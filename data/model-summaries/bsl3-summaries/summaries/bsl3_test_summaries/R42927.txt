the united states' method for taxing american based companies gives rise to two principal issues in the international tax debate .
the u.s. will generally defer levying a tax on this income until it is brought back ( repatriated ) to the united states , although the countries where american companies operate may tax this income at the time it is earned .
first , american companies can use tax deferral and other techniques to avoid or delay taxes by moving profits out of high - tax countries ( or out of the u.s. ) and into low - tax countries with little corresponding change in business operations , a practice known as "profit shifting. .
american based companies reported earning $938 billion in profits overseas in 2008 ( most recent data ) .
for example , the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations held a hearing in september 2012 on the methods companies use to shift profits and possible options for curbing such behavior .
second , the ability to defer taxes on income earned abroad allows american companies to reinvest earnings in foreign markets and expand business operations alongside foreign counterparts .
for example , economist kimberly clausing has estimated that profit shifting by american companies cost the government between $57 billion and $90 billion in lost revenue in 2008 .
