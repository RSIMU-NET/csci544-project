the consideration of a measure in the committee of the whole and in the house can be divided into five stages: ( 1 ) the house resolves itself into the committee of the whole ; ( 2 ) members engage in general debate on the measure ; ( 3 ) members offer , consider , and vote on amendments to the measure ; ( 4 ) the committee of the whole rises and reports back to the house with a recommendation ; and ( 5 ) the house votes on the recommendation and then on the measure itself .
an important parliamentary device designed to allow greater participation in debate is the committee of the whole ( formally , the committee of the whole house on the state of the union ) .
members of the house of representatives have multiple opportunities to participate in the consideration of measures on the floor .
the house considers most major measures in the committee of the whole ; in fact , house rules require revenue , appropriations , and authorization measures to be first considered in the committee of the whole ( house rule xviii , clause 3 ) .
they can discuss legislation , propose changes to the pending text , and suggest actions that may facilitate deliberation or expedite decision making .
