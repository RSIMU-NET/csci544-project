my statement will ( 1 ) update usps's financial condition and outlook and explain our recent decision to place usps's financial condition on our high - risk list , and ( 2 ) discuss the need for usps to restructure its mail processing , retail , and delivery networks and its efforts to improve their efficiency .
postal service ( usps ) operations .
under this scenario , usps would increase its outstanding debt by an additional $3 billion , which would bring its total debt to $13.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2010 â€” only $1.8 billion less than its $15 billion statutory limit .
as a result , usps is projecting the following for fiscal year 2009: a net loss of about $7 billion , even if it achieves record cost savings of about $6 billion ; an increase in outstanding debt by the annual statutory limit of $3 billion ; and , despite this borrowing , an unprecedented $1 billion cash shortfall .
my statement is based upon on our past and ongoing work , including the report being released today on usps efforts to improve delivery efficiency , and our report adding usps to the high - risk list , as well as our continued monitoring of usps's financial condition and outlook .
