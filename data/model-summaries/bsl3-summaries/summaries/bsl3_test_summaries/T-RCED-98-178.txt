in july 1997 , we reported on operational and safety trends in the rail industry over the past 20 years and how the federal railroad administration ( fra ) has revised its rail safety program to address these trends .
the increased concentration of larger railroads , as well as the service problems occurring in the western half of the united states , have heightened concern about the safety of freight railroads .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on rail safety as the subcommittee considers legislation to reauthorize rail safety programs .
currently , there are 10 class i railroads — the nation's largest railroads — amtrak and 9 freight railroads .
rather than continuing to use violations and civil penalties as the primary means to obtain compliance with railroad safety regulations , fra decided to emphasize cooperative partnerships with other federal agencies , railroad management , labor unions , and the states .
while 1996 and preliminary 1997 data , the latest data available , show improvements in safety , it is too early to determine if fra's new approach will sustain a long - term decline in accidents and fatalities .
in summary , we found the following: the railroad industry has changed significantly since the staggers rail act of 1980 made it federal policy that railroads would rely , where possible , on competition and the demand for services rather than on regulation to establish reasonable rates .
