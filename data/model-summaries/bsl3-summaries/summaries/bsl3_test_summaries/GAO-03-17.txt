significant funding increases are also planned , which would bring the fiscal year 2003 munitions budget to over $10 billion .
accordingly , this review was undertaken , pursuant to gao's legislative authority , to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) improvements have been made to the department of defense's munitions requirements determination process and ( 2 ) the process is being used to guide current munitions acquisitions .
in september and october of 2001 , congress provided emergency funding of $1.3 billion for munitions , with a supplemental increase in the fiscal year 2002 munitions budget of $397 million .
the department of defense planned to spend about $7.9 billion on acquiring munitions in fiscal year 2002 .
the department expected that its efforts to improve the munitions requirements process should correct over - or understated requirements and provide the combatant commands with needed munitions .
since 1994 , the department of defense inspector general and gao have issued numerous reports identifying weaknesses and expressing concerns about the accuracy of the process used by the department to determine munitions requirements .
ongoing military operations associated with the global war on terrorism have heightened concerns about the unified combatant commands having sufficient quantities of munitions .
