the primary responsibility of the lsc is to manage and oversee the congressionally appropriated federal funds that it distributes in the form of grants to local legal services providers , which in turn give legal assistance to low - income clients in all 50 states , the district of columbia , the u.s. territories of american samoa , guam , and the virgin islands , the commonwealth of puerto rico , and micronesia ( including the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands , the republic of the marshall islands , and palau ) .
the legal services corporation ( lsc ) is a private , nonprofit , federally funded corporation that helps provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( i.e. , non - criminal ) matters .
debate existed from the start among policymakers as to whether the lsc's role should be similar to that of its predecessor , namely , using lawsuits and other means to resolve broad underlying difficulties of the poor , or whether the focus should be more narrowly defined to addressing small , specific situations .
since its inception , the legal services program has been controversial , and congress has imposed restrictions on activities of lsc - funded legal services programs .
