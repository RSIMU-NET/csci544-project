 ( recommendation 6 ) .
this review addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which fema and the red cross effectively coordinated mass care in response to the 2017 hurricanes , and ( 2 ) the extent to which fema supported and used state and local assessments of mass care capabilities for the 2017 hurricanes .
 ( recommendation 3 ) to ensure more accurate mass care capability assessments , fema should require grantees to solicit capabilities information from key mass care service - delivery providers in making capability estimates and identify these providers in their submissions .
 ( recommendation 4 ) to build the emergency preparedness capabilities of grantees , fema should develop systematic , documented protocols to determine the conditions under which it will follow up and provide feedback to grantees about mass care capability assessments .
hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria — which all made landfall within a 4-week time period — caused a combined $265 billion in damage , and each ranks among the five costliest hurricanes on record , according to the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) .
 ( recommendation 5 ) we are also making the following recommendation to the american red cross: to ensure assistance reaches all survivors , red cross should develop mechanisms for it and its partners to leverage local community groups , such as conducting regular outreach to communicate and regularly share aggregate information with these groups .
