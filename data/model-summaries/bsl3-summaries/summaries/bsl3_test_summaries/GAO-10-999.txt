in the over 18 months since the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) was enacted in february 2009 , the department of the treasury has paid out approximately $154.8 billion in recovery act funds for use in states and localities .
in this report , the seventh in a series in response to the act's mandate , we update and add new information on the following: ( 1 ) selected states' and localities' uses of recovery act funds , ( 2 ) the approaches taken by the selected states and localities to ensure accountability for recovery act funds , and ( 3 ) states' plans to evaluate the impact of the recovery act funds they receive .
these funds have been used to support and preserve services in a wide range of areas including health , education , transportation , and housing .
specifically , the stated purposes of the recovery act are to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery ; assist those most impacted by the recession ; provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health ; invest in transportation , environmental protection , and other infrastructure that will provide long - term economic benefits ; and stabilize state and local government budgets in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases .
