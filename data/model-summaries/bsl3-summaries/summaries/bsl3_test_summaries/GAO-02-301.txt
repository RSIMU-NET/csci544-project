accordingly , we are recommending that the tva chairman ( 1 ) evaluate the structure and effectiveness of its current programs ; ( 2 ) review the longer - term potential applicability of other programs to its power system ; and ( 3 ) , as appropriate , implement demand - side management practices .
the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) operates the nation's largest public power system , supplying electricity to about 8 million customers across a 7-state region .
these plants account for almost all of tva's emissions of two key air pollutants â€” sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , which has been linked to reduced visibility , and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , which contribute to the formation of harmful ozone .
tva relied on its 11 coal - burning plants to supply about 60 percent of its electric power in fiscal year 2001 .
concerned about tva's dual challenge of reducing emissions while managing increased demand on its power system , you asked us to: ( 1 ) determine how tva plans to meet future demands for electricity through 2005 while minimizing its emissions of so2 and nox ; ( 2 ) describe the scope and impact of tva's demand - side management efforts ; and ( 3 ) compare the scope and impact of tva's demand - side management efforts to those of selected other utilities' efforts .
