section 212 ( f ) of the ina is arguably the broadest and best known of these provisions , but sections 214 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 215 ( a ) ( 1 ) can also be seen to authorize the executive to restrict aliens' entry or admission to the united states .
t he immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides that individual aliens outside the united states are "inadmissible" — or generally barred from admission to the country — on health , criminal , security , and other grounds set forth in the ina .
however , the ina also grants the executive several broad authorities that could be used to exclude certain individual aliens or classes of aliens for reasons that are not specifically set forth in the ina .
the provisions currently in section 212 ( f ) — which have been part of the ina since its enactment in 1952 — state , in relevant part , that whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states , he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate .
