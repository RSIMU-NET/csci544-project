the federal employees' compensation act ( feca ) program provides workers' compensation coverage to approximately 2.8 million federal and postal employees for work - related injuries and illnesses .
in fiscal year 2012 , the feca program made more than $2.1 billion in wage - loss compensation payments to claimants .
benefits include wage - loss benefits , medical benefits , vocational - rehabilitation benefits , and survivors' benefits .
to answer this objective , we determined whether individuals potentially received improper payments , potentially committed fraud , or received overlapping payments by comparing feca data to quarterly wage ( qw ) and unemployment insurance ( ui ) data from selected states .
labor's office of workers' compensation programs ( owcp ) estimated that future actuarial liabilities for government - wide feca compensation payments to those receiving benefits as of fiscal year 2012 would total over $34 billion ( this amount does not include any costs for workers added to the feca rolls in future years ) ; the u.s .
we recommend that the secretary of labor assess the feasibility of developing a cost - effective mechanism to share feca compensation information with states , such as reporting information to ndnh , to help identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving overlapping ui and feca payments .
