this report addresses ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to review records that are maintained in its databases to identify potential overstays , ( 2 ) the extent to which dhs's changes in its systems or processes have improved data on potential overstays and dhs's ability to report overstay rates , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dhs has made progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system .
to provide reasonable assurance of when dhs will be able provide an assessment of the benefits and costs of biometric air exit options to congress , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security establish time frames and milestones for developing and implementing an evaluation framework to be used in conducting the department's assessment of biometric air exit options .
