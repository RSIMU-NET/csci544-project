under the new national military strategy , the department of defense ( dod ) must be capable of rapidly deploying armed forces to respond to contingency and humanitarian operations around the world .
since dod is increasingly relying on the c - 5 aircraft as its primary airlifter , we assessed the reliability and mission capability of the aircraft and dod's current plan for modifying the c - 5 .
the air force's air mobility command ( amc ) has 104 c - 5 , 199 c - 141 , and 16 c - 17 strategic airlift aircraft in its fleet .
military strategic airlift aircraft provide the capability to fly the critical , early arriving troops and cargo for overseas deployments .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the air force to ( 1 ) conduct a readiness evaluation to determine how c - 5 peacetime mission capability can be improved and the costs of such improvements and ( 2 ) assess the impact of proposed aircraft modifications on c - 5 mission capability and then reprioritize the proposals according to the results of the assessment .
dod has not been providing adequate funding to meet the original schedule for proposed c - 5 improvements .
