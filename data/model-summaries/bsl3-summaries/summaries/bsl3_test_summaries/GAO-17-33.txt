this report describes ( 1 ) what is known about the extent of elder abuse by guardians ; and ( 2 ) what measures federal agencies and selected state and local guardianship programs have taken to help protect older adults with guardians from abuse .
we also conducted interviews with various guardianship stakeholders including the following: federal agencies including the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , bureau of consumer financial protection ( cfpb ) , and department of justice to discuss efforts to support to state guardianship programs .
because of your concern about the financial exploitation and other abuses of older adults , you asked us to review whether abusive practices by guardians are widespread .
the federal government does not regulate or directly support guardianship , but federal agencies may provide indirect support to state guardianship programs by providing funding for efforts to share best practices and facilitate improved coordination .
in 2014 , the u.s. census bureau estimated that there were over 46 million older adults — individuals aged 65 and over — in the united states .
while many guardians act in the best interest of persons under guardianship , some have been reported to engage in the abuse of older adults .
