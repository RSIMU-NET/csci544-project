one of the two major manufacturers of influenza vaccine for the united states warned in late august 2004 that deliveries would be delayed because a small quantity of its vaccine failed sterility tests .
as the traditional influenza vaccination period started in fall 2004 , the nation faced the unexpected loss of nearly half its projected vaccine supply .
before the october 5 announcement , hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and its advisory committee on immunization practices ( acip ) had recommended that those at high risk of severe complications from influenza and those in other priority groups — such as health care workers and those aged 50 – 64 years — receive an influenza vaccination .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) had expected that this manufacturer would produce about 47 million doses — close to half of the 100 million doses estimated for the 2004 – 05 influenza season .
on october 5 , 2004 , the manufacturer announced that because of potential contamination , it would be unable to release any vaccine for the u.s. market .
media reports of long lines of seniors waiting hours for a chance at a vaccination , of others at high risk who could not find a vaccination , and of individuals turned away who never returned when supplies became available fueled worries that the nation was not adequately prepared to respond to the significant vaccine shortage or to an influenza pandemic ( a widespread or worldwide influenza epidemic ) .
