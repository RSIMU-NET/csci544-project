mr. chairman and members of the committee: i appreciate the opportunity to testify on the internal revenue service's ( irs ) efforts to identify and deal with abusive tax schemes that primarily are used by individual taxpayers .
irs caught about $5 billion in improper tax avoidance or tax credit and refund claims , but estimated that another $20 billion to $40 billion had not been identified and addressed .
my statement today , based on work we have done at the committee's request , focuses on what is known about the extent of abusive tax schemes involving individual taxpayers , the status of irs's efforts to combat such schemes , and challenges irs faces in moving forward .
during hearings before this committee last april , several witnesses testified about the increased promotion and use of various types of abusive tax schemes and scams , including constitutional trusts , offshore trusts , and tax credits for slave descendants .
in part because no one individual or office could provide an agencywide perspective on irs's strategy , goals , objectives , performance measures , or program results , it is difficult to provide a clear picture of all that is underway and being accomplished in irs's efforts to address abusive tax schemes .
