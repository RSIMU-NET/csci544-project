congress might consider reforms to the nation's immigration system , and , thus , the detention of noncitizens ( aliens ) in the united states may be an issue .
congressional interest in the policy of detaining noncitizens in the united states while determining whether noncitizens should be removed from the united states tends to be varied .
for example , while some want to increase the categories of aliens who are detained and increase the amount of detention space , others want to create alternatives to detention and exempt asylum seekers from mandatory detention .
the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination of whether they should be removed from the united states and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention ( i.e. , the aliens must be detained ) by dhs .
for example , as the department of homeland security ( dhs ) expands programs to locate removable aliens from jails throughout the country , dhs may need additional detention beds in areas of the united states where traditionally there has not been a need for detention space .
the report also presents general policy issues surrounding detention of aliens , including concerns about the number of aliens subject to mandatory detention ; the justness of mandatory detention , especially as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation ; and the proper limits on the length of time in detention for aliens who have been ordered removed but cannot be returned to their home country .
