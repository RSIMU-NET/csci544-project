the small business innovation development act of 1982 , which authorized the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program , emphasizes the benefits of technological innovation and the ability of small businesses to transform the results of research and development ( r&d ) into new products .
the five largest , accounting for over 90 percent of all sbir awards , include the department of defense ( dod ) ; the department of energy ( doe ) ; the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and its national institutes of health ( nih ) , in particular ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and the national science foundation ( nsf ) .
it focuses on the quality of small businesses' research proposals for technological innovation , the implementation of a provision for technical assistance by agencies participating in the program , and duplicate funding of similar research by more than one agency .
the act designated four major goals for the program: stimulating technological innovation .
this requirement will effectively double the annual funding for the program to about $1 billion .
at the start of our review , the house committee on small business directed us to focus our work on sba as the main administrative agency for the program and on the five major funding agencies ( dod , hhs , nasa , nsf , and doe ) that accounted for more than 90 percent of the total expenditures for sbir projects .
