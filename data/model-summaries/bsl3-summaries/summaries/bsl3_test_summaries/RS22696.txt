an antitrust suit ( originally a class action ) was filed by a group of ipo purchasers against the underwriters of those issues ( 10 major investment banks ) alleging conspiracy , price fixing - related , and tying violations of ยง 1 of the sherman act .
the particular , allegedly harmful practices included ( 1 ) required investor promises to place bids in the aftermarket at prices above the initial public offering price , referred to as "laddering" ; ( 2 ) required investor commitments to purchase other , less attractive securities , a kind of tying arrangement ; and ( 3 ) investor payment of excessive commissions .
given ( 1 ) congress's expressed concern that securities markets become and remain stable , ( 2 ) the continued oversight and actions of a single expert regulatory agency versus the probability of diverse and possibly conflicting decisions by nonexpert judges in the event of securities / antitrust lawsuits , and ( 3 ) the likelihood of conflict between the mandates of antitrust law and allowable activities under the securities laws , the court found that "the securities laws are 'clearly incompatible' with the application of the antitrust laws. .
