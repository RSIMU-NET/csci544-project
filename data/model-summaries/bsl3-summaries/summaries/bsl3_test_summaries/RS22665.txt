by a vote of 5-4 , the court held that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) in 2003 had improperly denied a petition asking the agency to regulate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new motor vehicles under the clean air act ( caa ) .
i n 2007 , the supreme court issued its decision in massachusetts v. epa , its first pronouncement on climate change and still one of the most important environmental law decisions in the past decade .
the supreme court decision did not compel epa to regulate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new motor vehicles , but it did limit the range of options available to the agency so that doing so was its most defensible course of action .
in that year , 19 environmental and energy organizations petitioned epa to regulate emissions of ghgs ( carbon dioxide [co 2 ] , methane , nitrous oxide , and hydrofluorocarbons ) from new motor vehicles .
