this report responds to your request and provides our ( 1 ) assessment of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to manage the fund's cash and ( 2 ) recommendations to dod which , if properly implemented , will provide additional management oversight of the fund's cash operations .
one area of continuing concern has been dod's management of the fund's cash .
in the committee's report on the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization , you raised concerns about the management of the defense business operations fund's cash and directed that we review the fund's cash management practices .
currently , dod's policy requires the fund to maintain cash levels to cover 7 to 10 days of operational costs ( $1.5 billion to $2.1 billion ) and 4 to 6 months of capital asset disbursements ( $.5 to $.9 billion ) .
dod's fiscal year 1995 federal managers' financial integrity act ( fmfia ) report highlighted a number of serious weaknesses in dod's financial management operations and systems .
since april 1991 , we have reported and testified on the challenges and problems confronting dod in the management of the fund .
