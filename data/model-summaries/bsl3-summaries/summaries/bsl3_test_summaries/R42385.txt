in accordance with united states law , the u.s. government places conditions on the use of defense articles and defense services transferred by it to foreign recipients .
the arms export control act ( aeca ) , as amended , authorizes the transfer by sale or lease of united states origin defense articles and services through the government - to - government foreign military sales ( fms ) program or through the licensed commercial sales process .
violation of these conditions can lead to the suspension of deliveries or termination of the contracts for such defense items , among other things .
section 3 ( c ) of the arms export control act further sets out the circumstances under which a nation may lose ( a ) its u.s. foreign military financing , ( b ) its loan guarantees for purchases of u.s. defense articles and services , ( c ) its rights to have previously purchased u.s. defense articles or services delivered , ( d ) its rights to have previously made agreements for the sale of u.s. defense articles or services carried out .
however , since the major revision of u.s. arms export law in 1976 , neither the president nor the congress have actually determined that a "substantial violation" did occur thus necessitating the termination of deliveries or sales or other penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act .
