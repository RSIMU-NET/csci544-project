the supreme court has twice struck down attempted global asbestos settlements , in both instances inviting congress to craft a legislative solution .
claims of asbestos - related injury have flooded the courts since the 1970s , but litigation has proven to be an inadequate means to resolving all the claims .
the bill was reported out of the senate judiciary committee on june 16 ( s.rept .
the office would be headed by an administrator , who would be appointed by the president — with the advice and consent of the senate — to a five - year term and report directly to the assistant secretary of labor for the employment standards administration .
the comparable time period for all other asbestos claims ( with the exception of the least serious claims ) would be two years .
the bill would establish within the department of labor the office of asbestos disease compensation , which would award damages to claimants on a no - fault basis according to their respective levels of injury and asbestos exposure .
