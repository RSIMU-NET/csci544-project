however , despite some improvements in the federal government's management of its personnel in recent years , strategic human capital management — and more specifically , the need for the office of personnel management ( opm ) and agencies to address skills gaps in mission critical occupations — continues to be a gao high risk area .
for example , of the 34 areas on our 2017 high - risk list ( excluding strategic human capital management ) , skills gaps played a role in making 15 areas high - risk , and included information technology management , and acquisitions , and veterans' health care , among others .
our work has shown that a careful consideration of federal pay is essential to fiscal stewardship and is necessary to support the recruitment and retention of a talented , agile , and high - performing federal workforce .
it is congress's policy that pay for federal workers in the general schedule ( gs ) , the pay system covering the majority of federal workers , be in line with pay for comparable nonfederal workers .
in my remarks today , i will discuss ( 1 ) lessons learned in creating a more market - driven , results - oriented approach to federal pay , and ( 2 ) opportunities in addition to pay and benefits that opm and agencies could use to be more competitive in the labor market and address skills gaps .
