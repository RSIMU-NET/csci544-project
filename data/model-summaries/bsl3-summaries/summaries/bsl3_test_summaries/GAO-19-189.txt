the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) is one of the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) most complex projects and top priorities .
for this report , we assessed ( 1 ) the considerations that nasa took into account when updating the jwst project's cost and schedule commitments , ( 2 ) the technical and integration challenges , if any , that are affecting the execution of the jwst project , and ( 3 ) the extent to which nasa has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of the jwst project .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
in june 2018 , nasa approved new cost and schedule commitments for jwst with a cost of $9.7 billion and a launch readiness date of march 2021 .
112-284 included a provision for gao to assess the jwst program annually and to report to the committees on appropriations on key issues relating to program and risk management , achievement of cost and schedule goals , program technical status , and oversight mechanisms .
between now and its system integration review planned for august 2019 , the jwst program will have to continue to address technical challenges and mitigate risks .
