to address these issues , dhs initiated hrit in 2003 to consolidate , integrate , and modernize the department's information technology ( it ) infrastructure that supports human resources .
specifically , my remarks today summarize key findings from that study , which ( 1 ) evaluated the progress dhs has made in implementing the hrit investment and how effectively dhs managed the investment , ( 2 ) determined whether the performance and learning management system ( palms ) — hrit's only ongoing program — is being implemented enterprise - wide , and ( 3 ) evaluated the extent to which palms is implementing selected it acquisition best practices .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement the human resources information technology ( hrit ) investment .
since dhs was created in 2002 and merged 22 agencies into one department with eight components , its human resources environment has included fragmented systems , duplicative and paper - based processes , and little uniformity of data management practices .
key causes for dhs's lack of progress in implementing hrit and its associated strategic improvement opportunities include unplanned resource changes and the lack of involvement of the hrit executive steering committee .
