from 1987 through 2003 , the united states provided more than $2 billion in economic assistance to the federated states of micronesia ( fsm ) and the rmi under a compact of free association ; approximately $579 million of this economic assistance went to the rmi .
the compact provided a framework for the united states to work toward achieving its three main goals: ( 1 ) to secure self - government for the fsm and the rmi , ( 2 ) to ensure certain national security rights for all of the parties , and ( 3 ) to assist the fsm and the rmi in their efforts to advance economic development and self - sufficiency .
the amended compact with the rmi identifies the additional 20 years of grant assistance as intended to assist the rmi government in its efforts to promote the economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance of its people .
in 2003 , the u.s. government approved an amended compact with the rmi that provides an additional 20 years of assistance , totaling about $1.5 billion from 2004 through 2023 .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss gao's recent work regarding the compact of free association between the united states and the republic of the marshall islands ( rmi ) .
