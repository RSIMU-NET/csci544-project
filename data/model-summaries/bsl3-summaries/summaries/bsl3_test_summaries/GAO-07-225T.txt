in particular , my testimony highlights three key areas: ( 1 ) the actions that dhs and its component agencies have taken to assess the risks posed by terrorism to the u.s. passenger rail system ; ( 2 ) the actions that tsa and other federal agencies have taken to enhance the security of the u.s. passenger rail system ; and ( 3 ) the security practices that domestic and selected foreign passenger rail operators have implemented to mitigate risks and enhance security .
regarding passenger rail security , key department of homeland security ( dhs ) stakeholders with critical roles include the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , which is responsible for securing all modes of transportation , and the office for grants and training ( ogt ) , which provides grant funds to rail operators and conducts risk assessments for passenger rail agencies .
within the department of transportation ( dot ) , the federal transit administration ( fta ) and federal railroad administration ( fra ) have responsibilities for passenger and freight rail safety and security .
since september 11 , 2001 , tsa has focused much of its efforts and resources on meeting legislative mandates to strengthen commercial aviation security .
