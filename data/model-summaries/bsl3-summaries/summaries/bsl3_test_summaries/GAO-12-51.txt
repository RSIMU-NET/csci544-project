in 2010 , the federal government spent about $114 billion on the medicare advantage ( ma ) program , a private plan alternative to the original medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) program that covers about a quarter of all medicare beneficiaries .
such steps could include , for example , accounting for additional beneficiary characteristics , including the most current data available , identifying and accounting for all years of coding differences that could affect the payment year for which an adjustment is made , and incorporating the trend of the impact of coding differences on risk scores .
to help ensure appropriate payments to ma plans , the administrator of cms should take steps to improve the accuracy of the adjustment made for differences in diagnostic coding practices between ma and medicare ffs .
if cms does not update its methodology , excess payments due to differences in coding practices are likely to increase .
information on a beneficiary's age , sex , medicaid enrollment status , original reason for medicare entitlement ( i.e. , age or disability ) , and major medical conditions all factor into the calculation of the risk score .
