however , if clinicians want to bill medicare for these services , the service must meet medicare's statutory requirements for payment .
in this report we 1. describe the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are used by medicare and other federal programs to provide health care services ; 2. assess the extent to which cms oversees telehealth payments in medicare ; 3. describe the factors associations representing providers and patients rated — and payers cited — as affecting the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare ; and 4. describe how emerging payment and delivery models could affect the potential use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare .
to describe the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are used by medicare and other federal programs , we reviewed available data , statutes , regulations , and other relevant documentation related to telehealth in medicare , medicaid , the department of defense ( dod ) , and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) .
while medicare currently uses telehealth primarily in rural areas or regions designated as having a shortage of health professionals , in the future emerging payment and delivery models may change the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are available and used by medicare beneficiaries and providers in other areas .
