continuing appropriations acts , commonly known as continuing resolutions ( crs ) , have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades .
if interim or full - year appropriations are not enacted , a funding gap and government shutdown occur for affected agencies and programs .
when congress and the president do not reach final decisions about one or more regular appropriations acts , they often negotiate and enact a cr .
first , the report discusses how an interim cr's provisions and requirements may impact directly upon an agency , based on what an interim cr explicitly is formulated to do .
an "interim" cr provides agencies with stopgap funding for a period of time until final appropriations decisions are made , or until enactment of another interim cr .
a "full - year" cr , by contrast , provides final funding amounts for the remainder of a fiscal year in lieu of one or more regular appropriations acts .
given the nature of budget deliberations and the potential for changes in the budget process to change power relationships among participants , the ways in which the impact of an interim cr may be framed might be viewed as similarly significant .
