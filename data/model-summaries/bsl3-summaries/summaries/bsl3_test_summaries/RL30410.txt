almost four decades after the supreme court ruling in regents of the university of california v. bakke , the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy .
in striking down the admissions process at the university of texas school of law , the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit in hopwood v. texas concluded that any use of race in the admissions process was forbidden by the constitution .
many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination , but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty .
in subsequent years , however , federal courts began to question the powell rationale , unsettling expectations about whether diversity - based affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring decisions is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment .
smith v. university of washington was the first federal appeals court to rely on justice powell's decision as binding precedent on the issue .
justice powell , in his opinion for the bakke court , stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is "a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education," noting that "[t]he atmosphere of 'speculation , experiment , and creation' so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body. .
