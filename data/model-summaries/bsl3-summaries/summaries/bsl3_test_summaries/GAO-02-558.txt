specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) irs's overall approach to ensure that innocent spouse cases were being processed in a timely , accurate , and consistent manner ; ( 2 ) the adequacy of irs's procedures to transfer tax liabilities between taxpayers when relief was granted to one of the taxpayers ; and ( 3 ) irs's efforts to evaluate the usefulness of its innocent spouse program web site to taxpayers .
since passage of the irs restructuring and reform act ( restructuring act ) of 1998 , irs has received thousands of requests from taxpayers for innocent spouse relief .
under the internal revenue service's ( irs ) innocent spouse program , irs can relieve taxpayers of tax debts on the basis of equity considerations , such as not knowing that their spouse failed to pay taxes due .
irs's inability to provide timely responses to such requests has generated concerns among taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders .
by law , married persons who file joint tax returns are each fully responsible for the accuracy of the tax return and for the full tax liability .
because of your concerns about irs's growing inventory of unresolved innocent spouse cases and the timeliness of irs's case processing , you asked us to review irs's administration of the program .
