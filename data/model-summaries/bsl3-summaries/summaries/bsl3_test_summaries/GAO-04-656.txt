specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the status of ssa's process unification initiative , ( 2 ) ssa's assessments of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels , and ( 3 ) whether ssa's new proposal incorporates changes to improve consistency in decisions between adjudication levels .
the social security administration ( ssa ) is the nation's largest provider of income assistance to individuals with disabilities , paying $91 billion in federal benefits to 11.4 million beneficiaries with a disability and their families in 2003 .
however , ssa continues to face challenges in its efforts to provide consistent disability decisions .
state agencies called disability determination services ( dds ) decide whether claimants meet ssa's definition of disability by applying ssa's decision - making criteria .
these challenges , and others associated with modernizing its disability programs , contributed to our decision to include federal disability programs on our list of high - risk government programs .
each year , about 2.5 million people file claims with ssa for disability benefits .
partly on the basis of early studies of potential causes of inconsistent decisions , ssa included in its process unification initiative efforts to provide consistent guidance to all adjudicators , clarify policy , provide training , test potential process changes , and perform a new quality review of allowances decided by aljs .
