barring major changes by congress in the form of increased appropriations from the fund or a redirection of its receipts , the fund's balance is expected to continue to increase .
the reclamation fund was established in 1902 as a special fund within the united states treasury to aid the development of irrigation on the arid lands of western states .
it originated as a revolving fund supported by the proceeds of the sale of land and water in the western united states .
this report provides general background information on the reclamation fund , including a short history of the fund and trends in its deposits and appropriations .
as of the end of fy2011 , the fund had a balance in excess of $9.6 billion .
for instance , congress could increase appropriations from the reclamation fund in annual discretionary appropriations , but such an increase would have to compete with other appropriations ( including general fund appropriations ) subject to congressional 302 ( b ) allocations .
over time it , has been amended to receive proceeds from a number of disparate sources , including power generation and mineral leasing .
more recently , a bill in the senate in the 113 th congress , the authorized rural water projects completion act ( s. 715 ) , proposes to establish a new fund for rural water projects ( similar to the water settlements fund referenced above ) that would receive , without further appropriation , approximately $80 million per year in funding that would otherwise revert to the reclamation fund .
