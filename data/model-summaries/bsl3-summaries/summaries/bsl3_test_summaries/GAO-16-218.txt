this report assesses ( 1 ) the department of energy's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration's ( nnsa ) management approach for the b61-12 life extension program ( lep ) and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa and the air force are managing risks in the lep .
to maintain the readiness of the b61 and other weapons in the stockpile , the department of energy's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) and dod undertake life extension programs ( lep ) that entail refurbishing or replacing weapons' components to extend the lives of weapons by 20 years or more .
many weapons in the u.s. nuclear stockpile have aged far beyond their designed operational lives and , according to the department of defense ( dod ) , require modernization to ensure that the nuclear arsenal is safe , secure , and effective for as long as such weapons exist .
some of the oldest of the weapons in the active stockpile are versions of the b61 bomb , an aircraft - delivered weapon that is a key component of the united states' commitments to the north atlantic treaty organization's ( nato ) nuclear deterrent .
