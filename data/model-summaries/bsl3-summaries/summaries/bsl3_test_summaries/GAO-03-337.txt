future demographic trends include a doubling of the nation's retiree population and only modest labor force growth , leading to concerns about retirement income adequacy for future generations .
experts consulted by gao cited priorities for improving retirement data that fit into two broad categories: ( 1 ) obtaining better data from employers on employee benefits and ( 2 ) obtaining better data by linking more individual and household surveys with administrative data ( such as employer records , and social security earnings history records ) .
credible projections of the effects of policy proposals on federal spending and future retirees' income are necessary .
because adequate data is critical to the analysis of retirement income and wealth , gao was asked to identify data improvements that experts say are a priority for the study of retirement income and wealth , as well as factors limiting efforts to obtain the needed information .
the plan should include cost - effective strategies to make better use of existing statistics by linking survey and administrative data , improve access to linked data consistent with privacy and confidentiality legislation , and improve data collected from employers related to retirement income and wealth .
