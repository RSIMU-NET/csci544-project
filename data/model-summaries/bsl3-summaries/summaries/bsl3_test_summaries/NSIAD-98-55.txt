over the past few years , the department of defense ( dod ) has been interested in modernizing its forces with new weapons and equipment .
for a variety of reasons , these efforts have been stymied , and funds that dod expected to have available to modernize the force have been needed instead for current operational activities .
we have been assessing various air force activities to determine the feasibility of reducing operating costs .
in making this assessment , we ( 1 ) evaluated the effect that reorganization may have on mission accomplishment , ( 2 ) determined whether costs could be reduced through redistributing aircraft among fewer wings , and ( 3 ) developed five possible options for redistributing c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft among fewer wings at lower operating costs .
in may 1996 , we reported that the air force's fighter force was not organized economically and recommended that the air force develop an implementation plan for operating its fighter force in larger , more cost - effective squadrons .
a few years ago , we evaluated whether the air force could operate its fighter forces more cost - effectively .
