we identified weaknesses in four key areas: ( 1 ) field inspections , ( 2 ) data mining processes that exclude many large farming operations when farmers do not report their interest in them , ( 3 ) quality assurance reviews conducted by insurance companies , and ( 4 ) imposition of sanctions .
my testimony today focuses on two primary issues discussed in the september 2005 report: ( 1 ) the effectiveness of usda's procedures and processes to prevent and detect fraud , waste , and abuse in selling and servicing crop insurance policies , and ( 2 ) the extent to which program design issues may make the program more vulnerable to fraud , waste , and abuse .
in part , to improve the integrity of the crop insurance program , congress enacted the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 ( known as arpa ) .
in 2005 , the crop insurance program provided $44 billion in insurance coverage for over 200 million acres of farmland at a cost of $2.7 billion to the federal government , including $117 million estimated by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) risk management agency ( rma ) to have resulted from fraud , waste , and abuse .
