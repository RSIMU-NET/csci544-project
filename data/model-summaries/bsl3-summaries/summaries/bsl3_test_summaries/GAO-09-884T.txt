as of october 2008 , there were more than 1.8 million women veterans in the united states ( representing approximately 7.7 percent of the total veteran population ) , and more than 102,000 of these women were veterans of the military operations in afghanistan and iraq , known as operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) .
i am pleased to be here today as the committee considers issues related to the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) delivery of health care services to women veterans .
historically , the vast majority of va patients have been men , but that is changing .
according to va data , in fiscal year 2008 , over 281,000 women veterans received health care services from va — an increase of about 12 percent since 2006 .
women veterans seeking care at va medical facilities need access to a full range of physical health care services , including basic gender - specific services — such as breast examinations , cervical cancer screening , and menopause management — and specialized gender - specific services such as obstetric care ( which includes prenatal , labor and delivery , and postpartum care ) and treatment of reproductive cancers .
