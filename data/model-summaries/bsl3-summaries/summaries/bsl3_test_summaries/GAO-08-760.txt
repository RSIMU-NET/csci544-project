the part d program , which began in january 2006 , is administered by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) .
to protect beneficiaries and the fiscal integrity of the medicare program , the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) , which established the part d program , requires all part d sponsors to have programs to safeguard part d from fraud , waste , and abuse .
all part d sponsors had the required elements and recommended measures for written policies , procedures , and standards of conduct ( element 1 ) ; effective lines of communication ( element 4 ) ; and enforcement of standards through disciplinary guidelines ( element 5 ) .
while medicare part d is now in its third year of operation , little is known about the extent to which part d sponsors have implemented their fraud and abuse programs or the extent of cms's oversight of part d sponsors' programs .
medicare part d provides voluntary , outpatient prescription drug coverage for eligible individuals 65 years and older and eligible individuals with disabilities .
