this report examines ( 1 ) what available data indicate about pregnant women detained or held in dhs facilities ; ( 2 ) policies and standards that dhs has to address the care of pregnant women , and the extent to which they are applicable across all facilities ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the care provided to pregnant women in dhs facilities .
the health and safety of pregnant women in the custody of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) have been a concern in recent years for a number of policymakers , medical associations , and advocacy groups .
in addition , some members of congress have introduced bills to , in part , limit the use of restraints on pregnant women , set healthcare standards , and require the use of alternatives to detention for pregnant women .
specifically , this includes information on our analyses of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) data and inspection findings and department of homeland security ( dhs ) complaints used to address these questions: 1 .
to address all three objectives , we interviewed dhs officials from ice and u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) in headquarters and four field locations , pregnant detainees , and non - governmental organizations ( ngo ) to obtain their perspectives on the care of pregnant women in dhs custody .
