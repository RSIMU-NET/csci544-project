mda has been charged with developing and fielding the ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) , a system expected to be capable of defending the united states , deployed troops , friends , and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight .
in march 2009 , we plan to issue our report covering mda's progress toward achieving its goals during fiscal year 2008 as well as its efforts to improve transparency , accountability , and oversight .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the future of the missile defense agency's ( mda's ) testing program .
the national defense authorization acts for fiscal years 2002 , 2007 and 2008 mandated that we prepare annual assessments of mda's ongoing cost , schedule , testing , and performance progress .
in fulfilling this charge , mda placed an initial set of missile defense components in the field in december 2005 .
additionally , in september 2008 , we issued a report on mda's target program .
the missile defense agency's mission is to develop an integrated and layered bmds to defend the united states , its deployed forces , allies , and friends .
