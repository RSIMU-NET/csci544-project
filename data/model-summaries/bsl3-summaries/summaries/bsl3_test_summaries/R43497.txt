for these reasons , congress , through the clean air act ( caa ) has required emission standards for new automobiles since 1965 , and has amended these requirements on several occasions .
the caa , as amended , requires the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to set national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for common pollutants from numerous and diverse sources , which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare .
further , over the last five decades , the scientific understanding of the effects of air pollutants has led to a tightening of air quality standards .
as with tier 2 , the tier 3 standards consider the vehicle and its fuel as an integrated system and include changes to both vehicle emission limits and fuel formulation rules , lowering the allowable sulfur content of gasoline .
the agency reports that in 2013 on - road vehicles accounted for about 34% of carbon monoxide emissions in the united states , 38% of nitrogen oxides , 12% of volatile organic compounds , and 3% of particulate matter .
since the 1960s , emission standards for motor vehicles , coupled with standards for the fuels they burn , have reduced emissions from new cars and trucks by at least 95% .
