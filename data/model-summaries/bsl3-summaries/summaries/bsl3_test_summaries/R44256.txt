however , a number of recent high - profile police shootings and other law enforcement - related deaths have reignited the debate about how much force police should wield in a democratic society that values both law and order and the personal liberty of each of its citizens under law .
to provide legal context for this debate , this report will address three overarching questions: ( 1 ) Â what are the constitutional rules governing an officer's use of force ; ( 2 ) what role has congress played in providing a remedy for a violation of these rules ; and ( 3 ) what are the potential reforms to these rules and remedies ? .
similarly , the house judiciary committee held a hearing on policing strategies on may 19 , 2015 , and various measures have been introduced in the 114 th congress to address both use of force tactics and data collection by state and local police departments .
police officers must stop and seize violent suspects , serve search warrants in hostile environments , and maintain the peace and safety of the communities in which they serve .
by the very nature of their job , law enforcement officers are tasked with using physical force to restrain individuals and protect themselves and others from harm .
