the republic of yemen remains a country of concern to u.s. policy makers .
although yemen itself is a resource - poor nation , it is strategically located next to saudi arabia ( figure 1 ) , one of the world's major oil producers , and the bab al mandab strait , through which commercial oil tankers carry an estimated 3.4 million barrels per day ( 3.5% to 4% of the global oil supply ) .
yemen's 1,184-mile coastline abuts the red sea and the gulf of aden across from the horn of africa , which until recently had been a major area of somalia - based piracy .
for more than a decade , u.s. officials and members of congress have been concerned with the threat of terrorism emanating from yemen and directed against the united states .
issues such as terrorism and yemen's political stability are tied to broader questions regarding the country's long - term economic and environmental viability .
however , in yemen no one group , including the central government , has a monopoly on armed force ; various actors can act as "spoilers" to disrupt the system in pursuit of their own interests ( figure 2 ) ; and that dynamic played out throughout 2014 .
