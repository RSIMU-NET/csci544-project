specifically , i will discuss dod's efforts to ( 1 ) develop a comprehensive , integrated , enterprisewide business transformation plan and its related leadership approach and ( 2 ) comply with legislation that addresses business systems modernization and improving financial management accountability .
it is a pleasure to be back before this subcommittee to discuss the progress and challenges associated with the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to transform its business operations .
dod's current approach is clearly superior to its prior approach ; however , a number of formidable challenges remain .
as a result , progress on the full range of dod's business transformation challenges has been inconsistent , focusing thus far on enterprisewide transformation , with many challenges remaining concerning the transformation of the various military services and defense agencies .
since the first financial statement audit of a major dod component was attempted almost 20 years ago , we have reported that weaknesses in business operations not only adversely affect the reliability of reported financial data , but also the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of dod's operations .
among these difficult choices will be decisions about the affordability and sustainability of the continued growth in defense spending .
