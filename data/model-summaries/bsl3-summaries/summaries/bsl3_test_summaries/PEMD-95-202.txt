because of this uncertainty , you asked us to provide you with information on ( 1 ) approaches that show promise in helping teenage mothers complete their secondary education as a step toward self - sufficiency and ( 2 ) aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program activities that enable teenage mothers on welfare to complete their secondary education .
as the congress and the administration consider how to reform the nation's welfare system and reduce the number of families that are dependent on welfare , concerns have focused on the increasing numbers of births to unmarried teenagers .
while low - income teenage mothers stand a better chance of avoiding long - term welfare dependency if they obtain a high school education , there is uncertainty about how to achieve this outcome .
this issue is of particular concern because families started by teenage mothers represent almost half the families receiving welfare and are likely to receive assistance for long periods of time , at great cost to the public .
all five programs also provided child care and transportation assistance ; otherwise , these programs were quite different .
to develop this information , we visited 13 local programs in new jersey , new mexico , oregon , texas , vermont , and wisconsin that were recognized by experts as being exemplary in helping disadvantaged teenage mothers complete their secondary education .
