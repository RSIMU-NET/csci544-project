my statement today focuses on initial observations from our ongoing review for this subcommittee and examines the status and management of ssa's efforts to ( 1 ) update its medical listings to reflect current medical knowledge and ( 2 ) develop its own occupational information system ( ois ) to reflect labor market changes .
in the last 20 years , ssa disability benefit payments to beneficiaries and their dependents have increased almost fivefold , from $35 billion in 1990 to over $164 billion in 2010 .
given the extensive size and cost of its disability programs , ssa must have current and appropriate criteria by which to assess whether an applicant's medical conditions affect his or her ability to perform work in the national economy .
in addition , the ois should ( 1 ) meet ssa's legal , program , and data requirements ; ( 2 ) be flexible enough to incorporate changes in ssa's policies and processes ; and ( 3 ) be able to be updated to reflect the evolving workplace environment .
gao has designated ssa's federal disability program as a high - risk area ; in 2008 , we reported that the agency's medical criteria did not fully reflect medical and technological advances , and the occupational criteria it used from the department of labor ( labor ) had not been updated since 1991 , despite the trend away from manual labor jobs and towards service - and knowledge - based jobs .
