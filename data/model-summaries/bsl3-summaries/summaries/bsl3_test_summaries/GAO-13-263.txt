we recommended that gsa should: ( 1 ) ensure that courthouses are within their authorized size or notify congressional committees ; and that the judiciary should: ( 2 ) retain caseload projections to improve the accuracy of its 10-year judge planning and ( 3 ) establish and use courtroom - sharing policies based on scheduling and use data .
since the early 1990's , the federal judiciary ( judiciary ) and the general services administration ( gsa ) have undertaken a multibillion - dollar federal courthouse construction program .
we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which the judiciary's capital - planning process aligns with leading practices and provides information needed for informed decision making and ( 2 ) the extent to which courthouse projects recommended for funding in fiscal years 2014 to 2018 were assessed under the judiciary's current capital - planning process .
our recommendations have not yet been implemented .
specifically , 33 federal courthouses completed from 2000 to 2010 included 3.56 million square feet of extra space that cost an estimated $835 million to construct and $51 million annually to operate and maintain .
in light of this program history and the federal government's current fiscal challenges , you asked us to review the judiciary's current plans for new courthouse construction .
