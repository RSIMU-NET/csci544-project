in this context , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the foundation's roles and responsibilities for raising funds to support the park service , ( 2 ) the amount and kinds of donations the foundation has raised between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the contributions obtained by the foundation assist the park service in addressing park priorities .
to improve its communication with the park service and improve management controls , we are making four recommendations to the national park foundation , namely that it take the following four steps: enter into an overall written agreement with the park service that includes its fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the foundation and the park service in their partnering relationship ; identify and document all current and future fund - raising agreements made with the park service , specifying the terms of work agreed to by each party ; develop a process , either through training or briefings , to help ensure complete and consistent understanding of its fund - raising strategy and roles and responsibilities with the park service headquarters , regional , and local park officials ; and in developing its fund - raising approach , consider the list of individual park priorities compiled and provided by the park service â€” this list could be used for identifying patterns of park needs for systemwide projects as well as for identifying specific needs that may be of interest to potential donors .
