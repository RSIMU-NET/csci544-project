incomplete or inaccurate real estate appraisals resulting in property overvaluations could expose the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) — which insured about 3.7 million single - family mortgage loans with a total value of about $425 billion in fiscal years 2001 to 2003 — to greater financial risks .
specifically , this report examines ( 1 ) how hud ensures that appraisers it approves to perform appraisals under its single - family mortgage insurance programs are qualified to be placed on the appraiser roster ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hud uses a risk - based approach when monitoring the appraisers participating in its single - family mortgage insurance programs ; and ( 3 ) hud's efforts to take enforcement actions against appraisers it identifies as not complying with its requirements .
to reduce the financial risks assumed by hud and to further enhance its oversight of appraisers participating in hud's single - family mortgage insurance programs , we recommend that the secretary of hud direct the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner to institute reasonable controls on the process of placing appraisers on the appraiser roster to ensure that applicants' conformance to eligibility criteria is verified ; consider a requirement to include , when targeting appraisers for review , those appraisers who have recently completed a sanction period in order to ensure that these appraisers have corrected their relevant deficiencies ; maintain the historical information , particularly early loan default information , used to target appraisers for review in order to ensure that the hocs target and review appraisers based on the criteria in hud guidance ; and implement a cost - effective field review contractor oversight process that includes on - site monitoring .
