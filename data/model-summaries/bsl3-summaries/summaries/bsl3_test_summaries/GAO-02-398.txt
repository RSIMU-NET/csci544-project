in response to your interest , we are reporting on ( 1 ) the status of the network growth strategy , ( 2 ) amtrak's estimates of expected mail and express revenue , and ( 3 ) amtrak's success in obtaining freight railroads' agreement to allow it to expand service over their tracks .
in recent years , facing the continuing deterioration of its financial condition and its attempt to eliminate its need for federal operating assistance by december 2002 , amtrak undertook a number of actions intended to improve its financial condition .
the national railroad passenger corporation ( amtrak ) is the nation's intercity passenger rail operator .
these potential risks include the expected ability to obtain capital funding and reach agreement with freight railroads to operate over their tracks .
in december 1999 , amtrak's board of directors shifted its route and service strategy toward planning to implement new routes and expand services ( called the network growth strategy ) on the freight railroad tracks over which amtrak operates .
amtrak has been unsuccessful in implementing its network growth strategy .
it estimated that this expansion , involving 15 routes , would yield about $66 million in net financial benefits through fiscal year 2002 , primarily from expanding its mail and express business , and help amtrak move toward operational self - sufficiency .
