it begins by providing a broad overview of ( 1 ) congress's powers under the constitution and ( 2 ) congress's role in interpreting this document .
on january 5 , 2011 , the house of representatives adopted an amendment to house rule xii to require that members of the house state the constitutional basis for congress's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution .
the report then specifically addresses house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , discussing its key requirements and limits , the legal effect of a cas , and the debate over the rule's value .
 ( the amendment does not pertain to concurrent or simple resolutions. ) .
the constitutional authority statement ( cas ) rule , found at house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , was subsequently adopted in the 113th , 114th , 115th , and 116th congresses .
as the cas rule begins its ninth year , the requirement continues to be a topic of congressional debate and inquiry , as members of the house contemplate how to comply with the rule prior to every submission of a bill or joint resolution .
