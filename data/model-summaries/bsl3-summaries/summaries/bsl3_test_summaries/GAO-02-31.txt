our objectives were to ( 1 ) update full - cycle costs to reflect the most current information and ( 2 ) analyze bureau data to determine the causes of the significant increase in cost per housing unit for the 2000 census when compared to the cost for the 1990 census .
the decennial census is the nation's most comprehensive and expensive data - gathering program .
from providing the basis for apportioning the u.s. house of representatives to providing data used by communities , businesses , and americans everywhere , the decennial census provides a great deal of knowledge about our nation .
however , due to current , ongoing studies and evaluations of the 2000 census , it is too early to determine the full extent of improvements compared to the 1990 census .
