this report responds to your request that we review the internal revenue service's ( irs ) program to audit income tax returns through correspondence .
we provide information on the number , results , and duration of correspondence audits as well as the characteristics of the audited returns and examine the processes and requirements that irs has put in place to govern correspondence audits .
irs has two quality review functions to see whether correspondence audits comply with its requirements and standards .
for example , in recent years , earned income credit ( eic ) claims and individual retirement account penalties have been highlighted by the service centers .
in recent years , congress has been concerned about irs' use of its enforcement tools , particularly about whether the tools are used fairly and in a manner that does not impose excessive burdens on taxpayers .
this report also includes our recommendations on improving the correspondence audit program .
in reviewing irs' correspondence audit processes and requirements , we found weaknesses that undermine its ability to ( 1 ) identify and audit all questionable tax issues on tax returns , ( 2 ) support its audit recommendations for additional taxes , ( 3 ) consistently accept justification for eic claims , ( 4 ) review adherence to audit requirements and quality standards , and ( 5 ) solicit taxpayers' responses about the tax issues being audited .
