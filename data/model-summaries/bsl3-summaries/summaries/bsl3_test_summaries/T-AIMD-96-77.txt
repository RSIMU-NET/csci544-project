the single audit is an important means by which the congress , federal oversight officials , and program managers obtain information on whether the recipients of federal assistance properly account for the federal funds they receive , maintain adequate internal controls over those funds , and comply with program requirements .
the single audit , which has gained widespread acceptance throughout the country , has helped foster fundamental financial management improvements and strengthened accountability at state and local governments and nonprofit organizations receiving federal assistance .
the 12 years of experience with the single audit act have shown that refinements can be made to strengthen the usefulness of single audits while at the same time reducing the burden on state and local governments and nonprofit organizations .
this has resulted in the state and local governments institutionalizing fundamental reforms , such as ( 1 ) preparing annual financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles , ( 2 ) obtaining annual independent comprehensive audits , ( 3 ) strengthening internal controls over federal funds and compliance with laws and regulations , ( 4 ) installing new accounting systems or enhancing old ones , ( 5 ) implementing subrecipient monitoring systems that have greatly improved oversight of entities to whom they have distributed federal funds , ( 6 ) improving systems for tracking federal funds , and ( 7 ) resolving audit findings .
