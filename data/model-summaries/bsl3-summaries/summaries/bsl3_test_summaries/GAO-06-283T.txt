through these programs , va provided almost $30 billion in cash disability benefits to more than 3.4 million veterans and their survivors in fiscal year 2004 .
for years , the claims process has been the subject of concern and attention within va and by the congress and veterans service organizations .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the claims processing challenges and opportunities facing the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) disability compensation and pension programs .
va's disability programs have not been updated to reflect the current state of science , medicine , technology , and labor market conditions .
while va is making efforts to address these problems , several factors may impede va's ability to make and sustain significant improvements in its claims processing performance .
many of their concerns have focused on long waits for decisions , large claims backlogs , and inaccurate decisions .
in january 2003 , we designated modernizing va and other federal disability programs as a high - risk area , because our work over the past decade found that these programs are based on concepts from the past and continue to experience management problems .
