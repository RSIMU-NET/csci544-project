the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) housing assistance programs in our scope include the three major rental assistance programs â€” housing choice voucher ( voucher ) , public housing , and project - based programs ( including the project - based section 8 , section 202 supportive housing for the elderly , and section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities programs ) .
disproportionately large numbers of military veterans have appeared among the homeless population in recent years , raising concerns about the incomes and housing conditions of veterans who rent , rather than own , their homes .
specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households ; ( 2 ) how hud's rental assistance programs treat veteran status ( that is , whether a person is a veteran or not ) and veteran - specific benefits in determining eligibility and subsidy amounts ; ( 3 ) the extent to which phas and property owners participating in hud's rental assistance programs establish a veterans' preference in their administrative and tenant selection plans ; and ( 4 ) the extent to which hud's rental assistance programs served veteran households in fiscal year 2005 .
