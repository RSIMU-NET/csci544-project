specifically , you asked us to evaluate ( 1 ) why women's benefits are lower than men's under the current social security system , ( 2 ) the possible differential effects on women of the new privatization reform proposals , and ( 3 ) what can be done to minimize the possibly negative effect on women of certain elements of the social security reform proposals .
increasing longevity and falling birth rates over the past 50 years have led to a growth in the elderly's share of the u.s. population .
the share that is 65 and older is expected to continue to increase from 13 percent of the total u.s. population today to 20 percent by 2050 .
several different reform plans have been proposed to address the financing problem , and all would affect the financial well - being of current and future beneficiaries .
on april 10 , 1997 , we testified before the house ways and means subcommittee on social security on the issue of social security reform and women's retirement income .
this demographic change has led to a serious long - term financing problem for the social security system .
