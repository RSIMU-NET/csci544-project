specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) beneficiaries' potential financial liability under medicare's current benefit structure and cost - sharing requirements , ( 2 ) the cost of medigap policies and the extent to which they provide additional coverage , and ( 3 ) concerns that medigap's so - called “first dollar” coverage undermines the cost control incentives of medicare's cost - sharing requirements .
most beneficiaries have additional supplemental coverage that helps to fill medicare's coverage gaps and pay some out - of - pocket expenses .
however , concerns exist that supplemental coverage can be expensive and may undermine the legitimate role of cost sharing in a health insurance plan — to encourage cost - effective use of services .
medicare provides valuable and extensive coverage for beneficiaries' health care needs .
nevertheless , recent discussions have underscored the significant gaps that leave some beneficiaries vulnerable to sizeable financial burdens from out - of - pocket costs .
i am pleased to be here today as you consider the need to modernize and strengthen the medicare program and review the role of supplemental “medigap” policies that many seniors buy to help improve their medicare coverage .
