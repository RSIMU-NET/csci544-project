in my testimony today , i will summarize ( 1 ) security incidents reported at federal agencies , ( 2 ) the effectiveness of information security at federal agencies , ( 3 ) agencies' reported progress in performing key control activities , and ( 4 ) opportunities to enhance fisma reporting and independent evaluations .
we also analyzed agencies' inspectors general ( ig ) reports pertaining to information security ; congressional reports ; annual fisma reports for 24 major federal agencies ; the performance and accountability reports for those agencies ; and the office of management and budget ( omb ) fisma guidance and mandated annual reports to congress .
concerned by reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act ( fisma ) of 2002 , which permanently authorized and strengthened information security program , evaluation , and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies .
more specifically , fisma requires agency information security programs that , among other things , include ● periodic assessments of the risk ; ● risk - based policies and procedures ; ● subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for networks , facilities , and systems or groups of information systems , as appropriate ; ● security awareness training for agency personnel , including contractors and other users of information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency ; ● periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies , procedures , and practices , performed with a frequency depending on risk , but no less than annually ; ● a process for planning , implementing , evaluating , and documenting remedial action to address any deficiencies ; ● procedures for detecting , reporting , and responding to security ● plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations .
