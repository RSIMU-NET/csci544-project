the commerce , consumer , and monetary affairs subcommittee asked us on november 9 , 1993 , to determine ( 1 ) the adequacy of commerce's administration of its employees' acceptance and reporting of travel funds from nonfederal sources and ( 2 ) the implications , if any , of commerce's denying the office of government ethics ( oge ) access to its records of reimbursed travel in 1992 .
this report presents the results of our review of the programs administered by the department of commerce and federal trade commission ( ftc ) for controlling the acceptance and reporting of travel expenses incurred by their employees and paid by nonfederal organizations .
under regulations promulgated by the general services administration ( gsa ) , federal employees can accept payment of travel costs by nonfederal sources , such as private companies and universities , if the purpose of the travel is related to the employees' official duties and responsibilities and the acceptance of such travel does not present the appearance of a conflict of interest .
commerce and ftc have established regulations that require adherence to gsa's regulations .
federal agencies are required to establish procedures to ensure that these conditions are met before travel reimbursements are accepted .
