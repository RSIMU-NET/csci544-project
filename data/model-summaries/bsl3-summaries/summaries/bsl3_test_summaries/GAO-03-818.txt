specifically , the objectives of this report were to assess ( 1 ) the department's progress in assessing its core functions as a basis for sourcing decisions , ( 2 ) the plans and progress dod has made in identifying and implementing alternatives to a - 76 , and ( 3 ) the current status of dod's a - 76 program .
the department of defense ( dod ) is currently examining a core competency - based approach for making sourcing decisions â€” that is , the decision to use a public or private sector source to perform a necessary agency function or activity based on whether the function or activity is core to the agency's mission .
in determining how to best perform non - core functions , dod's position is that its components should look beyond just the use of office of management and budget ( omb ) circular a - 76 , with its focus on public - private competitions , in making sourcing decisions .
