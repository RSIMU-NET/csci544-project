the house report 114-537 that accompanied the national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2017 included a provision for gao to review certain aspects of department of defense's ( dod ) acquisition process , including contract type selection , to determine their effect , if any , on foreign military sales ( fms ) .
each year , the u.s. government reports billions of dollars in sales of defense articles and services to foreign governments through the foreign military sales ( fms ) program .
to help increase efficiency when defining fms requirements to be placed on contract , we recommend that the secretary of defense issue department - wide guidance for the military departments and dod components to expand the use of requirements checklists to develop more comprehensive letters of request for fms cases .
further , in the fiscal year 2017 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) , congress required dod to revise its acquisition regulations to place new requirements on fms contracting and to seek ways to accelerate contracting and pricing for fms .
the department of state ( state ) has overall responsibility for the program , including the approval of sales .
this report addresses 1 ) how the use of firm - fixed - price contracts compares to other contract types awarded for fms procurements and the reasons they were used and 2 ) the factors that may contribute to delays and potentially increase costs for fms procurements .
