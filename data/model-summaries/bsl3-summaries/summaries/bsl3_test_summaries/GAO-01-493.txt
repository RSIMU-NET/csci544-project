according to the department of the navy , the primary purpose of forward - deployed naval forces is to project power from the sea to influence events ashore .
to be successful , our naval forces must be able to gain access to , and operate in the littoral regions of , potential adversaries .
consequently , they must be able to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines and submarines , and to protect themselves against cruise missiles and other antiship weapons .
specifically , we assessed the navy's existing mine countermeasures , antisubmarine warfare , ship self - defense , and surface fire support capabilities , and the progress of the acquisition programs the navy is pursuing to address shortfalls in these areas .
dod did not agree with our statement that the navy has not established funding priorities among its various antisubmarine and mine countermeasures programs .
we accept dod's determination that current funding levels are adequate .
the navy has not established funding priorities among its various antisubmarine programs .
the navy has not made a decision on the size and composition of its future mine countermeasures force structure .
in addressing limitations , the plan should identify the mix of mine warfare capabilities and systems for its future force structure to include the types and quantities of systems to be procured ; priorities among systems ; development schedules for the systems ; and the level of resources required for development , procurement , and sustainment .
