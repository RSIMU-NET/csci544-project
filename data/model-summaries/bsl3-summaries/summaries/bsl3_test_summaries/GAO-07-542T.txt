the foundation laid by the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and other management reform legislation provides a basis to improve the accountability of government programs and operations as well as to routinely produce valuable cost and operating performance information .
from a broad financial management perspective , the federal government's deteriorating long - range financial condition and long - term fiscal imbalance are matters of increasing concern .
this will be important as the federal government faces difficult fiscal challenges that will require reliable cost and performance information to support timely decisions on spending and , at the same time , pressures to address fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement will only intensify .
