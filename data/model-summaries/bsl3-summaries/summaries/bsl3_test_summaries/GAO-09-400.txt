in fiscal year 2008 , the department of defense ( dod ) granted eligibility for initial or renewal security clearances to more than 630,000 applicants who were military , dod civilian , or private industry personnel working on dod contracts .
long - standing delays in the clearance process led us to designate dod's personnel security clearance process as a high - risk area in 2005 .
 ( 3 ) to what extent did executive branch reporting to congress from 2006 through 2009 on dod and other federal agencies include information on quality in the security clearance process ? .
 ( 2 ) how complete is the documentation of investigations and adjudications for initial top secret security clearances favorably adjudicated within dod ? .
we limited our focus to initial top secret clearances because ( 1 ) we have identified documentation problems with this clearance level in previous work ; ( 2 ) investigators gather the most information for investigations for top secret clearances ; and ( 3 ) individuals granted top secret clearances have access to information that , if improperly disclosed , could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security .
we are making five recommendations to omb , opm , and dod .
