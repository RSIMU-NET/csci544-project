in order for dea to better determine to what extent its efforts are decreasing diversions and to inform future program decisions , we recommend that the administrator of dea strengthen the agency's performance measurement for the diversion control program by reassessing its set of performance measures for the program to identify ways to enhance the measures and their link to the program outcome goal of reducing diversion .
according to the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) , the abuse of controlled prescription drugs such as pain relievers , depressants , and stimulants is the nation's fastest - growing drug problem .
because of the rising diversion and illicit use of controlled prescription drugs , you asked us to review dea's management of its diversion control investigations to combat this problem .
although such prescription drugs have legitimate medical uses , they also pose a potential for abuse and addiction and , thus , being diverted for nonmedical illicit uses .
making more meaningful information available externally about the program's results would enable program managers and external stakeholders to better understand what the program is accomplishing and provide more effective oversight .
how does dea help ensure that policies and procedures are followed for diversion investigations and to what extent does it determine the results of its efforts on the diversion problem ? .
