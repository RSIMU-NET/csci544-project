as requested , after providing some context about records management in the federal government and the roles of federal agencies and the national archives and records administration ( nara ) , my statement will focus on describing the challenges of electronic records management and potential means of addressing these challenges .
as you are aware , federal agencies are increasingly using electronic means to create , exchange , and store information , and in doing so , they frequently create federal records .
according to the federal records act , federal records are information in whatever form that documents government functions , activities , decisions , and other important transactions , and such records must be managed and preserved in accordance with the act .
under the federal records act , each federal agency is required to make and preserve records that ( 1 ) document the organization , functions , policies , decisions , procedures , and essential transactions of the agency and ( 2 ) provide the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the government and of persons directly affected by the agency's activities .
i appreciate the opportunity to discuss critical issues surrounding electronic records management in the federal government .
