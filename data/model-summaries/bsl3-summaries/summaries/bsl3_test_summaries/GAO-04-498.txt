our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) what factors were primarily responsible for the price increase , ( 2 ) if the prices charged customers during fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003 recovered the reported actual costs of performing the work , and ( 3 ) if the air force has taken effective steps to improve efficiency and control the activity group's costs .
the air force depot maintenance activity group supports combat readiness by providing services necessary to keep air force units operating worldwide .
the group's in - house operations generate about $5 billion in annual revenue principally by repairing and overhauling a wide range of assets , including fighter aircraft such as the f - 15 , intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the minuteman and peacekeeper missiles , jet aircraft engines , electronics , avionics , software , and inventory items for the military services , other government agencies , and foreign governments .
because the activity group's customers are expected to request about 20.8 million hours of in - house work in fiscal year 2004 , this means that customers will have to pay about $4.9 billion for work that they would have paid about $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2000 .
