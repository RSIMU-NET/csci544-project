these fiscal pressures will require the congress to make tough choices regarding what the government should do , how it will do its work , who will help carry out its work in the future , and how government will be financed in the future .
this request is necessary to help us continue to support the congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the american people .
my testimony today will focus on our ( 1 ) performance and results with the funding you provided us in fiscal year 2004 , ( 2 ) streamlining and management improvement efforts under way , and ( 3 ) budget request for fiscal year 2006 to support the congress and serve the american people .
in the years ahead , our support to the congress will likely prove even more critical because of the pressures created by our nation's current and projected budget deficit and long - term fiscal imbalance .
we are grateful to the congress for providing us with the support and resources that have helped us in our quest to be a world - class professional services organization .
