the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , under the authority of congress as enunciated in periodic farm legislation , provides support to the u.s. farm economy through a variety of federal farm programs .
direct support can often involve the transfer of billions of dollars each year .
for example , usda's commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) outlays on farm support programs have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017 .
this variation has generated considerable interest — by both the general public and congress — in who is eligible to participate in farm programs and , thus , may receive payments .
program eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how many u.s. farm programs operate and how support dollars are distributed across the nation .
program payments vary across commodities and regions as well as by size of farm operations .
a key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be "actively engaged in farming" ( aef ) — that is , that a person contribute either labor or management time ( or both ) to the farm's operation .
