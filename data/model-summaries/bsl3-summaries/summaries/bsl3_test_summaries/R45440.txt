the interest and debate surrounding cryptocurrencies has led some central banks to examine whether the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could be leveraged to create digital versions of state - created currencies , which would have legal status in their jurisdiction of issue .
others believe that cryptocurrencies , which do not have status as legal tender , are a scam and a financial bubble that has burst , as evidenced by the approximately 85% drop in value of cryptocurrencies over the course of 2018 .
it has three functions in the economy: 1 ) a medium of exchange ( an item that buyers give to sellers when they want to purchase goods and services ) ; 2 ) a unit of account ( the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts ) ; and 3 ) a store of value ( an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future ) .
cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value that have no status as legal tender and are administer ed using distributed ledger technology , running on a network of independent , peer - to - peer computers .
a major policy question is whether state - issued digital currencies could draw on the benefits of cryptocurrencies while minimizing the risks , but there are varying views on the need for or desirability of digital fiat currencies .
