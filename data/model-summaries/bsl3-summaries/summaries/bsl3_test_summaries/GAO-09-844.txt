the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) constellation program is approaching a crossroads in development as it nears entry into the implementation phase .
the constellation program is developing the ares i crew launch vehicle and the orion crew exploration vehicle , the agency's first major efforts to support implementation of the vision for space exploration .
the program has delayed its entry into implementation , however , and is still modifying its overall architecture and specific requirements .
over $10 billion has already been obligated and nasa budget estimates indicate that over $97 billion is to be spent on the constellation program through 2020 .
to assess nasa's progress toward establishing a sound business case for the ares i and orion projects and identify key technical challenges nasa faces in developing the ares i crew launch and the orion crew exploration vehicles , we obtained and analyzed constellation plans and schedules , risk mitigation information , and contract performance data relative to the standards in our knowledge - based acquisition practices including program and project plans , contracts , schedules , risk assessments , funding profile , budget documentation , earned value reports , and the results of nasa's assessments of the program .
