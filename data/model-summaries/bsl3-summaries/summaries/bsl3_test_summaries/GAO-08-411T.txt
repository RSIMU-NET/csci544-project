although social security is important because of its size , the real driver of the long - term fiscal outlook is health care spending .
long - term fiscal simulations by gao , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and others all show that despite a 3- year decline in the federal government's unified budget deficit , we still face large and growing structural deficits driven primarily by rising health care costs and known demographic trends .
our long - term fiscal challenge is primarily a health - care challenge .
medicare and medicaid are both large and projected to continue growing rapidly in the future .
for example , the department of the treasury ( treasury ) reported a unified deficit of $163 billion and an on - budget deficit of $344 billion in fiscal year 2007 .
already the first members of the baby boom generation have filed for early social security retirement benefits â€” and will be eligible for medicare in only 3 years .
the goal of these reports is to increase public awareness and understanding of the long - term fiscal outlook in light of escalating health care cost growth and population aging , to stimulate public and policy debates , and to help policymakers make more informed decisions .
