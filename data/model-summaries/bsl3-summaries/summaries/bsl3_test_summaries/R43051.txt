in the 1970s , the number of requests for tribal recognition by the department of the interior ( department ) increased exponentially in the wake of the decisions in united states v. washington , which recognized tribal treaty fishing rights in the pacific northwest , and joint tribal council of passamaquoddy v. morton , which recognized a tribal land claim on the east coast .
in the 19 th century and first half of the 20 th century , the federal government made determinations about which groups of indians were tribes on an ad hoc basis when negotiating treaties and determining which groups of indians could reorganize their governments under the indian reorganization act .
faced with many requests for tribal recognition , in 1978 , the department adopted a uniform process and uniform criteria for considering whether a group should be acknowledged as an indian tribe .
a positive determination under the regulations means that the group has inherent sovereign authority independent of the state in which it is located and independent of the united states , although it remains a domestic dependent nation .
one scholar on tribal acknowledgment explains the significance of tribal recognition as follows: an administrative determination that a group is a tribe ( i.e. , that it merits federal acknowledgment or recognition ) establishes a government - to - government relationship between it and the united states .
