pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has established regulations regarding the transport , treatment , storage , and disposal of hazardous wastes .
as more states propose such legislation , potentially regulated stakeholders ( particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers ) have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with a patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states .
rcra establishes certain minimum standards that states must meet .
with increased legislative activity in the states , it is anticipated that stakeholders will increase their call for federal legislation regarding e - waste management .
to date , 14 states have enacted some form of legislation or regulations that will affect e - waste recycling and disposal practices .
however , states have the option to implement requirements that are more stringent than those specified under rcra .
to illustrate the issues associated with individual state action , this report discusses the key issues that have led to state action , describes common elements in state waste laws and proposals , and provides an overview of each enacted state law .
a challenge to many states is how to finance an e - waste collection and recycling program .
