consequently , the upcoming change of century is a sweeping and urgent challenge for public - sector and private - sector organizations alike .
the year 2000 ( y2k ) computing crisis has received much attention in recent months â€” and deservedly so .
as the world's most advanced and most dependent user of information technology , the united states possesses close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of internet assets .
in brief , education faces major risks that year 2000 failures could severely disrupt the student financial aid delivery process , including delaying disbursements and application processing .
education is now accelerating its program , but with the slow start , it remains in a position of playing catch up .
accordingly , the department has major challenges ahead but limited time remaining to adequately deal with them .
my statement today will describe the risks to the department of education , with a focus on student financial aid systems , actions the department has taken in recent months to address these risks , and key issues the department must deal with if its systems are to be ready for the century change: testing of systems , exchanging data with internal and external partners , and developing business continuity and contingency plans .
