historically , electricity service has been defined as a natural monopoly , meaning that theindustry has ( 1 ) an inherent tendency toward declining long - term costs , ( 2 ) high thresholdinvestment , and ( 3 ) technological conditions that limit the number of potential entrants .
the public utility holding company act ( puhca ) ( 1 ) and the federal power act ( fpa ) of 1935 ( title i and title ii of the public utility act ) ( 2 ) established a regime ofregulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federalgovernment .
the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will bepermitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among thevarious customer classes ( residential , commercial , and industrial ) .
at the least , a state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates , and oftenover investment and debt .
despite this diversity , the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have notrestructured is the establishment of retail electric prices .
in addition,many regulators have considered unified control of generation , transmission , and distribution as themost efficient means of providing service .
