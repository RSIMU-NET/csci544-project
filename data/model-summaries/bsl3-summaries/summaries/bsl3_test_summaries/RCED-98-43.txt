this report discusses various issues concerning the role of certain power marketing administrations ( pma ) and other federal agencies in restructuring electricity markets .
we examined whether the government operates them and the related electric power assets in a businesslike manner and identified options that the congress and other policymakers can pursue to address concerns about the pmas' role in restructuring markets and about their management .
although markets for wholesale transactions are becoming competitive , retail markets are still uncompetitive .
the electricity industry has been predominantly monopolistic and noncompetitive .
these options can be grouped in several different ways , including ( 1 ) improving the planning , budgeting , and funding for capital repairs of the federal hydropower assets ; ( 2 ) changing the pmas' power rates and repayment methodologies ; ( 3 ) organizationally restructuring the federal hydropower program to improve its operating efficiency ; and ( 4 ) eliminating the application of selected legal and administrative requirements to the federal program .
electricity markets are not yet fully competitive but are moving in that direction .
supporters of restructuring argue that markets will not be truly competitive until both wholesale and retail markets are transformed .
