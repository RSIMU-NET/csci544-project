the purpose of this report is to ( 1 ) compare the honor and conduct systems at each academy and describe how the various systems provide common due process protections and ( 2 ) describe the attitudes and perceptions of the students toward the honor and conduct systems .
as part of a comprehensive review of student treatment at the department of defense ( dod ) service academies originally requested by senator nunn and senator glenn , we collected information on the honor and conduct adjudicatory systems at the military academy , the naval academy , and the air force academy .
as arranged with your staff , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 1 day from its date of issue .
due process protections are greater in criminal proceedings than in non - criminal proceedings ( such as administrative hearings ) .
courts have established that students facing expulsion from tax - supported colleges and universities have constitutionally protected interests that require minimal due process protections and established standards for student disciplinary proceedings .
in reviewing judicial and administrative proceedings , we identified 12 categories of due process protections commonly used to ensure fairness in hearings .
