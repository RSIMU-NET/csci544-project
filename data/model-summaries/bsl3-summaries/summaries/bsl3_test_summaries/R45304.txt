since then , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has issued regulations for more than 90 contaminants , and all states ( except wyoming ) have assumed primary responsibility for administering the federal drinking water program and overseeing public water system compliance .
the quality of water delivered by public water systems has been regulated at the federal level since enactment of the 1974 safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) .
among the key provisions , the 1996 amendments authorized a drinking water state revolving fund ( dwsrf ) program to help public water systems finance improvements needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and to address the most serious risks to human health .
congress last broadly amended the law in 1996 ( p.l .
states are authorized to use dwsrf funds to provide financial assistance ( primarily subsidized loans ) to eligible public water systems for expenditures that epa has determined , through guidance , will facilitate sdwa compliance or significantly further the act's health protection objectives .
the law authorizes epa to make grants to states each year to capitalize a state revolving loan fund .
each state must match 20% of its annual capitalization grant .
