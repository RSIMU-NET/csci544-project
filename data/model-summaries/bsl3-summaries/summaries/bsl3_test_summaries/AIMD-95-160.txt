our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) epa's planned state emissions reporting requirements exceed the agency's program needs and ( 2 ) states use epa's aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) to monitor emissions data .
the 1990 amendments require the states to collect , analyze , and report information to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
after the amendments were passed , the chairman of the former environment , energy , and natural resources subcommittee expressed concern that epa and the states could be overwhelmed by the collection and reporting requirements of the law and might not be able to make appropriate use of the information .
this report conveys the results of our evaluation of selected data collection and reporting requirements of the clean air act amendments of 1990 .
epa began work on the now suspended emissions regulation in order to consolidate and standardize several state emissions reporting requirements ( i.e. , emission statements , periodic emission inventories , and annual statewide point source reporting ) and to align these requirements with the mandates in the 1990 amendments .
the clean air act gives epa authority to set national standards to protect human health and the environment from emissions that pollute ambient ( outdoor ) air .
