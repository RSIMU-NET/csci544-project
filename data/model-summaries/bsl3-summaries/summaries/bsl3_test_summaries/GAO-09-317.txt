to better understand the role that high speed rail service could play in the u.s. transportation system , we were asked to assess ( 1 ) the factors affecting the economic viability of high speed rail projects — that is , whether a project's total social benefits offset or justify the total social costs — and difficulties in determining the economic viability of proposed projects ; ( 2 ) the challenges that u.s. project sponsors experience in developing and financing high speed rail projects ; and ( 3 ) the federal role in the potential development of high speed rail systems .
federal , state , and local decision makers have had a renewed interest in looking at how high speed rail might fit into our national transportation system and address increasing mobility constraints on the nation's highways and at airports due to congestion .
the recently enacted american recovery and reinvestment of act of 2009 ( arra ) appropriated $8 billion for high speed rail and intercity passenger rail congestion and capital grants ( the latter of which were authorized by the priia ) , with priority given to projects that support the development of high speed rail service .
