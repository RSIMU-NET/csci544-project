data mining involves the use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown , valid patterns and relationships in large data sets .
these tools can include statistical models , mathematical algorithms , and machine learning methods ( algorithms that improve their performance automatically through experience , such as neural networks or decision trees ) .
consequently , data mining consists of more than collecting and managing data , it also includes analysis and prediction .
as passed in its final form as part of the omnibus spending bill ( p.l .
for example , on january 16 , 2003 , senator feingold introduced s. 188 the data - mining moratorium act of 2003 , which would have imposed a moratorium on the implementation of data mining under the total information awareness program ( now referred to as the terrorism information awareness project ) by the department of defense , as well as any similar program by the department of homeland security .
however , the proliferation of data mining has raised some implementation and oversight issues as well .
these include concerns about the quality of the data being analyzed , the interoperability of the databases and software between agencies , and potential infringements on privacy .
