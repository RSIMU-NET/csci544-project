by the time of the revised statutes of 1878 , the list of federal capital offenses included treason ; and murder , arson , or rape in u.s. special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ; piracy ; insurance fraud involving the destruction of a vessel at sea ; and the rescue of an individual under sentence of death .
the federal death penalty act and related provisions establish the procedure that must be followed before a defendant convicted of a federal capital offense may be executed .
the death penalty has long been a sentencing option in this country .
when the first congress convened , it made federal capital offenses of murder within federal enclaves , treason , and piracy , as well as forgery and counterfeiting of federal certificates and public securities .
after furman , where the supreme court found unconstitutional imposition of capital punishment pursuant to procedures then required under state and federal law , congress made procedural adjustments to revive the death penalty as a sentencing option first in air piracy cases , then in drug kingpin homicide cases , and finally as a general matter in the federal death penalty act .
the federal death penalty act reflects the constitutional boundaries identified in furman and subsequent related supreme court decisions .
