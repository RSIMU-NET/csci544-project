postal service's ( usps ) cost structure has become unsustainable in part because its declining revenue is insufficient to cover the costs of operating usps's vast network of post offices and mail - processing centers .
for example , by considering factors , such as the distance of cpus to existing post offices , cpu hours and days of service , and usps's costs of compensating cpus , usps could better inform its retail strategy in order to make better strategic use of cpus in its future retail network , which will likely include reduced hours at thousands of post offices .
usps reached its statutory $15 billion borrowing limit in september , 2012 , and usps's cash resources are so low that it is unable to meet all of its retiree health care prefunding obligations .
usps provided a written response ( see appendix iii ) in which they discussed usps's efforts beyond cpus to provide customers with sufficient and convenient access to its products and services through other types of partnerships and alternatives to post offices .
usps revenue from cpus and compensation to them from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 , and 3. challenges usps might face if it increases its use of cpus .
