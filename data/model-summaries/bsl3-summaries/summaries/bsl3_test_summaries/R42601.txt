the development of the internet and its use in china have raised u.s. congressional concerns , including those related to human rights , trade and investment , and cybersecurity .
the people's republic of china ( prc ) has the world's largest number of internet users , estimated at 500 million people , including an estimated 300 million people with accounts on twitter - like microblogging sites .
along with its extensive internal security apparatus , china also has an aggressive and multi - faceted internet censorship system .
these include the use of the internet as a u.s. policy tool for promoting freedom of expression and other rights in china ; the use of the internet by political dissidents in the prc and the political repression that such use often provokes ; and the role of u.s. internet companies in both spreading freedom in china and cooperating with prc censorship and social control efforts .
congressional interest in the internet in china is linked to human rights in a number of ways .
despite government efforts to limit the flow of information , chinese internet users are able to access unprecedented amounts of information , and the web has served as a lifeline for political dissidents , social activists , and civil society actors .
