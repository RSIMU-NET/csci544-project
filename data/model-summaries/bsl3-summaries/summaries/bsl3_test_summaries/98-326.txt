this is an outline of two federal statutes: the electronic communications privacy act ( ecpa ) and the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) .
congress crafted both to preserve the ability of government officials to secure information critical to the nation's well - being and to ensure individual privacy .
the courts play an essential role in both .
both evolved out of the shadow of the supreme court's fourth amendment jurisprudence .
fisa authorizes the collection of information about the activities of foreign powers and their agents , whether those activities are criminal or not .
fisa has no such concern .
it modeled parts of fisa after features in ecpa .
ecpa's only concern is crime .
ecpa protects individual privacy from the intrusions of other individuals .
there are differences , however .
congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute as a temporary measure to prevent disclosure of government secrets during world war i .
although early american law proscribed common law eavesdropping , the crime was little prosecuted and by the late nineteenth century had "nearly faded from the legal horizon. .
prominent among its enactments are: the usa patriot act ; the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2002 ; the 21 st century department of justice appropriations authorization act ; the department of homeland security act ; the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act ; and the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 amendments act of 2008 ( 2008 fisa amendments act ) .
