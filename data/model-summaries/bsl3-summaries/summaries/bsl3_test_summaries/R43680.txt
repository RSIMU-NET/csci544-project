the congressional research service ( crs ) does not take a position on the best way to reduce the deficit .
as a result , the federal debt held by the public increased from 39% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2008 to 72% of gdp in 2013 , which was its highest share of gdp since after world war ii .
the federal budget has been in deficit ( i.e. , spending has exceeded revenues ) since 2002 , and deficits were significantly larger from 2009 to 2012 than in any other year since world war ii .
congress has expressed interest in examining policy options to reduce the deficit .
this report first discusses the size of projected budget deficits , then discusses how much the deficit would need to be reduced to return to long - term sustainability , then analyzes alternative time frames for reducing the deficit , and finally discusses broad policy choices for reducing the deficit .
at some point , spending cuts or revenue increases will be needed to restore fiscal sustainability , although the recent decline in the deficit has provided policymakers more flexibility on the timing of these changes .
