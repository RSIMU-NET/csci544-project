the food and drug administration ( fda ) , the federal agency that approves drugs for marketing , is responsible for administering the law and has procedures for ensuring the study of drugs in pediatric patients .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we addressed the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent are children of racial and ethnic minority groups represented in clinical studies for drugs granted exclusive marketing rights , ( 2 ) are drugs that are used to treat diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups being studied for safety and effectiveness in children under the pediatric exclusivity provision , and ( 3 ) does fda have appropriate management systems to monitor the representation of children of racial and ethnic groups in studies submitted for additional exclusive marketing rights ? .
a drug used to treat children that has not been tested or labeled for pediatric use may place children at risk of under - or overdosing , and when age - appropriate formulations of the drugs do not exist , such as liquids or chewable tablets , the drug may be improperly administered to children .
to help address these concerns , in 1997 congress passed a law that gives sponsors 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights for their products in return for conducting clinical drug studies in children , commonly known as the pediatric exclusivity provision .
