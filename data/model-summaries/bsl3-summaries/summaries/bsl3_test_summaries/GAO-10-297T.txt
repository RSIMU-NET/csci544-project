the smithsonian has been referred to as america's museum , as its museums hold and provide access to irreplaceable national collections in american and natural history , art , and other areas .
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on efforts by the smithsonian institution ( smithsonian ) to address challenges related to governance and facilities .
in my statement today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the findings of a report we are releasing today — smithsonian institution: implementation of governance reforms is progressing , but work remains — regarding the smithsonian's efforts to implement governance reforms recommended by the board of regents governance committee and by gao in 2008 , and ( 2 ) provide a brief update on the smithsonian's efforts to implement our 2007 facilities and funding recommendations .
the smithsonian has implemented one of the four recommendations we made in 2008 to strengthen its governance reform efforts , and it has taken steps to implement the other three recommendations .
in september 2007 , we concluded that if the smithsonian did not develop a viable strategy to address its estimated $2.5 billion in facilities projects , its facilities and collections would face increased risk , and the ability of the smithsonian to meet its mission would likely decline .
