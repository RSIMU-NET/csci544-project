under the clean air act , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) is responsible for overseeing the states' air quality programs and for ensuring that the states appropriately implement the act's requirements .
concerned about the air quality consequences of emissions that exceed allowable levels , you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) the steps that epa and state regulators take to verify that large sources comply with their title v or state permit and the extent of compliance found ; ( 2 ) the steps that regulators take to verify the accuracy of emissions reports submitted by large industrial sources and the extent of errors found ; and ( 3 ) the steps that epa is taking , if any , to improve its oversight of these processes .
title v of the clean air act amendments of 1990 requires nearly 20,000 major stationary sources ( such as factories that emit more than specified levels of pollutants ) to obtain and comply with the conditions of a permit that consolidates all applicable air pollution control requirements .
to address these questions , we performed audit work at epa's headquarters , 2 of epa's 10 regional offices , and the air quality offices of four states ( two states within each of two of epa's regions ) .
