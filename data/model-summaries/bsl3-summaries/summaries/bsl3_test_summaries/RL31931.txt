in 1992 , the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases .
over the past 16 years , a variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states , including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions , improved appliance efficiency , and incentives for developing renewable energy sources .
further , in june 2008 , the senate considered legislation ( s. 3036 ) to enact an economy - wide cap - and - trade system to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions .
this focus was particularly evident in the administration's 2006 climate action report ( car ) submitted under the provisions of the unfccc .
a cap - and - trade system is the favored approach of the incoming administration , and similar legislation may have a better chance of passage in the 111 th congress .
since then , the bush administration has focused u.s. climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions .
in 2001 , president george w. bush rejected the kyoto protocol to the unfccc , which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
