 ( recommendation 2 ) .
highway and transit projects that use federal funds are subject to federal requirements , including requirements under the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) , to analyze the potential environmental effects of proposed projects ; such evaluations are called environmental impact statements or environmental assessments , which we refer to in this report as “environmental reviews” .
our work focused on federal - aid highway and transit projects and the provisions included in the past three surface - transportation reauthorizations that are intended to streamline the environmental consulting and permitting processes performed by the three federal resource agencies: fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) , and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) .
this report: addresses the extent to which identified streamlining provisions have had an impact on the time frames for the environmental consulting and permitting processes ; identifies actions taken by federal resource agencies to streamline their consulting and permitting reviews and identifies additional streamlining opportunities , if any ; and describes the actions taken by ceq to accelerate highway and transit projects .
