the section 8 housing choice voucher program has come under increasing criticism from the administration and congress for its cost and its complexity .
recent changes in the way the program is funded have largely addressed concerns at the federal level about "spiraling costs" ; however , the new funding structure has not reduced budget pressures for the local public housing authorities ( phas ) that administer the program .
in 2006 , a bipartisan voucher reform bill , which would have modified the voucher program but largely retained its current structure , was approved by the house financial services committee , but no further action was taken before the close of the 109 th congress .
bills to enact the president's reform have been introduced in congress , although no further action has been taken .
noting these concerns , the administration has argued in each of the past several years that the existing section 8 voucher program should be dismantled and replaced with a new , broader - purpose grant program .
every year since 2003 , the president has proposed eliminating the section 8 voucher program and replacing it with a new initiative .
