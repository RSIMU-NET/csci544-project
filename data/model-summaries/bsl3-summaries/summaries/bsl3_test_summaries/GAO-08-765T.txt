this report focused on contracts for major investments with complex service acquisitions at the coast guard , customs and border protection ( cbp ) , and the transportation security administration ( tsa ) — three of the dhs components reporting among the highest obligations for performance - based service acquisitions in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 .
to help improve service acquisition outcomes , federal procurement policy calls for agencies to use a performance - based approach to the maximum extent practicable .
to meet its expansive homeland security mission , dhs spends billions of dollars on service acquisitions for critical trade , transportation , and border security investments .
while a performance - based approach has been widely accepted , we have found that agencies face certain challenges in implementing the approach — especially for complex or major investments .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) planning and assessment of its complex service acquisitions .
in fact , more than 80 percent of dhs's total procurement dollars are spent on services .
specifically , i will discuss how contract outcomes are influenced by how well dhs components have defined and developed contract requirements and performance standards .
