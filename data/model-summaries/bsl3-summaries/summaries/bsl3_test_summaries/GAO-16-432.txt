the food and drug administration ( fda ) — an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — has faced challenges carrying out its responsibilities to approve and oversee the safety and efficacy of medical products sold in the united states .
systematically track funding of regulatory science projects across each of its priority areas .
develop and document measurable goals , such as targets and time frames , for its regulatory science efforts so it can consistently assess and report on the agency's progress in regulatory science efforts .
systematic tracking of both progress on measurable goals and funding is essential for fda to strategically plan its regulatory science initiative across the agency .
in 2013 , fda issued another strategic plan for regulatory science , as required by the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 ( fdasia ) .
to evaluate fda's strategic planning efforts to address its regulatory science priorities for medical products , we analyzed fda documents , including its 2011 and 2013 strategic planning documents , its reports on strategic priorities , and a 2015 progress report .
we examined the achievements related to regulatory science for 17 projects funded by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
