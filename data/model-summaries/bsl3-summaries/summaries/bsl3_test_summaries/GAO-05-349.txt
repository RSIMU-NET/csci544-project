the department of defense ( dod ) has expressed continuing concerns about servicemembers' use of predatory consumer loans .
and ( 2 ) are dod and active duty servicemembers fully utilizing the tools that dod has to curb the use and effects of predatory lending practices ? .
these tools include: ( 1 ) the armed forces disciplinary control boards , which can make recommendations to installation commanders who can then use or threaten to use their “off - limits” authority to prohibit servicemembers from using a business that engages in predatory lending practices ; ( 2 ) free legal assistance with contracts and other financial transactions ; and ( 3 ) personal financial management ( pfm ) programs that offer servicemembers assistance , such as financial management training and counseling .
our recommendation will ( 1 ) require the boards to meet regularly and ( 2 ) provide installation commanders additional focus and oversight into conditions that may adversely affect servicemembers on their installations .
these loans can result in financial problems that may lead to severe negative consequences for the military as a whole ( e.g. , decreases in unit readiness and morale ) as well as for the servicemembers themselves ( e.g. , criminal and adverse personnel actions , including possible discharge from the military ) .
