over two - thirds of the 39 million beneficiaries enrolled in medicare's traditional fee - for - service program in 2017 had two or more serious health conditions , such as diabetes and heart disease .
the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( 2018 bba ) defines longitudinal comprehensive care planning ( lccp ) as a service that includes the following five components: a conversation with a beneficiary diagnosed with a serious or life - shared decision - making through an interdisciplinary team that includes a physician , registered nurse , and social worker ; development of a longitudinal comprehensive care plan ( care plan ) that is discussed with the beneficiary that addresses the progression of the disease and treatment options ; a care plan that addresses the beneficiary's goals , values , and a care plan that discusses the availability of other resources or social supports that may help mitigate the beneficiary's health risks .
the 2018 bba included a provision that we examine medicare physician fee schedule billing codes established by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers the medicare program — that may be used for care planning services provided to beneficiaries diagnosed with a serious or life - threatening illness or illnesses .
