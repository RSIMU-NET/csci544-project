we recommend that the secretary of labor take steps to ( 1 ) better utilize information in labor's database , such as indicators of program performance , for management oversight , particularly for apprenticeship programs in occupations with expected future labor shortages ; ( 2 ) develop a cost - effective strategy for collecting data from council - monitored states ; ( 3 ) conduct labor's reviews of apprenticeship activities in states that regulate their own programs on a regular basis to ensure that state activities are in accord with labor's requirements for recognition of apprenticeship programs ; and ( 4 ) offer substantive feedback to states from its reviews .
specifically , we assessed ( 1 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of labor monitors the operations and outcomes of registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , ( 2 ) its oversight activities for council - monitored states , and ( 3 ) the outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions in relation to those sponsored by employers alone .
