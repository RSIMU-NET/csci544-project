our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) what state regulators were doing to oversee the year 2000 readiness of the insurance industry , ( 2 ) how the regulatory oversight of the insurance industry's year 2000 readiness compared with the oversight of the banking and securities industries , ( 3 ) the current status of the insurance industry's year 2000 readiness , and ( 4 ) the nature and extent of year 2000 liability exposures that insurers face and the mitigation efforts taken to address such exposures .
the insurance industry , with policy reserves of approximately $2.5 trillion , is an important component of the financial system .
the effectiveness of insurers' efforts to mitigate their exposures remains unclear as some mitigation measures face legal and marketplace challenges .
these reserves are held in trust for policyholders , much like bank deposits are held for depositors .
thus , a regulator of financial institutions could use this , or other similar guidance , as general criteria for assessing the state of preparedness of its regulated institutions .
financial services institutions are especially dependent upon the accurate transmission of electronic information ; thus , the systems they use must be readied to correctly process 2000 dates .
