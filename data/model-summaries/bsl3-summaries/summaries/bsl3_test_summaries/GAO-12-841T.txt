the joint polar satellite system ( jpss ) and the geostationary operational environmental satellite - r ( goes - r ) programs are meant to replace current operational satellites , and both are considered critical to the united states' ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting .
as requested , this statement summarizes our two reports being released today on ( 1 ) the status , plans , and risks for jpss and ( 2 ) the status , schedule management process , and risk management process within the goes - r program .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on two satellite acquisition programs within the department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) .
in early 2012 , in response to congressional direction , dod decided to terminate the program because it still has two satellites to launch within its legacy defense meteorological satellite program .
as a result , noaa has improved its ability to fully meet its mission - essential function of providing continuous satellite imagery in support of weather forecasting .
dod is currently identifying alternative means to fulfill its future environmental satellite requirements .
