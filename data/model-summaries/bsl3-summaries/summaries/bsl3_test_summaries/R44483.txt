when it comes to global supply and demand for natural gas , china is the main wildcard .
those issues include the following: the prospects for u.s. energy exports , including exports of natural gas and coal ; prospects for u.s. energy companies' investments in china ; chinese investment in the u.s. energy sector ; manufacturing competitiveness between the united states and china ; china's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change ; china's ability to reduce the severe air pollution that hangs over parts of the country , and thus reduce the airborne pollutants that have been shown to travel from china to the west coast of the united states ; china's political and economic relationships with such regions as central asia , a major supplier of natural gas to china via pipelines , and the middle east , currently a major supplier of oil and lng to china ; china's plans for disputed waters in the south china sea , which may contain significant hydrocarbon resources ; and china's management of its energy - rich but troubled xinjiang region , which has a large ethnic turkic population and has been the subject of human rights concerns from governments and groups outside china , and of chinese government concerns about separatism , terrorism , and religious extremism .
