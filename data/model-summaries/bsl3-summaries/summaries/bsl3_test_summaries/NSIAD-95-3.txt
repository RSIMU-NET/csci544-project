originally , the department of defense ( dod ) estimated that it would realize $4.1 billion in property sales revenue from military bases closed under the 1988 and 1991 base realignment and closure rounds .
revenue from property sales is to be used to help pay for the base closure costs .
communities are asking the federal government to provide ( 1 ) cash grants ; ( 2 ) marketable revenue - producing properties , such as golf courses and housing units , to help pay for reuse activities ; and ( 3 ) funds for upgrading buildings and infrastructure .
rather , the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 ( the property act ) requires a screening process in which the appropriate government officials explore transferring the property with or without payment to another government or nonprofit agency .
in 1994 , dod reduced this estimate to $1.2 billion .
the army is credited for almost all of the $69.4 million in property sales revenue and for $5.3 million of the $22.2 million in pending sales .
disagreements between various agencies and jurisdictions have stalled reuse decisions at some bases .
dod has the discretion to determine what the highest and best use for the property is and relies heavily on local reuse plans to make this determination .
