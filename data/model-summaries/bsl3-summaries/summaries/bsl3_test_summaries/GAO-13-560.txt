the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for enforcing laws prohibiting the illegal importation of goods into the united states , including prescription drugs that have not been approved for marketing in the united states by fda , and its u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) conducts investigations related to violations of these laws , including illegally importing prescription drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods .
