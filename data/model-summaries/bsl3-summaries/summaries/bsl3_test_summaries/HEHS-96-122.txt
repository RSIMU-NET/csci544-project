growing concern over student performance and behavior in public elementary and secondary schools has led some educators and policymakers to consider single - gender educational settings to improve student performance .
because of this recent interest , you asked us to identify the major educational and legal issues involved with public single - gender education and to cite some examples of recent public single - gender education programs .
