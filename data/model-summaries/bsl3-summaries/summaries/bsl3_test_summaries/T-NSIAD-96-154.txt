our work did not specifically address the veteran's gulf war illness issue ; however , we did address some issues common to those contained in your february 15 , 1996 , interim report such as inadequate detection equipment , and problems of transitioning from investigational new drug vaccine status to food and drug administration approved vaccines .
as you know , during the persian gulf conflict ( 1 ) many units arrived in the persian gulf without needed protective equipment and adequate training , ( 2 ) plans to vaccinate personnel to protect them from the effects of biological agents were inadequate , and ( 3 ) medical units lacked the ability to treat casualties in a chemically or biologically contaminated environment .
we appreciate the opportunity to provide our assessment of the capability of u.s. forces to fight and survive while under attack by chemical and biological agents .
u.s. forces still lack the ability to defend adequately against chemical and / or biological agents and a degraded war - fighting capability could still result from persistent equipment , training , and medical shortcomings .
new and improved equipment for chemical and biological defense is needed to overcome some shortfalls , and dod is having difficulty meeting all of its planned chemical and biological defense research goals .
