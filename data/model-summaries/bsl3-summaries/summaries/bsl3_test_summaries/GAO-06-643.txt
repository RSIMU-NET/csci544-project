when hurricane katrina made its final landfall along the louisiana / mississippi border on august 29 , 2005 , it quickly became one of the largest natural disasters in the history of the united states .
despite a massive deployment of resources and support from both military and civilian agencies , many have regarded the federal response as inadequate .
this report presents the results of our review of the military response to hurricane katrina , which examined ( 1 ) the extent to which pre - katrina plans and training exercises reflected the military assistance that might be required during a catastrophic , domestic , natural disaster , ( 2 ) the support that the military provided in responding to katrina and factors that affected that response , and ( 3 ) the actions the military is taking to address lessons learned from katrina and to prepare for the next catastrophic event .
as recovery operations continue , the nation is quickly approaching the 2006 hurricane season , and faces other natural and man - made threats that could result in a catastrophe at any instant .
we currently have a large body of ongoing work to address preparation , response , recovery , and rebuilding efforts related to hurricanes katrina and rita .
