since use of the in - lieu - fee mitigation option has increased over the last decade , you asked us to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the in - lieu - fee option has been used to mitigate adverse impacts to wetlands , ( 2 ) the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its intended purpose of mitigating such impacts , and ( 3 ) in - lieu - fee organizations compete with mitigation banks for developers' mitigation business .
of an estimated 220 million acres of marshes , bogs , swamps , and other wetlands in the contiguous united states during colonial times , over half have disappeared , and some of the remaining wetlands have been degraded .
developers whose projects adversely affect wetlands must , as prescribed in regulations and guidance issued by the army corps of engineers ( corps ) and environmental protection agency ( epa ) under the clean water act , first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to wetlands to the extent practicable .
agencies need adequate success criteria in order to measure whether progress is being made toward achieving the national goal of no net loss of the nation's remaining wetlands .
