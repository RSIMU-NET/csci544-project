i am pleased to be here today to discuss the importance of having strong chief information officers ( cios ) at major federal agencies and ensuring an effective cio council to help bring about much - needed reforms in the government's management of information technology ( it ) .
our views are based not only on our work in the technology area , but also on our experiences in evaluating the implementation of other major management reforms , such as the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and the government performance and results act ( results act ) of 1993 .
based upon our work and that of others , the congress , in conjunction with the administration , crafted two recent landmark reforms in federal information management: the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) of 1995 and the clinger - cohen act of 1996 .
to help reverse this trend , gao embarked on a concerted effort to learn how leading private and public sector organizations controlled system development projects and successfully applied technology to improve their performance .
the picture that unfolded year after year was bleak: multimillion dollar and , in some cases , billion dollar system development efforts routinely came in over cost , behind schedule , and lacking in promised capabilities .
