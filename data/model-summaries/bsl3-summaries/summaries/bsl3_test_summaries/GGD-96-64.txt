on our own initiative , we conducted a follow - up review to identify ( 1 ) how long federal agencies took to enter fugitives onto the wanted person file ; ( 2 ) what information the agencies had on entry times and the means used to monitor entry times ; and ( 3 ) what actions agencies took , considered , or could take to reduce any entry delays .
then , we interviewed officials and reviewed various documents from the department of justice's fbi , immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) , and united states marshals service ( usms ) and from the department of the treasury's bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms ( atf ) and the customs service .
as a result of our earlier work on interagency coordination in apprehending federal fugitives , we noted that many entries in the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) national crime information center's ( ncic ) wanted person file were made long after issuance of the arrest warrants.this was generally contrary to the stated policies of the agencies that made the entries and the generally accepted view of ncic officials , the international association of chiefs of police , and others that timely use of the file facilitates apprehension and reduces risks to law enforcement personnel and the general public .
