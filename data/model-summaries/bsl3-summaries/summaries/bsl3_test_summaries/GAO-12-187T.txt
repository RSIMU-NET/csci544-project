my statement today discusses ( 1 ) the role of the nextgen test facilities in the development of nextgen technologies and how private industry and partner agencies participate in projects at the nextgen test facilities , and ( 2 ) our previous findings on nextgen technology transfer and faa's efforts to improve the transfer and implementation of nextgen - related technologies .
these test facilities provide access to the systems currently used in the national air space ( nas ) and house various types of hardware , simulators , and other equipment to allow for demonstrations of new technologies .
i appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on the use of test facilities as a means of leveraging public , private , and academic resources to deliver technologies for the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
transforming the nation's air transportation system affects and involves the activities and missions of several federal agencies , though the federal aviation administration ( faa ) is the lead implementer .
the result will be an air transportation system that relies on satellite - based surveillance and navigation , data communications , and improved collaborative decision making .
