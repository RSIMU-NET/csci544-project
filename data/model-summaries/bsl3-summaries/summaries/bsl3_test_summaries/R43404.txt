in response to the disclosure of various national security agency ( nsa ) surveillance and data collection programs , a number of legislative changes to the government's intelligence operations authority have been suggested .
many of these proposals include amendments to the practices and procedures of the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) , and the fisa court of review , which reviews rulings of the fisc .
currently , the government's applications for surveillance orders to the fisc are classified , as are most fisa opinions themselves .
a number of proposals seek to increase government transparency by requiring public disclosure of fisa opinions .
these proposals might be understood to raise separation of powers issues , namely , the scope of the executive branch's control over national security information .
at least one group has proposed that all fisa decisions should be published in their entirety ; other proposals would allow the government to conduct a declassification review of the material first , substituting a summary of material when appropriate .
on the other hand , at least according to the public record , the fisa court of review has sat only twice ; and both times the court released its opinion with sensitive information redacted .
