with a budget of about $42.5 million , cpsc carries out its mission by ( 1 ) enforcing federal consumer product regulations ( by recalling products from store shelves , for example ) and ( 2 ) conducting projects to address products with potential hazards not covered by existing regulations .
specifically , this report ( 1 ) identifies the criteria cpsc uses to select projects and reviews the information it relies upon in making these choices , ( 2 ) assesses the information cpsc draws on to perform risk assessment and cost - benefit analyses and evaluates the agency's methodology for conducting cost - benefit analyses , and ( 3 ) describes cpsc's procedures for releasing manufacturer - specific information to the public and reports whether evidence exists that cpsc violated its statutory requirements concerning the release of such information .
created to protect consumers from “unreasonable risk of injury,” the u.s. consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) oversees these and about 15,000 other consumer products ranging from kitchen appliances and children's toys to hot tubs and garage door openers .
contending that the agency is ineffectively allocating its resources , cpsc's critics have voiced dissatisfaction with the selection of certain agency projects and have questioned the validity of cpsc's risk assessment and cost - benefit analyses supporting those projects .
