the objectives of this review were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) available data allow the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to accurately identify the marine mammal stocks that meet the marine mammal protection act's ( mmpa ) requirements for establishing take reduction teams , ( 2 ) nmfs has established take reduction teams for those marine mammal stocks that meet the statutory requirements , ( 3 ) nmfs has met the statutory deadlines established in the mmpa for the take reduction teams subject to the deadlines and the reasons for any delays , and ( 4 ) nmfs has developed a comprehensive strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the take reduction plans that have been implemented .
we recommend that the assistant administrator of nmfs develop a comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of each take reduction plan and implementing regulations , including , among other things , establishing appropriate goals and steps for comprehensively monitoring and analyzing rates of compliance with take reduction measures .
marine mammals – – such as whales , dolphins , and porpoises – – often swim or feed in waters where commercial fishing occurs and can become entangled in fishing gear , which may seriously injure or kill them – – this is referred to as “incidental take.” the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's ( noaa ) national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) estimates that commercial fishing operations result in thousands of such incidental takes each year .
