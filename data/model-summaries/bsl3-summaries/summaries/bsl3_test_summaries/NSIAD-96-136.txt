uoes is intended to ( 1 ) allow military users to influence the thaad system design , ( 2 ) permit an early operational assessment of the system's capabilities , and ( 3 ) provide a system that could be deployed in a national emergency .
the ballistic missile defense organization and the army plan to acquire a theater high altitude area defense ( thaad ) user operational evaluation system ( uoes ) â€” an early prototype version of the final thaad system .
we are addressing this report to the committees of jurisdiction because it identifies problems and calls for corrective action that the department of defense ( dod ) has indicated an unwillingness to take .
the congress may also wish to restrict obligational authority for acquiring uoes until the secretary of defense certifies that the system has adequate operational effectiveness to merit its deployment in a national emergency .
uoes will consist primarily of refurbished components acquired for the system's demonstration and validation phase , although the army plans to purchase 40 uoes interceptors to provide the deployable system capability .
in commenting on a draft of this report , dod disagreed with our recommendations , stating that thaad uoes will serve three functions in priority order: ( 1 ) providing soldiers an opportunity to influence the system's design ; ( 2 ) conducting early operational assessments of the system ; and ( 3 ) if directed by the national command authority , providing a theater commander in chief with a limited missile defense capability .
