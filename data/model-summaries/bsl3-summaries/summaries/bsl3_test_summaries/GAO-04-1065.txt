two broad groups of u.s. - flag carriers compete for these food aid shipments: 1. those that participate in the maritime security fleet ( msf ) ( generally liners that carry containers on scheduled routes ) and receive a $2.1 million annual subsidy from the federal government and 2. those that do not ( generally carriers of bulk and bagged cargo that operate on a charter basis ) .
food aid shipments must generally be transported on u.s. - flag ships under the requirements set by the cargo preference program .
to answer these questions , we gathered and analyzed food aid shipment data for fiscal years 1999 to 2003 from the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , the department of agriculture ( usda ) , and the maritime administration ( marad ) , as well as msf and cargo preference vessel data from marad and military contingency participation data from marad and the department of defense ( dod ) .
since no analysis had been conducted on the effects of such a change , the maritime security program was authorized without this provision , and we were directed to study the impact of placing a limitation on msf transportation of bagged food aid preference cargo .
