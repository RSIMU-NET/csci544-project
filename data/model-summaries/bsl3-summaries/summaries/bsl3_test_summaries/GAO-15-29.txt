the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) — a semiautonomous agency within the department of energy ( doe ) — is responsible for managing the nation's nuclear security missions .
this report examines: ( 1 ) the extent to which doe and nnsa cost estimating requirements and guidance for its projects and programs reflect best practices for developing and reviewing cost estimates , and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa project and program reviews identified weaknesses in cost estimates , and the extent to which any weaknesses can be attributed to not following cost estimating best practices .
these missions include maintaining the safety , security , and effectiveness of the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile and reducing the threat posed by nuclear proliferation .
revise doe requirements and guidance that apply to programs to ensure that program reviews are conducted periodically , including reviews of the life - cycle cost estimates for programs .
revise doe directives that apply to programs to require that doe and nnsa and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 cost estimating best practices , including developing life - cycle cost estimates for programs .
because doe does not require the use of most of the 12 cost estimating best practices for its projects and programs , it is unlikely that nnsa and its contractors will consistently develop reliable cost estimates .
