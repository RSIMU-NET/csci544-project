in his state of the union address on january 28 , 2003 , president george w. bush announced a new $720 million research and development ( r&d ) initiative to promote hydrogen as a transportation fuel .
the hydrogen fuel initiative is intended to complement the freedomcar initiative , which focuses on cooperative vehicle research between the federal government , universities , and private industry .
the freedomcar initiative replaced a related clinton administration initiative , the partnership for a new generation of vehicles ( pngv ) , announced in 1993 .
for fy2004 , however , overall funding for research ( within the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ) into hydrogen fuel , fuel cells , and vehicle technologies increased by about 30% .
through fy2003 , the overall level of funding for pngv - and freedomcar - related research at the department of energy ( doe ) remained relatively constant , with some of the funds for hybrid vehicles transferred to fuel cell research .
while both initiatives aimed to increase fuel efficiency of the automotive fleet , freedomcar extended the time frame by another 10 to 15 years and focused research on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ; pngv focused mainly on diesel - fueled hybrid vehicles .
