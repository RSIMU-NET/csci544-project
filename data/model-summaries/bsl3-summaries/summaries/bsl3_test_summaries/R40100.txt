there are three components of the problem of differentiated global carbon policies with respect to trade: ( 1 ) the lack of an international agreement with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gases ; ( 2 ) the issue of carbon leakage ; and ( 3 ) economic and competitive effects .
this report examines the dynamics of this issue in three parts: ( 1 ) exploration of the nature of the problem with respect to international climate change policy , potential environmental effects , and potential economic effects ; ( 2 ) identification of a range of possible options to address concerns ; ( 3 ) analysis of issues raised by the proposed mitigating approaches and options ; and ( 4 ) implications of the various approaches .
as the debate on reducing greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) has progressed , increasing concern has been raised about how a u.s. reduction program would interact with programs in other countries .
there are three basic approaches to assisting greenhouse - gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries: ( 1 ) assist domestic industry ; ( 2 ) penalize foreign competitors ; and ( 3 ) develop alternative sectoral approaches .
