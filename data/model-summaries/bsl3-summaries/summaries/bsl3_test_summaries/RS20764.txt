federal efforts to assist members of the armed forces date to 1864 , when president abraham lincoln issued an order to allow members of the military to return home to cast a ballot if they could not vote absentee according to the laws of their respective states .
some other states permitted an absent military voter to designate a proxy , who would cast a ballot , as directed , on the voter's behalf .
eighteen states , all in the north , permitted soldiers to vote absentee by establishing remote voting at military encampments where units were usually organized by state .
it is the only area of election administration law in which legislation has been enacted since passage of the help america vote act of 2002 ( p.l .
the first federal absentee voting law was the soldier voting act of 1942 ( p.l .
little progress occurred concerning absentee voting by members of the military in the following decades , despite an expansion of state absentee voting laws .
the law allowed members of the armed forces to vote for presidential electors and candidates for the u.s. senate and house , whether or not they were previously registered and regardless of poll tax requirements .
