senate report 105-52 , dated july 22 , 1997 , on the 1998 military construction appropriations bill requested the continuation of our annual review of the department of defense's ( dod ) base closure accounts and its budget request for base closure activities .
specifically , this report discusses opportunities for offsetting the budget request for fiscal year 1999 , including the validity of two proposed military construction ( milcon ) projects included in that request .
specifically , dod stated that ( 1 ) $35.7 million in unreported proceeds generated by brac activities is unavailable to offset fiscal year 1999 requirements because the proceeds have been or will be reprogrammed to cover unfunded requirements , ( 2 ) $54.8 million in unobligated balances is unavailable as an offset since it has already been earmarked for other unfunded requirements , ( 3 ) $40.6 million for two separate milcon projects is unavailable for offset because previously approved actions that were deferred until 1999 still need to be fully funded , and ( 4 ) reductions of this magnitude will eliminate the management flexibility envisioned by the congress and , adversely impact dod's ability to close installations and speed the economic recovery of affected communities .
