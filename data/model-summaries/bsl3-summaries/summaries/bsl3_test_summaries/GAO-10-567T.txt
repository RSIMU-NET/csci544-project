in particular , i will provide an update on the progress the bureau is making in addressing issues that prompted us to designate the 2010 census a high - risk area , including ( 1 ) the reliability of key it systems ; ( 2 ) a broad range of activities critical to an effective headcount , some of which were problematic in either earlier 2010 operations or in the 2000 census ; and ( 3 ) the quality of the bureau's cost estimates .
the broad range of activities i will discuss today include procedures for fingerprinting temporary employees ; the rollout of key marketing efforts aimed at improving the participation of hard - to - count populations and how american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) funds are being used as part of that effort ; the bureau's plans for mailing a second , follow - up questionnaire and the removal of late mail returns ; and the bureau's plans to enumerate people who are vulnerable to being missed by the census , including the homeless and those displaced by recent economic conditions and the hurricanes that slammed the gulf coast .
