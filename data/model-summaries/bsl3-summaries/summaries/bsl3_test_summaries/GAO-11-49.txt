fragmentation of care delivery can lead to poor quality of care , medical errors , inefficient delivery of services , higher costs , and patient dissatisfaction .
one way that hospitals , physicians , and other providers have addressed fragmentation is by forming integrated delivery systems ( ids ) to improve efficiency , quality , and access to care .
health care delivery in the united states has long been characterized by fragmentation at the national , state , and local levels .
the health care safety net act of 2008 directed gao to report on integrated health system models that integrate primary , specialty , and acute care and serve uninsured and medically underserved populations .
in this follow - on report , we provide more in - depth information on 1. organizational features that idss use to support strategies to improve 2. approaches idss use to facilitate access to care for underserved 3. challenges idss encounter in providing care , including care provided to underserved populations .
care is delivered by multiple providers , in multiple care settings , and often without systematic coordination and communication across providers and settings .
fragmentation can be especially burdensome for patients with chronic illnesses because of their ongoing care needs and for underserved populations — individuals who are uninsured or medically underserved — because of their financial and other challenges to accessing services .
