specifically , we ( 1 ) reviewed va's efforts to expedite vocational rehabilitation services to seriously injured servicemembers and ( 2 ) determined the status of an agreement between dod and va to share health data .
since the onset of operation enduring freedom ( oef ) in october 2001 and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) in march 2003 , the department of defense ( dod ) has reported that more than 12,000 servicemembers have been injured in combat .
to ensure the continuity of medical care as a first priority as well as to coordinate efforts to ensure access to all other va benefits , such as vocational rehabilitation , va formed its seamless transition task force in august 2003 .
one key problem has been the lack of systematic data from dod about who is seriously injured , the nature of their injuries , and where the servicemembers received treatment .
you asked us to testify on va's and dod's efforts to provide a seamless transition for seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers .
we recommended that va and dod collaborate to reach an agreement for va to have access to dod data for seriously injured servicemembers that both departments agree are needed to promote recovery and return to work and both departments concurred .
