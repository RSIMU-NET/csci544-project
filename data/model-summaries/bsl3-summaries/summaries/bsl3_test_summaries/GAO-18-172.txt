the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is responsible for securing the nation's transportation systems while facilitating the movement of passengers and commerce using security - related technologies .
this report addresses ( 1 ) the extent and purposes of tsa's use of otas and ( 2 ) how tsa ensures prices are reasonable and how it oversees otas .
otas entered into under this authority are generally not subject to certain federal laws and regulations related to federal contracts such as the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , allowing tsa to customize them to help meet project requirements and mission needs .
in response to these deficiencies , tsa has taken action to strengthen oversight and compliance with its policy .
in addition to the steps tsa has taken to improve ota oversight , such as revising its ota policy and increasing training requirements , tsa officials told us that they will continue to conduct quarterly compliance reviews and monthly data verification in accordance with their policy .
to address the extent to which tsa uses otas , we analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) on obligations through contracts and otas from fiscal year 2012 to 2016 .
