the u.s. electricity and natural gas industries' transition to competitive markets has not been smooth .
the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) — the federal agency primarily responsible for regulating and overseeing these industries — will play an important role in developing competitive wholesale markets and in protecting consumers against market abuses .
volatile prices , energy shortages , financial difficulties such as the bankruptcy of the enron corporation ( the nation's largest energy trading company before its financial problems ) , and accusations of price manipulation have raised questions about the transition to competitive markets and the federal government's ability to regulate and oversee these new markets to protect market participants and consumers .
in light of ferc's stated commitment to and your interest in market oversight , you asked us to assess ferc's progress in ( 1 ) establishing an oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets and ( 2 ) improving agencywide human capital management .
to strengthen ferc's human capital plan , we recommend that the chairman of ferc revise the agency's plan to ( 1 ) identify specific activities , resources , and time frames to implement the human capital initiatives and ( 2 ) provide results - oriented measures to track the agency's progress in implementing the initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness .
