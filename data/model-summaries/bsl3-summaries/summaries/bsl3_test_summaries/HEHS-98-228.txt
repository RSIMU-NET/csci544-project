to provide the public with information about the social security program , the congress enacted a law that requires the social security administration ( ssa ) to provide to individuals regular statements that estimate the benefits they may receive through the program .
in light of this proposal , you asked us to look at ( 1 ) the general implications of using a rate of return for social security and ( 2 ) the challenges of including this information on the pebes .
recently , in the course of the debate regarding how to restore long - term solvency for the social security program , legislation has been proposed that would require ssa to place on the pebes an individualized estimate of the rates of return workers receive on their contributions to the social security program .
the purpose of the proposal is , in part , to provide information that would enable workers to compare the current social security program with other investments , including alternatives being discussed in the reform debate .
in 1995 , ssa began sending personal earnings and benefit estimate statements ( pebes ) automatically to workers who had reached age 60 .
ensuring long - term solvency within the current program structure will require either increasing revenues or reducing expenditures , or some combination of both .
