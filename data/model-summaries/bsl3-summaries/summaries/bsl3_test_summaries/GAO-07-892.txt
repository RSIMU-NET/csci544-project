to ensure that comparable screening and monitoring services are available to all responders , we are recommending that the secretary of hhs expeditiously take two actions: ( 1 ) ensure that screening and monitoring services are available for federal responders and ( 2 ) ensure that screening and monitoring services are available for nonfederal responders residing outside of the nyc metropolitan area .
specifically , in this report we assess the status of ( 1 ) services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , ( 2 ) niosh's efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , and ( 3 ) niosh's awards to grantees for treatment services , as well as efforts to estimate the cost of serving responders .
tens of thousands of people served as responders in the aftermath of the world trade center ( wtc ) disaster , including new york city fire department ( fdny ) personnel , federal government personnel , and other government and private - sector workers and volunteers from new york and elsewhere .
more than 5 years after the destruction of the wtc buildings , concerns remain about the physical and mental health effects of the disaster , the long - term nature of some of these health effects , and the availability of health care services for those affected .
