title ix prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity , including intercollegiate athletics , at colleges and universities ( hereafter referred to simply as “colleges” ) receiving federal financial assistance .
specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the steps the department of education and ncaa have taken since 1992 to promote equity between men and women participating in intercollegiate athletics , ( 2 ) the steps states have taken to promote gender equity in athletic programs at colleges , and ( 3 ) what existing studies show about the progress made since 1992 in promoting gender equity in intercollegiate athletics .
this is a four - fold increase since enactment of title ix of the education amendments of 1972 .
but many have pointed to the gap that still remains in overall opportunity between men's and women's programs .
some have noted this increase as a move toward “gender equity” in athletics — that is , progress toward a fair distribution of athletic opportunity and resources between men's and women's athletic programs .
for example , in 1992 , the national collegiate athletic association ( ncaa ) reported that although the numbers of male and female undergraduates enrolled at college campuses in 1991 were roughly the same , women constituted about 30 percent of all student athletes at the time , and women's programs received about 23 percent of the athletic operating budgets .
