in june 2007 , exxonmobil corporation and conocophillips , two of the largest u.s. oil companies , abandoned their multi - billion dollar investments in the heavy oil deposits of the orinoco basin in venezuela .
this action followed the breakdown of negotiations between the companies and the government of president hugo chavez and petroleos de venezuela ( pdv ) , the venezuelan national oil company .
this report assesses the position of national oil companies , and how their evolving strength may affect the availability of supply in the oil market , and hence , oil security .
this amounted to approximately 10% of the company's total reserve holdings , and its production from venezuela amounted to 4% of its total crude oil production .
the report also examines the effects of national oil company expansion on the major private international oil companies as well as how these companies might differ in motivation and results .
on the venezuelan side , pdv expanded its reserve and production position , and its strength in the international oil market .
four other international oil companies , including total sa from france , statoil from norway , bp from great britain , and chevron from the united states , accepted agreements that raised the pdv share in their orinoco projects from approximately 40% to a controlling interest of about 78% .
