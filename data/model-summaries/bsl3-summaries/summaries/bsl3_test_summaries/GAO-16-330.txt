this report ( 1 ) examines what steps nrc and agreement states have taken since 2007 to ensure that radioactive materials licenses are granted only to legitimate organizations , and licensees can obtain materials only in quantities allowed by their licenses , and ( 2 ) presents the results of our covert vulnerability testing designed to test the effectiveness of these controls .
specifically , nrc stated that the agency would consider gao's recommendations as part of the working groups the agency has established to evaluate ( 1 ) including category 3 sources in wbl and nsts , ( 2 ) license verification transfer requirements for category 3 sources , and ( 3 ) enhancing security and safety measures as part of the prelicensing process .
in addition , we found that nrc had made progress toward implementing recommendations to ( 1 ) modify its process for issuing licenses to ensure that radioactive materials cannot be purchased by those with no legitimate need for them and ( 2 ) examine whether certain radioactive sources should be subject to more stringent regulations .
in 2008 , we found that nrc had worked with the agreement states and others to ( 1 ) identify sealed sources of greatest concern , ( 2 ) enhance requirements to secure radioactive sources , and ( 3 ) ensure that security requirements were implemented .
