 ( recommendation 9 ) .
the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( pkemra ) required the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) to establish advance contracts — those that are established prior to disasters and that are typically needed to quickly provide life - sustaining goods and services in the immediate aftermath of disasters .
fema and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) — components of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and the department of defense ( dod ) , respectively — used advance contracts to procure goods and services provided in response to the catastrophic disasters the united states experienced in 2017: hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria ; and the california wildfires .
these weaknesses were: ( 1 ) challenges in fema's acquisition planning ; ( 2 ) limited record keeping or management of certain fema contracts ; and ( 3 ) incomplete reporting on fema's advance contract actions to certain congressional committees .
this report specifically addresses the use of advance contracts , assessing the extent to which ( 1 ) fema and usace used advance contracts , ( 2 ) the planning , management , and reporting of selected fema and usace advance contracts met certain contracting requirements , and ( 3 ) fema and usace identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of these contracts .
