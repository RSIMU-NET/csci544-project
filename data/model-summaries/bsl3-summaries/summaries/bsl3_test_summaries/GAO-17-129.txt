this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing three research questions: ( 1 ) how child welfare and medicaid agencies in selected states work to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care ; ( 2 ) what is known about the results of their efforts , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the department of health and human services ( hhs ) helps states support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care .
to help states effectively address ongoing challenges related to ensuring the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care , the secretary of hhs should consider cost - effective ways to convene state child welfare , medicaid , and other stakeholders to promote collaboration and information sharing within and across states on psychotropic medication oversight .
