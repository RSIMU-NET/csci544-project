this sweeping piece of legislation was enacted just 10 months ago , but it has already produced major changes in the nation's approach to maritime security .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the implementation of the maritime transportation security act ( mtsa ) of 2002 .
our information is based on interviews with agency officials charged with implementing mtsa's provisions , as well as with officials and stakeholders from several ports .
mtsa called for actions in 46 key areas we identified , such as creating a maritime intelligence security system , assessing security conditions in port areas , creating and implementing a vessel tracking system , and creating identification systems for port workers and seafarers .
also , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is testing new identification cards for controlling access to secure transportation facilities , including vessels and port facilities .
we will be continuing our efforts to more fully evaluate a number of the issues i will address today , and we plan to issue a report when this work is complete .
the bureau of customs and border protection ( bcbp ) and the maritime administration ( marad ) , the two other agencies with the largest set of responsibilities under mtsa , also are making progress on major projects .
