thank you for the opportunity to appear today before the subcommittees to provide our perspective on the role of the u.s. export - import bank ( ex - im ) in promoting exports and achieving other u.s. policy goals .
as congress considers policies to achieve more robust growth in the u.s. economy , it must consider the full range of tools available to further growth and create new jobs for u.s. workers .
as the official export credit agency of the united states , ex - im has a key role in helping many u.s. firms achieve sales in foreign markets .
in addition to establishing ex - im's broad mandate of supporting u.s. employment through exports , congress has laid out specific , targeted goals for the bank in areas such as increasing financing for environmentally beneficial exports and expanding services to small and minority - owned businesses .
some of these tools are related to promoting exports , which can have broad benefits to the u.s. economy .
i will also describe progress ex - im has made in achieving the specific targets set by congress , as well as some challenges the bank faces in meeting those targets .
