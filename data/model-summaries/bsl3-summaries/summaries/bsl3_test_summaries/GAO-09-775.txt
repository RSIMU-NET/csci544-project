the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) have been working for over a decade on initiatives to share data between their health information systems .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , our objectives for this third report are to ( 1 ) evaluate the departments' progress and plans toward developing electronic health record systems or capabilities that allow for full interoperability and comply with applicable federal interoperability standards and ( 2 ) determine whether the interagency program office established by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 is positioned to function as a single point of accountability for developing and implementing electronic health records .
to evaluate the department of defense's ( dod ) and veterans affairs' ( va ) progress toward developing electronic health record systems or capabilities that allow for full interoperability of personal health care information , we reviewed our previous work on dod and va efforts to develop health information systems , interoperable health records , and interoperability standards to be implemented in federal health care programs .
to better improve management of dod's and va's efforts to achieve fully interoperable electronic health record systems , including satisfaction of the departments' interoperability objectives , we recommend that the secretaries of defense and veterans affairs direct the director of the dod / va interagency program office to establish a project plan and a complete and detailed integrated master schedule .
