specifically , my comments will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which db plans have invested in hedge funds and private equity , ( 2 ) challenges that such plans face in investing in hedge funds and private equity , ( 3 ) steps that plan sponsors can take to address these challenges , and ( 4 ) the implications of these challenges for plan sponsors and the federal government .
specifically , this project — being conducted for the ranking member of the subcommittee on health , employment , labor and pensions of the house committee on education and the workforce — seeks to assess the extent to which db plans have realized desired benefits from investing in hedge funds and private equity , and what actions they may have taken in response to lessons learned over the last 5 years .
much has happened in the financial markets since we issued three reports in 2008 — one that addressed defined benefit ( db ) pension plan investments in hedge funds and private equity , another that addressed federal oversight and other issues regarding hedge funds exclusively , and a third that addressed private equity funds .
