over the last decade , the congress , the office of management and budget ( omb ) , and executive agencies have worked to implement a statutory framework to improve the performance and accountability of the executive branch and to enhance executive branch and congressional decisionmaking .
the cornerstone of federal efforts to successfully meet current and emerging public demands is to adopt a results orientation ; that is , to develop a clear sense of the results an agency wants to achieve as opposed to the products and services ( outputs ) an agency produces and the processes used to produce them .
as agreed with the subcommittee , i will highlight how gpra can be used as a tool to assist the congress in oversight and decisionmaking and to help address the challenges facing the federal government in the 21st century .
my statement is based on our large body of work in recent years assessing gpra implementation and on strategic human capital management , as well as recent reports presenting the results of our survey of federal managers at 28 agencies and our analysis of human capital management discussions in agencies' fiscal year 2001 performance plans .
