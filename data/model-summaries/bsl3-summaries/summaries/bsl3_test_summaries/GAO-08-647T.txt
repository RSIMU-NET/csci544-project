specifically , i will ( 1 ) identify workforce challenges that va medical facilities experience related to va crnas , and ( 2 ) identify a key mechanism that va medical facilities have to help make va crna salaries competitive for recruitment and retention purposes and the extent to which va facilities use this mechanism .
to do the work for our december 2007 report , we analyzed web - based surveys we sent to all va chief anesthesiologists , va human resources ( hr ) officers , and va crnas , with survey response rates of 92 , 85 , and 76 percent , respectively .
given the increased demand for crnas and the important role they play in providing anesthesia services in va medical facilities , concerns have been raised about the challenges va may face in making va crna salaries competitive in order to maintain its va crna workforce , particularly in some local markets where the labor market for crnas can be highly competitive .
one such issue va faces is an increased demand for the services provided by certified registered nurse anesthetists ( crna ) , who provide the majority of anesthesia care veterans receive in medical facilities operated by va. crnas are registered nurses who have completed a 2- to 3-year master's degree program in nurse anesthesia and who typically provide anesthesia care in health care settings with anesthesiologists and surgeons .
