i appreciate the opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to discuss our report , which is being released today , on the actions that the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has taken towards integrating its various management processes , systems , and people , both within and across areas such as information technology , financial management , acquisition , and human capital , as well as in its administrative services .
subsequently , the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( 9 / 11 commission act ) required dhs to develop a strategy for management integration .
we also reviewed dhs's performance goals and measures for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 , and assessed these goals and measures against government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) requirements to determine the extent to which they provided a framework for assessing management integration across the department .
dhs could also improve the extent to which it is measuring its progress on management integration , and holding its management chiefs accountable for implementing management integration .
it is critically important that dhs work to unify and strengthen its management functions because the effectiveness of these functions will ultimately affect its ability to fulfill its various missions .
