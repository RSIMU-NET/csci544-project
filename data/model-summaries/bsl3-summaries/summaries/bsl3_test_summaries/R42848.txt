in a sharp reversal of its policy of denying the existence of a chemical weapons program , the syrian government agreed to destroy its chemical weapons stocks and joined the treaty banning the possession and use of these weapons , the chemical weapons convention ( cwc ) , on september 12 .
president obama had been seeking congressional authorization to use military force in response to a large - scale chemical weapons attack by syria , but on september 10 asked congressional leaders to postpone a vote in order to give the administration time to pursue a u.s. - russian diplomatic initiative to achieve chemical weapons disarmament in syria .
the target dates for implementation are completion of initial on - site inspections of syria's declared chemical weapons - related sites by november 2013 ; destruction of syrian chemical weapons production , mixing , and filling equipment by november 2013 ; and complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment in the first half of 2014 .
on september 14 , 2013 , secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov announced a proposed framework for elimination of syrian chemical weapons .
as a first step , the syrian government is required to declare all its stocks , munitions , precursor chemicals , and production and storage facilities to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) .
