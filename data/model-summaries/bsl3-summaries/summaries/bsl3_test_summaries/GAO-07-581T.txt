i am pleased to appear here today to discuss our assessment of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) may 2006 cost - benefit analysis used to support the purchase and deployment of next generation radiation portal monitors .
combating nuclear smuggling is one of our nation's key national security objectives and the deployment of radiation detection equipment including portal monitors at u.s. ports of entry , including border crossings and domestic seaports , is an integral part of this system .
dhs , through its domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) , is responsible for acquiring and supporting the deployment of radiation detection equipment , including portal monitors , within the united states .
the pacific northwest national laboratory ( pnnl ) , one of the department of energy's ( doe ) national laboratories , is under contract to manage the deployment of radiation detection equipment for dhs .
u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for screening cargo as it enters the nation at our borders , which includes operating radiation detection equipment to interdict dangerous nuclear and radiological materials .
in july 2006 , dhs awarded contracts to three vendors for developing the advanced spectroscopic portals' capabilities .
