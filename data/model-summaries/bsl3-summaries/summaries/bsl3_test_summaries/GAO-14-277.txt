to strengthen usaid's ability to help ensure that its food aid prepositioning program meets the goal of reducing delivery time frames in a cost - effective manner , we recommend that the usaid administrator take the following three steps to systematically 1. collect , and ensure the reliability and validity of , data on delivery time frames for all emergency food aid shipments , including prepositioned food aid shipments ; 2. monitor and assess data on delivery time frames for prepositioned food aid shipments ; and 3. monitor and assess costs associated with commodity procurement , shipping , and storage for prepositioned food aid shipments .
