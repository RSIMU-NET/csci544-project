my statement today is based on these reports and addresses ( 1 ) opportunities for dhs to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in its programs ; save tax dollars ; and enhance revenue , and ( 2 ) opportunities for dhs to strengthen its management functions .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on opportunities for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to eliminate fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in its programs ; enhance revenue ; and improve management functions at the department .
further , failure to effectively address dhs's management and mission risks could have serious consequences for u.s. national and economic security .
since beginning operations in 2003 , dhs has become the third - largest federal department , with more than 224,000 employees and an annual budget of about $60 billion .
over the past 10 years , dhs has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential .
dhs has implemented more than 60 percent of these recommendations and has actions under way to address others .
since 2003 , we have made approximately 1,800 recommendations to dhs across more than 1,300 reports and congressional testimonies designed to strengthen program management , performance - measurement efforts , and management processes , and enhance coordination and information sharing , among other things .
