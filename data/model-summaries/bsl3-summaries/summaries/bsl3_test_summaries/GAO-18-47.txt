with the president's decision to elevate cybercom to a unified combatant command , such actions will also help as dod continues to plan to support civil authorities in response to a cyber incident and where cybercom has a significant role .
generally , dod supports civil authorities through its defense support of civil authorities ( dsca ) mission .
the department of defense ( dod ) recognizes that a disruptive , manipulative , or destructive cyberattack could present a significant risk to u.s. economic and national security if lives are lost ; property , destroyed ; policy objectives , harmed ; or economic interests , affected and that the department must be prepared to support civil authorities in all domains â€” including in cyberspace .
