recent congressional interest in u.s. energy policy has focused in part on ways through which the united states could secure more economical and reliable petroleum resources both domestically and internationally .
canadian oil sands account for about 54% of canada's total crude oil production , and that number is expected to rise from its current level of 1.9 million barrels per day ( mbd ) in 2013 to 4.8 mbd by 2030 .
these impacts may include increased water and natural gas use , disturbance of mined land , effects on wildlife and water quality , trans - boundary air pollution , and emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghg ) during extraction and processing .
further , the infrastructure to produce , upgrade , refine , and transport the resource from canadian oil sands reserves to the united states is in place , and additional infrastructure projects — such as the keystone xl pipeline — have been proposed .
many forecasters identify petroleum products refined from canadian oil sands as one possible solution .
the u.s. department of state ( dos ) , in response to comments on the 2010 draft supplementary environmental impact statement ( 2010 draft eis ) for the keystone xl pipeline project ( which would connect oil sands production facilities in the western canadian sedimentary basin with refinery facilities in the united states ) , commissioned a contractor to analyze the life - cycle ghg emissions associated with these resources in comparison to other reference crudes .
