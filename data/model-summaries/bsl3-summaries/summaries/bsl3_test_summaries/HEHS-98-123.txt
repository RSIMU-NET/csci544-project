in 1997 , almost 900,000 children younger than 18 received about $5 billion in supplemental security income ( ssi ) benefits .
in february 1997 , the social security administration ( ssa ) published regulations to implement the new definition of disability for the ssi children's program set forth in the welfare reform law .
the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( p.l .
104-193 ) , commonly referred to as welfare reform , made eligibility for childhood ssi benefits more restrictive .
examples of such functional criteria include standards for assessing a child's social skills ; cognition and communication skills ; and the ability to concentrate , keep pace , and persist at tasks at hand .
the congress made the eligibility criteria for children to receive ssi more restrictive in order to help ensure that only needy children with severe disabilities are eligible for benefits .
ssa has made substantial progress in implementing the new childhood definition of disability through its rapid redetermination of most of these cases , its action to ensure that the redetermination process is fair , and its ongoing review of the implementation of the new regulations .
