this statement provides information on two of the objectives in our 2003 report: ( 1 ) whether the judiciary's quantitative case - related workload measures were reasonably accurate measures of district judge and courts of appeals judges' case - related workload ; and ( 2 ) the reasonableness of any proposed methodologies to update the workload measures .
our 2003 report was based on the results of our review of documentation provided by the federal judicial center ( fjc ) and the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aousc ) on the history and development of the case - related workload measures and interviews with officials in each organization .
if the conference determines that additional judgeships are needed , it transmits a request to congress identifying the number , type , ( courts of appeals , district court ) , and location of the judgeships it is requesting .
i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our work on case - related workload measures for district court and courts of appeals judges .
however , the judicial conference's analysis begins with the quantitative case - related workload measures it has adopted for the district courts and courts of appeals â€” weighted case filings and adjusted case filings , respectively .
