delegations from more than 190 countries and regions meet from november 28 to december 9 , 2011 , in durban , south africa , to continue discussions of how to address climate change under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) .
the year 2012 will mark both the 20 th anniversary of the opening for signature of the unfccc ( in rio de janeiro , 1992 ) and the end of the first "commitment period" ( 2008-2012 ) of the unfccc's subsidiary kyoto protocol .
the preceding 20 years have witnessed expanding evidence of many aspects of human - related , greenhouse gas ( ghg ) - induced climate change .
however , many questions regarding the magnitude , timing , and local characteristics of natural and human - induced climate change will likely persist for decades .
congress remains divided over the stance the united states should take in the international climate change negotiations .
the u.s. congress has taken up , but never enacted , legislation specifically addressing mitigation of u.s. ghg emissions , and has not fully funded requests by presidents clinton , ( george w. ) bush , or obama to support their pledges of financial support for deployment of low - emitting technology and other assistance to low - income countries .
