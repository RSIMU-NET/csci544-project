the same is true in most if not all of the states .
witnesses in a federal criminal case may find themselves arrested , held for bail , and in some cases imprisoned until they are called upon to testify .
in spite of the concerns of some that the authority can be used as a means to jail a suspect while authorities seek to discover probable cause sufficient to support a criminal accusation or as a preventive detention measure , the lower courts have denied that the federal material witness statute can be used as a substitute for a criminal arrest warrant .
particularly in the early stages of an investigation , however , an individual's proximity to a crime may make him both a legitimate witness and a legitimate suspect .
although subject to intermittent criticism , it has been so at least from the beginning of the republic .
the supreme court has never squarely considered the constitutionality of the federal statute or any of its predecessors , but it has observed in passing that , "[t]he duty to disclose knowledge of crime ... is so vital that one known to be innocent may be detained in the absence of bail , as a material witness" and that , "[t]he constitutionality of this [federal material witness] statute apparently has never been doubted. .
