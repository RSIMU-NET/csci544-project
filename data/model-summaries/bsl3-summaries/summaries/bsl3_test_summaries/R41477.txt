the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is the lead federal agency for increasing access to behavioral health services .
samhsa's two largest programs are the $1.8 billion substance abuse prevention and treatment ( sapt ) block grant and the $421 million community mental health services ( cmhs ) block grant , which account for more than 60% of the agency's budget in fy2010 .
possible reauthorization issues include increased performance measurement and accountability for samhsa grants , granting specific authority for the access to recovery program , improving the ability of communities to provide behavioral health services during disaster response , requiring collaboration between samhsa and other federal agencies , increasing samhsa's level of emphasis on primary prevention , increasing samhsa's role in expanding the number and diversity of the behavioral health provider workforce , and ensuring fairness of the formula used to distribute samhsa's block grants .
samhsa and most of its programs and activities are authorized under title v of the public health service act ( phsa ) .
authorizations of appropriations for most of samhsa's grant programs expired at the end of fy2003 , though many of them continue to receive funding .
