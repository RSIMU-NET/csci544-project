we reviewed reports , including those of the accountability review boards , the overseas presence advisory panel ( opap ) , and a state department - led interagency rightsizing committee,and we discussed overseas staffing issues with officials from the state department , other u.s. agencies operating overseas , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) , which is currently implementing the president's management initiative to rightsize u.s. embassies .
we identified three critical elements that should be evaluated together as part of this framework: ( 1 ) physical security and real estate , ( 2 ) mission priorities and requirements , and ( 3 ) operational costs .
to follow up on our november 2001 report on the executive branch's efforts in this area , you asked us to determine what rightsizing actions may be feasible to reduce costs and security vulnerabilities while retaining effectiveness in meeting foreign policy objectives .
for our purposes , we define rightsizing as aligning the number and location of staff assigned to u.s. embassies with foreign policy priorities and security and other constraints .
in response to opap's recommendations , in february 2000 , president clinton directed the secretary of state to lead an interagency effort to ( 1 ) develop a methodology for assessing embassy staffing , and ( 2 ) recommend adjustments , if necessary , to staffing levels at six pilot study embassies .
