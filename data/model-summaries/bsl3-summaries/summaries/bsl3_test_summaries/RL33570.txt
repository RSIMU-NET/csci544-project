over the past 15 years , the u.s. current account has moved from a small surplus to a deficit that in 2005 was nearly $800 billion .
therefore , the u.s. trade deficit and its consequences will continue to be legitimate matters of concern for economic policy makers .
the net accumulation of liabilities through 2005 is $2.7 trillion , which is equivalent to about 22% of u.s. gdp .
because a current account deficit is a reflection of a concurrent net inflow of borrowed funds from the rest of the world , the accumulation of debt from a long succession of large annual deficits has caused the united states to move from being a small net creditor to the rest of the world to being a large net debtor .
the current account deficit has increased also as a share of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , climbing from near zero to a record 6.2% in 2005 .
the size of this surplus has varied , hitting a low of $4 billion in 1998 and a high of $37 billion in 2003 , but over the past 25 years , the surplus has remained between $15 billion and $30 billion .
