currently , social security has two provisions in place that attempt to ensure these workers' noncovered employment is taken into consideration when calculating their social security benefits: ( 1 ) the government pension offset ( gpo ) , which affects spouse and survivor benefits , and ( 2 ) the windfall elimination provision ( wep ) , which affects retired worker benefits .
social security covers about 96 percent of all u.s. workers ; the vast majority of the remaining 4 percent who are not covered are public employees .
alternatively , as part of social security reform , others have proposed extending mandatory coverage to all state and local government employees who are not currently covered ; under mandatory coverage , the need for these provisions would be phased out over time .
to address concerns with how noncovered workers are treated compared with covered workers , social security has provisions in place to take noncovered employment into account when calculating social security benefits for public employees , but the provisions have been difficult to administer .
it has also been a source of confusion and frustration for the workers these provisions affect .
however , the social security administration ( ssa ) cannot effectively and fairly apply these provisions because it does not have access to complete and accurate information on noncovered earnings and receipt of noncovered pensions .
