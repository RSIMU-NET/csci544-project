the reliability of contract disbursing data is critical to the department of defense ( dod ) for ( 1 ) properly accounting for and accurately making contract payments , ( 2 ) effectively accounting for and controlling billions of dollars in budget authority , and ( 3 ) preparing reliable financial information on the results of operations to support management and congressional decision making on programs , operations , and budget requests .
for example , defense finance and accounting service ( dfas ) columbus fiscal year 1999 data showed that almost $1 of every $3 in contract payment transactions in the mechanization of contract administration services ( mocas ) system was for adjustments to previously recorded payments â€” $51 billion of adjustments out of $157 billion in transactions .
we have previously reported on dod's inability to accurately account for and report on disbursements , which is a long - term problem that is pervasive and complex in nature .
you asked that we determine ( 1 ) the magnitude of adjustments that affected previously recorded payments and dfas columbus's reported cost to make these adjustments during fiscal year 2002 , ( 2 ) why contracts , including payment instructions , were so complex , ( 3 ) the key factors that caused dfas columbus to make payment adjustments for the two contracts that we reviewed in detail , and ( 4 ) what steps dod has taken or planned to address the adjustment problem .
