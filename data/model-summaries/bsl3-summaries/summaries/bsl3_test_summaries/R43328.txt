medicaid plays a key role in covering long - term services and supports ( ltss ) to eligible aged and disabled individuals .
as the largest single payer of ltss in the united states , medicaid ltss spending in 2015 ( combined federal and state ) totaled $149.4 billion and accounted for 42.5% of all ltss expenditures ( $351.8 billion ) .
however , states have a range of options that allow ltss coverage of home and community - based services ( hcbs ) for medicaid beneficiaries based on need , and that allow states to target such coverage to particular groups of individuals ( i.e. , older adults and individuals with physical disabilities , or individuals with a specific disease or condition such as hiv / aids ) .
for example , the addition of the section 1915 ( c ) hcbs waiver to medicaid law in 1981 and subsequent statutory amendments that created new medicaid state plan benefit options have allowed states to further the provision of hcbs .
an estimated 4.1 million medicaid beneficiaries ( or 5.9% ) of the 68.5 million total enrolled medicaid population received ltss in fy2013 .
in 2015 , medicaid ltss accounted for 31% of all medicaid spending despite the fact that ltss recipients represent a relatively small share of the total medicaid population .
