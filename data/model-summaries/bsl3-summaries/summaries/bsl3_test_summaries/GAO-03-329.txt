the department of defense ( dod ) relies on a broad array of intelligence systems to study the battlefield and to identify and hit enemy targets .
these systems include reconnaissance aircraft , satellites , and ground - surface - based stations that receive , analyze , and disseminate intelligence data .
a key problem facing dod is the inability of these systems to operate effectively together for technical reasons ( such as incompatible data formats ) and / or operational reasons .
given the importance of the dcgs initiative to the war fighter , you asked us to assess ( 1 ) whether dod has adequately planned for these processing systems and ( 2 ) whether dod's process for testing and certifying the interoperability of the systems is working effectively .
moreover , dod is fielding new systems and new versions of old systems without following its own certification process .
this delay has hampered dod's ability to ensure interoperability in the systems now being developed and deployed .
to ensure that an effective distributed common ground - surface system is adequately planned and funded , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications , and intelligence to expand the planning efforts for dcgs to include a migration plan or road map that at a minimum lays out ( 1 ) current system capabilities and desired capabilities ; ( 2 ) specific initiatives , programs , projects and schedules to get dod and the services to their goal ; ( 3 ) measures to gauge success in implementing the migration plan as well as the enterprise architecture ; and ( 4 ) mechanisms for ensuring that the plan is followed .
