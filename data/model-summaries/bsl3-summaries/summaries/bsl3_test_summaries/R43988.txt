investor - state dispute settlement ( isds ) provisions in international investment agreements ( iia ) enable an aggrieved investor , with an investment located in the territory of a foreign host government , to bring a claim against that government for breach of an investment agreement before an international arbitration panel .
the primary forum for investment arbitration is the international centre for settlement of investment disputes ( icsid ) , which is affiliated with the world bank .
ongoing trade negotiations among the united states and several pacific rim countries regarding the proposed trans pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement — and between the united states and the european union with respect to the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) agreement — have rekindled debate over the value of including isds provisions in bits and trade agreements .
the centre was established by the 1965 convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states ( icsid convention ) .
the united states has negotiated a number of bilateral investment treaties ( bit ) and free trade agreements ( fta ) that contain isds arbitration procedures for resolving investors' claims that a host country has violated substantive obligations intended to protect foreign investors and investments from discriminatory , unfair , or arbitrary treatment by the host government .
