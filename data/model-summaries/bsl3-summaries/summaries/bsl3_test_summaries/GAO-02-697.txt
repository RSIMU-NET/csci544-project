the department of labor's unemployment insurance ( ui ) program paid about $30 billion in benefits in calendar year 2001 to workers who lost their jobs .
in light of the dramatic increase in the number of unemployed workers filing for ui benefits in the past year and the program's potential exposure to fraud and overpayments , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent and type of overpayments in the ui program , including those that may be attributable to fraud or abuse ; and ( 2 ) the factors that contribute to overpayments in the ui program , as well as actions taken by labor to ensure program integrity .
in recent years , reports from labor's office of inspector general ( oig ) and others have identified numerous aspects of the ui program that may be vulnerable to overpayments and fraud .
the health of each state's trust fund depends , in part , on the amount of taxes collected from employers ; current economic conditions , such as the level of unemployment ; and the ability of the state to control its benefit payments by accurately determining individuals' eligibility for ui benefits in a timely manner .
