on july 9 , 1997 , we briefed you , other members of your staff , and officials from the defense information systems agency ( disa ) on the results of our review to date of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to improve the defense integration support tools database ( dist ) .
during our review , we focused on determining the status of the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications and intelligence ( asd / c3i ) and disa's efforts to address data integrity and other problems associated with dist and whether these efforts will be completed in time to beneficially affect departmentwide and component year 2000 efforts .
dist serves as the dod inventory of automated information systems and is intended to be used as a tool to help dod components in correcting year 2000 date problems .
disa was included in our review because of its unique role in dod's information processing and the year 2000 process .
the issues we discussed in our briefing were part of the work we performed concurrent with our overall review of dod's year 2000 computer systems efforts for the chairman , senate committee on governmental affairs ; the chairman and ranking minority member , subcommittee on government management , information and technology , house committee on government reform and oversight ; and the honorable thomas m. davis , iii , house of representatives .
