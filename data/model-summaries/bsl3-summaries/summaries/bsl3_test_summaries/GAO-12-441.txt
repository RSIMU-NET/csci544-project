to assess the progress agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended proliferation security initiative ( psi ) policies and procedures , and issuing required annual reports , we reviewed the findings and recommendations in gao's 2006 and 2008 reports on psi and the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( the 9 / 11 act ) .
specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) the progress relevant agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended psi policies and procedures and issuing required annual reports ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which psi activities have enhanced and expanded u.s. counterproliferation efforts .
for almost 10 years , the united states has been actively participating in the proliferation security initiative ( psi ) to assist in u.s. efforts to break up black markets , detect and intercept weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) materials in transit , and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade .
the u.s. government issued the national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction in 2002 , and the proliferation of wmd , such as nuclear - or missile - related goods or technology , remains one of today's key challenges to international security .
