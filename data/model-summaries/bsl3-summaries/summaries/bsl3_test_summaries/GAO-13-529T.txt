my testimony is based on several previously published gao reports on stem education , including our january 2012 report entitled science , technology , engineering , and mathematics education: strategic planning needed to better manage overlapping programs across multiple agencies and also addresses actions taken by the administration to better plan and coordinate federal stem education programs since our 2012 report was issued.agencies and programs that provided funding for stem education programs in fiscal year 2010 ; ( 2 ) the extent to which these stem programs overlap ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which federal stem education programs have measured their effectiveness and were aligned to a governmentwide strategy .
we interviewed officials from the office of management and budget ( omb ) and ostp , and officials from other federal agencies that administer stem education programs .
in addition to the federal effort , state and local governments , universities and colleges , and the private sector have also developed programs that provide opportunities for students to pursue stem education and occupations .
these programs can serve an important role both by helping to prepare students for careers in stem fields and by enhancing the nation's global competitiveness .
