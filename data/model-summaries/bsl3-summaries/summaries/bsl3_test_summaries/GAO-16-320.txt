as with our prior reports , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with the requirements for registrations and reports filed under the lda ; ( 2 ) identify any challenges and potential improvements to compliance by lobbyists , lobbying firms , and registrants ; and ( 3 ) describe the resources and authorities available to the u.s. attorney's office for the district of columbia ( usao ) in its role in enforcing lda compliance and the efforts it has made to improve that enforcement .
hlgoa also increased civil penalties and added criminal penalties for failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements .
this methodology allows us to generalize some elements to the population of ld - 2 reports .
in addition , hloga requires us to annually audit the extent of lobbyists' compliance with the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended ( lda ) by reviewing publicly available lobbying registrations and other matters .
