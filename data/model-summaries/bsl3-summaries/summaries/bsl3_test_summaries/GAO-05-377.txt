the general mining act of 1872 encouraged development of the west by allowing individuals to stake claims and obtain exclusive rights to gold , silver , copper , and other valuable hardrock mineral deposits on land belonging to the united states .
specifically , we were asked to determine the ( 1 ) types , amount , and coverage of financial assurances operators currently use to guarantee reclamation costs ; ( 2 ) amount that financial assurance providers and others have paid to reclaim operations that had ceased and not been reclaimed since blm began requiring financial assurances and the estimated costs of completing reclamation for such operations ; and ( 3 ) reliability and sufficiency of blm's automated lr2000 information system for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations .
however , some operators did not reclaim blm land disturbed by hardrock operations related to exploration , mining , and mineral processing when their operations ceased .
because blm does not have an effective management process and critical management information , it has not ensured that some current and previous operators have adequate financial assurances , as required by federal regulations and / or blm guidance .
since then , thousands of operators have extracted billions of dollars worth of hardrock minerals from land now managed by the department of the interior's bureau of land management ( blm ) â€” the agency that manages the largest amount of federal land .
