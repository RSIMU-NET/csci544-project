through its investigative powers , congress gathers information it considers necessary to oversee the implementation of existing laws or to evaluate whether new laws are necessary .
the information that congress seeks , whether to inform itself for lawmaking purposes or to conduct oversight , often lies in the executive branch's possession .
this "power of inquiry" is essential to the legislative function and derives directly , though implicitly , from the constitution's vesting of legislative power in the congress .
the use or threatened use of these powers in a way that would impose burdens on an agency can encourage compliance with subpoenas ( or make it more likely that requested information will be provided without need to issue a subpoena ) and solidify congress's position when trying to negotiate a compromise during an investigative dispute with the executive branch .
when congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information , or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is considered inappropriate or unavailing , a subpoena — either for testimony or documents — may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands .
this process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands .
