subsequently , as requested , we have analyzed in greater detail two of the identified approaches: energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) and public / private partnerships ( partnerships ) .
however , in an era of limited resources and growing mission demands , congress has authorized agencies to use approaches other than full , up - front funding to finance capital acquisitions such as land improvement projects , buildings , and equipment .
finding a solution for this problem has been difficult .
this same problem arises for any asset that is acquired to meet long - term needs .
while leasing to meet long - term needs almost always results in excessive long - term costs to taxpayers and does not necessarily reflect the best approach to capital asset management , it also provides the government opportunities to spend more on other mission objectives .
in particular , we determined ( 1 ) what specific attributes of espcs and partnerships contributed to budget scoring decisions , ( 2 ) the costs of financing through espcs and partnerships compared to the costs of financing via timely , full , and up - front appropriations , and ( 3 ) how espcs and partnerships are implemented and monitored .
