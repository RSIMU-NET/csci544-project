on august 11 , 2006 , revised grazing regulations of the bureau of land management ( blm ) took effect ( 43 c.f.r .
congress also has examined the development of the 2006 regulatory changes and related policy options through committee oversight .
among the changes made in 1995 , many of which were reexamined by blm during the development of the 2006 regulatory changes , are those that: separated grazing preference from permitted use , so that a permittee's preference for receiving a grazing permit was not tied to a specific amount of grazing based on historic levels ( described as animal unit months , or aums ) ; allowed permittees up to three years of nonuse of their permits ; authorized suspending or canceling a permit if a permittee is convicted of violating certain state or federal environmental laws ; eliminated the express requirement that a permittee be engaged in the livestock business ; replaced the term affected interest with interested public ; allowed conservation use for the term of a grazing permit , thereby excluding livestock grazing from all or a portion of an allotment ; required title of permanent structural improvements to be held in the name of the united states ; required that water rights for livestock grazing be held in the name of the united states , to the extent allowed by state law ; imposed a surcharge on a permittee who allows livestock not owned by the permittee or the permittee's children to graze on public land ; eliminated grazing advisory boards and replaced them with the broader interest resource advisory councils ; and adopted rangeland management standards called fundamentals of rangeland health .
