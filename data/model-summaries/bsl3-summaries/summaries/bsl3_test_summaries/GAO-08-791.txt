this report examines the factors that will affect the impact of recent legislation applying u.s. immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) on the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi's ( 1 ) labor market , including foreign workers ; ( 2 ) tourism sector ; and ( 3 ) foreign investment .
the united states recently enacted legislation applying u.s. immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) , ending decades of the cnmi's control over its own immigration system .
we were asked to examine factors that will affect the impact of the recent legislation's implementation on the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi's ( 1 ) labor market , including foreign workers ; ( 2 ) tourism sector ; and ( 3 ) foreign investment .
because current data gaps limit federal agencies' ability to make key implementation decisions to best meet the goals of the legislation , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of labor take the following two actions: develop a strategy for obtaining critical data on the cnmi labor market that are not currently available on an ongoing basis , such as data on the wages , occupations , and employment status of cnmi residents and foreign workers ; and develop a strategy for obtaining critical data on cnmi foreign investment , such as overall levels of foreign investment and the investment amounts associated with various types of foreign investor entry permits .
