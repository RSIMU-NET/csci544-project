to identify practices that could be adopted by federal agencies and others to ( 1 ) promote successful sharing of information on computer - based vulnerabilities and incidents and ( 2 ) overcome related challenges , we studied 11 organizations experienced in developing pertinent information - sharing relationships and procedures .
our specific objectives were to identify ( 1 ) critical success factors in building information - sharing relationships and ( 2 ) related challenges and how to address them .
these factors included ( 1 ) fostering trust and respect ; ( 2 ) establishing effective , timely , and appropriately secure communication ; ( 3 ) obtaining top management support ; ( 4 ) ensuring organization leadership continuity ; and ( 5 ) generating clearly identifiable membership benefits .
information sharing and coordination are key elements in developing comprehensive and practical approaches to defending against computer - based , or cyber , attacks , which could threaten the national welfare .
accordingly , the federal government's strategy for protecting the nation's critical computer - dependent infrastructure sectors includes efforts to establish information sharing and analysis centers ( isacs ) within both the federal government and individual industry sectors .
