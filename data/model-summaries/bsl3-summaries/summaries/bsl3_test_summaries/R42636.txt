issues related to the compensation of federal employees often center on the pay differential between federal workers and their private sector counterparts .
the increased interest has been driven at least in part by the federal fiscal situation and in part by the state of the economy since the recession began in 2007 .
for years , the annual president's pay agent ( ppa ) study , which is covered in greater detail later in this report , has shown a large wage penalty for federal workers compared to private sector workers in similar occupations .
in recent years , there has been significant congressional interest in compensation of the federal workforce .
these studies and accompanying reporting on the comparison of compensation of federal workers to private sector workers provide an indication of the disparate findings , which makes it difficult to determine how compensation of federal employees actually compares to that of workers in the private sector .
there have been several attempts in recent years to address the issue of compensation between the federal workforce and the private - sector workforce .
any modeling of the relationship between the compensation of federal and private sector workers involves making assumptions , which in turn influence the results .
