in january 2003 , we designated the implementation and transformation of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) as high - risk due to the size and complexity of the effort , the existing challenges faced by the components being merged into the department , and the potentially serious consequences should dhs fail to effectively carry out its mission .
dhs , which is expected to have some of the most extensive acquisition requirements in government , is currently in the process of integrating the mission functions and acquisition practices of 23 incoming entities .
the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) is one of the largest agencies coming under the new department , with a budget of $6.1 billion and contracts for goods and services valued at $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2002 .
dhs officials are currently assessing the incoming agencies' ( 1 ) major procurements to determine whether duplication exists and to identify ways of maximizing the dhs's purchasing power by consolidating like procurements where feasible ; ( 2 ) procurement and financial systems to determine whether any of the existing systems are adequate to meet the department's future needs ; and ( 3 ) acquisition workforce to identify gaps and the need for dhs - specific training requirements .
