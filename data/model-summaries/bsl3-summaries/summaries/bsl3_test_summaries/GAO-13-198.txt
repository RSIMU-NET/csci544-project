the coast guard authorization act of 2010 required that that the transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) reader pilot report include ( 1 ) the findings of the pilot program with respect to key technical and operational aspects of implementing twic technologies in the maritime sector ; ( 2 ) a comprehensive listing of the extent to which established metrics were achieved during the pilot program ; and ( 3 ) an analysis of the viability of those technologies for use in the maritime environment , including any challenges to implementing those technologies and strategies for mitigating identified challenges .
given dhs's challenges in implementing twic over the past decade , at a minimum , the assessment should include a comprehensive comparison of alternative credentialing approaches , which might include a more decentralized approach , for achieving twic program goals .
ports , waterways , and vessels handle billions of dollars in cargo annually , and an attack on our nation's maritime transportation system could have serious consequences .
over $23 million had been made available to pilot participants from two federal emergency management agency ( fema ) grant programs â€” the port security grant program and the transit security grant program .
