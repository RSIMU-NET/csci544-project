the department of defense ( dod ) uses contractors to meet many of its logistical and operational support needs during combat operations and peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance missions .
our reporting objectives are to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which costs for selected contracts supporting contingency operations increased and the factors causing the increases , ( 2 ) the extent to which dod provided oversight for selected contracts that support contingency operations , and ( 3 ) the reasons for the department's use of contractors to support contingency operations for the contracts we reviewed , as well as other contracts .
to conduct our work , we selected and conducted a case study review of a nonprobability sample of 7 department of defense ( dod ) contracts for services that support deployed forces .
according to dod , the scale and duration of global war on terrorism operations have required a significant increase in contractor support and in deployment of contractor personnel to areas such as iraq and afghanistan .
these criteria included: the contract supported deployed forces ; operations and maintenance ( o&m ) funds were used to pay for the contract services ; the principal place of performance was within central command's area of operation ; the contract was to maintain a weapons system ( s ) and / or provide support ; the contract was still in effect ; and the contractor was u.s. based .
