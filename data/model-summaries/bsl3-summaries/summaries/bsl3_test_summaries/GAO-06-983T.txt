i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to resolve long - standing problems in supply chain management .
dod maintains a military force with unparalleled logistics capabilities and can claim success in meeting the challenges to supplying the warfighter .
for example , by early 2005 , dod moved more than 2 million short tons of cargo , including equipment , spare parts , and supplies , several thousand miles to the persian gulf in support of operation iraqi freedom .
as requested , my comments today will focus on dod's progress in ( 1 ) implementing the supply chain management improvement plan and ( 2 ) incorporating performance measures for tracking and demonstrating improvement .
over the next 6 years , dod also plans to invest about $54 billion in aircraft , trucks , ships , and other mobility assets to deploy and supply its forces .
the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics , as well as other senior dod officials , has shown a commitment to improving supply chain management .
at the same time , there are pervasive , decades - old problems in dod's supply chain management that need to be addressed and resolved .
