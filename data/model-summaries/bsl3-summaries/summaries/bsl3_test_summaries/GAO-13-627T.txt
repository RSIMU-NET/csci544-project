as federal agencies have modernized their information technology ( it ) operations , put more of their services online , and increased their information security profiles , their need for computing power and data storage resources has resulted in a dramatic increase in the federal data centers and a corresponding increase in operational costs .
in response , the office of management and budget's ( omb ) federal chief information officer ( cio ) launched the federal data center consolidation initiative ( fdcci ) in 2010 .
for example , in july 2012 , we reported on the progress the 24 participating federal departments and agenciesmaking on this initiative and found that , while progress had been made , nearly all of the agencies had not yet completed a data center inventory or the consolidation plans needed to implement their consolidation initiatives .
were you asked us to testify on our report being released today that evaluated agencies' reported progress against omb's planned consolidation and cost savings goals and assessed the extent to which the oversight organizations put in place by omb for fdcci are adequately performing oversight of agencies' efforts to meet these goals .
