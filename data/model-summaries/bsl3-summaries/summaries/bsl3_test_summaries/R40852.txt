the supreme court in skilling v. united states held that the honest services class of mail and wire fraud offenses proscribes only bribery and kickbacks .
for the purpose of mail and wire fraud prosecutions , federal jurisdiction is triggered when a person utilizes the federal postal service or an interstate carrier or sends a wire or radio communication .
in doing so , the court took the middle ground between those who had urged that the definition be found unconstitutionally vague and those who favored sweeping and severe condemnation of public and private corruption .
perhaps in part to address the disagreement among the courts of appeals , the supreme court granted writs of certiorari in three cases , weyhrauch v. united states , black v. united states , and skilling v. united states .
section 1346 , in 1988 to incorporate within the ambit of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes schemes infringing on a victim's right to an official's or employee's "honest services" ( i.e. , an employee's honest work on behalf of a company or an official's honest public service ) .
although it is generally agreed that congress has the authority to regulate the federal mail system and interstate wire communications , the sparse text and potential breadth of the honest services statute have prompted concerns regarding its constitutionality .
