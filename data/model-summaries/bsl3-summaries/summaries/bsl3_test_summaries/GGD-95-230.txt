our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess the extent to which flows of money into mutual funds were affecting the amount of deposits at banks and ( 2 ) determine what impact such flows might have on the availability of finance for the economy as a whole and for residential , consumer , and business borrowers .
this letter responds to the committee's request that we examine whether the movement of funds from bank deposits into mutual funds affects the availability of credit for residential , consumer , or commercial purposes .
in addition , we did a literature search for research articles examining ( 1 ) how residential , consumer , and business borrowers obtain financing , not only from bank loans or securities issuance but also from other sources and ( 2 ) how lenders , including banks as well as nonbank providers such as finance companies , funded the financing they provided and whether they sold or securitized their finance .
in addition , the relative importance of bank loans has been further diminished by the increased provision of direct loans by nonbank financial intermediaries , including securities firms , insurance companies , and finance companies .
