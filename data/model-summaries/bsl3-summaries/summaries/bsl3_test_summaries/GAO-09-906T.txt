specifically , i will focus on ( 1 ) the progress the forest service and the interior agencies have made in managing wildland fire and ( 2 ) key actions we previously recommended and believe are still necessary to improve the agencies' management of wildland fire .
growing recognition of the long - term fiscal challenges facing the nation has also led congress , the agencies , and others to focus on ensuring that federal wildland fire activities are appropriate and carried out in a cost - effective manner .
it also prompted a sustained effort , known as the national fire plan , on the part of federal agencies and congress to improve fire suppression capabilities , reduce fuels , restore fire - adapted ecosystems , and help communities better withstand wildland fire .
such data are critical to helping the agencies ( 1 ) identify the extent , severity , and location of wildland fire threats to the nation's communities and resources ; ( 2 ) predict fire intensity and rate of spread under particular weather conditions ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the effect that reducing fuels may have on future fire behavior .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss wildland fire management by the federal wildland fire agencies — the forest service within the department of agriculture and four agencies within the department of the interior — including key actions that we believe the agencies should take to improve their management of wildland fires and help contain the rising costs of preparing for and responding to fires .
