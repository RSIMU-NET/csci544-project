the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) is charged with reducing illicit drug use , manufacturing and trafficking , drug - related crime and violence , and drug - related health consequences .
among these approaches is an effort to reduce and prevent drug use among america's youth by conducting educational and community action programs , including a national youth anti - drug media campaign .
the campaign combines paid and donated advertising with public communications outreach in an effort to change teen and parental beliefs and behaviors regarding drug use .
to achieve these goals , the office formulates a national drug control strategy that includes multipronged approaches to combating national drug use .
since then , over $1 billion has been appropriated for the media campaign .
as such , the report expressed concern about the amount of resources consumed by consultants and the extent to which funds were spent for consulting services rather than media time and space for advertisements .
this report focuses on the following question: what services did contractors and their subcontractors provide in support of ondcp's media campaign and what were the estimated award amounts for these services for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 ? .
