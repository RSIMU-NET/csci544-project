to obtain more information about the quality of national data on child fatalities and near fatalities from maltreatment , the chairman , house ways and means committee , asked us to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which hhs collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment , ( 2 ) the challenges states face in collecting and reporting information on child fatalities from maltreatment to hhs , and ( 3 ) the assistance hhs provides to states in collecting and reporting data on child fatalities from maltreatment .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is the principal federal agency that provides oversight of state child welfare systems , which are intended , in part , to protect children who have been maltreated and help prevent maltreatment .
estimate the costs and benefits of collecting national data on near fatalities and take appropriate follow - up actions .
according to estimates by the national child abuse and neglect data system ( ncands ) , 1,770 children in the united states died from physical abuse or other forms of maltreatment in fiscal year 2009 .
to better understand the scope of child maltreatment , including child fatalities , and inform efforts to address and prevent it , the 1988 amendments to the child abuse prevention and treatment act ( capta ) required hhs to establish a national data collection and analysis program for child maltreatment data .
