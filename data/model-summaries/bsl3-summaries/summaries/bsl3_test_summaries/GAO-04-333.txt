in 2001 , hhs — through its administration for children and families' ( acf ) children's bureau — began implementing a new federal review system , known as the child and family services reviews ( cfsr ) , to hold states accountable for improving child welfare outcomes .
in addition , the federal department of health and human services ( hhs ) monitors states' compliance with key federal goals , specified in part by the adoption and safe families act ( asfa ) of 1997 , to keep children safe and ensure their placement in stable and permanent homes .
to better understand the cfsr process , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) acf's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; ( 2 ) acf's and the states' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in their pips ; and ( 3 ) additional efforts , if any , that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to help ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety , permanency , and well - being for children .
the objectives of our study were to report on ( 1 ) acf's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; ( 2 ) acf's and the states' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in the pip ; and ( 3 ) additional efforts that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety , permanency , and well - being .
