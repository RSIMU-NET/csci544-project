postal service ( usps ) was unable to make its statutorily required payments of $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 and $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 to prefund retiree health benefits .
this report ( 1 ) describes the status and financial outlook of the postal service retiree health benefits fund , ( 2 ) analyzes how alternative approaches for funding retiree health benefits could affect future usps payments and unfunded liabilities , and ( 3 ) determines key considerations for policymakers assessing the alternative approaches .
usps has also proposed withdrawing from the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) and administering its own health care plan for its employees and retirees .
implementing strategies and options to better align costs with revenues may better enable usps to be in a financial position to prefund its retiree health benefit liability for its over one million active and retired postal employees and their beneficiaries .
the act required annual payments ( ranging from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion per year ) from fiscal years 2007 through 2016 to be deposited into a new fund established in the u.s. treasury and administered by the office of personnel management ( opm ) called the postal service retiree health benefits fund ( psrhbf ) .
