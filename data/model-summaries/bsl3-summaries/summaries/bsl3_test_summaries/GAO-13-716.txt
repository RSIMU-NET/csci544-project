to ensure a stable future supply of lithium - 7 , we recommend that the secretary of energy direct the isotope program , consistent with the program's mission to manage isotopes in short supply , to take on the stewardship role by fully assessing supply risks ; communicating risks , as needed , to stakeholders ; ensuring risks are appropriately managed ; and fully and accurately determining domestic demand .
this report examines ( 1 ) what is known about the supply and domestic demand for lithium - 7 ; ( 2 ) the responsibilities of doe , nrc , and other entities in assessing risks to the lithium - 7 supply , and what , if anything , has been done to mitigate a potential supply disruption of lithium - 7 ; and ( 3 ) additional options , if any , identified by government officials and industry representatives for mitigating a potential lithium - 7 shortage .
this leaves the reactors that depend on lithium - 7 vulnerable to supply disruptions that , if not addressed , could lead to their shutdown .
doe has studied lithium - 7 supply and demand to guide its decisions related to lithium - 7 .
