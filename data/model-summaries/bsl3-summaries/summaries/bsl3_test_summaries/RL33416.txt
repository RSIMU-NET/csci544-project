as the economy of the people's republic of china ( prc ) has boomed in the past decade , raising living standards for many of its citizens , incidents of social protest also have risen dramatically .
economic development has brought about or exacerbated a host of economic , social , and political problems , including income inequality , environmental pollution , official corruption , and ambiguous property rights , which in turn have fueled grievances .
in the medium term , ongoing u.s. efforts to promote civil society and the rule of law in the prc could help people and institutions in china to develop legal understanding and procedures for expressing and resolving social grievances .
social unrest in china affects ongoing u.s. policies promoting human rights and democracy in china and broader considerations about engagement with the prc .
in the longer run , social unrest may adversely affect the business climate for foreign investment , the pace of economic reforms ( including compliance with wto commitments ) , political stability in the prc , and chinese foreign policy .
in the short run , social unrest raises many human rights concerns toward china among many u.s. policy - makers .
