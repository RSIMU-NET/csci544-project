in addition , the next administration should focus its attention on: ( 1 ) adopting a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing governmentwide performance ; ( 2 ) improving the relevance of performance information to congress ; and ( 3 ) building agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making .
you asked us to discuss: ( 1 ) the trends in federal managers' reported use of performance information governmentwide and at the agency level as identified through four surveys we conducted over the past 10 years ; ( 2 ) how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to improve federal program management ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned to be considered by the next congress and administration for future performance improvement initiatives .
first , the next administration should promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the last decade to ensure that the performance information gathered is used in making management decisions: ( 1 ) demonstrating leadership commitment to results - oriented management ; ( 2 ) developing a clear “line of sight” linking individual performance with organizational results ; and ( 3 ) building agency capacity to collect and use performance information .
