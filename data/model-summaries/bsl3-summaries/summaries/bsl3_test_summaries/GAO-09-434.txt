these challenges include ( 1 ) improving agencywide management , ( 2 ) transforming epa's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals , ( 3 ) improving implementation of the clean air act , ( 4 ) reducing pollution in the nation's waters , ( 5 ) speeding the pace of cleanup at superfund and other hazardous waste sites , and ( 6 ) addressing emerging climate change issues .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) operates in a highly complex and controversial regulatory arena , and its policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy , society , and government .
specifically , we found that epa has not ( 1 ) identified the causes of poorly performing state enforcement programs , ( 2 ) informed the public about how well the states are implementing their enforcement responsibilities , and ( 3 ) assessed the performance of epa's regional offices in carrying out their state oversight responsibilities â€” performance that has been inconsistent over the years .
epa has generally concurred with our recommendations , but has been slow to implement some of them .
epa has also been slow to improve long - standing problems in its enforcement data , which , among other things , hampers its ability to accurately determine the universe and characteristics of entities needing regulation to ensure that ( 1 ) the public is afforded equal protection under environmental laws and ( 2 ) regulated parties , taxpayers , and ratepayers are not subjected to widely varying costs of environmental compliance among regions .
