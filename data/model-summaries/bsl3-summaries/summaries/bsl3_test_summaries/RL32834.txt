the 109th congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of temporaryassistance for needy families ( tanf ) for five years .
the 108th congress and its predecessor , the107th congress , both inconclusively debated a long - term authorization for tanf and relatedprograms .
that bill was approved by the house ways and means committee's subcommittee on humanresources on march 15 , and awaits full committee action , as well as consideration by othercommittees that have jurisdictions over parts of the bill .
240 , introduced by house republican leaders and making its waythrough house committees of jurisdiction , is similar to bills that passed the house in 2002 and 2003 .
the program has received 11 short - term extensions since the original funding authorityfor tanf expired on september 30 , 2002 .
the senate finance committee has reported an original bill , s. 667 ( s.rept.109-51 ) .
s. 667would add $6 billion over five years to current levels of mandatory child care funding .
it does not address non - tanf provisionsof both bills , such as revisions to the child care and development fund , child supportenforcement , abstinence education , and transitional medicaid .
