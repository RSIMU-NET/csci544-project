the logan act , designed to cover relations between private citizens of the united states and foreign governments , has prompted much controversy as to its scope and effect in its more than 200 years .
as amended , the act states: any citizen of the united states , wherever he may be , who , without authority of the united states , directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof , in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states , or to defeat the measures of the united states , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years , or both .
because the united states had not assisted the french revolutionaries to their satisfaction and because the united states had ratified the jay treaty with great britain , the french government authorized plunderings of american merchant ships .
described as either a "paper dragon or sleeping giant" by one commentator , proclaimed to be possibly unconstitutional by others , it represents a combination of legal and policy factors in both domestic and international concerns .
