radio frequency spectrum is used for all forms of wireless communications , including cellular telephony , paging , personal communications service , radio and television broadcast , telephone radio relay , aeronautical and maritime radio navigation , and satellite command and control .
spectrum policy covers both satellite and terrestrial transmissions .
some observers argue that a fully - developed policy should take into account issues such as international competitiveness , the communications needs of public safety agencies and the military , the role of wireless technology in economic growth , and the encouragement of new technologies that make spectrum use more efficient and more beneficial to society as a whole .
the federal communications commission ( fcc ) is responsible for overseeing licensed and unlicensed spectrum used for commercial purposes and by state and local agencies , including first responders , as well as most other radio frequencies not assigned for federal use .
for the immediate future , congress may choose to debate and act on questions such as reforming spectrum management and allocation mechanisms .
radio frequency spectrum is managed primarily by regulations that set rules , for example , for permissible uses , certification of devices , requirements for public safety , and the acquisition of licenses .
