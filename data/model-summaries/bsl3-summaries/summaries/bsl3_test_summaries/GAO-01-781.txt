specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the number , status , and reasons for park service visitor center projects ; whether these projects involved new construction or renovation of existing facilities ; and whether these projects were identified as priorities by the park service or by the congress ; ( 2 ) the costs of the visitor center projects and the functions included in those projects ; and ( 3 ) the sources of funding for the projects .
the national park service manages and maintains thousands of facilities to provide nearly 300 million visitors a year a safe and enjoyable visit to the nation's parks and monuments .
one of the most important of these facilities is the visitor center , which serves as a focal point for visitors to learn about a park and offers a variety of services , including such basic services as orientation and information , exhibits and interpretation , publication sales , and restrooms .
most of the park service's 384 parks have a visitor center , but as existing visitor center buildings age and new parks are added to the system , new or renovated visitor centers are needed .
