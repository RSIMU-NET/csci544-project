the department of defense maintains a supply of spare and repair parts in order to keep its equipment operational for war - and peace - time missions .
to identify changes in the department of defense's ( dod ) on - hand and on - order inventories for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 , we used data developed in prior reviews and inventory stratification reports .
in response to your request , this report ( 1 ) provides information on changes in and make up of the department's inventory and ( 2 ) analyzes changes in inventory requirements , with a focus on causes of requirements changes derived from a sample of navy inventory items .
while the services are implementing management changes that will reduce the size of dod's inventory , long - standing and systemic inventory management problems continue to exist .
the management of this inventory is especially critical as the department and the services are called upon for new missions relating to combating terrorism worldwide and protecting the homeland .
such changes in missions can lead to changes in inventory requirements , which , in turn , determine the size of the inventory .
