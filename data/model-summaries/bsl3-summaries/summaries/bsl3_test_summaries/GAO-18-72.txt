to address the objectives , we selected four agencies with responsibility for assessing their own facilities â€” dhs's u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) ; the department of transportation's federal aviation administration ( faa ) ; and the united states department of agriculture's ( usda ) agricultural research service ( ars ) and forest service .
to help federal agencies protect and assess risks to their facilities , the interagency security committee ( isc ) , an organization chaired by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , developed physical security standards for non - military federal facilities in the united states .
this report examines: ( 1 ) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the interagency security committee's ( isc ) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and ( 2 ) what management challenges , if any , selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results .
