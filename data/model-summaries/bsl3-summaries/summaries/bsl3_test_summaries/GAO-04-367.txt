our work focused on the initial implementation efforts of the following seven departments and the agencies within those departments that have the most developed competitive sourcing programs: agriculture ; defense ; education ; health and human services ( hhs ) ; the interior ; the treasury ; and veterans affairs ( va ) .
therefore , after discussions with your staff , we agreed to ( 1 ) describe the progress agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program in response to the president's management agenda , ( 2 ) identify major challenges agencies are facing , and ( 3 ) identify strategies they are using to select activities for competition based on mission - related needs .
but the use of public - private competition represents a major management change for agencies and has raised concerns about the fairness of the process and the potential impact on federal jobs .
the environment in which the federal government currently operates — with new security threats , demographic changes , rapidly evolving technologies , increased pressure for results , and growing fiscal imbalances — demands that agencies engage in a fundamental review of how they accomplish their missions .
