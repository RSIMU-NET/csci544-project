in our prior work , we identified concerns associated with bia management of energy resources and categorized them into five broad areas: ( 1 ) oversight of bia activities ; ( 2 ) collaboration and communication ; ( 3 ) bia workforce planning ; ( 4 ) technology ; and ( 5 ) bia's data .
in addition , we have found numerous challenges facing interior's bureau of indian education ( bie ) and bia and the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) indian health services ( ihs ) in administering education and health care services , which put the health and safety of american indians served by these programs at risk .
we are adding this high - risk area in response to serious and long - standing problems in federal management of indian energy resources and administration of indian education and health care programs , which are highlighted in several of our prior reports , along with reports and testimony from inspectors general , tribal nations , special commissions , and others .
to conduct our prior work , we reviewed relevant laws , regulations , and policies ; reviewed and analyzed federal data ; and interviewed tribal , federal , and industry officials , among others .
