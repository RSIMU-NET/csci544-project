congress created the commission and authorized the guidelines in the sentencing reform act of 1984 .
once binding on federal courts , the guidelines are now the starting point for federal sentencing in most cases .
the first guidelines were promulgated with an effective date of november 1 , 1987 .
they provide the principal standard against which the reasonableness of any sentence imposed is judged .
in the last quarter of fy2014 , over 75% of the sentences imposed by federal courts fell within the sentence ranges recommended by the guidelines or within those ranges but reduced by prosecution endorsed departures recommended in the guidelines .
the federal sentencing guidelines greatly influence the sentences imposed for federal crimes .
the commission may promulgate amendments which become effective 180 days after they are presented to congress , absent congressional action .
the guidelines are the work of the u.s .
sentencing under the guidelines is essentially a score - keeping exercise , not unlike the procedure for filling out a federal income tax return .
the sentencing ranges for any term of imprisonment depend both on the final offense level and upon the offender's criminal history score calculated on the basis of his past criminal record and divided into categories .
