the secretary of energy should direct the office of nuclear energy to reassess its decision to engage in discussions with potential host communities , screen sites , or conduct other site selection activities until key prerequisites to these efforts — such as revising health and safety regulations — have been addressed .
these defense - related activities produced about 14,000 metric tons of nuclear waste , consisting of high - level waste ( hlw ) and spent nuclear fuel ( snf ) that are currently stored in facilities in five states and managed by the department of energy ( doe ) .
from 1944 until the 1980s , the united states used nuclear reactors to produce plutonium and other materials for nuclear weapons .
we found that doe's cost estimates were not reliable because they excluded major costs that will likely add tens of billions of dollars , were minimally documented , lacked transparency , and were not fully credible .
specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) what doe cited as the benefits of a separate defense hlw repository in its recommendation to the president ; ( 2 ) the reliability of doe's cost and schedule estimates for its new plan to site , license , and construct a defense hlw repository ; and ( 3 ) doe's efforts to site a defense hlw repository and key challenges , if any , to siting the repository .
