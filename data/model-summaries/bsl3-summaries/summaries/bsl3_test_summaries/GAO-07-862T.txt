we recently issued a report , entitled medicare: focus on physician practice patterns can lead to greater program efficiency , which discusses an approach to analyzing physicians' practice patterns in medicare and ways the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) could use the results of such an analysis to modify inefficient physician behavior .
this spending target system — called the sustainable growth rate ( sgr ) system — adjusts medicare's physician fees based on the extent to which actual spending aligns with specified targets .
the report fulfilled a 2003 mandate that we examine aspects of physician compensation in medicare , pertaining only to physicians serving beneficiaries in traditional fee - for - service ( ffs ) medicare .
this topic has been of significant interest to the congress , as medicare's current system of spending targets used to moderate physician spending growth and annually update physician fees has been problematic .
against this backdrop , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the results of our analysis estimating the prevalence of inefficient physicians in medicare and ( 2 ) the potential for cms to profile physicians in traditional ffs medicare for efficiency and use the results in ways that are similar to other purchasers' efforts to encourage efficiency .
