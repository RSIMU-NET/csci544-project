the social security administration ( ssa ) administers the ssi program , which is the nation's largest cash assistance program for the poor .
in 2001 , outstanding ssi debt and newly detected overpayments totaled $4.7 billion .
for example , to better deter and detect overpayments , the agency obtained legislative authority to use additional tools to verify recipients' financial eligibility for benefits ; enhanced its processes for monitoring and holding staff accountable for completing assigned ssi workloads ; and improved its use of automation to strengthen its overpayment detection capabilities .
last year , ssi provided $33 billion in benefits to 6.8 million aged , blind , and disabled persons .
these provisions allow ssa to offset federal salaries of former recipients , use collection agencies to recover overpayments , and levy interest on outstanding debt .
benefit eligibility and payment amounts for the ssi population are determined by complex and often difficult to verify financial factors such as an individual's income , resource levels , and living arrangements .
we designated ssi a high - risk program in 1997 after several years of reporting on specific instances of abuse and mismanagement , including poor overpayment detection and recovery practices .
