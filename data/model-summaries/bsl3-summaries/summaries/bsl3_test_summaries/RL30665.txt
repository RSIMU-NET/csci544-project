the majority leader in the contemporary house is second - in - command behind the speaker of the majority party .
typically , the majority leader functions as the speaker's chief lieutenant or "field commander" for day - to - day management of the floor .
from an institutional perspective , the majority leader is principally responsible for exercising overall supervision of the order of business on the floor , especially as it affects the party's program .
two fundamental and often interlocking responsibilities orient the work of the majority leader: institutional and party .
as lewis deschler , the late house parliamentarian ( 1928-1974 ) , wrote: a party's floor leader , in conjunction with other party leaders , plays an influential role in the formulation of party policy and programs .
such information is derived in part from the floor leader's contacts with his party's members serving on house committees , and with the members of the party's whip organization .
or as one speaker put it , the majority leader's "job is to run the floor and keep monitoring committees and legislation. .
for example , representative richard armey of texas became the gop's first majority leader in 40 years when republicans won control of the 104 th house in the november 1994 elections .
