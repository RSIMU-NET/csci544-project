our review was based in large part on our analysis of data collected by the department of education as part of the national postsecondary student aid study ( npsas ) .
in august 1996 we reported that tuition increases at 4-year public colleges had outstripped increases in household income , and parents and others were questioning how students and their families would find the money to pay for school .
recent sharp increases in the annual volume of new federal student loans suggest that the cumulative amounts of student debt may be rising as well .
in response to this concern , you asked us to answer the following questions: what changes have occurred in recent years in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who borrow and in the cumulative amount of their borrowing ? .
we chose 1992-93 for a comparison because it ( 1 ) predated the most recent round of increases in maximum limits on the amounts of loans available through the government's major student loan programs , and ( 2 ) like 1995-96 , was a year in which the department identified students who had graduated from their academic programs .
