during economic downturns , states' employment and tax revenues typically fall as enrollment in the medicaid program , a federal - state health financing program for low - income populations , tends to increase .
to provide states with fiscal relief and to help maintain state medicaid programs so beneficiaries are assured continuity of services during this most recent recession , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) provided states with $89 billion through an increased federal share of medicaid funding from october 2008 through december 2010 .
the mandate specifically called for recommendations to improve the starting and ending of temporary assistance , and to account for variations in state economic conditions .
the federal funding states receive for medicaid is determined by a statutory formula , the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) .
we found that past economic downturns hampered states' ability to fund increased medicaid enrollment and maintain existing services , and that the recovery act assistance began during the national recession while nearly all states were experiencing medicaid enrollment increases .
in a march 2011 report , we reviewed how past economic downturns affected states' ability to fund medicaid , examined the responsiveness of past increased fmap assistance to state medicaid needs , and identified options for adjusting the increased fmap formula for use during future economic downturns .
