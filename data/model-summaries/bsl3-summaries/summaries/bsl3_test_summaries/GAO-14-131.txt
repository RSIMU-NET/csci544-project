this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which eda documented grant selection decisions ; ( 2 ) the indicators of economic distress for counties with eda - funded projects and how these funds have been distributed to rural and nonrural areas ; and ( 3 ) the types of projects that have been funded by these programs .
the public works and economic development act of 1965 ( pweda ) authorized the creation of the economic development administration ( eda ) within the department of commerce ( commerce ) .
the two largest programs eda uses to accomplish its mission are the public works and economic development ( public works ) program and the economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) program .
to increase transparency in the award selection process , the secretary of commerce should direct the deputy assistant secretary for economic development to develop and implement procedures to ensure that eda regional offices consistently complete the required investment review committee record template for each proposed project considered for funding .
because eda officials have not ensured that its regional offices fully and consistently document their irc discussions in the template , eda may not have adequate assurance that its funding decisions are consistent and transparent .
