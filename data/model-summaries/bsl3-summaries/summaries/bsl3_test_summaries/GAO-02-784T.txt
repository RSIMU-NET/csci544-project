to date , none of the military services or major dod components has passed the test of an independent financial audit because of weaknesses in financial management systems , operations , and controls .
of the 22 areas on gao's governmentwide “high - risk” list , 6 are dod program areas , and dod shares responsibility for 2 other high - risk areas that are government wide in scope .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss financial management at the department of defense ( dod ) .
in this regard , on september 10 , 2001 , secretary of defense rumsfeld announced a broad initiative intended to “transform the way the department works and what it works on” which he estimated could save 5 percent of dod's budget — or about $15 billion to $18 billion annually .
today , dod faces financial and related management problems that are pervasive , complex , long - standing , and deeply rooted in virtually all business operations throughout the department .
the president has made financial management and the use of technology integral to his fiscal year 2002 management agenda for making the federal government more focused on citizens and results .
