we are here today to discuss ( 1 ) ops' progress in implementing integrity management and other initiatives , ( 2 ) ops' progress in responding to recommendations from the safety board and statutory requirements , and ( 3 ) issues that are critical to the future success of ops' initiatives to improve the safety and oversight of the pipeline industry .
we appreciate this opportunity to testify on the office of pipeline safety's ( ops ) oversight of the safety of our nation's pipeline infrastructure .
as a result , ops has the lowest implementation rate of any transportation agency for recommendations from the national transportation safety board ( the safety board ) .
in recent years , ops has initiated several actions to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry , including requiring “integrity management” programs for individual operators to assess their pipelines for risks , take action to mitigate the risks , and develop program performance measures .
these challenges include ( 1 ) developing performance measures for the integrity management approach , ( 2 ) ensuring sufficient resources and expertise to oversee operators' integrity management programs , ( 3 ) providing consistent and effective enforcement of integrity management program requirements , and ( 4 ) issuing requirements for integrity management programs for operators of gas transmission pipelines .
