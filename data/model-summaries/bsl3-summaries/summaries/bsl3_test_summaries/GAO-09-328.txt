as agreed to with your office , this report provides the results of the first phase of our work , including our efforts to determine ( 1 ) omb's progress toward addressing our prior recommendations related to the fmlob initiative and other challenges that impede its implementation and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of omb's monitoring of fmlob and financial management system modernization projects , including their costs .
the federal government's ability to efficiently and effectively manage and oversee its day - to - day operations and programs relies heavily on the ability of agency financial management systems to produce complete , reliable , timely , and consistent financial information for use by executive branch agencies and congress .
specifically , we recommended that omb place a high priority on fully integrating into its approach four key concepts: ( 1 ) developing a concept of operations that articulates the interrelationships among financial management systems and how the shared service provider concept fits into the overall federal financial management framework , ( 2 ) defining standard business processes to promote consistency within and across agencies , ( 3 ) developing a strategy for ensuring that agencies' financial management systems are migrated to a limited number of service providers , and ( 4 ) defining and effectively implementing applicable disciplined processes necessary to properly manage financial management system implementation projects .
