we interviewed agency officials to identify key performance measures and other mechanisms the agencies use to determine the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs and to understand agency efforts to identify their firefighting aircraft needs , including their use of information on performance and effectiveness .
my statement today focuses on ( 1 ) how the federal wildland fire management agencies assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs and ( 2 ) the forest service's efforts to modernize the large airtanker fleet and challenges it has faced in doing so .
balancing the need to suppress unwanted wildland fires to protect people and resources with the need to recognize fire's natural role on the landscape is a complex task , particularly given the current condition of the nation's landscape , increased development in and around wildlands ( an area often called the wildland - urban interface ) , and the future outlook for wildland fires .
as you know , wildland fires have resulted in tragic loss of life and damage to homes , infrastructure , and important cultural and natural resources .
the 2015 fire season has been especially severe , with over 9 million acres burned to date â€” well over the annual average of about 6.5 million acres burned during each of the last 10 years .
