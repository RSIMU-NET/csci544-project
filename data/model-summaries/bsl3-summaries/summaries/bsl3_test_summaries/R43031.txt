in 2008 , the u.s. supreme court decided district of columbia v. heller , in which the court held that the second amendment to the u.s. constitution protects an individual right to possess a firearm , unconnected with service in a militia , and the use of that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home .
shortly afterward in mcdonald v. city of chicago , the supreme court held that the second amendment also applies to the states , but it did not further explore the scope of the second amendment .
this report first discusses the standard of judicial review that the lower courts generally have fashioned to determine if a firearm law is in violation of the second amendment .
although heller did not constitute "an exhaustive historical analysis ... of the full scope of the second amendment," the court noted that its decision "does not imperil every law regulating firearms," and "[does] not cast doubt [] on longstanding regulatory measures [such] as 'prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,' 'laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.' .
