the focus of the latest national debate over high levels of immigration is largely on its economic effects , that is , whether immigration provides net economic benefits to society .
the report opens with a discussion of how to analyze the impact of immigrants on the pay and job opportunities of native - born workers .
immigration has been a contentious issue since the nation's inception .
the current debate has been concerned with the impact of immigration on the public budget and the private economy .
during periods of substantial immigration , it has not been unusual for the native - born population to raise objections on many grounds â€” cultural , religious , ethnic , and economic .
the debate over immigration policy has been devoted more to the well - being of u.s. workers than to consumer welfare .
immigrants also affect the private economy in their capacity as workers: if the admission of foreign - born workers lowers wages , which , in turn , results in more goods being produced at lower prices , then u.s. consumers would benefit ; however , if immigration results in lower wages , u.s. workers would be harmed .
