the state of vietnam's worker rights conditions has become part of the debate over whether congress should approve the vietnam - u.s. bta , which does not contain provisions that explicitly deal with labor rights .
by the mid - 1980s , disastrous economic conditions led the country to adopt a more pragmatic line , enshrined in the doi moi ( renovation ) economic reforms of 1986 .
the linkage between labor rights and the bta would have become even more contentious if the bush administration had followed up on its proposal to bundle the bta into a broad - based trade bill that would also include a u.s. - jordan free trade agreement and new negotiating authority ( also known as "fast track" or "trade promotion authority" ) for the president to negotiate new multilateral trade agreements .
ever since communist north vietnamese forces defeated u.s. - backed south vietnam in 1975 , reunified vietnam has been struggling with how to maintain a balance between two often contradictory goals â€” maintaining ideological purity and promoting economic development .
they are also likely to loom large in the debate over the merits of a bilateral textile agreement , which the u.s. and vietnam are likely to negotiate in the next year .
