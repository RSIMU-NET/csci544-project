the office of the comptroller of currency ( occ ) a federal bank regulatory agency included check cashers and other msbs in a list of inherently high - risk businesses in its bank secrecy act / anti - money laundering manual .
concern is twofold: ( 1 ) widespread termination of account relationships could result in the loss of access to financial services and products by the significant market segment currently served by check cashers and ( 2 ) if these businesses are consequently forced "underground" the potential loss of transparency could damage ongoing efforts to safeguard the u.s. financial system .
check cashing businesses may offer additional fee - based products and services including money orders , processing utility bill payments , pre - paid phone cards , and funds transfers .
the difficulties involve how to minimize the resources and costs borne by financial institutions while ensuring the effective administration of the anti - terrorism financing and anti - money laundering programs .
both banks and nonbank msbs must have written anti - money laundering programs , file currency transaction reports ( crts ) and supicious activity reports ( sars ) , and maintain certain records .
