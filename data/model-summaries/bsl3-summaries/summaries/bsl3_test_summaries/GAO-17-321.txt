the general services administration ( gsa ) has taken some important steps to improve the capacity of the federal real property profile ( frpp ) to allow agencies to better record data ; however , questions remain about the accuracy of data collected and reported .
this report assesses ( 1 ) the reliability of government - wide data and reporting on domestic , federally owned buildings' disposal data in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and ( 2 ) steps omb , gsa , and selected cfo act agencies have taken to improve disposal data .
the combined initiatives ( 1 ) of omb's requirement for cfo act agencies to implement standard data - validation and verification checks beginning in fiscal year 2017 , ( 2 ) of gsa's updated guidance and the expanded capacity of the frpp to allow agencies to enter more complete disposal data , and ( 3 ) of selected agencies' development of new processes should lead to improved data reliability .
as of september 30 , 2015 , this real estate portfolio included approximately 240,000 federally owned buildings that are under the custody and control of the 24 civilian and defense chief financial officer ( cfo ) act agencies in the united states and u.s. territories .
