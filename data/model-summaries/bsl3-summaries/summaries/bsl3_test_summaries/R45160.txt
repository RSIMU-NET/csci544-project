the commission is responsible for administering federal campaign finance law and for civil enforcement of the federal election campaign act ( feca ) .
the federal election commission ( fec ) is a six - member independent regulatory agency .
as of this writing , the commission again faces a potential loss of its policymaking quorum because only four commissioners remain in office .
one nomination is pending , and the status of future departures remains unclear .
commissioners are appointed by the president and are subject to senate confirmation .
in 2008 , the fec lost its policymaking quorum for six months .
the fec also discloses campaign finance data to the public , conducts compliance training , and administers public financing for participating presidential campaigns .
feca requires that at least four of the six commissioners vote to make decisions on substantive actions .
the topic may be relevant for congressional oversight of the agency , particularly if it loses its policymaking quorum , and for senate consideration of nominations to the agency .
congress created the fec in 1974 , after controversial fundraising during 1960s presidential campaigns and the early 1970s watergate scandal .
these developments notwithstanding , it is unclear whether the agency will lose more commissioners .
