among the remaining critical challenges are ( 1 ) clearly establishing a strategic direction for agencies by improving goal - setting and measurement ; ( 2 ) improving the management of crosscutting program efforts by ensuring that those programs are appropriately coordinated to avoid duplication , fragmentation , and overlap ; and ( 3 ) ensuring that agencies have the data systems and analytic capacity in place to better assess program performance and costs , improve management and performance , and establish accountability .
and , we suggested several improvements to the draft plan , including that dod ( 1 ) more completely state strategies for achieving its goals and include schedules of significant actions ; ( 2 ) link and discuss how external factors could affect its ability to achieve its goals ; ( 3 ) discuss how program evaluations were used in developing its goals and identify key issues for future evaluations ; ( 4 ) discuss planned or ongoing actions to resolve persistent management problems , including time frames and required resources ; and ( 5 ) identify and discuss coordination efforts for programs that crosscut with other agencies' programs .
these twin demands are the broad forces behind the move to a performance - based approach to management in public sector organizations â€” the most important effort to improve government management in over a generation .
