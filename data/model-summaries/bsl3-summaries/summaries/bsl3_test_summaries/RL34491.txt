the senate's emphasis on individual and minority rights , reflected in both its standing rules and chamber custom , can make it challenging for the chamber to achieve its various goals in a timely manner .
for this reason , the senate routinely chooses to set aside its standing rules by unanimous consent .
many of the pairs ( or groups ) are competing options for the same policy issue .
these amendments or measures are sometimes of a controversial nature with potential to be subjected to extended consideration or even a filibuster .
under recent practice , these uc agreements sometimes include a provision imposing a 60-vote requirement for approval of amendments or legislation , instead of the simple majority vote ordinarily required in the senate .
lastly , in many of these 60-vote threshold uc agreements , it is a pair ( or group ) of amendments or measures that are jointly held to the 60-vote requirement .
this is done formally through uc agreements , which in many cases outline the terms under which specific legislation will be considered .
second , for cases in which a large majority either in favor of or against the question cannot be assumed , the 60-vote threshold accomplishes the same purpose as a filibuster by preventing or delaying passage , but without requiring the senate to engage in extended debate .
