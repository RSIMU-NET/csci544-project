persons suspected of terrorist or criminal activity may be transferred from one state ( i.e. , country ) to another to answer charges against them .
unlike in the case of rendition and extradition , the legal justification for removing an alien from the united states via deportation or denial of entry is not so that he can answer charges against him in the receiving state ; rather , it is because the united states possesses the sovereign authority to determine which non - nationals may enter or remain within its borders , and the alien fails to fulfill the legal criteria allowing non - citizens to enter , remain in , or pass in transit through the united states .
a distinct form of rendition is extradition , by which one state surrenders a person within its territorial jurisdiction to a requesting state via a formal legal process , typically established by treaty between the countries .
unlike in extradition cases , persons subject to this type of rendition typically have no access to the judicial system of the sending state by which they may challenge their transfer .
besides receiving persons through rendition , the united states has also rendered persons to other countries over the years , via the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and various law enforcement agencies .
