most federal offshore oil and gas production leases contain royalty provisions that require the lessee to pay a certain percentage of revenue on the value of oil and natural gas production to the federal government as the lessor .
in 1995 , congress passed the deep water royalty relief act ( dwrra ) , which provides an incentive for exploration of oil and natural gas reserves in "deep water," which might otherwise be uneconomic , by providing that a certain initial volume of production from deep water wells would be exempt from royalty obligations .
section 302 of the dwrra provides a mechanism by which holders of existing leases can apply for royalty relief , which is to be granted by the secretary of the interior if the lease would otherwise be uneconomic .
any holder of a "covered lease" is forced to decide between three options: ( 1 ) the lessee can keep the lease under its current terms ( i.e. , without a price threshold ) and lose the right to bid on future offshore lease sales in the gulf of mexico ; ( 2 ) the lessee can pay a newly created "conservation of resources" fee , as established elsewhere in the proposed act ; or ( 3 ) the lessee can renegotiate the covered lease to include royalty relief price thresholds .
