our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify states that have funded programs to replace older manufactured homes with more energy efficient models and describe these programs ; ( 2 ) identify challenges , if any , these states reported facing in implementing these programs ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which these programs resulted in energy savings sufficient to offset replacement costs .
according to the energy information administration ( eia ) , the nation's approximately 130 million housing units account for about 23 percent of total energy consumption in the united states .
many of the occupants of these homes qualify for federal assistance to help pay their energy bills through the u.s. department of health and human services' ( hhs ) low income home energy assistance program ( liheap ) .
some states have conducted pilot programs to replace older manufactured homes ; however , liheap funds are statutorily prohibited from being used for new construction â€” which includes replacing existing homes .
officials from all three state replacement pilot programs and representatives of organizations and agencies that aided these programs told us that they faced three key types of challenges: ( 1 ) many potential beneficiaries were not eligible to participate ; ( 2 ) some potential beneficiaries were not willing to participate ; and ( 3 ) other logistical challenges , such as finding suitable replacement homes within a reasonable distance to transport them to beneficiaries , which resulted in higher costs .
