in the coming decades , the need for long - term services and supports ( ltss ) to assist individuals with limited abilities for self - care is expected to increase , in part due to the aging of the population .
medicaid , a federal - state health financing program for low - income and medically needy individuals , is the nation's primary payer of ltss .
in addition , states may seek permission from cms to provide hcbs under waivers of traditional medicaid requirements ; for example , in order to provide services to a specific population , such as individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities , or to limit the number of beneficiaries who can receive hcbs .

this report describes 1. decisions that influenced the structure of selected states' medicaid 2. selected states' challenges providing hcbs to medicaid beneficiaries and efforts to respond to these challenges .
