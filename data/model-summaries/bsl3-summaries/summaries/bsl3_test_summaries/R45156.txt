the electrical grid in the united states comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems that bring power to end - use customers .
smart meters have run into cost and performance issues and resistance to the technology ( generally from concerns of some customers over potential health impacts of radio wave emissions ) .
however , with changes in federal law , regulatory changes , and the aging of the electric power infrastructure as drivers , the grid is changing from a largely patchwork system built to serve the needs of individual electric utility companies to essentially a national interconnected system , accommodating massive transfers of electrical energy among regions of the united states .
technical solutions at the transmission and distribution levels ( such as the increased ability to monitor the system for problems and incorporate intermittent renewable energy sources ) can provide some benefits to both utilities and customers ( through passed through savings ) , and the efficiency benefits associated with real - time pricing and demand response enabled by smart - grid technologies can be significant .
the "grid" also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and power companies in different states and regions of the united states .
