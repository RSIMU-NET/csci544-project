my testimony today will focus on: ( 1 ) the progress tsa and other dhs components have made in securing the nation's commercial aviation system and ( 2 ) challenges that have impeded dhs's ( and , as they relate to transportation security , tsa ) efforts to implement its mission and management functions .
the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , originally established as an agency within the department of transportation in 2001 but now a component within dhs , is charged with securing the transportation network while also ensuring the free movement of people and commerce .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) progress and challenges in securing our nation's aviation system .
tsa has primary responsibility for security in all modes of transportation and since its inception has developed and implemented a variety of programs and procedures to secure the commercial aviation system .
for example , the u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) has responsibility for conducting passenger prescreening — in general , the matching of passenger information against terrorist watch lists prior to an aircraft's departure — for international flights operating to or from the united states , as well as inspecting inbound air cargo upon its arrival in the united states .
