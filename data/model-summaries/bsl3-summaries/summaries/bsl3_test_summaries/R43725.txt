in january 2006 , the 109 th congress enacted the first in a series of legislative provisions to enable certain iraqi and afghan nationals to become u.s. lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) based on their service to the u.s. government .
the hundreds of iraqi interpreters who work for the u.s. military conceal their identities in distinctive ways .
section 1059 of the fy2006 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) made certain iraqi and afghan nationals who had worked directly with u.s. armed forces as translators eligible for special immigrant visas ( sivs ) .
a house judiciary committee report on a related bill in the 109 th congress to provide special immigrant status for iraqi and afghan translators ( h.r .
congress subsequently broadened the special immigrant classification for translators and also authorized a second special immigrant classification for certain iraqi and afghan nationals who had worked for , or on behalf of , the u.s. government in iraq or afghanistan , respectively .
given the seeming consensus that the u.s. government should assist its iraqi and afghan employees in need , an ongoing question for congress is whether the existing siv provisions are sufficient to accomplish this , or whether further extensions of the temporary siv programs for iraqis and afghans who worked for , or on behalf of , the u.s. government , or other changes to the siv provisions are warranted .
