social security's minimum benefit provision , the special minimum primary insurance amount ( pia ) , is an alternative benefit formula that increases benefits paid to workers who had low earnings for many years and to their dependents and survivors .
in 2017 , about 39,347 ( or about 0.6% ) of the 62 million social security recipients qualified for the minimum benefit .
unlike the standard social security benefit formula , which is based on a worker's average lifetime earnings , the special minimum pia is based on the number of years a person has worked .
because of the way regular social security benefits and the special minimum pia are computed , the number of recipients who qualify for the special minimum pia has been decreasing .
beneficiaries receive the higher of the two amounts .
to be eligible for a social security retired - worker benefit , a worker generally needs 40 earnings credits ( also called quarters of coverage ) .
it then presents arguments for and against expanding the special minimum pia , discusses elements to be considered in proposals for change , and describes some specific options for increasing benefits paid to people with low earnings or low income .
