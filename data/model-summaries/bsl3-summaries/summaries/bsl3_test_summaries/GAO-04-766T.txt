as requested , my testimony today will focus on electronic voting systems , and in doing so i will address ( 1 ) the role of these systems within the larger election process , ( 2 ) attributes that can be used to examine these systems' capabilities , ( 3 ) the importance of both system design and implementation to the performance of these systems , and ( 4 ) the challenges confronting local jurisdictions in using any type of voting equipment , particularly electronic voting systems .
other facets include the people who implement and use the technology and the processes that govern its implementation , among which are the standards used to define the characteristics and performance of the technology .
states are responsible for the administration of both their own elections and federal elections , but the congress has enacted laws in several major areas of the voting process , including the timing of federal elections , voter registration , and absentee voting requirements .
we recommended that the secretaries of defense and state improve ( 1 ) the clarity and completeness of service guidance , ( 2 ) voter education and outreach programs , ( 3 ) oversight and evaluation of voting assistance efforts , and ( 4 ) sharing of best practices .
