our objectives were to assess ( 1 ) the progress made to develop , review , and approve facility and vessel security plans by july 1 , 2004 ; ( 2 ) the coast guard's monitoring and oversight strategy for ensuring that facility and vessel security plans are implemented ; and ( 3 ) the accuracy of the coast guard's estimates of costs for complying with mtsa security planning and implementation requirements .
one of its central maritime transportation security provisions is a requirement that security plans be developed and implemented for specific facilities ( such as factories , cargo terminals , and power plants ) ; certain individual cargo and passenger vessels ; and entire ports .
these stakeholders include law enforcement and other government agencies at every level ( federal , state , and local ) ; vessel owners and operators ; railroads ; port authorities ; factories and other businesses ; and people who work in port areas or live nearby .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the nation's 361 ports have increasingly been viewed as potential targets for future attacks for many reasons .
the maritime transportation security act ( mtsa ) contains much of the federal government's approach to addressing these security vulnerabilities .
