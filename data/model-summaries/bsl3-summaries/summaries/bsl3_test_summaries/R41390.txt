implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ) is having a substantial impact on federal mandatory spending .
the two agencies primarily responsible for the aca's implementation are the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the internal revenue service ( irs ) , within the department of the treasury .
first , it discusses all the aca authorizations ( and reauthorizations ) of appropriations for grant and other programs .
this includes premium tax credits and cost - sharing subsidies for individuals and families who purchase private insurance coverage through the aca health insurance exchanges , as well as federal matching funds for states that choose to expand their medicaid programs .
furthermore , the aca established four special funds — and appropriated amounts to each one — to support primary care , public health , and comparative effectiveness research , and help pay for the administrative costs of the law's implementation .
in addition , the aca authorized new medicare spending and appropriated billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support numerous other activities and programs .
for example , it provided a permanent appropriation — available for 10-year periods — for a center for medicare & medicaid innovation to test and implement innovative health care payment and service delivery models .
