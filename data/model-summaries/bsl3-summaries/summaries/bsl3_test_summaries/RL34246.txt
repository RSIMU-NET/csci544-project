these diseases will endanger u.s. citizens at home and abroad , threaten u.s. armed forces deployed overseas , and exacerbate social and political instability in key countries and regions in which the united states has significant interests. .
in january 2000 , the national intelligence council ( nic ) released a report asserting that , "[n]ew and reemerging infectious diseases will pose a rising threat to u.s. and global security over the next 20 years .
congress designates funds for global tb interventions only to the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , while other agencies and departments draw from general funds ( see table a - 5 in the appendix ) .
nic cited a number of factors that heighten the infectious diseases threat , including increasing drug resistance , slow development of new antibiotics , urban sprawl , environmental degradation , and the growing ease and frequency of cross - border movements .
because agencies and departments might use discretionary funds to support global tb initiatives , some u.s. international tb activities might not be included here , such as research conducted by the national institute of health ( nih ) to develop a new tb drug with a shorter treatment regimen .
