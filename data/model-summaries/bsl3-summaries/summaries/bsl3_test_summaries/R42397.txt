since opening to the public on december 2 , 2008 , the capitol visitor center ( cvc ) has had more than six million visitors .
added expenses were incurred because of higher - than - expected bids ; several design changes ; security upgrades following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ; necessary changes to the air filtration system ; house and senate expansion space costs ; and extra costs associated with working around the capitol , such as security screening for the thousands of construction workers and vehicles that entered the construction site .
this report addresses the rationale and planning for the cvc , an overview of construction and funding , and subsequent legislation related to its operations and design .
a number of factors delayed the project's completion date and increased its cost .
located beneath the east front plaza , the cvc was designed to enhance the security , educational experience , and comfort of visitors to the u.s. capitol .
the cost of the center was an estimated $621 million .
unusually wet weather in 2003 , the discovery of asbestos in the part of the capitol connected to the center , and an undocumented century - old well under the construction site were unanticipated .
