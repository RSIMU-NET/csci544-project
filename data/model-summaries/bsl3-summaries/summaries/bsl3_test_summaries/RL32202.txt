concerns about the long - term effects of economic hardship and the increasing age of soviet - era systemscontinue to prompt questions about the security of russia's nuclear weapons andmaterials .
the united states has offered , through efforts such as the nunn - lugarcooperative threat reduction program , to enhance safety and security at nuclear facilities inrussia .
it includes a brief listing of the cooperative programs and assistance theunited states has provided to russia and the other former soviet states in an effort to addressconcerns about the safety and security of nuclear weapons and materials .
after the 1991 demise of the soviet union , many analysts grew concerned that nuclear weaponsmight be lost or stolen , or that some might be launched by accident or without authorization byresponsible officials .
the program's new objectives are to dismantleweapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure in the former soviet union ; consolidate and secure weapons of mass destruction and related technologies and materials ; increasetransparency and encourage higher standards of conduct , and support defense and militarycooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation .
many of these weapons were located outside russia , but have since beenreturned to storage areas in russia .
