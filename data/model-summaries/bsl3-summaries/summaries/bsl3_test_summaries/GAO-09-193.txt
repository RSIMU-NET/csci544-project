therefore , our objectives in this report are to provide information on ( 1 ) the mechanisms through which federal dollars flow to nonprofit organizations ( which we define as those entities that are federally tax - exempt ) , and how federal involvement varies across them , and ( 2 ) what is known about federal dollars flowing through these mechanisms to nonprofit organizations in fiscal year 2006 ( the most recent year for which we could obtain data from all sources ) .
our data sources included the federal procurement data system â€” next generation ( fpds - ng ) , federal awards and assistance data system ( faads ) , several systems at the centers for medicare & medicaid services , the department of the treasury's ( treasury ) estimates of the revenue loss of tax expenditures , and the office of management and budget's ( omb ) collection of information on federal credit programs .
increasingly , the federal government relies on networks and partnerships to achieve its goals , and many of these involve nonprofit organizations .
these organizations are involved in a wide array of missions including healthcare , education , poverty alleviation , and economic development , and their missions can align with or complement the objectives of federal programs .
