my comments today are based on our most recent reports issued in august 2007 and october 2006 , and cover ( 1 ) the changes that have occurred in the railroad industry since the enactment of the staggers rail act , including changes in rail rates since 1985 , ( 2 ) the extent of captivity in the industry and stb's efforts to protect captive shippers , and ( 3 ) stb's actions to address our recent recommendations .
in particular , the 1980 act encouraged greater reliance on competition to set rates and gave railroads increased freedom to price their services according to market conditions , including the freedom to use differential pricing — that is , to recover a greater proportion of their costs from rates charged to shippers with a greater dependency on rail transportation .
at the same time , the 1980 act anticipated that some shippers might not have competitive alternatives — commonly referred to as “captive shippers” — and gave the interstate commerce commission ( icc ) , and later the surface transportation board ( stb ) , the authority to establish a process so that shippers could obtain relief from unreasonably high rates .
