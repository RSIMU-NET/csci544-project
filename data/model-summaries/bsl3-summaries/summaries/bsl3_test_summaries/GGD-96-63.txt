as part of our ongoing work examining how federal agencies have used buyouts to downsize the federal workforce , you asked that we compare the projected costs and savings of buyouts with an alternative downsizing strategy , reductions - in - force ( rif ) , over a 5-year period .
two driving forces in the reductions have been the federal workforce restructuring act of 1994 and the national performance review ( npr ) .
both congress and the administration have agreed that federal employment levels should be cut as a means of reducing federal costs and controlling deficits .
because such an analysis is dependent on many factors that may vary considerably among agencies , we used a variety of assumptions and scenarios in our analysis to determine the average costs and savings of each method .
these effects included the ability to use buyouts to restructure agency workforces , retain or improve workforce diversity , and avoid lowering productivity and morale .
we based our analysis on available workforce data and on the results of earlier studies completed by us and by other organizations .
through a series of executive orders and legislation , goals have been established for reducing federal staffing levels .
