currently , the united states has active economic sanctions imposed on three major oil - producing and exporting countries: iran , russia , and venezuela .
generally , sanctions - related supply losses have been counterbalanced by increased production and exports from the united states , russia , and other countries ; petroleum trade flow adjustments ; indications of slowing global oil demand growth rates ; and design elements of oil - related sanctions .
a sustained global petroleum supply imbalance of 1% to 2% could contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements ( both upward and downward ) for crude oil and related petroleum products ( e.g. , gasoline and diesel fuel ) .
these design elements are intended to mitigate sanctions - related market and price impacts and to build into the sanctions regime multilateral coordination and cooperation .
oil - related sanctions are one option that could be used to apply economic pressure on certain countries in order to achieve broader geopolitical and foreign policy objectives .
economic sanctions are one foreign policy tool that can be used to potentially influence the behavior and actions of political leadership in other countries .
