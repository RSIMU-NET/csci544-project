in this report , we review the extent to which di , ssi , and va's disability criteria have been updated based on ( 1 ) scientific advances , including medical and technological innovations ; and ( 2 ) labor market changes , including the growth in service - and knowledge - based industries over manufacturing - based industries .
the three largest federal disability programs providing cash assistance , which are administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , in 2001 collectively provided $89.7 billion in cash benefits to approximately 10.2 million adults with a physical or mental condition that reduced their earning capacity .
ssa administers both the disability insurance ( di ) program and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
with such an extensive cash outlay and such a large beneficiary population , it is important to use updated scientific , workforce , and economic information to evaluate claims for disability benefits .
over time , progress in the fields of medicine and technology has provided a better understanding of how disease and injury affect the ability to work .
together , scientific advances and labor market changes redefine the extent that physical or mental conditions affect the ability of people with disabilities to work .
