to improve available data about the direct care workforce , we recommend that the acting administrator of the health resources and services administration take steps to produce projections of direct care workforce supply and demand and develop methods to address data limitations in order to do so .
unless hrsa takes actions to overcome data limitations in order to make projections of supply and demand , the ability of policymakers and other stakeholders to develop appropriate workforce strategies to ensure a sufficient number of qualified direct care workers will continue to be hampered .
hrsa , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for ensuring that americans have access to a skilled health workforce .
for example , the congressional commission on long - term care reported in 2013 that a number of states have experienced shortages and high attrition of direct care workers but lack data to help them assess the size of the problem .
ltss can be provided in institutional or home - and community - based settings and comprise a broad range of health care , personal care , and supportive services to help individuals with limited ability for self - care maintain their quality of life .
