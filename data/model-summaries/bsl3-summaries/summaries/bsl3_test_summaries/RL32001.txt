although the aids epidemic in the broader latin america and caribbean region is not as pervasive as in africa , over 1.8 million people were estimated to be living with hiv in the region in 2007 , including 230,000 in the caribbean and 1.6 million in latin america .
moreover , the adult prevalence rate in several countries in the caribbean and central america are among the highest outside of sub - saharan africa .
in terms of sheer numbers , brazil accounts for about one - third of those living with hiv in latin america , but its prevalence rate of 0.5% ( 2005 ) is low compared to many countries in central america and the caribbean .
furthermore , brazil's active prevention efforts have lowered prevalence among the high risk groups — intravenous drug users and homosexuals — and the government's extensive antiretroviral ( arv ) treatment program has lowered death rates .
the caribbean countries with the highest prevalence or infection rates in 2006 were haiti , the bahamas , belize , guyana , and trinidad and tobago , with rates between 2% and 4% ; and barbados , the dominican republic , jamaica , and suriname , with rates between 1% and 2% .
