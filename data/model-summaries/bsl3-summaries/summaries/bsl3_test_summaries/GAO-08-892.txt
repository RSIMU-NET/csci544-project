our objectives were to ( 1 ) seek to determine how many a - 3 and g - 5 visa holders have alleged abuse by foreign diplomats with immunity since 2000 , ( 2 ) review the u.s. government's process for investigating abuse allegations involving foreign diplomats with immunity , and ( 3 ) describe and assess how state ensures correct and consistent implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa polices and procedures .
in june 2007 , the department of state ( state ) noted in its annual trafficking in persons report that some foreign diplomats may have abused individuals they had brought to the united states to work in their households .
this spot - check system would allow headquarters to assess compliance without dedicating the resources needed to review all a - 3 and g - 5 visas issued in a given year and could be targeted at posts that issue high numbers of a - 3 or g - 5 visas or that have identified difficulties interpreting guidance on these visas classes .
