the change would likely occur in the form of legislation to eliminate the application of title iv to trade with russia .
extension of pntr has implications for russia's accession to the world trade organization ( wto ) .
granting russia permanent normal trade relations ( pntr ) status requires a change in law because russia is prohibited from receiving pntr under title iv of the trade act of 1974 .
title iv includes the so - called jackson - vanik amendment free emigration requirements .
the wto requires its members to extend immediate and unconditional nondiscriminatory treatment to the goods and services of all other members .
president obama signed the legislation into law on december 14 , 2012 .
the legislation also included provisions — the magnitsky rule of law accountability act of 2012 — that impose sanctions on individuals linked to the incarceration and death of russian lawyer sergei magnitsky .
on november 16 , 2012 , the house passed ( 365-43 ) , and on december 6 , 2012 , the senate passed ( 92-4 ) h.r .
after 19 years of negotiations , russia joined the wto on august 22 , 2012 .
for a country to maintain that status , the president must reconfirm his determination of full compliance in a semiannual report ( by june 30 and december 31 ) to congress .
