onrr should provide additional guidance on how to report royalty - free and royalty - bearing flaring and consider creating a separate category for royalty - bearing flaring ; how to report certain unreported or underreported emissions , such as emissions from storage tanks and gas vented during well completions ; and how to differentiate between combusted and noncombusted lease use volumes reported on the ogor , which could assist interior in measuring its progress toward greenhouse gas reduction goals .
to help improve reporting of emissions data on the ogor , the secretary of the interior should direct blm or onrr , as appropriate , to take the following four actions: blm should provide additional guidance on how to estimate natural gas emissions from federal oil and gas leases .
further , improved reporting from operators could also help interior better track its efforts to curb greenhouse gases from federal leases and its new goals for methane reduction .
interior provided written comments , in which it concurred with two of the six recommendations in the draft report , partly concurred with two others , and did not concur with the remaining two recommendations .
since operators of federal leases may be subject to state regulations and policies regarding natural gas emissions , we reviewed the regulatory activity in five states with high federal oil and gas production and emissions .
