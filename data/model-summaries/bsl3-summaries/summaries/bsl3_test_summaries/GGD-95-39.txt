this report presents the status of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) plans for conducting the taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) for tax year 1994 .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the status of irs' 1994 tcmp planning effort and ( 2 ) identify the potential effects of this plan on measuring taxpayer compliance .
it also identifies the potential effects of these plans on measuring taxpayer compliance .
this report was prepared , not at the request of the committee , but as part of our continuing efforts to provide information and analysis to improve tax administration .
tcmp results play an important role in tax policy and administration decisions .
irs uses the data for measuring compliance levels , estimating the tax gap ( i.e. , the difference between the amount of income tax owed and the amount voluntarily paid ) , identifying compliance issues , developing formulas for objectively selecting returns to audit , and allocating audit resources .
congress and federal and state agencies use tcmp data for policy analysis , revenue estimating , and research .
because of tcmp's importance , we have been monitoring irs' plans to develop and implement the 1994 tcmp .
