committees have existed within the house and senate since the first congress .
despite the advantage of having a direct avenue of communication open between the committee and these groups , electronic communications have raised some concerns .
for example , existing law and chamber regulations on the use of communication media such as the franking privilege have proven difficult to adapt to the new electronic technologies .
initially , committees were ad - hoc â€” temporarily convened to address specific pieces of legislation and disbanded after reporting to the house or senate .
communications to and within congress have evolved over the years .
the system of permanent , standing committees was reinforced through changes made in the 1946 and 1970 legislative reorganization acts that further defined and refined committee jurisdiction .
these technologies have arguably served to enhance the ability of committees to share information directly with stakeholder groups , including other members , federal agencies , and individual private citizens .
by the early 1800s , both the house and senate "developed a system of permanent , or standing , committees" that were organized around topics instead of an individual piece of legislation .
political scientist stephen frantzich once described congress as "the vortex of three discrete communications flows: it is the target , sender , and subject matter of communication. .
