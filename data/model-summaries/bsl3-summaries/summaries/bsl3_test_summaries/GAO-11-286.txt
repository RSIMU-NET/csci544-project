the department of health and human services' food and drug administration ( fda ) has responsibility for ensuring the safety of seafood imports .
to better ensure the safety of seafood imports , we recommend that the secretary of health and human services direct the commissioner of fda to take the following three actions: study the feasibility of adopting other practices used by other entities , such as requiring foreign countries that want to export seafood to the united states to develop a national residues monitoring plan to control the use of aquaculture drugs , to more efficiently ensure the safety of imported seafood and report its findings to the secretary ; develop a more comprehensive import sampling program for seafood by more effectively using its laboratory resources and taking into account the imported seafood sampling programs of other entities and countries ; and develop a strategic approach with specific time frames for enhancing collaborative efforts with nmfs and better leveraging nmfs inspection resources .
we provided the departments of agriculture , commerce , and health and human services ( hhs ) a draft of this report for their review and comment .
we did not address the remaining practices: ( 1 ) define and articulate a common outcome ; ( 2 ) establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies ; ( 3 ) agree on roles and responsibilities ; ( 4 ) develop mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results ; ( 5 ) reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts ; and ( 6 ) reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts .
