in the 1994 general election , republicans won a majority of seats in the house for the first time since the 83 rd congress ( 1953-1955 ) .
one of the majority's prerogatives is writing the house's rules and using its majority status to effect the chamber's rules on the day the new house convenes .
the first purpose of the report is to identify the sources of the broad rewriting of house rules in the 104 th congress and additional changes in subsequent congresses .
it is a feature of the house , but not of the senate , that it must adopt rules at the convening of each congress .
although each new house largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous congress , each new house also adopts changes to those rules .
it elects its speaker , chairs its committees , holds majorities on its committees , selects its officers , and manages its legislative agenda .
the second part of the report organizes rules changes affecting committees and the house floor topically and changes affecting budgetary legislation , house administration , and ethics by congress , and briefly explains the changes in layman's terms .
