it also provides the projected effects of the options on social security and ssi benefit levels and eligibility in 2042 , and the interaction between the two programs .
one way to measure such targeting is to compare the estimated effects of potential policy options on the elderly poor vs. the elderly non - poor .
these four options were chosen to illustrate different approaches to mitigating poverty in a benefit cut scenario , allowing policymakers to see the potential pros and cons of generic options .
the details of each option could be modified or combined with other provisions .
the following section describes each of the four options crs modeled .
if one of the objectives of reforming social security were to mitigate the effect of possible benefit reductions on the elderly poor , targeting spending would become an important consideration .
this analysis does not cover potential transition issues nor the cost of the options modeled .
other ways of analyzing the targeting of an option include measuring the poverty gap and looking at the proportion of people who fall below a given percentage of the poverty threshold ( e.g. , 150% or 200% of poverty ) .
