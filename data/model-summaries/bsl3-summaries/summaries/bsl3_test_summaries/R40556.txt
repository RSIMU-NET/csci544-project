a diverse array of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions is currently under way or being developed on the international , national , and sub - national level ( e.g. , individual state actions or regional partnerships ) .
proposals in the u.s. congress have generally focused on market - based approaches , but some proposals have included a mix of market and non - market strategies .
in addition , on may 19 , 2009 , president obama announced a plan to integrate federal fuel economy standards ( under the energy policy and conservation act ) with federal vehicle emissions standards ( under the clean air act ) and state standards ( driven by california's rulemaking action ) .
preference for a carbon tax or a cap - and - trade program ultimately depends on which variable one wants to directly control â€” emissions or costs .
market - based mechanisms that limit ghg emissions can generally be divided into two types: quantity control ( e.g. , cap - and - trade ) and price control ( e.g. , carbon tax or fee ) .
in the 111 th congress , members have introduced nine bills that include provisions to impose or permit some form of market - based controls on ghg emissions .
