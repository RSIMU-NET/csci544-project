my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) trends in degree attainment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , ( 2 ) trends in the levels of employment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , and ( 3 ) federal education programs intended to support the study of and employment in stem - related fields .
the health of the u.s. economy is directly tied to our science and technology industries , and the united states is a world leader in scientific and technological innovation .
these factors , concurrent with the nation's large and growing long - term fiscal imbalance , present significant and difficult challenges for policymakers as they tackle how best to ensure that our nation can continue to compete in the global marketplace .
since 1995 , for example , the united states has generated the largest share of high - technology manufacturing output of any country in the world .
concerns have been raised , however , about the nation's ability to maintain its technological competitive advantage , especially in light of other nations' investments in their own research infrastructures , the aging and changing u.s. workforce , and the fiscal challenges facing the nation .
