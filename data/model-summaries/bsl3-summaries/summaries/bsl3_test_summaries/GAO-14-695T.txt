my testimony today addresses the extent to which tsa has ( 1 ) regularly analyzed data to identify program trends and areas working well or in need of corrective action , and ( 2 ) comprehensively assessed the effectiveness of pscs , and coordinated with stakeholders to deploy psc teams to the highest - risk airports and utilize them as intended .
i appreciate the opportunity to discuss our work on the transportation security administration's ( tsa ) national explosives detection canine team program ( nedctp ) .
within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , tsa is the primary federal agency responsible for security of the nation's transportation system .
this statement is based on our january 2013 report and includes selected updates on the status of tsa's efforts to implement the recommendations in that report .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , tsa has implemented a multilayered system of security composed of people , processes , and technology to protect the transportation system .
one of tsa's security layers is nedctp , composed of over 800 explosives detection canine teams — a canine paired with a handler — aimed at deterring and detecting the use of explosive devices in the u.s. transportation system .
