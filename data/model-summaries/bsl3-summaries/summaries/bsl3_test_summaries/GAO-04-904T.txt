i appreciate the opportunity to testify on the results of our work on the management of first responder grants in the national capital region ( ncr ) .
what has been the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) role to date in enhancing the preparedness of ncr through such actions as coordinating the use of federal emergency preparedness grants , assessing preparedness , providing guidance , targeting funds to enhance preparedness , and monitoring the use of those funds ? .
these 16 grants were selected to cover a range of programs , including the largest funding sources ; grants provided for general purposes , such as equipment and training ; and grants provided for specific purposes , such as fire prevention and bioterrorism .
to respond to these questions , we met with and obtained documentation from officials of dhs including its office for national capital region coordination ( oncrc ) , the senior policy group , the metropolitan council of governments , state emergency management agencies , and first responder officials from ncr jurisdictions .
our report addressed the following questions: what federal funds have been allocated to local jurisdictions in ncr for emergency preparedness , for what specific purposes , and from what sources ? .
