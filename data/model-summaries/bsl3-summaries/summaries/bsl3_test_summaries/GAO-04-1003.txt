our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) develop a profile of general and flag officer careers and ( 2 ) assess dod's justification for its general and flag officer legislative proposals .
for fiscal year 2005 , the department of defense ( dod ) has proposed eliminating or amending a number of general and flag officer provisions to provide greater flexibility in managing its senior uniformed leaders .
the mandate directed us to evaluate dod's recommendations .
since 1996 , congress annually has authorized the military services a total of nearly 900 active duty general and flag officers .
this evaluation should include an assessment of ( 1 ) factors that contribute to the retirement of senior general and flag officers prior to the statutory retirement limits , ( 2 ) the need for changes in dod policy or procedure to make greater use of existing authority to extend general and flag officers careers on a case - by - case basis beyond the statutory retirement limits , and ( 3 ) the long - term cost implications of proposals to change retirement compensation .
such provisions reflect congressional interest in maintaining oversight and accountability of general and flag officers .
