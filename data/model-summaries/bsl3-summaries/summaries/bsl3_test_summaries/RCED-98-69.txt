accordingly , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the quality of the air inside the niehs building when it was first occupied in 1981 , ( 2 ) identify the health effects associated with exposure to formaldehyde , and ( 3 ) describe the current management practices at niehs for air handling and air monitoring .
the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) , the component of the national institutes of health that does research on environment - related diseases , moved into a new facility at research triangle park , north carolina , in april 1981 .
in response to your inquiries , niehs and the inspector general ( ig ) of the department of health and human services issued two letter reports in 1997 addressing some aspects of the employees' complaints ; other questions , however , remained unanswered .
even though considerable time has passed , some employees continue to believe that the quality of the air — specifically , the level of formaldehyde emissions — in the building in 1981 has caused them to have continuing health problems .
soon after the agency occupied the facility , some employees began complaining about the quality of the air , primarily in one of the facility's five modules .
