our testimony is based on our prior work and a review that we have underway for this subcommittee and includes assessments of security concerns with ( 1 ) airport access controls , ( 2 ) passenger and carry - on baggage screening , and ( 3 ) alternatives to current screening practices , including practices in selected other countries .
billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system .
a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation .
faa's efforts to address these problems have been slow .
faa is addressing these recommendations , but progress on one key effort — the certification of screening companies — is still not complete because the implementing regulation has not been issued .
we recommended that faa develop an integrated plan to focus its efforts , set priorities , and measure progress in improving screening .
weaknesses in the current system in which airlines are responsible for screening passengers and controlling access to secure areas have raised questions about whether alternative approaches should be considered .
