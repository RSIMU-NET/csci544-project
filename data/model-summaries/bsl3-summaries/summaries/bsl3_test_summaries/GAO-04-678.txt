the department of defense ( dod ) is experiencing significant and increasing reliance on software and information systems for its weapon capabilities , while at the same time traditional dod prime contractors are subcontracting more of their software development to lower tier and sometimes nontraditional defense suppliers .
dod is also using more commercial - off - the - shelf ( cots ) software to reduce development costs and allow for frequent technology updates , which further increases the number of software developers with either direct or indirect access to weapon system software .
we have previously made recommendations to dod to adopt more effective software development practices and to increase oversight of software intensive systems to improve acquisition outcomes .
while dod attempts to better its software acquisition policies and implement new initiatives , it must take steps to ensure that security is an integral element in decision making and that program managers mitigate risks accordingly .
while these plans and initiatives may help to increase dod's focus on software security and may lead to the development and identification of several potential software security best practices , dod software assurance officials acknowledge that significant effort remains to adequately mitigate software risks to weapon systems .
