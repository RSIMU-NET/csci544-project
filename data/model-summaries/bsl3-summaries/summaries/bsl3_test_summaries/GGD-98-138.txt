our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess irs' progress in converting its systems according to the guidelines in our year 2000 assessment guide , ( 2 ) identify the risks irs faces to completing the year 2000 effort on time , and ( 3 ) identify risks to the continuity of irs operations in the event of year 2000-induced system failures .
although 2000 is less than 2 years in the future , irs has less than 1 year to complete all of the work that it believes is necessary to reach its goal of having all of its systems year 2000 compliant by january 1999 .
the outcome of these efforts will also depend on the extent to which agencies have institutionalized key systems development and program management practices , as well as on their ability to execute large - scale software development or conversion projects .
this report summarizes the information we provided to your office on the results of our work to date on the internal revenue service's ( irs ) efforts to have its information systems function correctly when processing dates beyond december 31 , 1999 .
agencies' success or failure will largely be determined by the quality of their program management and executive leadership .
