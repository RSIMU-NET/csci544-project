this report compares selected recommendations of the president's commission on care for america's returning wounded warriors ( pccww ) , often called the dole - shalala commission in reference to its co - chairs , and the veterans' disability benefits commission ( vdbc ) .
congress , the two commissions , and others have determined that certain programs and systems that involve both the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) are particularly problematic in providing continuity and quality of care and services to injured servicemembers .
recommendations were made in the following broad categories: disability evaluation and compensation ; determining eligibility for benefits ; appropriateness of the benefits ; appropriateness of the level of benefits ; survivors and dependents ; disability claims administration ; transition ; and establishing an executive oversight group to implement recommendations .
