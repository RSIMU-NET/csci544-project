notice: this draft is restricted to official use .
as you know , last month we issued a major new series of reports , entitled performance and accountability series: major management challenges and program risks , and an update of our high risk series .
framework contains as its core elements financial management improvement legislation , including the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 , the government management reform act of 1994 , and the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 ; information technology reforms , including the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) of 1995 and the clinger - cohen act of 1996 ; and the government performance and results act of 1993 ( the results act ) .
at the same time , the report series also underscored the pivotal role that the federal government's central management agencies — in particular , omb — must play in guiding and overseeing agencies' efforts to address the shortcomings that we identified and to implement the changes necessary to improve performance .
mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee: we are pleased to be here today to discuss our observations on the office of management and budget's ( omb ) efforts to carry out its responsibilities to set policy and oversee the management of the executive branch .
