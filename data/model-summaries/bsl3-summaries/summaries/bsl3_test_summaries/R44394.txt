there are several ways to measure traffic safety: the number of highway fatalities ; the number of serious injuries from crashes ; the economic loss to people involved in crashes ; and the social cost of emergency response and accident - induced traffic delays .
to understand these numbers in context , other measures are often applied to produce rates such as number of events per million miles traveled , per million registered drivers , and per million persons in the total population .
these tools may be used , in different ways , to achieve three traffic safety goals: reducing the number of crashes ; reducing the severity of crashes ; and improving medical care for people injured in crashes .
the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled ( vmt ) is the most commonly cited measure of traffic safety , due in part to the seriousness of that outcome and in part to the fact that fatalities are closely tracked and unambiguous .
instead , it has had to rely on both carrots ( incentive grants ) and sticks ( penalties that reduce federal transportation funding ) to influence state governments to adopt and enforce traffic safety measures affecting driver behavior .
