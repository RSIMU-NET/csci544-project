over the past three decades , federal agencies and state and local governments have established a number of entities ( e.g. , units , centers , and task forces ) nationwide that may — in all or in part — collect , process , analyze , or disseminate information in support of law enforcement and counterterrorism - related efforts .
the federal government — specifically , the department of justice ( doj ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) — operates or , through grant funding or personnel , supports five types of these field - based information - sharing entities .
this report addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which these field - based entities are distinct , fragmented , overlapping , or potentially duplicative ; ( 2 ) the extent to which doj , dhs , and ondcp hold these entities accountable for coordination and have assessed opportunities for coordination to reduce overlap and duplication and what practices , if any , select entities have reported using to coordinate and achieve efficiencies ; and ( 3 ) how , if at all , doj , dhs , and ondcp incorporate information they collect on the results that these field - based entities achieve when making funding decisions for them .
