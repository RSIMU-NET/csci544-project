in fiscal year 1996 , excluding interest on the public debt , civilian employee pension benefits ( i.e. , civil service retirement and disability ) was the seventh largest mandatory spending program , with nearly $40 billion in payments to 2.3 million retirees and survivor annuitants .
as agreed with your office , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the number of federal retirees , if any , whose pensions have come to exceed the final salaries that they earned while working ; ( 2 ) explain why these retirees' pensions came to exceed their final salaries ; and ( 3 ) determine the difference , if any , in these retirees' pension amounts if current cost - of - living - adjustment ( cola ) policy — that is , the cola policy enacted in 1984 , which established the formula and schedule used today by the office of personnel management ( opm ) — had been in effect without interruption since 1962 , and also determine any difference in the number of retirees whose pensions would have exceeded their final salaries .
although current employees finance a portion of these benefits through the contributions they make , the federal government pays most pension costs , as do states and localities and private sector employers .
