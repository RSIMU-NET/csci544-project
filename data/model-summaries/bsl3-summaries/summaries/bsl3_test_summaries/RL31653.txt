in its place , congress instituted a system of supervised release , which applies to all federal crimes committed after november 1 , 1987 .
supervised release is the successor to parole in the federal criminal justice system .
parole ordinarily stands in lieu of a portion of the original term of imprisonment , while supervised release begins only after full service of the original term ( less any "good time" credits ) .
in 1984 , congress eliminated parole to create a more determinate federal sentencing structure .
both parole and supervised release call for a period of supervision following release from prison and for reincarceration upon a failure to observe designated conditions .
