as requested , this statement summarizes our draft report that ( 1 ) determines the status and plans of efforts to restructure the center weather service units , ( 2 ) evaluates efforts to establish a baseline of the current performance provided by the center weather service units so that faa and nws can ensure that any operational changes do not degrade aviation weather services , and ( 3 ) evaluates challenges to restructuring the center weather service units .
the national weather service ( nws ) plays a significant role in providing weather services to the aviation community .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the proposed changes to the aviation weather services provided at the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) en route centers .
to identify challenges , we compared the agencies' plans with best practices of leading organizations in system development , interagency collaboration , and architecture planning .
nws's weather products and data are vital components of faa's air traffic control system , providing weather information to local , regional , and national air traffic management , navigation , and surveillance systems .
