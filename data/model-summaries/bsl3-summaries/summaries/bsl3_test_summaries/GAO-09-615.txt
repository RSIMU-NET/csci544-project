u.s. government agencies including the department of defense ( dod ) , the department of state , and the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) have spent billions of dollars in afghanistan to encourage economic development , improve governance , increase security , and positively influence the afghan people .
we further recommend that the secretary of defense and administrator of usaid ; collaborate to create a centralized project - development database for use by u.s. government agencies in afghanistan , including establishing specific milestones for its development and implementation .
chief among dod's programs is the commander's emergency response program ( cerp ) .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the commander of u.s. central command to evaluate workforce requirements and ensure adequate staff to administer establish training requirements for cerp personnel administering the program , to include specific information on how to complete their duties and responsibilities .
dod partially concurred with our recommendation to require u.s. central command to evaluate workforce requirements and ensure adequate staff to administer the commander's emergency response program ( cerp ) .
due to significant congressional interest in this issue , we conducted a review of the cerp in afghanistan under the authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations on his own initiative and examined the following questions: to what extent ( 1 ) does dod have the capacity to manage and oversee the cerp in afghanistan and ( 2 ) has dod established mechanisms to coordinate its cerp projects with usaid ? .
