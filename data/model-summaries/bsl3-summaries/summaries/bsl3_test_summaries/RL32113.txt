one manifestation of this struggle occurs when congressional committees engage in oversight of the administrative bureaucracy ; another when members of congress attempt to intervene in administrative proceedings on behalf of private constituents or other private entities with interests affecting the member's constituency .
the inevitable tension between congress and the executive created by our constitutionally mandated system of separated but shared powers has been the source of continual interbranch conflict .
past high profile incidents raising questions regarding the legal and ethical propriety of congressional exertions of influence on administrative decisionmaking have surprisingly produced only a paucity of authoritative commentary on and analysis of the guiding principles and standards applicable to the constitutional bases of the roles members play when they act as part of the committee oversight process or in their individual representative capacities .
on relatively rare occasions these interventions have resulted in court actions challenging the congressional intercession as exertions of undue political influence on agency decisionmakers which violate the due process rights of participants in the proceedings in question and impugn the integrity of the agency decisional processes ; or in disciplinary proceedings before ethics committees of either house alleging that such member actions violated institutional rules or other ethical standards .
