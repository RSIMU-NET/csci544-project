with a staff of 64,000 , ssa administers the nation's largest federal program — social security — as well as the largest cash welfare program , supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
in that report , we highlighted the challenges that ssa would face as an independent agency: the shortfall in funds to pay future social security benefits , growing and changing disability caseloads , and public concerns about ssi program growth .
ssa's expenditures totaled $363 billion in fiscal year 1995 , nearly one - fourth of this nation's $1.5 trillion federal budget .
i am pleased to be here today to provide our assessment of the social security administration's ( ssa ) efforts to address policy and program issues and to prepare for managing the challenges it faces in the 21st century .
yet as ssa acknowledges , public confidence in its programs is low and has been low for some time .
today , i will describe these policy and program challenges and assess ssa's progress in addressing them and in preparing to manage its future challenges .
these efforts include the chief financial officers act of 1990 ( cfo act ) , the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) , and the government management reform act of 1994 ( gmra ) .
