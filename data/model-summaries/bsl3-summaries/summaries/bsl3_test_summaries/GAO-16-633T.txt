the u.s. coast guard , within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , is the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety , security , and environmental stewardship .
in recent years , the coast guard has begun to deploy new assets , such as national security cutters and fast response cutters , and has taken actions to assess what assets it needs to carry out its missions and how to best allocate its current assets .
the coast guard continues to face decisions about what assets it needs and how to best allocate those assets to meet its mission responsibilities .
the impact of balancing a broad array of coast guard missions , in conjunction with constrained budgets in recent years , have underscored the need for the coast guard to ensure it has the proper mix of assets and can effectively allocate them to achieve its mission responsibilities .
we have reported extensively on the coast guard's challenges in managing its multi - billion dollar major acquisition portfolio , intended to acquire assets and capabilities to conduct its various missions .
it is primarily based on our may 2016 report on the coast guard's allocation of assets ; as well as prior reports on the coast guard's acquisition of assets , in addition , my statement includes selected updates from may 2016 on the coast guard's efforts to reassess and update its mission needs , and fiscal year 2015 asset resource hour data .
