many questions pertain to the current restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations , including ( 1 ) the nature of the restrictions , ( 2 ) what constitutes an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the restrictions , and ( 3 ) whether the restrictions can be waived .
however , they also reflect long - standing debate over whether and to what degree the federal procurement process should be used to promote socioeconomic goals that one court described as "only indirectly related to conventional procurement considerations" ( i.e. , acquiring the supplies and services that best meet the government's needs at the lowest price ) .
as amended , this act prohibits the department of homeland security from awarding a contract to an inverted domestic corporation , or a subsidiary thereof , unless the secretary of homeland security determines that a waiver is necessary in the interest of national security .
these questions are shaped , in part , by the broader debate over whether such corporations are to be seen as "deserters," who change their corporate citizenship to avoid paying u.s. taxes , or as evidencing systemic problems in the u.s. tax code .
