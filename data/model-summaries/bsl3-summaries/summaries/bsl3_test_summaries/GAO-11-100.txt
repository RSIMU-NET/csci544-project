the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a separately organized agency within the department of energy ( doe ) , is working to re - establish the country's capability to produce tritium â€” a key radioactive isotope used to enhance the power of nuclear warheads and bombs .
in this context , in response to your request that we review the tritium readiness program , we ( 1 ) determined the extent to which nnsa has been able to overcome technical challenges producing tritium , ( 2 ) determined the extent to which nnsa is able to meet current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , and ( 3 ) assessed the management of nnsa's tritium readiness program .
this alternatives analysis should be coordinated closely with dod and take into account current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium .
complete an acquisition strategy that reflects the outcome of the analysis of alternatives and aligns the contracting structure to that plan and , if necessary , ensures adherence to the appropriate contracting procedures for long - duration contracts .
we are encouraged by nnsa's pledge to adjust its budget requests in response to changes in program needs and by other actions nnsa is taking to reduce its unexpended funding balances .
