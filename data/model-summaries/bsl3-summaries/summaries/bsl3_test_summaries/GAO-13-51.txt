direct the secretary of the navy to update its cost estimates and in doing so: include in its sensitivity analysis an assessment of the range of possible costs for extending the service life of other nonstructural components that are becoming obsolete and capability upgrades that may be required for some of the 150 aircraft , and obtain an independent review of the updated cost estimates .
considering that further slips in the f - 35 program may occur and could increase the scope and cost of the services' plans for upgrading and extending the service life of current aircraft , you asked us to ( 1 ) describe the air force and navy plans to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft , and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which cost estimates for these programs exhibit characteristics of a high - quality cost estimate .
to improve future updates of air force and navy cost estimates for upgrading and extending the service life of selected f - 16s and f / a - 18s and to improve the ability of decision - makers to assess the potential total costs , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following four actions: direct the secretary of the air force to update its cost estimates , and in doing so: include in its sensitivity analysis an assessment of the range of possible costs if the capability - upgrade and service - life extension programs are expanded to more than 300 aircraft including up to the maximum of 650 aircraft , and obtain an independent review of the updated cost estimates .
