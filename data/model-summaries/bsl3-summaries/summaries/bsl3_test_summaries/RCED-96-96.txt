specifically , we obtained the best available information on the ( 1 ) frequency of foodborne illness , ( 2 ) health consequences and economic impacts of foodborne illnesses , and ( 3 ) adequacy of knowledge about foodborne illnesses to develop effective control strategies .
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) is the federal agency primarily responsible for monitoring the incidence of foodborne illness in the united states .
over the past decade , a number of widely reported outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by microbial contamination — the most commonly identified cause of such outbreaks — have heightened the public's concern about the safety of food .
given the scale of the u.s. food production and distribution system and the lack of control over how consumers handle food after they purchase it , there is little likelihood that foodborne illnesses can be completely eliminated .
cdc coordinates its activities concerning the safety of the food supply with the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services and those concerning the safety of meat , poultry , and eggs with the food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) in the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .
