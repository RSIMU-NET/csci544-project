the primary federal law governing the manufacture , distribution , and use of prescription and illicit opioids is the controlled substances act ( csa or the act ) , which is administered and enforced by the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) in the u.s. department of justice .
the csa provides the legal regime through which the federal government ( 1 ) regulates and facilitates the lawful production , possession , and distribution of controlled substances , including opioids ; ( 2 ) prevents diversion of these substances from legitimate purposes ; and ( 3 ) penalizes unauthorized activities involving controlled substances .
t he alarming rise in drug overdose deaths involving opioids over the past two decades has prompted the federal government to examine the causes of the public health crisis , identify possible solutions to counteract the problem , and take actions to address the crisis .
legislative proposals introduced in the 115 th congress include the following: changes to the dea's authority to deny , revoke , or suspend a registration , and to issue immediate suspension order s .
the regulatory framework under the csa relies primarily on a registration system: the act requires persons who handle controlled substances ( such as drug manufacturers , wholesale distributors , exporters , importers , health care professionals , hospitals , pharmacies , and scientific researchers ) to register with the dea and comply with the terms and conditions of the registration .
