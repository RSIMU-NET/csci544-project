we appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss the status of efforts by the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) to plan for and coordinate the transformation of the nation's current air traffic control ( atc ) system to the “next generation air transportation system” ( ngats ) — a system intended to safely accommodate an expected tripling of air traffic by 2025 .
authorized in 2003 , jpdo is housed within the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , whose air traffic organization ( ato ) is responsible for modernizing and operating the nation's current atc system .
according to vision 100 , the legislation that authorized jpdo , the transformation to ngats will be completed by 2025 with the assistance of seven organizations that make up jpdo's senior policy committee: the departments of transportation , commerce , defense , and homeland security ; faa ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) ; and the white house office of science and technology policy .
