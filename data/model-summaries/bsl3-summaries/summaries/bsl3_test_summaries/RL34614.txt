this report identifies the potential environmental , health , and safety opportunities and challenges of nanotechnology ; explains the importance of addressing nanotechnology ehs concerns ; identifies and discusses nanotechnology ehs issues ; and summarizes several options for congressional action , including the nanotechnology ehs - related provisions of selected legislation .
a key issue before congress regarding nanotechnology is how best to protect human health , safety , and the environment as nanoscale materials and products are researched , developed , manufactured , used , and discarded .
while the rapidly emerging field of nanotechnology is believed by many to offer significant economic and societal benefits , some research results have raised concerns about the potential environmental , health , and safety ( ehs ) implications of nanoscale materials .
the nni is a multi - agency federal effort to coordinate and expand federal nanotechnology research and development ( r&d ) efforts .
potential tools the federal government might use to address these issues include research and development , regulation , and international engagement .
nanotechnology — a term encompassing nanoscale science , engineering , and technology — is focused on understanding , controlling , and exploiting the unique properties of matter that can emerge at scales of one to 100 nanometers .
