medicaid section 1115 demonstrations , which allow states to test and evaluate new approaches for delivering medicaid services , have become a significant feature of the medicaid program , increasing both in number and cost over the years and affecting millions of beneficiaries .
cms has also allowed states to use medicaid funds to finance costs that would not otherwise be eligible for federal funds , such as incentive payments to providers to improve access to and quality of care .
in november 2016 , nearly three - quarters of states operated at least part of their medicaid program under section 1115 demonstrations , and , in fiscal year 2015 , federal demonstration expenditures amounted to $109 billion or about one - third of medicaid program expenditures that year .
because medicaid section 1115 demonstrations ( hereafter referred to as demonstrations ) are intended to test new approaches to providing coverage and delivering medicaid services , evaluations of the demonstrations are essential to determining whether the new approaches are having their intended effect .
for example , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that oversees the medicaid program , has approved states' proposals to extend medicaid coverage under demonstrations to populations or for services that would not otherwise be covered under medicaid .
