at your request , we will first discuss the status of the national weather service ( nws ) systems modernization and then address the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring noaa's marine data .
in brief , although nws is nearing completion of its systems modernization effort , two significant challenges face it this year â€” deploying the final system of the modernization and ensuring that all of its mission - critical systems are year 2000 compliant .
last month , we continued to designate the nws systems modernization effort as a high - risk information technology area and the noaa fleet as an additional major management challenge confronting the department of commerce .
we appreciate the opportunity to join in today's hearing to discuss our work in two areas under the responsibility of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , a component of the department of commerce .
in the noaa fleet area , noaa now outsources for more of its research and data needs but plans to spend $185 million over the next 5 years to acquire four new replacement noaa fisheries research ships .
nws has made progress on both fronts .
