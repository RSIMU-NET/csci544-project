in november 2014 , in response to a gao recommendation , the department reestablished the joint requirements council ( jrc ) that the department had dissolved in 2006 , to review requirements submitted by dhs's component agencies ( e.g. , the transportation security administration ) .
the purpose of the council is to validate and prioritize operational requirements — those capabilities that are necessary to conduct dhs's mission — for all major acquisitions and to ensure that objective , analytical rigor supports these requirements .
