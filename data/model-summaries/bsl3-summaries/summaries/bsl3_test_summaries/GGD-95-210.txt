this report presents the results of our review of bank and thrift sales of mutual funds .
you also asked us determine the disclosure and sales practices of banks and thrifts with respect to mutual funds , and to evaluate the framework for regulation and oversight of bank and thrift mutual fund operations .
you requested that we report on the extent to which banks and thrifts have expanded into mutual fund activities .
this report recommends that the banking and securities regulators develop a common approach for conducting examinations of bank and thrift mutual fund activities .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the extent and nature of bank and thrift involvement in mutual fund sales , ( 2 ) assess whether the sales practices followed by banks and thrifts provide bank customers adequate disclosures of the risks of investing in mutual funds , and ( 3 ) analyze whether the existing framework for regulation and oversight of bank and thrift mutual fund sales practices and proprietary fund operations adequately protects investors .
but there were no signs there .
specifically , when nondeposit investment products are either recommended or sold to retail customers , the disclosures must specify that the product is ( 1 ) not insured by fdic ; ( 2 ) not a deposit or other obligation of the institution ; ( 3 ) not guaranteed by the institution ; and ( 4 ) subject to investment risks , including possible loss of the principal amount invested .
