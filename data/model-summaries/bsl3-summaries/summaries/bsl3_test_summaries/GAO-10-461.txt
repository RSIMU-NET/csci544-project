for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been challenged in modernizing its business systems .
in 1998 , the army initiated the logistics modernization program ( lmp ) in order to replace two aging army systems used to manage its inventory and its repair operations at the depots .
in 1995 , we designated dod's business system modernization program as high risk , and continue to do so because these systems are fundamental to addressing long - standing weaknesses related to the management of contracts , finance , and the supply chain .
you also asked us to monitor the actions taken by the army after the system has been deployed to ensure that its stated processes are adequate and have been effectively implemented .
this scorecard focused on four elements: ( 1 ) validating user access , ( 2 ) critical business processes validated by sites , ( 3 ) production support and infrastructure readiness , and ( 4 ) training readiness .
in written comments on a draft of this report , dod stated that the army concurred with our recommendations and highlighted the corrective actions it is taking to ( 1 ) improve testing activities to obtain reasonable assurance that the data used by lmp can support the lmp processes , ( 2 ) improve training for lmp users , and ( 3 ) establish performance metrics that will enable the army to assess whether the deployment sites are able to use lmp as intended .
