in general , when a request is submitted , representatives from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) meet with the state and compile a preliminary damage assessment ( pda ) .
when a state is overwhelmed by an emergency or major disaster , the governor may request assistance from the federal government .
the current fiscal environment , including concern over the federal deficit , has heightened congressional interest in the costs of disasters , leading to proposals to offset some portion of disaster assistance spending by implementing new budgetary mechanisms .
the president has the authority to make the declaration or deny the request .
if the increase in the number of declarations is a concern for the federal costs that accompany them ( or for other reasons which have been discussed in this report ) , congress may choose to address the issue .
addressing the issue may be conceptualized as two approaches: ( 1 ) limiting the number of declarations and ( 2 ) limiting the amount of spending that can occur after a declaration has been made .
congressional concern over the rising number of declarations is primarily focused on their associated costs because once declared , the majority of disaster relief costs ( at least 75% ) are shifted from the state to the federal government .
