u.s. insurers and congress face new policy issues and questions related to the opportunities and risks presented by the growth in the international insurance market and trade in insurance products .
the international aspects of insurance have spurred the creation of a variety of entities and measures , both domestic and foreign , to facilitate the trade and regulation of insurance services .
the new federal involvement in insurance issues , both domestic and international , has created frictions both among the federal entities and between the states and the federal entities , and has been a subject of both congressional hearings and proposed legislation .
financial services have been addressed in a number of u.s. trade agreements going back to the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) in 1994 .
the mccarran - ferguson act , passed by congress in 1945 , gives primacy to the individual states , and every state has its own insurance regulator and state laws governing insurance .
insurance is often seen as a localized product and u.s. insurance regulation has addressed this through a state - centric regulatory system .
the international association of insurance supervisors ( iais ) was created more than 20 years ago , largely under the impetus of the u.s. national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , to promote cooperation and exchange of information among insurance supervisors , including development of regulatory standards .
