to enhance dod's ability to determine whether the regional centers are achieving departmental priorities , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for policy to develop an approach to assess the regional centers' progress in achieving dod priorities , including identifying measurable goals and objectives , metrics , or other indicators of performance , and develop a methodology for using performance information , to include defining the role of the governance board in the process .
moreover , dod's ability to assess the regional centers' performance would provide congress with the information it needs as it evaluates current and similar programs and considers future funding levels .
in recent years , the department of defense ( dod ) has emphasized security cooperation approaches to build the defense capacity of foreign partners and advance the u.s. objective of international peace and cooperation .
until measurable program goals and objectives linked with performance metrics are implemented , dod cannot fully assess or adequately oversee the regional centers .
while dod has taken positive steps by establishing a new governance body and updating dod guidance applying to the regional centers for fiscal year 2013 , dod does not yet have a process to assess the regional centers' progress .
