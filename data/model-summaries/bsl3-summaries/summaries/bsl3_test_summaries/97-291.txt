97-291 - - nafta: related environmental issues and initiatives updated september 28 , 200 .
nafta's standards provisions do not affect a country's ability to determine its levelsof environmentalprotection for manufacturing and other process standards ( such as water pollution controls and resource harvestingpractices ) .
while not a new issue , the question ofwhether acountry's stricter environmental measures could be found to pose non - tariff trade barriers received an unprecedentedlevel of attentionduring the nafta debate .
environmental issues emerged early in nafta negotiations , and linkages between trade and environmental issues were reflected inthe outcome of these negotiations more so than in any previous trade talks .
a related concern was that expected nafta - driven industrialization andpopulation growthin the u.s. - mexico border region would worsen the severe pollution problems already present .
ultimately , the nafta parties included language to conditionally protect a party's stricter environmental,health , and safetystandards for products and produce ( provided that , among other things , such measures are scientifically based ) .
at least20 cases have beenfiled , including 6 against the united states , one of which involves california's ban on methyl tertiary butyl ether ( mtbe ) in gasoline .
