preventive health care services can extend lives and promote well - being among our nation's seniors .
such preventive services are a growing part of medicare , the federal government's health insurance program for some 34 million americans age 65 and older , as well as 6 million younger disabled persons .
medicare , administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , now covers 10 preventive services â€” 3 types of immunizations and 7 types of screening .
what action has cms taken to increase use of preventive services among the medicare population ? .
screening for some types of cancer may extend and improve the quality of life through early detection and treatment .
for example , immunizations against the flu can prevent thousands of hospitalizations and deaths each year among those age 65 and older .
to answer these questions , we estimated medicare beneficiaries' use of services from a nationwide , state - based survey conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .
these beneficiaries may , for example , face barriers in obtaining the services or simply choose not to use them .
