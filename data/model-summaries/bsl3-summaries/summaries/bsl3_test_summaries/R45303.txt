an officially secular nation , india has a long tradition of religious tolerance ( with periodic and sometimes serious lapses ) , which is protected under its constitution .
although religious discrimination and intolerance of social dissent is hardly new to india , the 2014 election of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) to majority status at the federal level — the party won 52% of parliament's lok sabha ( lower - house ) seats in that year's national elections — triggered concerns among human rights advocates that agents of overt hindu majoritarianism would be empowered .
for some observers , prime minister modi's 2016 u.s. visit — and address to a joint session of congress — completed the "political rehabilitation" of a foreign leader who was at one time viewed by many in the united states as a pariah: in 2005 , modi had been denied a u.s. visa over concerns about his role in government during lethal anti - muslim violence in gujarat in 2002 .
in the weeks leading up to modi's june 2016 visit to washington , dc , some members issued public criticisms of india's human rights record .
