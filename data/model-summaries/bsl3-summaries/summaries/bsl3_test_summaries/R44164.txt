the u.s. department of education ( ed ) determines title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) based on four separate funding formulas: basic grants , concentration grants , targeted grants , and education finance incentive grants ( efig ) .
it is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other students attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low - income families .
this report provides a general overview of the key components of each of the four formulas used to allocate title i - a funds and changes to these factors made by the essa .
the leas , in turn , distribute funds to schools , often based on the percentage of children in each school eligible for free or reduced - price lunch .
the state then makes specific adjustments to the grant amounts , including reserving funds for administration and school improvement and determining grants for charter schools that are their own leas .
