i am pleased to have the opportunity to provide information on our recent review of the 2004 – 05 influenza vaccine shortage , with lessons to consider as the nation improves its ability to respond to an influenza pandemic ( a global influenza outbreak resulting from a major genetic change in the influenza virus ) .
concern about the nation's preparedness to respond to an influenza pandemic has been growing for some time , in part because of the increase in the number of identified human cases of avian influenza in asia .
the nation's experience responding to the shortage of annual influenza vaccine for the 2004 – 05 influenza season — in which the nation faced an unexpected loss of nearly half its projected vaccine supply — offers insight into the some of the challenges that federal , state , and local entities will face if a pandemic occurs .
this body of work includes interviews with officials in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , such as officials from the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the national vaccine program office .
studies suggest that a pandemic's effects in the united states could be severe , and shortages of vaccine could occur .
