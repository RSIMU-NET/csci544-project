their interest has been sparked by the debate over the south korea - u.s. free trade agreement ( korus fta ) , which would lower or eliminate u.s. tariffs and non - tariff barriers on most imports from south korea .
some , particularly the agreement's opponents , argue that the agreement could lead to increased u.s. imports of goods or components made in north korea .
a number of groups and individuals have recently focused attention on u.s. rules governing imports from north korea .
as a result of north korea's relative economic isolation , the undeveloped state of its export sector , and u.s. trade restrictions , the united states imports virtually no finished goods from north korea .
the korus fta will not enter into force unless congress approves implementation legislation , which obama administration officials have said they expect to send to the 112 th congress .
the ability of the united states to enforce its restrictions would then depend to a large extent upon the level of u.s. - south korea customs cooperation — which arguably would be enhanced by the korus fta — and the severity of the penalties charged for non - compliance with u.s. import restrictions .
