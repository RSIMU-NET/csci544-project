iran's ballistic missile program dates to the late 1970s after the shah was overthrown and the islamic republic of iran established .
this is because there is little transparency in iran's ballistic missile programs , which has led to some degree of a lack of confidence in iran's public assertions of its activities .
many consider that iran's ballistic missile development was in full force by the mid - 1980s during its protracted war against iraq , during which iran reportedly launched more than 600 ballistic missiles .
iranian ballistic missile proliferation has been a matter of u.s. and international concern .
ballistic missile defense ( bmd ) program in general and the u.s. proposed missile defense system in europe specifically , as well as u.s. diplomatic efforts to curb iranian long - range ballistic missile programs .
because of the secrecy inherent in the development of weapon systems , especially in less open societies , open - source analyses reflect a wide - range of technical views and assessments .
the new iranian government embarked on a ballistic missile program marked by considerable secrecy .
today , there is little disagreement among most experts that iran has acquired some number of ballistic missiles from other countries and has developed other ballistic missiles indigenously or in cooperation with others .
