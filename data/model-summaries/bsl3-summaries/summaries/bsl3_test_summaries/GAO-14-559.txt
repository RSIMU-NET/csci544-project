the objectives of our review were to determine ( 1 ) what is known about the effectiveness of ignition interlocks in reducing alcohol - impaired driving and ( 2 ) the extent to which the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) has assisted states in implementing ignition - interlock programs , including the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) ignition - interlock grant program .
this report discusses ( 1 ) what is known about the effectiveness of ignition interlocks in reducing alcohol - impaired driving and ( 2 ) the extent to which nhtsa has assisted states in implementing ignition - interlock programs , including the map - 21 ignition - interlock grant program .
for such states , the incentive and relatively limited funding offered by the grant is not likely to outweigh the challenges of changing state ignition - interlock laws to eliminate exemptions .
according to the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) , all states have enacted legislation requiring or permitting the use of ignition interlocks .
most recently , the 2012 surface transportation reauthorization act — moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) — also included funding for a new grant program for states with laws mandating that all drivers convicted of dwi be allowed to drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock .
