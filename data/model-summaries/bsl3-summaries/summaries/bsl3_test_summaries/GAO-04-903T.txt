my testimony today will summarize and update , where possible , key findings from our 2002 report related to ( 1 ) trends in crime against volunteers and the agency's system for generating such information , ( 2 ) the agency's field implementation of its safety and security framework , and ( 3 ) the underlying factors that contributed to peace corps' performance in the field .
the administration intends to increase this number to about 14,000 over the next few years , and congress has increased appropriations for the peace corps to support this expansion .
in many countries , female volunteers face special challenges ; more than a third of female volunteers report experiencing sexual harassment on at least a monthly basis .
about 7,500 peace corps volunteers currently serve in 70 “posts” ( country missions ) around the world .
i am pleased to be here to discuss peace corps' efforts to ensure the safety and security of its volunteers .
volunteers often live in areas with limited access to reliable communications , police , or medical services .
the agency has made some progress but has not completed implementation of these initiatives .
