issues that appear to continually challenge u.s. cybersecurity efforts include uncertainty of the geographic location of the perpetrators of cyber attacks ; the evolving integration of mobile technology devices into critical information infrastructure ; the introduction of new vulnerabilities to the nation's infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated threats ; a poorly coordinated federal - private sector approach to addressing emerging risks ; and legal ambiguities with respect to u.s. response and offensive actions .
a persistent set of issues has stymied significant progress in detecting and deterring existing threats and implementing effective safeguard measures .
comprehensively addressing national cybersecurity - related issues is a difficult task because of a number of technical and policy considerations .
