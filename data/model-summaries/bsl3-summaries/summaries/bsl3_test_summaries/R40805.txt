111-117 ) , after congress had passed the conference version of the bill on december 10 , 2006 .
the enacted bill provided a total of $122.1 billion , $15.1 billion ( 14.1% ) more than the equivalent figure provided in fy2009 and $1.1 billion less than the amount requested by the administration .
the president's net fy2010 request for the programs covered by this appropriations bill was $123.2 billion ( after scorekeeping adjustments ) .
other factors , such as supplemental appropriations for response to disasters ( such as the damage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes in the fall of 2005 ) and changes in the makeup of the department of transportation ( portions of which were transferred to the department of homeland security in 2004 ) , also complicate comparisons of year - to - year funding .
this was $16.2 billion ( 15.1% ) more than the amount enacted in the fy2009 thud appropriations act .
