specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine whether marad will meet the statutory deadline of september 2006 to dispose of its obsolete ships and , if not , what factors may prevent it from doing so ; and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which marad has used alternative methods , other than ship scrapping , to dispose of its obsolete ships and the barriers to using such alternatives .
key elements necessary for effective program management that are missing or inadequate include ( 1 ) an integrated strategy and milestones for meeting the 2006 deadline ; ( 2 ) an identification of total resources needed to achieve the program's goals ; ( 3 ) measures of progress toward achieving the goals ; ( 4 ) identification of external factors , particularly those related to legal , regulatory , and environmental issues , which could impact the program's progress , and strategies to mitigate these factors ; ( 5 ) a decision - making framework ; and ( 6 ) an evaluation and corrective action plan .
