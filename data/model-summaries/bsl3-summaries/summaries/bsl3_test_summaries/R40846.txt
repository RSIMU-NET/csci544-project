the health care reform debate raises many complex issues including those of coverage , accessibility , cost , accountability , and quality of health care .
underlying these policy considerations are issues regarding the status of health or health care as a moral , legal , or constitutional right .
congress' power to tax and spend for the general welfare and its power to regulate interstate commerce have been the primary sources of constitutional authority for most health care legislation .
in addition , other statutes , such as title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 which prohibits discrimination under federally funded programs , affect the manner of delivery of services under federal grants .
for purposes of this report , discussion will be limited to constitutional and legal issues pertaining to a right to health care .
it may be useful to distinguish between a right to health and a right to health care .
while the united states constitution and supreme court interpretations do not identify a constitutional right to health care at the government's expense , congress has enacted numerous statutes which establish and define statutory rights of individuals to receive medical services from the government .
