our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the status of the small business lending fund ( sblf ) ; ( 2 ) identify reasons for variation in growth of qualified small business lending at sblf banks ; and ( 3 ) actions the department of the treasury ( treasury ) has taken to evaluate sblf participant lending patterns .
in response to concerns about challenges faced by small businesses in recent years , congress enacted the small business jobs act of 2010 , which authorized the secretary of the department of the treasury ( treasury ) to make up to $30 billion of capital available and offered incentives to financial institutions to increase small business lending .
among other things , the law aimed to stimulate job growth by establishing the small business lending fund ( sblf ) to encourage financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion to increase their lending to small businesses with up to $50 million in annual revenues .
