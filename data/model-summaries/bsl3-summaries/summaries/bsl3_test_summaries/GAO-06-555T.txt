our march 2006 report examined ( 1 ) the process nrc used to develop the april 2003 dbt for nuclear power plants , ( 2 ) the actions nuclear power plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised dbt , and ( 3 ) nrc's efforts to strengthen the conduct of its force - on - force inspections .
my testimony today is based on our report being released today , entitled nuclear power plants: efforts made to upgrade security , but the nuclear regulatory commission's design basis threat process should be improved ( gao - 06-388 ) .
to defend against a potential terrorist attack , nrc issues and enforces security - related regulations and orders , and nuclear power plant licensees implement security measures to meet nrc requirements .
furthermore , according to the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , which regulates and oversees the safe operation and security of nuclear power plants , there continues to be a general credible threat of a terrorist attack on the nation's commercial nuclear power plants , in particular by al qaeda and like - minded islamic terrorist groups .
as you know , nuclear power plants were among the targets considered in the original plan for the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
