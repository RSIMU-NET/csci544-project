as part of its mission , the internal revenue service ( irs ) strives to maintain the highest possible level of tax compliance .
our past work has discussed some of the problems with attempts to research noncompliance and related solutions through igps.for example , we raised concerns about whether igps ( 1 ) focused on taxpayer populations with significant compliance shortfalls and ( 2 ) collected statistically valid data that could be generalized to a larger population .
irs annually audits a number of tax returns to determine whether taxpayers have voluntarily complied with the tax laws and paid the proper amounts of tax .
information gathering projects ( igp ) are one technique that irs uses to collect information on noncompliance and to identify returns with audit potential .
this report responds to your request for information on the ( 1 ) number of igps nationwide and in irs' georgia district during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , ( 2 ) descriptions and results of igps in the state of georgia during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , and ( 3 ) controls and procedures irs has in place for igps .
in selecting returns for audit , irs' computer assigns a score to each filed return to help find those having audit potential â€” that is , those for which an audit would be likely to change the reported tax because of noncompliance .
