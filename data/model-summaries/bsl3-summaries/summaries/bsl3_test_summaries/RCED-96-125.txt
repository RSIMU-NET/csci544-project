over the past several decades , manufacturing has been declining in many of the nation's cities .
to help you evaluate whether these provisions in s. 1285 would encourage redeveloping the brownfields in the nation's cities , you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) what the universe of potential brownfield sites nationwide is , ( 2 ) what legal barriers superfund presents for redeveloping brownfields , and ( 3 ) whether the proposed loans to local governments are likely to be sufficient for conducting site assessments .
the senate's proposed legislation to reauthorize superfund , s. 1285 , seeks to encourage local governments to redevelop brownfields by addressing two of the barriers to redevelopment: liability under the superfund legislation and the costs of assessing the sites .
when the businesses closed , they left abandoned and idled properties commonly known as “brownfields,” which are sometimes contaminated with chemical wastes from the manufacturing processes .
because , in part , of the high cost of assessing the sites to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to clean them up in accordance with federal and state environmental laws , some new businesses have chosen to locate on uncontaminated sites outside of urban areas , known as “greenfields.” these decisions lead to the loss of tax revenue and employment in central city neighborhoods .
