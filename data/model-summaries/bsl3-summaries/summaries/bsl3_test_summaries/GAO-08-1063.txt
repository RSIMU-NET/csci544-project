to determine whether existing department of defense ( dod ) funds control systems , processes , and internal controls provide reasonable assurance that potential antideficiency act ( ada ) violations will be prevented and detected , we interviewed dod comptroller officials and reviewed gao and dod inspector general audit reports , including financial - related reports ; performance reports ; and reports specifically related to the ada , compliance with laws and regulations , or both .
federal agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , are responsible for ensuring that appropriated funds are used only for purposes , and within the amount and time frames , prescribed by the congress .
to comply with legal and regulatory requirements , dod must implement and maintain administrative controls that ensure the proper use of its appropriated funds , including the use of accounting and funds control systems that are able to accurately record obligations , collections , and disbursements against appropriations and the accounts established to track the status of appropriations .
to improve management and oversight of preliminary reviews and formal investigations of potential ada violations , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) to take the following two actions to update the department's fmr to require that ( 1 ) ada case files document that the investigating officer ( s ) selected to conduct a preliminary review or formal investigation is ( are ) free of personal , external , and organizational impairments and ( 2 ) dod components maintain documentation of the date by which an investigating officer must receive refresher training in order to remain qualified to perform ada reviews and investigations .
