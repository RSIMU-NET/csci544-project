this report discusses ( 1 ) the extent to which these agencies collect and maintain information on the post - government employment activities of these officials and ( 2 ) the key challenges the agencies face in enforcing post - government employment restrictions and fara requirements .
congress has enacted specific post - government employment restrictions designed to protect the u.s. government from the improper use of government information or other undue influence by former government employees .
to enhance justice's ability to ensure that the american people know the identity of persons trying to influence u.s. government policy in the united states on behalf of foreign entities , congress may wish to consider ( 1 ) granting the department of justice civil investigative demand authority to inspect records of persons justice believes should be registered as foreign agents and ( 2 ) requiring persons claiming certain exemptions to provide advance written notification to justice before engaging in the exempt activities .
our past work has found problems with the u.s. government's implementation of these laws .
in addition , justice officials have cited a lack of clear legal authority and a lack of resources as barriers to monitoring compliance with fara registration requirements .
