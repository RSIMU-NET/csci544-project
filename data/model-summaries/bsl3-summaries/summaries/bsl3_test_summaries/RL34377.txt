during the past six decades , congress on four occasions has approved legislation designed to regulate lobbyist contact with members of congress .
in 1995 , congress passed , and the president signed into law , the lobbying disclosure act , which repealed the 1946 act and created a detailed system of reporting thresholds .
finally , in 2007 , congress amended the 1995 act to further enhance disclosure and reporting requirements for lobbyists and lobbying firms .
the initial provisions , which were contained in the legislative reorganization act of 1946 , required that lobbyists register with the house of representatives and the senate and dis close certain receipts and expenditures .
in reporting the lda , the house judiciary committee summarized the need for new lobbying provisions: the act is designed to strengthen public confidence in government by replacing the existing patchwork of lobbying disclosure laws with a single , uniform statute which covers the activities of all professional lobbyists .
it also creates a more effective and equitable system for administering and enforcing the disclosure requirements .
the lobbying disclosure act ( lda ) of 1995 provided specific thresholds and definitions of lobbyists , lobbying activities , and lobbying contacts , compared to the 1946 act .
