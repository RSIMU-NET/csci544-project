our objectives for this report were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the air force's on - order and on - hand secondary inventory reflects the amount of inventory needed to support requirements from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , and ( 2 ) the air force had shortages in its inventory needed to support requirements from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 .
each of the military services and the defense logistics agency ( dla ) maintain a supply of secondary inventory of spare parts to keep military equipment operating for its missions .
inventory that is not in dod's possession but for which contracts have been awarded or funds have been committed is considered to be on order .
dod has reduced the overall value of its secondary inventory â€” from more than $100 billion in 1990 to about $67 billion as of september 30 , 2002 .
at a time when u.s. military forces and their equipment are in high demand , the effectiveness and efficiency of the department of defense's ( dod ) inventory management is critical to ensure that the warfighter is supplied with the right items at the right time .
