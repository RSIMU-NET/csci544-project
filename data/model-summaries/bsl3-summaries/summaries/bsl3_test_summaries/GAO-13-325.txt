to better inform dod's efforts to enhance competition , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following three actions: identify and track the specific factors that affect the competition rate , such as foreign military sales , and consider this information when setting annual competition goals for each dod component ; develop guidance that could enable dod components to apply lessons learned from past procurements to increase competition for the same good and services in the future ; and develop an action plan for dod components to collect reliable data on competitive procurements for which only one offer is received , so that the department can determine the effect of its new requirement on one - offer contracts .
the objectives for this review were to examine ( 1 ) trends in the department of defense's ( dod ) use of noncompetitive awards ; ( 2 ) factors influencing dod's competition rate ; ( 3 ) the extent to which justifications for exceptions to competitive procedures provided insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards ; and ( 4 ) the impact of dod's new requirement on contracts awarded using competitive procedures but for which only one offer was received .
