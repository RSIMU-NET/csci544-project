our objectives for this review were to describe ( 1 ) the known water resource effects of biofuel production in the united states ; ( 2 ) the agricultural conservation practices and technological innovations that exist or are being developed to address these effects and any barriers that may prevent the adoption of these practices and technologies ; and ( 3 ) key research needs regarding the effects of biofuel production on water resources .
in recent years , the federal government has increasingly encouraged the use of biofuels and other alternatives to petroleum in response to concerns over u.s. dependence on imported oil , climate change , and other issues .
the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa ) expanded the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) by requiring that u.s. transportation fuel contain 9 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2008 and increasing this amount annually to 36 billion gallons in 2022 .
