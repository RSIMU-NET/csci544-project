our high - risk program , supported by this committee and the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs , has brought much - needed focus to problems impeding effective government and costing billions of dollars each year .
this year , due to significant progress made , we narrowed the high - risk designation for two areas â€” protecting public health through enhanced oversight of medical products and dod contract management .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) regularly convenes meetings with agency leaders and gao to discuss progress updates on high - risk issues .
in addition , top administration officials have continued to show their commitment to ensuring that high - risk areas receive attention and oversight .
we have categorized our concerns about va's ability to ensure the timeliness , cost - effectiveness , quality , and safety of the health care the department provides into five broad areas: ( 1 ) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes , ( 2 ) inadequate oversight and accountability , ( 3 ) information technology challenges , ( 4 ) inadequate training for va staff , and ( 5 ) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities .
