ffmia requires the cfo act agencies to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with ( 1 ) federal financial management systems requirements , ( 2 ) applicable federal accounting standards , and ( 3 ) the u.s. government standard general ledger ( sgl ) at the transaction level .
this report , our eighth , discusses ( 1 ) the auditors' assessments of agency systems' compliance with ffmia for fiscal year 2003 and the financial management systems problems that continue to affect systems' ffmia compliance and ( 2 ) the challenges agencies have faced when implementing financial systems to help move toward ffmia compliance .
to address this long - standing weakness of the federal government , the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 designates executive branch officials with responsibility for the modernization of financial management systems , so that the systematic measurement of performance ; the development of cost information ; and the integration of program , budget , and financial information for management reporting can be achieved .
as shown in figure 2 , the combination of reforms ushered in by the ( 1 ) cfo act of 1990 , ( 2 ) government performance and results act of 1993 , ( 3 ) government management reform act of 1994 , ( 4 ) ffmia , ( 5 ) clinger - cohen act of 1996 , and ( 6 ) accountability of tax dollars act of 2002 , if successfully implemented , provides a solid basis for improving accountability of government programs and operations as well as routinely producing valuable cost and operating performance information .
