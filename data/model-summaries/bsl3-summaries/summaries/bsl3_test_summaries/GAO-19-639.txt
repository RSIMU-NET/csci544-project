you asked us to review faa's safety oversight of airport terminal areas — runways , taxiways , and ramp areas ( the area from the gate to the taxiway or runway , where aircraft are prepared for departure and arrival ) — and update our prior work , including our 2011 report on terminal area safety .
to address both objectives , we reviewed our prior work and other published work on faa's runway and taxiway safety efforts , including those from faa , the department of transportation's ( dot ) inspector general , and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) .
what efforts have faa and others implemented to improve terminal area safety , and how does faa assess their effectiveness ? .
the u.s. airspace system is one of the safest in the world , but incidents and near misses at and around u.s. airport runways and taxiways still occur .
to identify faa's and other stakeholders' efforts , including technologies , to improve terminal area safety and determine how faa assesses their effectiveness , we reviewed documentation of faa , airports' and airlines' current or planned terminal area initiatives .
