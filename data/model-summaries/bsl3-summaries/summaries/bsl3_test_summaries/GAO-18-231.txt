 ( recommendation 2 ) .
the department of defense's ( dod ) 2005 round of base realignment and closure ( brac ) was the largest , costliest , and most complex of the five brac rounds since 1988 .
since 2005 , we have issued more than 40 reports and testimonies on brac 2005 planning , implementation , costs , and savings ; this work highlights information dod can use to improve its process for developing and implementing brac recommendations .
in this report , we assess the extent that dod ( 1 ) measured the achievement of its goals for reducing excess infrastructure , transforming the military , and promoting jointness for brac 2005 and ( 2 ) implemented prior gao recommendations and addressed any additional challenges faced in brac 2005 to improve performance for any future brac round .
by implementing the 198 recommendations approved by the 2005 brac commission , dod closed 23 major bases , realigned 24 major bases , combined 26 installations into 12 joint bases , and eliminated about 12,000 civilian positions .
congress has not authorized additional brac rounds to date .
congress should consider , in any future brac authorization , a requirement for dod to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness and to track the achievement of its goals .
