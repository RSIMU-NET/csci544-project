gsa provided the results of its study to the house and senate committees on appropriations in november 2010 and also reported on its efforts to implement the federal strategic sourcing initiative â€” office supplies ii ( os ii ) , an initiative focused on leveraging the government's buying power to realize savings .
to conduct our work , we analyzed the data gsa used for its study ; met with and obtained documentation from officials at gsa and the departments of homeland security , air force , navy , and army , which were among the 10 agencies in gsa's study ; and reviewed contract documentation associated with the os ii initiative .
the conferees also directed gao to assess the gsa study , with particular attention to the potential for savings .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the general services administration's ( gsa ) efforts to reduce prices that federal agencies pay for office supplies .
concerned that federal agencies may not be getting the best prices available , the conferees on the consolidated appropriation act , 2010 , directed gsa to conduct a study of the office supply purchases made by the top 10 largest federal agencies .
