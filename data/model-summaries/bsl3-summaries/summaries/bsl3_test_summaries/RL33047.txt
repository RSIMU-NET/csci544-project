the receipt of "gifts" by members and staff of the house of representatives and of the senate , including the receipt or acceptance of payment or reimbursement of travel expenses from outside , private , third - party sources , is generally restricted by the operation of federal statutory law , as applied by the house and senate rules .
the wording of the house and senate rules on this subject are substantially identical , other than as to the permissible duration of such trips , which is limited in the house to four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel ( excluding travel days ) , and in the senate to three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel ( also excluding travel days ) .
this report discusses the statutory and congressional rule structure under which members of the house and senate , under an exception to the gift rules , may generally accept from some private sources — other than registered lobbyists or registered foreign agents — necessary travel expenses , including transportation , food and lodging , for travel "in connection with" their official duties , such as for fact - finding trips , conferences or symposia , under certain circumstances and limitations .
