the earned income credit ( eic ) is a refundable tax credit available to low - income , working taxpayers .
our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) irs's communications with taxpayers about recertification meet the needs of irs and taxpayers , ( 2 ) information taxpayers are told to provide to prove their entitlement to the eic is reasonably easy to obtain and consistent with what irs examiners accept in making recertification decisions , and ( 3 ) examiners are consistent in how they assess supporting documentation provided by taxpayers .
because of a concern about the extent of erroneous eic claims , the congress included provisions in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( tra97 ) that led to the internal revenue service's ( irs ) establishment of a compliance effort known as the eic recertification program .
most relevant to this report , ( 1 ) the definitions of qualifying child and eligible foster child for eic purposes have changed and ( 2 ) starting with tax returns filed in 2001 , irs , as authorized by tra97 , began imposing a 2-year ban on credits to taxpayers who it determines negligently claimed the eic through reckless or intentional disregard of the regulations .
