specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the progress made by the 23 states that are required to implement enhanced i&m programs , including the difficulties that the states have encountered , and ( 2 ) the impact that delays in implementing enhanced i&m programs may have on the states' ability to comply with the national air quality standard for ozone .
motor vehicles are responsible for up to half of the emissions of volatile organic compounds ( voc ) that affect ozone levels and up to 90 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions found in urban areas .
although the united states has significantly improved its air quality since the 1970s , air pollution problems , such as ozone and carbon monoxide , continue to threaten the health of millions of americans .
101-549 , nov. 15 , 1990 ) requires the states with the most serious ozone and carbon monoxide problems — 23 states have been identified — to implement enhanced inspection and maintenance ( i&m ) programs to reduce the emissions from motor vehicles .
in view of the pivotal role that enhanced i&m programs play in reducing voc emissions and the delays experienced to date in implementing these programs , as well as the possibility of future delays , we recommend that the administrator of epa compile information on the more successful practices , such as public relations campaigns , used by the states that have implemented their enhanced i&m programs and share the information with those states that are in the early stages of developing and implementing their programs .
