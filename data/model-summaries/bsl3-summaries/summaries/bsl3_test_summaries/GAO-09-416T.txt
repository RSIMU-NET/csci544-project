this endeavor was in response to the 1995 dod travel reengineering report issued by the dod task force to reengineer travel that pinpointed the following three principal causes for the department's inefficient travel system: ( 1 ) travel policies and programs focused on compliance with rigid rules rather than mission performance , ( 2 ) travel practices that did not keep pace with travel management improvements implemented by industry , and ( 3 ) nonintegrated travel systems .
after completing additional work , we plan to issue a report on the status of dod's actions on gao's previous recommendations , which will include any further recommendations needed to improve the department's implementation of dts and ensure its success in the future .
in december 1995 , the department of defense ( dod ) established the program management office — defense travel system ( pmo - dts ) to begin improving the department's travel operations by replacing existing travel systems with a single departmentwide system — dts .
today , our testimony will focus on the actions dod has taken to implement previous gao recommendations regarding implementation of dts and related travel policies , phase out legacy travel systems and their associated costs , and implement electronic travel voucher processing .
