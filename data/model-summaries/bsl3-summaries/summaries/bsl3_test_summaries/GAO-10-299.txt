to meet urgent needs , the department of defense ( dod ) can authorize contractors to begin work and incur costs before reaching a final agreement on the contract terms and conditions â€” known as an undefinitized contract action ( uca ) .
to identify and assess the actions the department of defense ( dod ) has taken to improve departmental insight into and oversight of undefinitized contract actions ( uca ) , we interviewed senior dod and service acquisition policy officials as well as local officials at the selected commands to identify new policies and guidance that would affect the amount of insight senior dod officials have .
the act requires dod to issue guidance that would include ( 1 ) circumstances in which it is appropriate for dod to use ucas , ( 2 ) procedures for ensuring compliance with definitization timelines and obligation amounts , ( 3 ) procedures for compliance with regulatory limitations on profit or fee with respect to costs incurred prior to definitization , and ( 4 ) reporting requirements for ucas that fail to meet required timelines for definitization or regulatory limitations on the obligation of funds or on profit or fee .
