child welfare agencies seek to ensure the well - being of children and their families , including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have a safe and permanent home .
as the u.s. constitution has been interpreted , states have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare .
other legislative proposals would authorize or require new services and protections for children in ( or about to enter ) foster care ; seek to improve services for youth who are aging out of care ( including those who have already exited due to age ) ; encourage greater access to a range of services for kinship caregivers and further encourage their involvement as decision - makers and use as caregivers for children who cannot remain safely with their parents ; aim to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment efforts of state child welfare agencies ; permit direct access to federal title iv - e funds for tribal governments ; and make other related changes intended to enhance the safety , permanence , and well - being of children .
the bulk ( $4.6 billion ) of this money was appropriated to reimburse states for the cost of providing foster care for children who meet federal eligibility criteria ( estimated 43% of national foster care caseload in fy2006 ) .
