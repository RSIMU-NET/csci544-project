the dod science and technology ( s&t ) community is tasked with ensuring that technologies are mature when dod's acquisition community takes over and integrates the technologies into weapon systems .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on the technological superiority of its weapon systems and armed forces to protect u.s. interests at home and abroad .
specifically , our objectives are to ( 1 ) identify techniques that commercial companies use to transition mature technologies before the start of product development and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which dod is using these techniques .
in fiscal year 2006 , dod plans to spend approximately $13 billion in its science and technology efforts to develop technologies that are as innovative as stealth and global positioning were when they were first developed .
although the united states has produced the best weapons in the world , its acquisition programs often incur cost overruns , schedule delays , and performance shortfalls that undermine dod's buying power .
this dilemma is due in part to dod's difficulty transitioning technologies from a technology development environment to an acquisition program .
dod has continued to allow the acquisition community to take over this task before the s&t community considers the technologies ready for transition .
