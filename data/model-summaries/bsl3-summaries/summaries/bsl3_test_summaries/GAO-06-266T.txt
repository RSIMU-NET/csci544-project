keys to making this safety oversight system work are to: ( 1 ) establish programs that focus resources on areas of highest safety risk and on mitigating risks ; ( 2 ) provide training and other communication to ensure that inspectors maintain the skills and knowledge to consistently carry out the agency's oversight programs ; and ( 3 ) have processes and data to continuously monitor , evaluate , and improve the numerous oversight programs that make up the safety oversight system .
this record is a result of the efforts of the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , airlines , manufacturers , and others in the aviation industry to maintain one of the safest aviation systems in the world .
the u.s. commercial aviation industry , with less than one fatal accident per 5 million flights from 2002 through 2005 , has an extraordinary safety record .
this statement focuses on these three key areas of faa's “early warning system” and is based on our recent reports on faa's inspection oversight programs , industry partnership programs , enforcement program , and training program .
faa's enforcement program , which is an outgrowth of its inspection process , is intended to ensure industry compliance with safety regulations and is another important element of its safety oversight system .
