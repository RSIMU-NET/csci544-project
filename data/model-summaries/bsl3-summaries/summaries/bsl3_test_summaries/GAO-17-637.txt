consider consumer disclosure requirements for air ambulance providers , which could include information such as established prices charged , business model and entity that establishes prices , and extent of contracting with insurance .
to describe what is known about factors affecting prices and selected stakeholders' views on actions the federal government could take to address pricing , we selected and interviewed 26 stakeholders , including representatives from: 8 air ambulance providers ( 3 large independent providers and 5 hospital - affiliated providers ) chosen to represent a range of business model types ( independent and hospital - affiliated ) , sizes , and known perspectives in the industry ; 2 associations representing air ambulance providers ; 6 groups familiar with air ambulance business and billing , such as industry analysts and consultants ; 4 states active in assessing air ambulance costs and prices charged ; 2 associations of state officials ; 2 associations representing health insurers ; and 2 groups involved with consumer policy or research .
we compared the u.s. department of transportation's ( dot ) practices and procedures for aspects of its air ambulance oversight to federal internal control standards related to information collection and external communication .
