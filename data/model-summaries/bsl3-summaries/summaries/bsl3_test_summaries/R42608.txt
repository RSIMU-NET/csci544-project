recently , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) reached settlements with barclays , in which the british bank admitted submitting false responses to the survey used to calculate libor and the euro interbank offer rate ( euribor ) to manipulate the indexes .
american policymakers have a number of concerns , including the possibility that american banks that participate in the libor survey may also have attempted to manipulate the index , the effect that changes in libor can have on borrowers and lenders whose contracts reference libor to determine the interest rate of a loan , and the reliance of policymakers on libor as one of the indicators of the stability of the financial system .

libor is an index that measures the cost of funds to large global banks operating in london financial markets or with london - based counterparties .
the u.s. banks on the dollar panel include bank of america , citibank , and jpmorgan chase , although all of the listed banks have significant u.s. activities .
