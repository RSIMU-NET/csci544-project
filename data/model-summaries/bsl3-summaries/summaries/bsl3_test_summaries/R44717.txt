during the first session of the 115th congress , congress faced numerous international trade and finance policy issues .
also significant are administration initiatives to potentially revise the two largest existing u.s. ftas , through the ongoing renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , and modification talks regarding the u.s. - south korea ( korus ) fta .
continued focus on the u.s. - china economic relationship , and economic sanctions against iran , cuba , north korea , russia , and other countries also have been of interest to congress .
in engaging on these issues , congress may conduct oversight of the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , and potentially consider implementing legislation for a revised nafta , and oversight of modification of the korus fta ; consider new bilateral trade agreement negotiations , including with the uk or japan ; examine the status of trade negotiations launched under the previous administration , including the potential transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) with the european union ( eu ) , a potential plurilateral trade in services agreement ( tisa ) , and ongoing discussions at the wto , as well as the future implications of the tpp without u.s. participation ; conduct oversight and take possible legislative action concerning a range of other trade issues , including u.s. trade relations with china and other major economies , as well as u.s. export and import policies and programs ; and monitor developments in capital flows and global debt levels , the international financial institutions and u.s. funding levels , the evolution of the aiib , and other countries' exchange rate policies , among other international finance issues .
