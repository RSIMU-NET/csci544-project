as agreed with your office , we examined ( 1 ) the current status of the superfund program , ( 2 ) the factors guiding epa's selection of sites to be placed on the npl , and ( 3 ) the program's future outlook .
to assess the npl listing process , we evaluated epa's minimum eligibility criteria , policies , guidance , and recent practices ; we also assessed the extent of epa's coordination with states .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) estimates that one in four americans lives within 4 miles of a hazardous waste site .
congress established the superfund program in 1980 to address the threats that these sites pose to human health and the environment .
in our review of cleanup actions , we focused on remedial actions , which are generally costly and can take a long time to complete .
however , it is unclear whether the advisory council will reach consensus on its recommendations ; and its findings are not expected until december 2003 , at the earliest .
within the superfund program , states may enter into agreements with epa to perform certain program actions , such as initial site assessments ; epa also consults with states on cleanup decisions throughout the cleanup process .
