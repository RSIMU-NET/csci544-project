we focused on identifying companies that ( 1 ) were publicly traded prior to the termination of their pension plan ( s ) , ( 2 ) had significant unfunded pension liabilities on a termination basis ( $100 million or more ) , ( 3 ) had a high unfunded liability per plan participant ratio ( $10,000 or more per participant ) , and ( 4 ) had more than 5,000 plan participants .
the pension benefit guaranty corporation's ( pbgc ) mission is to protect the pensions of almost 44 million american workers and retirees who participate in more than 29,000 defined benefit pension plans .
given the recent decline in global financial markets and increase in corporate bankruptcies , pbgc's deficit will likely continue to increase , with implications for pbgc's financial position .
in may 2009 , pbgc's acting director testified before the senate special committee on aging that through the first two quarters of 2009 , pbgc's estimated deficit had tripled to reach $33.5 billion , due largely to an increase in completed and probable plan terminations and a decrease in interest rates .
to determine pay and other benefits received by selected executives , we first obtained data from pbgc to identify companies whose underfunded plans had been terminated in the past 10 years .
