this report considers population longevity in the united states , as measured by life expectancy .
life expectancy is the expected number of years to be lived , on average , by a particular cohort , if current mortality trends continue for the rest of that cohort's life .
this tells us that , for those born in calendar year 2003 in the united states , 50% will die before that age ; the other half will live longer .
in addition , it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years .
it most commonly refers to life expectancy at birth , the median number of years that a population born in a particular year could expect to live .
specifically , the leading causes of the racial disparity were hypertension ( which contributed 15.0% to the disparity ) , followed by hiv disease ( 11.2% ) , diabetes ( 8.5% ) , and homicide ( 8.5% ) in a recent analysis .
while this report concentrates on trends and differentials in life expectancy at birth , appendix b table b - 2 provides estimates of life expectancy at selected additional ages in 2003 ( the most recent final data available ) .
