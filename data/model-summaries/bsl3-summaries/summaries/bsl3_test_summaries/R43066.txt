a health insurance exchange has been established in every state , as required by the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) .
a state can choose to establish its own state - based exchange ( sbe ) .
if a state opts not to , or if the department of health and human services ( hhs ) determines that the state is not in a position to administer its own exchange , then hhs will establish and administer the exchange in the state as a federally facilitated exchange ( ffe ) .
each exchange has two parts , a marketplace where individuals can shop for and enroll in health insurance coverage , and a small business health options program ( shop ) exchange for small employers .
in some cases , a state has partnered with hhs to establish and administer the exchange , and in other cases hhs is administering the individual exchange while the state administers the shop exchange .
each exchange is expected to generate its own funds to sustain its operations beginning january 1 , 2015 .
the center for consumer information and insurance oversight ( cciio ) at cms is responsible for implementing aca's private health insurance reforms and administering the grant programs discussed above .
