this act creates the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , a fixed federal funding stream that replaces the aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program and a number of welfare programs in which federal funding matched state spending and increased automatically with caseloads .
specifically , you asked us to report on ( 1 ) how state budgetary resources , including federal aid , have been allocated since states have had access to tanf funds , ( 2 ) what plans states are making to assure programmatic stability in times of fiscal and economic stress , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states have used , or plan to use , the program's federal contingency fund and the loan fund which are available for downturns or other emergencies affecting states .
in 1996 the congress made sweeping changes to national welfare policy in passing public law 104-193 , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) .
you asked us to review states' fiscal decisions for the tanf block grant and to address whether states are taking steps now to prepare for the effects of future economic downturns on their welfare programs .
