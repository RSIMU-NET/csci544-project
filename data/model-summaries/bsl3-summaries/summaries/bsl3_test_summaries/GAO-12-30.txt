in this report , we examine ( 1 ) the information required for submitting a report of harm to saferproducts.gov , ( 2 ) the extent to which the information required for submitting a report of harm is sufficient to identify the product and to allow cpsc to review a manufacturer's claim that a report of harm contains materially inaccurate information ( mii ) , and ( 3 ) the length of time cpsc takes to review and resolve manufacturers' claims of material inaccuracy in a report of harm .
on august 14 , 2008 , congress passed the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) to strengthen cpsc's authority to enforce safety standards and provide greater public access to product safety information .
we assessed the reliability of these data by ( 1 ) performing electronic testing , ( 2 ) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them , and ( 3 ) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data and related management controls .
to effectively implement the recent amendments to cpsia , we recommend that cpsc enhance the analytic methods it uses to identify product information in a report of harm , such as by verifying whether the model field in its data contains a number ( versus a text response , which would not meet the statutory requirement ) or by searching for model numbers or serial numbers that may be listed in other fields .
