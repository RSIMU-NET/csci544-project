the department of energy ( doe ) contracts with private companies and educational institutions to manage and operate 18 of its 22 laboratories .
these are cost reimbursement contracts under which doe pays all of its contractors' allowable costs .
responding to criticism that its historical contracting practices were costly and inefficient , doe switched to performance - based contracts in 1994 as part of its contract reform program .
doe did not implement our recommendation and has no plans to measure the overall costs and benefits of performance - based contracting for its laboratories .
we noted that although doe maintained that its performance - based incentives have been effective in achieving the desired end results , it had not been clear whether these successes were due to performance - based incentives or to an increased emphasis on program management .
doe's implementation of performance - based contracting for its laboratories is in a state of transition .
an important feature of performance - based contracting is providing incentives , including fees , to the contractor's achievement of objectives as a means of encouraging superior performance and lowering costs .
the report noted that the use of incentives has been effective in directing contractors' attention to performance outcomes and has improved communications concerning performance expectations .
