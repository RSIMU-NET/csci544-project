the department of energy ( doe ) is responsible for managing the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile , including surveillance of weapons currently in the stockpile to identify reliability and safety problems .
our objectives in this review were to ( 1 ) provide information on the status of doe's stockpile surveillance program ; ( 2 ) if the program is not on schedule , determine why it is not ; and ( 3 ) provide information on the steps being taken to return the program to the schedule .
furthermore , without contingency plans , doe's ability to respond to possible future major disruptions in its testing operations is uncertain .
doe conducts three types of stockpile surveillance tests — flight tests , nonnuclear systems laboratory tests , and nuclear and nonnuclear component tests — on nine types of nuclear weapons .
we recommend that the secretary of energy direct that the assistant secretary for defense programs develop detailed , written plans to restore stockpile surveillance tests to the contingency plans for testing facilities to provide for continued testing operations in the event that a testing facility is shut down for an extended period of time .
