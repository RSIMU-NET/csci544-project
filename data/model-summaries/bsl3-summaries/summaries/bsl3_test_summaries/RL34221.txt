as discussion of tax strategy patents may continue in the 112 th congress , a review of this controversial category of patents is appropriate .
proposed legislation in previous sessions of congress demonstrates legislative interest in the recently recognized phenomenon of patented tax strategies .
previously introduced , but unenacted legislation defined a "tax planning invention" as "a plan , strategy , technique , scheme , process , or system that is designed to reduce , minimize , determine , avoid , or defer , or has , when implemented , the effect of reducing , minimizing , determining , avoiding , or deferring , a taxpayer's tax liability or is designed to facilitate compliance with tax laws...." under the proposed legislation , such inventions would not have been patentable .
still others believe that the patent system should not provide incentives for individuals to develop new ways to reduce their tax liability .
according to some experts , tax strategy patents may limit the ability of taxpayers to utilize provisions of the tax code , interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations .
the proposed , but unenacted legislation would have stipulated that patents upon tax strategies could not be obtained .
