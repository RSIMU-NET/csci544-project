visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program to develop a system to collect biographic data ( such as name and date of birth ) and biometric data ( such as fingerprints ) from foreign nationals at u.s. ports of entry .
within dhs , u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is tasked with , among other duties , inspecting all people applying for entry to the united states to determine their admissibility to the country .
beginning in 1996 , federal law has required the implementation of an entry and exit data system to track foreign nationals entering and leaving the united states .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 required the secretary of homeland security to develop a plan to accelerate implementation of a biometric entry and exit data system that matches available information provided by foreign nationals upon their arrival in and departure from the united states .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement a biometric exit system .
since 2004 , dhs has tracked foreign nationals' entries into the united states as part of an effort to comply with legislative requirements , and since december 2006 , a biometric entry capability has been fully operational at all air , sea , and land ports of entry .
