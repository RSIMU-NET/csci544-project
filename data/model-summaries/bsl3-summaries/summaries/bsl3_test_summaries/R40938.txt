a day later , on january 9 , 2013 , venezuela's supreme court upheld this interpretation of the constitution , maintaining that chávez could take the oath of office before the supreme court at a later date when his health improves .
some opposition leaders and some venezuelan legal scholars had argued that the january 10 inauguration date was fixed by article 231 , and that since chávez could not be sworn in on that date , then the president of the national assembly should have been sworn in as interim or caretaker president until either a new election was held or chávez recovered .
on january 8 , 2013 , vice president nicolás maduro announced that president chávez would not be sworn into office on january 10 as planned because he was still recovering from cancer surgery in cuba , but that he would be sworn into office at a later date , as provided for in article 231 of the constitution .
opposition leader henrique capriles appeared to accept the supreme court's interpretation of the constitution , but maintained that it did not end the uncertainties facing the country .
voters delivered a resounding victory to president chávez and his united socialist party of venezuela ( psuv ) , which won 20 out of 23 states .
