because the veterans corporation's programs are still in their early stages , we agreed with the staffs of the house and senate committees on small business and veterans' affairs to describe ( 1 ) the veterans corporation's efforts in providing small business assistance to veterans , including service - disabled veterans ; ( 2 ) the use of and controls over federal funds to provide these services ; and ( 3 ) the efforts of the veterans corporation to become financially self - sufficient .
the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 ( act ) , as amended , created the veterans corporation and , among other things , requires it to ( 1 ) improve access to technical assistance that promotes entrepreneurship , and ( 2 ) use public and private resources to assist veterans , including service - disabled veterans , with the formation and expansion of small businesses .
recognizing the need to assist the nation's veterans who choose to start or expand small businesses in their transition from military to civilian life , congress created the national veterans business development corporation ( the veterans corporation ) — a chartered corporation — to provide small business and entrepreneurship assistance .
