in addition to providing printing services to the federal government , the government printing office ( gpo ) provides government publications to the public through its sales program at 24 bookstores across the country ; by telephone , fax , and mail order sales at its headquarters in washington , d.c. ; and through consigned sales agents in other agencies .
specifically , our objectives were to determine the facts surrounding the september 1996 inventory reduction: whether it followed existing policies and procedures , and how 3,258 copies of the senate 1789-1989 , a four - volume set written by senator byrd , were destroyed as part of that reduction .
gpo was established in 1861 to ( 1 ) assist congress and federal agencies in the production and replication of information products and services , and ( 2 ) provide the public with government information products and services .
gpo periodically reviews its inventory of publications to determine whether any can be considered excess — i.e. , no longer expected to sell — and then disposes of the excess copies .
this report responds to your request of july 21 , 1997 , that we review gpo's procedures involving the management of its inventory of publications that it determines to be excess , particularly its management of a major inventory reduction of excess publications that took place in september 1996 .
