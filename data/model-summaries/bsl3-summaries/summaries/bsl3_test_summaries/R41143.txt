the most prevalent pta today is a free trade agreement ( fta ) , such as the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) or the u.s. - australian fta .
preferential trade agreements ( ptas ) comprise a variety of unilateral , bilateral , or regional arrangements which favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences .
if ptas , on balance , create more trade ( by allowing production to shift to the more competitive producers in the agreement ) than they divert ( by shifting trade from lower - cost non - pta members to higher - cost members because of tariff preferences extended to members ) , they are said to be a building block or complement for the world trading system .
the world trade organization ( wto ) permits countries to enter into ptas under certain conditions , but the criteria are very elastic , and the examination by the wto as to their consistency with wto rules has not been rigorous .
given the need for the u.s. economy to rely on an increase in exports for faster growth , these concerns have also resonated in congress and the obama administration .
