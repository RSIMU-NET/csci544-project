you requested that we ( 1 ) determine the efforts civilian federal agencies are making to address their future acquisition workforce needs and identify the challenges , if any , they have encountered and ( 2 ) identify any “lessons learned” from the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to develop strategic plans for its acquisition workforce .
in order to leverage the experiences of federal agencies' efforts , including those of dod , to address future acquisition workforce needs , we recommend that the ofpp administrator work with procurement executives to ensure that the lessons learned from these efforts are shared with all federal agencies as they continue with their initiatives to improve the acquisition workforce .
four organizations — the office of personnel management ( opm ) , the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) , the procurement executives council ( pec ) , and the federal acquisition institute ( fai ) — have roles to play in dealing with workforce and acquisition workforce issues .
we included the following six civilian agencies in our review: the general services administration ( gsa ) , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the department of treasury , and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
