this report responds to your request that we review the internal revenue service's ( irs ) processes for handling undeliverable mail .
since the revenue act of 1928 , irs has been required to send such notifications to a taxpayer's last known address .
the internal revenue code ( irc ) requires irs to notify taxpayers of taxes they might owe and about actions it plans to take to collect the taxes .
a taxpayer's last known address was not defined by the revenue act nor has it been defined by department of the treasury regulations .
the postal service is also supposed to forward mail to taxpayers' new addresses if a change of address form has been submitted to it .
to help irs better manage its undeliverable mail we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue take the following actions: better encourage taxpayers to make address changes by ( 1 ) accepting changes of address over the telephone ; ( 2 ) making form 8822 , change of address , more conveniently available ; and ( 3 ) emphasizing to taxpayers the importance of keeping their addresses current with irs .
irs recognizes this problem and generally attempts to notify taxpayers of their tax obligations by sending additional notices to addresses it believes may be more current than the addresses in its records .
