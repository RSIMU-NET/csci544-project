the indian health service ( ihs ) , part of the public health service ( phs ) of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , funds health services to about 1.8 million indians , members of the nation's 562 federally recognized american indian and alaska native ( ai / an ) tribes in ihs service delivery areas .
the federal government's delivery of health services to indians , and funding of tribal and urban indian health programs , has developed over more than a century .
foremost is the reauthorization of the ihcia ( and related amendments to the social security act ( ssa ) ) .
it also shows ihs appropriations for recent years and discusses its current statutory authorities and legislative issues , including the reauthorization of appropriations in the indian health care improvement act ( ihcia ) and several other policy issues .
no ihcia reauthorization bill has been introduced in the 111 th congress as of the date of this report , although medicaid - related provisions concerning cost - sharing , property exclusions , and consultation have been included in current draft economic - stimulus legislation .
the federal government considers its provision of these health services to be based on its trust responsibility for indian tribes , a responsibility derived from federal statutes , treaties , court decisions , executive actions , and the constitution ( which assigns authority over indian relations to congress ) .
