the disability insurance portion of the old - age , survivors and disability insurance ( oasdi ) program was enacted in 1956 and provides benefits to disabled workers under the full retirement age ( fra ) in amounts based on an individual's career - average earnings in covered employment .
a statutory formula determines monthly payment levels for social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) .
in addition , the law also eliminates from benefit calculations one year of a ssdi beneficiary's lowest earnings for every five years of earnings ( also known as the one - for - five rule ) , which equates to a maximum of five "disability dropout years" for an individual with 25 or more years of earnings .
by statute , ssa also applies "childcare dropout years" ( cdys ) for years in which a beneficiary has zero earnings due to leaving the workforce to care for an infant child .
ssdi benefits , like those of the old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) program , are meant to replace income from work that is lost by incurring one of the risks the social program insures against .
