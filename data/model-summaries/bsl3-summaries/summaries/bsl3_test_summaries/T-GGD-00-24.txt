i am pleased to be here today to discuss the challenges that face the national archives and records administration ( nara ) and federal agencies in their efforts to manage the rapidly increasing volume of electronic records .
records generated electronically , such as electronic mail ( e - mail ) messages , word processing documents , cd roms , and world wide web site pages , present special archival challenges for nara and the agencies because these technologies are new and constantly changing .
consistent , sustained oversight from congress â€“ through avenues such as today's hearing - - is needed to ensure that records management policies and practices keep pace with today's environment .
also , because of the wide variance in electronic records management ( erm ) policies and practices at four agencies we visited , we recommended that nara conduct a baseline survey of all agencies as a part of its planned business process reengineering ( bpr ) effort .
in that report , we noted that nara and the agencies must address several hardware and software issues to ensure that electronic records are properly created , permanently maintained , secured , and retrievable in the future .
