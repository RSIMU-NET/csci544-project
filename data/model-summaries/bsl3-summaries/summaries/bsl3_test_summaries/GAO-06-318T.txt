we appreciate the opportunity to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on us - visit ( the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ) , a multibillion - dollar program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) that is intended to achieve a daunting set of goals: to enhance the security of our citizens and visitors and ensure the integrity of the u.s. immigration system , and at the same time to facilitate legitimate trade and travel and protect privacy .
to achieve these goals , us - visit is to record the entry into and exit from the united states of selected travelers , verify their identity , and determine their compliance with the terms of their admission and stay .
this legislation also directed us to review these plans .
since fiscal year 2002 , the house and senate appropriations committees have provided valuable oversight and direction to dhs on us - visit by legislatively directing it to submit annual expenditure plans for committee approval .
our reviews have produced four reports that , among other things , described dhs progress against legislatively mandated milestones and identified fundamental challenges that the department faced in delivering promised program capabilities and benefits on time and within cost .
