thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the department of defense ( dod ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) interagency program office and the office's role regarding va's electronic health record modernization ( ehrm ) program .
the use of information technology ( it ) is crucial to helping the departments effectively serve the nation's veterans and , each year , the departments spend billions of dollars on information systems and assets .
such initiatives include modernizing va's electronic health information system â€” the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) .
both va and dod have long recognized the importance of advancing the use of shared health information systems and capabilities to make patient information more readily available to their health care providers , reduce medical errors , and streamline administrative functions .
in developing this testimony , we relied on our previous reports and testimonies related to the interagency program office , as well as va's and dod's electronic health record system programs and modernization efforts .
to expedite the departments' efforts to exchange electronic health care information , congress included in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , provisions that required va and dod to jointly develop and implement electronic health record systems or capabilities and to accelerate the exchange of health care information .
