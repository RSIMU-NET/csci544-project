at the request of senator kay bailey hutchison , gao last year reviewed the care of the aircraft collection of the smithsonian's national air and space museum ( nasm ) .
as currently structured , the smithsonian will have to raise at least $100 million in private funds for its construction .
to be successful , the smithsonian will have to carry through on its initiated actions to develop a more clearly defined mission , collection priorities , and plans for the care of aircraft .
in its october 1995 report , smithsonian institution: better care needed for national air and space museum aircraft ( gao / ggd - 96-9 , october 19 , 1995 ) , gao found that nasm committed relatively few resources to aircraft restoration , compared to other museum activities .
further , it remains to be seen how successful the smithsonian will be in raising private funds for the dulles extension and how long this effort will take .
further , in september 1996 , the smithsonian board of regents approved a resolution encouraging the formation of partnerships with other museums that could care for smithsonian artifacts as a means of reducing storage problems .
