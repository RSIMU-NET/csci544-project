specifically , we are reporting on ( 1 ) the flooding and erosion threats that alaska native villages currently face , ( 2 ) the federal programs that are available to assist villages facing potential disasters , ( 3 ) the status of village relocation efforts , and ( 4 ) how federal assistance to relocating villages is prioritized .
to determine the federal programs that are available to assist villages facing potential disasters , we met with officials from additional federal agencies , such as the department of homeland security's federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , interior's bureau of indian affairs , the department of health and human service's indian health service , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and the department of transportation's federal aviation administration .
in december 2003 , we reported that most of alaska's more than 200 native villages were affected to some degree by flooding and erosion , most commonly caused by severe storm events on alaska's coastline or by river flooding , such as during the spring breakup of river ice .
flooding and erosion have caused millions of dollars of property damage in these remote villages and , in some cases , pose imminent threats to lives , homes , and infrastructure .
