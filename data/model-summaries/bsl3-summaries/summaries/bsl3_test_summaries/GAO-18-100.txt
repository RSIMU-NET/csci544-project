generally , health care insurers set three types of cost - sharing parameters: ( 1 ) deductibles — costs a beneficiary is responsible for before the health insurance plan will start to pay any costs ; ( 2 ) coinsurance or copayments ( per - service payments ) once the deductible is met ; and ( 3 ) caps — limits on the maximum cost - sharing amount a beneficiary can be responsible for during a year for covered services .
modernizing medicare's cost - sharing design would have both direct and indirect effects on beneficiaries' costs .
specifically , groups have proposed that medicare ffs's cost - sharing design be simplified and include features found in private plans ( including in medicare advantage ( ma ) , the private plan alternative to medicare ffs ) , which have evolved over time to promote prudent use of health care services and protect beneficiaries from catastrophic care costs .
gao and others have long noted concerns about the design of medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) cost - sharing — the portion of costs for covered services that beneficiaries are responsible for when they receive care .
