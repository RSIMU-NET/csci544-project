in my statement today , i will discuss ( 1 ) factors contributing to poor contracting outcomes and accountability , ( 2 ) long - standing issues in the department of defense's ( dod ) management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces , and ( 3 ) efforts to improve the capacity of the iraqi government .
about $45 billion was provided for reconstruction efforts , including rebuilding iraq's oil and electricity sectors , improving its security forces , and enhancing iraq's capacity to govern .
between fiscal years 2001 to 2008 , congress appropriated nearly $700 billion for the global war on terrorism .
in prior reports , gao recommended that , to improve accountability and minimize opportunities for fraud , waste , and abuse of u.s. funds , ( 1 ) dod adopt sound business processes in its acquisition strategies , such as definitizing contracts in a timely fashion and strengthening accountability procedures ; ( 2 ) dod leadership ensure implementation of and compliance with existing guidance to improve its management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces ; and ( 3 ) u.s. agencies work with iraq to develop strategic plans for key sectors .
