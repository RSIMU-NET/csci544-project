the crude oil windfall profit tax act ( p.l .
96-223 ) was enacted in 1980 as part of acompromise between the carter administration and the congress over the decontrol of crude oilprices .
the structure of the wpt was based on the structure of the oil price control program .
despite its name , the crude oil windfall profit tax was not a tax on profits .
however , the tax's role in increasingdependence on imported oil , distorting resource use in the energy markets and the economy , as wellas the administrative and compliance burden of the tax , all played a role in its repeal .
several bills would appropriate the proceedsfor the low - income home energy assistance program , which gives grants to poorerhouseholds to offset high energy bills and for residential weatherization .
the tax was imposed on the difference between the market price of oil , which wastechnically referred to as the removal price , and a statutory 1979 base price that was adjustedquarterly for inflation and state severance taxes .
the major economic issues concerning the wpt and its effects were: revenues , increaseddependence upon foreign oil , economic efficiency , and the tax's administrative and complianceburden .
