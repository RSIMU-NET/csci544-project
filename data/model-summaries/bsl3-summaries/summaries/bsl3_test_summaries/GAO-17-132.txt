this report examines ( 1 ) potential safety impacts of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems and repairs for commercial motor carriers and their drivers , and ( 2 ) factors that could affect the feasibility and cost of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems and repairs .
therefore , this estimate may not cover the full cost of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems .
large trucks and buses transport billions of tons of freight and travel hundreds of billions of miles every year on our nation's highways .
to perform this work , we reviewed relevant regulations , information on other existing systems for self - reporting safety - related information , ( fmcsa's national consumer complaint database and the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) aviation safety action program ) , and our past work on fmcsa's compliance , safety , accountability ( csa ) program .
if a driver identifies some aspect of his or her vehicle's equipment that is out of compliance with these regulations — for instance brakes that do not adequately stop and hold the vehicle — the carrier ( or its agent , e.g. , the driver or a repair facility ) is responsible for repairing the problem before the vehicle is on the road .
