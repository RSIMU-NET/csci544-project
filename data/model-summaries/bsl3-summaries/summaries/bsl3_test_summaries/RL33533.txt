the kingdom of saudi arabia's relations with the united states , its stability , and its future trajectory are subjects of continuing congressional interest .
this package of previously discussed and newly proposed defense sales is intended to address saudi needs for maritime and coastal security improvements , air force training and support , cybersecurity and communications upgrades , missile and air defenses , and enhanced border security and counterterrorism capabilities ( see " arms sales , security assistance , and training " below and appendix b ) .
u.s. - saudi security cooperation and u.s. concern for the continuing global availability of saudi energy supplies continue to anchor official bilateral relations as they have for decades .
previously , the obama administration had differed with saudi leaders over iran , the iranian nuclear program , and conflicts in syria , iraq , and yemen .
from 2012 through 2016 , the obama administration notified congress of proposed foreign military sales to saudi arabia with a potential value of more than $45 billion .
in this context , the trump administration's efforts to reinvigorate u.s. - saudi relations have drawn increased public attention and have generated debate .
