many hold requests take the form of a letter addressed to the majority or minority leader ( depending on the party affiliation of the senator placing the hold ) expressing reservations about the merits or timing of a particular policy proposal or nomination .
many decisions the senate makes — from routine requests for additional debate time , to determinations of how legislation will be considered on the floor — are arrived at by unanimous consent .
efforts to modify the original request may be undertaken — a process that can require extensive negotiations between and among senate leaders and their colleagues — but there is no guarantee that a particular objection can be addressed to the satisfaction of all senators .
senate rules , procedures , and precedents give significant parliamentary power to individual senators during the course of chamber deliberations .
when a unanimous consent request is proposed on the floor , any senator may object to it .
the senate hold emerges from within this context of unanimous - consent decision - making as a method of transmitting policy or scheduling preferences to senate leaders regarding matters available for floor consideration .
unless the target of a hold is of considerable importance to the majority leader and a supermajority of his colleagues — 60 of whom might be required to invoke cloture on legislation under senate rule xxii — the most practical course of action is often to lay the matter aside and attempt to promote negotiations that could alleviate the concerns that gave rise to the hold .
