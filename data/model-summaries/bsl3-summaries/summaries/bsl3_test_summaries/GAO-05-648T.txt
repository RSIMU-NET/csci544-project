i appreciate the opportunity to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on the implementation of the freedom of information act ( foia ) .
at that time we recommended that justice ( 1 ) encourage agencies to make material electronically available and ( 2 ) review agency annual reports to address specific data quality issues .
specific requests by the public for information through the act have led to disclosure of waste , fraud , abuse , and wrongdoing in the government , as well as the identification of unsafe consumer products , harmful drugs , and serious health hazards .
to help ensure appropriate implementation , the act requires that agencies report annually to the attorney general , providing specific information about their foia operations .
generally speaking , foia establishes that federal agencies must provide the public with access to government information , thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions .
the department of justice and the office of management and budget ( omb ) both have roles in the implementation of foia .
to assess implementation of foia , we examined , consolidated , and analyzed annual report data for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 from 25 major agencies ( herein we refer to this scope as governmentwide ) .
