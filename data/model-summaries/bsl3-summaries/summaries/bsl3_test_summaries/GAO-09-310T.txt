my statement today is based on our report , which ( 1 ) describes how regulation has evolved in banking , securities , thrifts , credit unions , futures , insurance , secondary mortgage markets and other important areas ; ( 2 ) describes several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades that have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system ; and ( 3 ) presents an evaluation framework that can be used by congress and others to shape potential regulatory reform efforts .
we prepared this work under the authority of the comptroller general to help policymakers weigh various regulatory reform proposals and consider ways in which the current regulatory system could be made more effective and efficient .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our january 8 , 2009 , report that provides a framework for modernizing the outdated u.s. financial regulatory system .
as a result of 150 years of changes in financial regulation in the united states , the regulatory system has become complex and fragmented .
to do this work , we synthesized existing gao work and other studies and met with representatives of financial regulatory agencies , industry associations , consumer advocacy organizations , and others .
