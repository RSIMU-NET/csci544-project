today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the control environment established by the un for managing the sanctions and oil for food program ; ( 2 ) other key internal control elements addressed by the un , including lines of authority and responsibility , risk assessment , and monitoring and oversight ; and ( 3 ) our observations on the lessons learned from the oil for food program .
iraq obtained more than $67 billion in oil revenues through the program ; as of november 2003 , about $31 billion in commodities and humanitarian assistance had been delivered to iraq .
in 1996 , the un and iraq began the oil for food program to address growing concerns about iraq's humanitarian situation after international sanctions were imposed in 1990 .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the lessons learned from the united nations ( un ) oil for food program and the implications for future sanctions programs and ongoing un reform efforts .
the intent of the program was to allow the iraq government to use the proceeds of its oil sales to pay for food , medicine , and infrastructure maintenance and , at the same time , prevent the regime from obtaining goods for military purposes .
