carbon capture and sequestration ( or storage ) — known as ccs — is a physical process that involves capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) at its source and storing it before its release to the atmosphere .
an integrated ccs system would include three main steps: ( 1 ) capturing co 2 at its source and separating it from other gases ; ( 2 ) purifying , compressing , and transporting the captured co 2 to the sequestration site ; and ( 3 ) injecting the co 2 into subsurface geological reservoirs .
the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) has pursued research and development of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated ccs system since 1997 .
u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) proposed rules and guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new and existing coal - fired power plants have been a focal point of discussion in congress about ccs .
congress has appropriated nearly $7 billion in total since fy2008 for ccs research , development , and demonstration ( rd&d ) at doe's office of fossil energy: nearly $3.5 billion in total annual appropriations ( including fy2015 ) and $3.4 billion from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l .
