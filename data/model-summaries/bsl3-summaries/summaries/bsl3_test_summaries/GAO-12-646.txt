this report focuses on ( 1 ) the factors that have affected the resources available in the fbf , ( 2 ) gsa's potential maintenance and repair liability for its owned assets and the implications for the fund , and ( 3 ) the information gsa considers when evaluating capital investment proposals and how its practices compare to leading practices for prioritizing capital investments .
our overall approach to addressing these topics was to ( 1 ) review laws , studies , and gao , gsa inspector general , and congressional research service reports on federal real property and the fbf ; ( 2 ) analyze data and documents pertaining to the fund's balance , including budget requests and appropriations acts from fiscal years 2006 to 2012 ; ( 3 ) evaluate the financial performance of gsa's real property portfolio of approximately 10,000 assets based on data from fiscal years 2006 through 2011 ; ( 4 ) analyze data maintained by gsa on the identified repairs needed in its owned assets ; ( 5 ) compare gsa capital investment practices to leading practices for making capital investment decisions identified in the office of management and budget's ( omb ) capital programming guide and gao's executive guide ; ( 6 ) interview gsa officials and omb staff on the state of gsa's real property portfolio ; and ( 7 ) review the four highest cost repairs and alterations projects of gsa's fiscal year 2012 budget submission to assess data used to determine project requirements and how gsa evaluated project alternatives .
