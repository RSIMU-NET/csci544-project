in 1997 , the social security administration ( ssa ) paid about $66 billion to 9.3 million disabled beneficiaries under the social security disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs .
to help ensure that only eligible beneficiaries remain on the rolls , ssa is required by law to conduct continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) for all di beneficiaries and some ssi disability recipients to determine whether they continue to meet the disability requirements of the law .
to fund this 7-year initiative , the congress authorized a total of about $4.1 billion .
ssa's regulations call for cdrs to begin as soon as 6 months after benefits are awarded for some beneficiaries , or as long as 7 years after benefits are awarded for other beneficiaries .
ssa funds state agencies called disability determination services ( dds ) to process disability applications and conduct cdr medical reviews in accordance with ssa policies and procedures .
ssa developed a plan for a 7-year initiative to conduct about 8.2 million cdrs during fiscal years 1996 through 2002 .
in fiscal year 1996 , to reduce the unnecessary costs incurred by not doing cdrs , ssa and the congress focused on providing funding to conduct overdue cdrs and new cdrs as they become due .
