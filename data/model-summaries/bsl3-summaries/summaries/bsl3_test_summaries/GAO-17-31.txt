we examined 1 ) the approaches selected states have taken to develop plans for implementing workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) provisions related to career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning , and 2 ) the related planning challenges , if any , these states have encountered and how they have addressed them .
to address both objectives , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance ; conducted case studies in five states ; and interviewed federal department of labor ( dol ) and department of education ( education ) officials .
these programs , administered primarily by the departments of labor ( dol ) and education ( education ) , provide a combination of education and training services that help job seekers obtain employment and advance in the labor market .
