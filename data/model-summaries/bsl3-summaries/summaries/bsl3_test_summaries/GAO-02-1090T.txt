my testimony today , which is based on our report that is being issued today , addresses three topics: ( 1 ) the federal funding approaches used for the marine transportation system as compared with the aviation and highway systems , ( 2 ) the amount of customs duties on imported goods shipped through the marine , aviation , and highway systems , and ( 3 ) a framework to assist the congress as it considers future federal investment decisions .
there are concerns that the projected increases in freight tonnage for all transportation modes will place pressures on the marine , aviation , and highway transportation systems .
an intermodal perspective appears especially important as the nation reacts to the increased security needs for transportation networks and as it plans for better , more efficient transportation for the future .
as a result , there is growing awareness of the need to view various transportation modes , and freight movement in particular , from an integrated standpoint , particularly for the purposes of developing and implementing a federal investment strategy and considering alternative funding approaches .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss challenges in defining the federal role with respect to freight transportation issues .
