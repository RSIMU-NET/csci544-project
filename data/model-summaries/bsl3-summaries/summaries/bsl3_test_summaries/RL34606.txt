a variety of offices at the federal level respond to complaints , grievances , and concerns from the public about government programs , services , and operations .
three with enhanced responsibilities are in the department of homeland security ( dhs ) : a privacy officer and an officer for civil rights and civil liberties , along with additional special duties for the inspector general ( ig ) .
despite their differences , they exhibit a common purpose — to represent the public in such matters — which is reflected in the classic ombudsman: that is , a high - ranking official who may be situated outside the executive and possessing independent resources and powers .
separate from these functions and duties , some ombudsman - like offices issue reports ( periodic and / or episodic ) to agency officials , congress , and / or the public , while others have no such obligation or practice .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 , which expanded the government's powers to combat terrorism , established a new entity or added to the responsibilities and roles of existing ones to help protect civil rights and civil liberties .
