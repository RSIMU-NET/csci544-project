recent events , including the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , have highlighted the importance of ensuring proper security at federal facilities .
additionally , the recent pay increases received by officers at 12 of the 13 police forces , along with the potential implementation of various human capital flexibilities , might also help to address recruitment and retention issues experienced by many of the police forces .
officials at some of these police forces have raised concerns that disparities in pay and retirement benefits have caused their police forces to experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining officers .
as agreed with your offices , our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) determine the differences that exist among these federal uniformed police forces regarding entry - level pay , retirement benefits , and types of duties ; ( 2 ) provide information on the differences in turnover rates among these federal uniformed police forces , including where officers who separated from the police forces went and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available and used by the police forces to address turnover ; and ( 3 ) provide information on the possible difficulties police forces may have experienced in recruiting police officers and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available to help these police forces to recruit officers .
