people are at the heart of an organization's ability to perform its mission , yet a key challenge for many federal agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , is to strategically manage their human capital .
the two critical success factors to strategic human capital planning that we identified in our model are ( 1 ) integration and alignment of human capital approaches and ( 2 ) human capital decisionmaking that is data - driven .
along with congress and the administration , we have been focusing increased attention on the need for improved human capital management across the government .
for this report , our specific objectives were to review the extent that these two plans , in addressing active duty military benefits , promote ( 1 ) the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and ( 2 ) the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions â€” the two critical success factors identified in our model .
first , the plans do not specifically address how dod will integrate and align benefits and other human capital approaches to meet its overall organizational goals .
we also reviewed dod's plans for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans .
