the rapid pace of technological advances , including the shift from voice to data , from wireline to wireless , and from copper to fiber is redefining the parameters of the telecommunications and media markets .
the deployment , adoption , and regulatory treatment of broadband technologies continues to hold a major focus in the policy debate .
