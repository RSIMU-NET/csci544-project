to better address obstacles that occur during the activation process and to help ensure that institutions are activated within estimated timeframes , including those institutions that do not currently have inmates , such as administrative usp thomson and usp yazoo city , we recommend that the director of the bureau of prisons take the following three actions: direct the central office to analyze staffing data at individual institutions in the activation process to assess their progress toward reaching authorized staffing levels and use that assessment to develop effective , tailored strategies to mitigate those challenges ; develop and implement a comprehensive activation policy that incorporates the knowledge of staff with experience activating institutions ; and develop and implement an activation schedule that incorporates the four characteristics of scheduling best practices .
the department of justice's ( doj ) federal bureau of prisons ( bop ) requested about $6.9 billion in fiscal year 2014 to provide for the custody and care of an inmate population that has increased from about 24,000 in fiscal year 1980 to over 216,000 in july 2014 .
taking action to address challenges that bop can control will help mitigate obstacles in ongoing and future activation of new institutions .
