polluted storm water runoff can lead to u.s. surface water degradation .
furthermore , as a part of this analysis , we recommend that epa assess the number of oil and gas sites impacted by the phase ii rule ; the costs to industry of compliance with the rule and whether these costs are solely attributable to the storm water rule ; and the environmental implications and benefits of the storm water rule , including , but not limited to , potential benefits for endangered species .
this report provides information about ( 1 ) oil and gas construction activities for which permits have been obtained under phase i and ( 2 ) oil and gas construction activities that are likely to be affected by phase ii and its financial and environmental implications .
sediment — the primary environmental concern associated with construction activities — clouds water , decreases photosynthetic activity ; reduces the viability of aquatic plants and animals ; and , ultimately , destroys organisms and their habitat .
oil and gas industry representatives were most concerned about costs that stem from delays companies may face when identifying a construction activity's impact on endangered species .
this report provides information about ( 1 ) oil and gas construction activities that have obtained permit coverage under phase i and ( 2 ) oil and gas construction activities that are likely to be affected by phase ii and its financial and environmental implications .
