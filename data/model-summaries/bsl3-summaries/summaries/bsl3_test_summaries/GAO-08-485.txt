congress included a provision in the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 requiring us to report on the recent employment of former department of defense ( dod ) officials by major defense contractors .
in response , this report ( 1 ) provides information on how many former dod military and civilian personnel worked for major defense contractors in 2006 and an estimate of how many of these were former dod senior or acquisition officials who worked on defense contracts for these employers that were the responsibility of their former agency or their direct responsibility at dod and ( 2 ) identifies the practices used to monitor compliance with post - government employment restrictions and the information challenges that contractors and dod face in monitoring the movement of former dod employees to defense contractors .
each year , civilian and military personnel leave the department of defense ( dod ) and go to work for contractors that do business with dod â€” sometimes the same contractors they were working with before leaving dod .
several of our reports on these past strategies to make post - dod employment with defense contractors more transparent to dod , the most recent in 1990 , found problems with the implementation and enforcement of those reporting requirements , and questioned the extent to which former dod officials or defense contractors complied with them and the effectiveness of dod's monitoring .
