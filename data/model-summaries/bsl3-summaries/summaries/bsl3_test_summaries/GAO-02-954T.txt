since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent anthrax incidents , there has been concern about the ability of the federal government to prepare for and coordinate an effective public health response to such events , given the broad distribution of responsibility for that task at the federal level .
in order to assist the committee in its consideration of this extensive reorganization of our government , this statement focuses on titles iii and v of the president's proposal and the implications of ( 1 ) the proposed transfer of specific public health preparedness and response programs currently housed in hhs into the new department , ( 2 ) the proposed transfer of control over certain other public health preparedness assistance programs from hhs to the new department , and ( 3 ) the proposed transfer of responsibility for research and development on chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear threats to the new department .
the aspects of the proposal concerned with public health preparedness and response would involve two primary changes to the current system , which are found in title v of the proposed legislation .
the president's proposed homeland security act of 2002 would bring many of these federal entities with homeland security responsibilities — including public health preparedness and response — into one department , in an effort to mobilize and focus assets and resources at all levels of government .
