although economic analysis can be used to estimate the distribution of the tax system , or a tax change ( a positive or descriptive analysis ) , it cannot be used to provide a normative or prescriptive analysis .
distributional effects are often central policy issues in debates over tax legislation .
in particular , it addresses the question of the justifications for a progressive tax system ( one where the share of income collected as a tax rises as income rises ) .
some of the private researchers involved in this work include the urban institute and brookings institution tax policy center ( tpc ) and the institute on taxation and economic policy ( itep ) of citizens for tax justice ( ctj ) .
one of them is how to pay for the goods that the government provides ( such as national defense , or highways ) .
even in the case of distribution issues , however , economic analysis can be used to facilitate the understanding of desirable distributions , measure them correctly , and determine the implications of different assumptions about social welfare for the optimal distribution of the tax burden .
the second issue is whether the tax system should be used for direct income redistribution ; in that case the optimal tax burden depends on the degree to which redistribution is deemed desirable .
