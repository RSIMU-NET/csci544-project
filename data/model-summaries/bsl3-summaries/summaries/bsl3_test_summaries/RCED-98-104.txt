this investigation was undertaken by epa , the u.s. department of agriculture's food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) , and the department of health and human services' food and drug administration ( fda ) â€” each of which has jurisdiction over some aspect of the food safety system .
in may 1997 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) discovered elevated levels of dioxin in poultry samples analyzed as a part of its reassessment of the health risks of dioxin .
concerned about the performance of the federal agencies in handling this incident , you asked us to determine the ( 1 ) basis for the federal agencies' decisions to require producers to demonstrate that their food products did not contain levels of dioxin above one part per trillion ; ( 2 ) federal agencies' effectiveness in working together to make decisions to address the problem of dioxin - contaminated feed and in communicating their decisions to the affected state agencies , producers , and processors ; and ( 3 ) impact of the food safety system on the handling of this dioxin incident .
these delays increased producers' costs .
however , researchers from the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) told us that science has not yet determined the level of exposure to dioxin that may present a danger to human health .
