we are pleased to be here to discuss the results of our september 2013 report , which the subcommittee is releasing today , and the efforts of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) federal protective service ( fps ) to protect the nearly 9,600 federal facilities that are under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) .
fps is authorized ( 1 ) to protect the buildings , grounds , and property that are under the control and custody of gsa , as well as the persons on the property ; ( 2 ) to enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting such property and persons on the property ; and ( 3 ) to investigate fps conducts its mission offenses against these buildings and persons .
testimony discusses ( 1 ) challenges fps faces in ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and ( 2 ) the extent to which fps and select federal agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies align with federal risk assessment standards issued by the interagency security committee ( isc ) .
the 2012 shooting at the anderson federal building in long beach , california , and the results of our 2009 covert testing and fps's ongoing penetration testing demonstrate the continued vulnerability of federal facilities .
