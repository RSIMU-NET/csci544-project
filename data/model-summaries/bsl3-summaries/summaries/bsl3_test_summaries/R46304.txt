the outbreak of coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) , first in the people's republic of china ( prc or china ) , and now globally , including in the united states , is drawing attention to the ways in which the united states and other ec onomies depend on critical manufacturing and global value chains that rely on production based in china .
an area of particular concern to congress in the current environment is u.s. shortages of medical suppliesâincluding personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient u.s. industrial capacity .
suppressed global demand will likely further complicate efforts to orchestrate a rebound in china's ( or global ) economic activity .
congress is particularly concerned about these dependencies and has passed legislation to better understand and address them .
because of china's role as a global supplier of ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( api ) , reduced exports from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states .
a key factor in the sharp economic slowdown in china was the dramatic downturn of both demand and supply after chinese officials imposed restrictions in the third week of january on movement of people and goods in and out of localities across china .
