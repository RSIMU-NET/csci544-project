my statement today focuses on the status of va's efforts to address its high - risk designations and open gao recommendations in the following areas: ( 1 ) managing risks and improving va health care ; ( 2 ) va acquisition management ; ( 3 ) improving and modernizing federal disability programs ; and ( 4 ) other government - wide high - risk areas that have direct implications for va and its operations .
however , important recommendations remain unimplemented ( open ) , and we continue to identify similar deficiencies in recent and ongoing work .
we categorized these recommendations into nine areas: ( 1 ) veterans' access to timely health care ; ( 2 ) veterans' community care program ; ( 3 ) human capital management ; ( 4 ) information technology ; ( 5 ) appeals reform for disability benefits ; ( 6 ) quality of care and patient safety ; ( 7 ) national policy documents ; ( 8 ) contracting policies and practices ; and ( 9 ) veterans' access to burial options .
congress has also acted to drive overarching change by , for example , passing the va mission act of 2018 ( va mission act ) .
