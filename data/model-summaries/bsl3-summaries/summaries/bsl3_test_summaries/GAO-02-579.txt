to address these concerns , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) if va's clinical guideline for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is consistent with medical community practices for managing serious mental illnesses and ( 2 ) whether implementation of the guideline is consistent with its intent to ensure that prescribing decisions are ultimately based on physicians' clinical judgment .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides health care services to veterans who have been diagnosed with psychosis — primarily schizophrenia , a disorder that can substantially limit their ability to care for themselves , secure employment , and maintain relationships .
these veterans also have a high risk of premature death , including suicide .
for many of them , effective treatment , especially antipsychotic drug therapy , has reduced the severity of their illnesses and increased their ability to function in society .
in fiscal year 2001 , the amount for antipsychotic drugs jumped 29 percent to $158 million — or 7 percent of va's total drug costs .
you asked us to review whether this guideline may result in restricted access to the more costly atypical antipsychotic drugs and , in turn , adversely affect the quality of care for veterans .
