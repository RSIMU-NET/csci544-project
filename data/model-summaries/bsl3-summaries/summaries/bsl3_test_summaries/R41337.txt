an evaluation may provide information at any stage of the policy process about how a federal government policy , program , activity , or agency is working .
the resulting information may be used to better understand policy problems and to help inform the design , implementation , and oversight of policies .
a variety of stakeholders may seek evaluation information and data to help them exercise their responsibilities , obligations , and rights in a representative democracy , including the establishment , implementation , oversight , and other requirements of a federal program or project .
a program's context , including its longevity and the manner in which it is implemented , typically influences choices about evaluation design .
these stakeholders and interested parties include , among others , congress , the president , federal agency officers and employees , state and local governments , interest groups , private sector contractors , the news media , and the general public .
for a number of reasons , there is not necessarily a best way to design and carry out an evaluation of a particular program , activity , or operation .
these include implementing and coordinating science , research , monitoring , and data collection ; developing and maintaining pertinent information ; assisting the signatories of the agreement in developing and implementing action plans ; coordinating the activities of epa and other entities in developing strategies to improve water quality and living resources of the bay ; and implementing outreach programs for public information , education , and participation to foster stewardship of the bay .
