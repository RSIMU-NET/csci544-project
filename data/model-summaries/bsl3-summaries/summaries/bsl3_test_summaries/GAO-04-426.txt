to determine whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified , we reviewed national policies and procedures that included the national interagency standards for fire and fire aviation operations and the national interagency mobilization guide .
in 2002 , the united states experienced one of the worst wildland fire seasons in the past 50 years .
in total , the federal government spent more than $1.6 billion to suppress fires that burned almost 7 million acres .
in this context , we reviewed ( 1 ) whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified ; ( 2 ) what resource management issues , if any , affected the ability of firefighting personnel to effectively fight the biscuit fire ; and ( 3 ) what differences , if any , existed in key personnel certification standards at federal and state agencies involved in fighting wildland fires — particularly in oregon — and whether any such differences affected efforts to respond to the biscuit fire .
