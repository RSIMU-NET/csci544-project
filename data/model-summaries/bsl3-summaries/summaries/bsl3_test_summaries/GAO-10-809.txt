congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) to help stimulate the united states economy by providing an estimated $862 billion over 10 years through a variety of programs .
in response , we determined ( 1 ) the extent of recovery act funding obligated by federal agencies on contracts , and the extent to which these contracts were awarded noncompetitively , ( 2 ) the reasons selected federal agencies awarded noncompetitive recovery act contract actions , ( 3 ) the extent of oversight of recovery act contracting at selected federal agencies , and ( 4 ) state officials' level of insight into and oversight of the use of noncompetitive recovery act contracts within selected states .
we mentioned our prior findings regarding 8 ( a ) eligibility only to illustrate that there may be issues that merit consideration by agency igs as part of their overall approach to audits related to recovery act contracts that were not apparent when they developed their recovery act audit plans .
as the igs of the five agencies we reviewed periodically revisit and revise their recovery act audit plans , they should assess the need for allocating an appropriate level of audit resources , as determined using their risk - based analyses , to the noncompetitive contracts awarded under sba's 8 ( a ) program .
