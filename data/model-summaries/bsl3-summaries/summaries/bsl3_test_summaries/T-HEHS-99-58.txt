specifically , you asked us to review hcfa's progress in ( 1 ) addressing its most immediate priorities and ( 2 ) strengthening its internal management to effectively discharge its major implementation and oversight responsibilities .
this legislation also established the bipartisan commission on the future of medicare to develop more long - term solutions for further ensuring medicare's integrity and solvency .
the balanced budget act of 1997 ( bba ) and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) were designed , with considerable input from the administration , to strengthen hcfa's ability to prevent fraud and abuse and constrain spending growth in the medicare program .
two of the programs hcfa administers cost federal and state taxpayers about $370 billion in fiscal year 1998 — $193 billion for medicare and $177 billion for medicaid — and represent an ever growing proportion of the federal budget — currently about 18 percent .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) ability to meet its new and growing responsibilities .
the long - term financial condition of medicare is now one of the nation's most pressing problems .
