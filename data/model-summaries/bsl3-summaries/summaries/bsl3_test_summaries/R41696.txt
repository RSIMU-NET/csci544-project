congress created the commission and authorized the guidelines in the sentencing reform act of 1984 .
once binding on federal courts , the guidelines are now the starting point for federal sentencing in most cases .
the supreme court has upheld the constitutionality of the guidelines as a valid delegation of congressional authority , but held unconstitutional the provision in the sentencing reform act which made them binding on federal courts , rather than advisory .
the goal of the guidelines is nation - wide federal sentencing consistency ; to ensure that defendants with similar criminal records , convicted of similar crimes , receive similar sentences and that the dissimilar do not .
they provide the principal standard against which the reasonableness of any sentence imposed is judged .
the first guidelines were promulgated with an effective date of november 1 , 1987 .
in the last quarter of fy2014 , over 75% of the sentences imposed by federal courts fell within the sentence ranges recommended by the guidelines or within those ranges but reduced by prosecution endorsed departures recommended in the guidelines .
the federal sentencing guidelines greatly influence the sentences imposed for federal crimes .
between the statutory maximum and any statutory minimum established for noncapital federal felonies , the guidelines calibrate a series of sentencing ranges , according to the nature of the offense and the defendant's criminal record .
