 ( recommendation 3 ) .
the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) , enacted in 2012 , included a provision for us to biennially review fta's processes and procedures for evaluating and rating projects seeking funding through the capital investment grants program .
since the 1970s , the federal transit administration's ( fta ) capital investment grants program has been the primary source of federal financial assistance to new “fixed - guideway” projects or extensions to existing fixed - guideway systems across the united states .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the fta administrator should take steps , such as undertaking additional research or public outreach , to enable fta to evaluate and rate projects in a program of interrelated projects , in a manner consistent with statutory provisions .
fta's progress in addressing outstanding statutory provisions as amended by map - 21 and the fast act , and how fta's evaluation and rating process enables it to verify that statutory requirements are met before recommending a core capacity project for funding .
we also reviewed fta's policy guidance ; other pertinent agency documents , such as fta's instructions for applying to the program , its templates for evaluating and rating projects in the program , and its annual reports to congress with funding recommendations ; and prior gao reports .
