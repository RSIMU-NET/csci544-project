the environmental protection agency ( epa ) is responsible for reviewing the environmental and health effects of chemicals in commerce and chemicals that have yet to enter commerce .
this report describes ( 1 ) the extent to which the iris program has addressed identified challenges and made progress toward producing chemical assessments and ( 2 ) the extent to which epa has demonstrated progress , if at all , implementing tsca , and the key challenges that remain .
the toxic substances control act of 1976 ( tsca ) provides epa with the authority to review chemicals already in commerce ( existing chemicals ) and chemicals yet to enter commerce ( new chemicals ) , obtain more information on the effects of chemicals on human health and the environment , and regulate those that epa determines pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment .
epa's ability to effectively implement its mission of protecting public health and the environment depends on its credible and timely assessments of the risks posed by chemicals .
the agency's integrated risk information system ( iris ) program identifies and characterizes the health hazards of chemicals and produces chemical assessments that contain this information .
