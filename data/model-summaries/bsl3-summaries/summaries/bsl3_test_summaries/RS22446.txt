under current law , two departments — the department of state ( dos ) and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — each play key roles in administering the law and policies on the admission of aliens .
citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) is charged with approving immigrant petitions , and dhs's customs and border protection ( cbp ) is tasked with inspecting all people who enter the united states .
dhs's immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is the lead agency on enforcing immigration law in the interior of the united states .
as congress debates comprehensive immigration reform and its component parts of immigration control ( i.e. , border security and interior enforcement ) , legal reform ( i.e. , temporary and permanent admissions ) , and the resolution of unauthorized alien residents , concerns arise over the capacity of the department of homeland security to identify and remove temporary aliens who fail to depart when their visas expire .
this issue is not new ; indeed , congress has been grappling with options to address it over the past two decades .
foreign nationals not legally residing in the united states who wish to come to the united states generally must obtain a visa to be admitted .
