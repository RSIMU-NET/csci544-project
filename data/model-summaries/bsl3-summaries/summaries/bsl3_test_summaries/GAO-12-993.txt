in response to your interest in a report on the repealed ctaa program and , more specifically , on how eda awarded the ctaa grants and how those grants fit in with other eda grant programs , we examined the ctaa program to determine ( 1 ) how eda made grant award decisions , ( 2 ) what mechanisms eda established to monitor the grants and evaluate their effectiveness , and ( 3 ) how the ctaa program compared with other eda community grant programs .
for fiscal year 2010 , the department of commerce's economic development administration ( eda ) awarded $36.8 million in ctaa grants to 36 communities to develop a strategic plan to help the community adjust to trade impacts and to promote economic diversification or to implement programs and projects as part of a strategic plan .
from 2001 to 2011 , u.s. imports of goods and services almost doubled from $1.4 trillion to $2.7 trillion .
the administration proposed to discontinue the program , contending that eda could provide similar assistance to communities at a lower cost through its economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) program .
the trade and globalization adjustment assistance act of 2009 ( tgaaa ) , passed as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act in february 2009 , reauthorized and amended trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) programs that assist trade - impacted workers , farmers and fishermen , firms , community colleges , and communities .
