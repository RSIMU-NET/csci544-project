the courts and the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) have historically understood the language of section 101 to allow an expansive range of patentable subject matter .
most recently , the leahy - smith america invents act ( aia ) of 2011 stipulated that "no patent may issue on a claim directed to or encompassing a human organism. .
the aia also limited the availability of patents claiming tax avoidance strategies .
this situation changed over the past decade due to a series of decisions issued by the supreme court of the united states .
the term "patentable subject matter" refers to the requirement of section 101 of the patent act of 1952 that an invention must consist of a "process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter" in order to be patented .
some members of congress have expressed interest in the rules governing patentable subject matter for many years .
other observers believe that these decisions may lead to patents of appropriate scope , curb abusive patent litigation , and encourage patent lawyers to draft and procure higher quality patents .
since the supreme court issued its decisions , section 101 has been more frequently invoked to invalidate issued patents and reject pending patent applications at the uspto .
