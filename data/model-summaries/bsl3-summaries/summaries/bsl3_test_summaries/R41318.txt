two political parties â€” the people's national party ( pnp ) and the jamaica labour party ( jlp ) have dominated the political system since before the country's 1962 independence .
an english - speaking caribbean nation with a population of about 2.8 million , jamaica has had a relatively stable parliamentary political system stemming from its history of british colonial rule , even though extensive political violence often marred national elections in the 1970s and 1980s .
in the 1970s and 1980s , the two parties had distinct ideological differences , with the pnp under michael manley ( 1972-1980 ) espousing democratic socialism and increasing state ownership of the economy , and the jlp under edward seaga ( 1980-1989 ) adopting a policy of economic liberalization and privatization .
while the jamaican government increased its enforcement activity and public awareness efforts in 2009 , the united states urges it to reform its patent protection law in accordance with international standards .
both the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) and the peace corps have provided assistance to jamaica since its independence in 1962 .
but in the aftermath of the jamaican government's efforts to capture coke and extradite him to the united states in late june 2010 , u.s. officials commended the golding government for its efforts .
