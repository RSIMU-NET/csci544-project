by enacting a number of major management reforms , the congress has created a statutory framework , with the government performance and results act ( gpra ) as its centerpiece .
a central piece of that initiative is the office of management and budget's ( omb ) new diagnostic tool , the program performance assessment rating tool ( part ) .
a series of three reports described agencies' progress over a 4-year period in aligning performance plans ; budgets ; and , in the most recent report , financial statements .
part is designed to provide a consistent approach to reviewing program design , planning , and goals development as well as program management and results .
during the past decade , the congress and the executive branch have sought to improve federal management and instill a greater focus on results .
finally , we observed that describing the planned and actual use of resources in terms of measurable results was an essential long - term effort that would take time and adaptation on the part of all agencies .
improving the integration of budget and performance is a high priority initiative in the president's management agenda .
