in this report , we examine ( 1 ) the extent to which hrsa has developed guidance for its staff responsible for monitoring grantees ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hrsa has implemented training for its staff responsible for monitoring grantees ; ( 3 ) hrsa's oversight of its staff responsible for monitoring grantees ; and ( 4 ) what practices , if any , hrsa has in place to ensure that the contractors conducting grantee monitoring activities are qualified and carry out their work as appropriate .
these grantees serve millions of people each year through programs that provide health care to uninsured individuals ; people with human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) ; pregnant women , mothers , and children ; people living in rural communities ; and others .
the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is charged with improving access to health care services for people who are uninsured , isolated , or medically vulnerable and enhancing the capacity of the health care workforce .
to help ensure complete and effective monitoring of grantees , we recommend that the administrator of hrsa develop a process , either at the agency or bureau level , to ensure that bureaus' sops address all of the key components of grantee monitoring as established by the agency .
