for a number of years , minority farmers have expressed concern that u. s. department of agriculture ( usda ) officials do not treat them in the same way as nonminority farmers in the conduct of usda's programs , particularly in decisions made in the department's county offices and district loan offices .
specifically , they asked us to ( 1 ) identify fsa's efforts to treat minority farmers in the same way as nonminority farmers in delivering program services ; ( 2 ) examine the representation of minorities in county office staffing and on county committees in the counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers ; and ( 3 ) examine data on the disposition of minority and nonminority farmers' applications for participation in the agricultural conservation program ( acp ) and the direct loan program at the national level and in five county and five district loan offices .
because of this concern , the former chairman and ranking minority member requested in april 1996 that we review the efforts of the department's farm service agency ( fsa ) to conduct farm programs in an equitable manner .
to carry out its responsibilities , the staff ( 1 ) investigates farmers' complaints of discrimination in program decisions , ( 2 ) conducts management evaluations of fsa's field offices to ensure that procedures designed to protect civil rights are being followed , and ( 3 ) provides equal employment opportunity ( eeo ) and civil rights training to its employees .
