 ( recommendation 3 ) .
doj implemented 11 of our recommendations , including that doj develop performance measures for criminal debt collection and better coordinate internally and with federal courts .
the justice for all reauthorization act of 2016 contained a provision for us to review and assess the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 .
to address these findings , we made 24 recommendations , including 14 to doj , among other agencies .
once restitution is ordered by the court , doj is responsible for collecting restitution payments and has delegated these activities to financial litigation units ( flu ) within each u.s. attorney's office ( usao ) .
 ( recommendation 1 ) to improve oversight of the collection of restitution we recommend that the attorney general: develop and implement performance measures and goals for each usao related to the collection of restitution , and measure progress towards meeting those goals .
specifically , we found that doj had not collected most of the outstanding criminal debt due to , among other factors , the nature of the debt , and a lack of coordination between relevant doj components .
doj took action to address the inspector general's recommendations by reviewing the system it uses to prioritize debt collection actions , by incorporating discussion of asset recovery into its training program , and by initiating a comprehensive study to review existing protocols and structures to improve doj's ability to collect debts owed to crime victims .
