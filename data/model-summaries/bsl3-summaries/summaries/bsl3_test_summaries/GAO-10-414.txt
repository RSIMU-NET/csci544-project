to increase the safety , capacity , and efficiency of the national airspace system , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , in cooperation with aviation industry stakeholders and other federal agencies , is developing a new , technologically advanced air traffic management system â€” the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
to help improve and expand faa's capability to use data for aviation safety oversight , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to take the following four actions: develop and implement a comprehensive plan that addresses how data fit into faa's implementation of a proactive approach to safety oversight and ensure that this plan fully describes the relevant data challenges ( such as ensuring data quality and continued access to voluntarily reported safety data ) , analytical approaches , and staffing requirements and integrates efforts to address them ; given the importance of high - quality data , extend standard quality controls , as appropriate , to the databases that support aviation safety oversight to ensure that the data are as reliable and valid as possible ; proceed with all deliberate speed to develop the capability to model the impact of nextgen changes on the national airspace system and manage any risks emerging from these changes ; and systematically identify the reasons that carriers are not participating in voluntary reporting programs , such as through a survey , and identify and implement further steps to encourage greater program participation , especially by smaller carriers .
