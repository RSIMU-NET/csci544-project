we examined ( 1 ) how selected pfs projects have been structured and what potential benefits these projects can provide ; ( 2 ) how selected pfs contracts have been structured to address potential project risks ; and ( 3 ) the potential roles for the federal government's involvement in pfs projects .
a small number of foreign and u.s. state and local governments are employing a contracting mechanism known as a social impact bond ( sib ) or a pay for success ( pfs ) program to fund preventive efforts designed to more effectively serve vulnerable populations .
federal , state , and local agencies play an important role in improving outcomes for our society's most vulnerable populations , who often face complex social or economic problems .
agencies at all levels of government can improve the lives of vulnerable populations and make effective use of available resources by allocating them to prevention programs that demonstrate the promise to innovatively solve intractable social challenges .
