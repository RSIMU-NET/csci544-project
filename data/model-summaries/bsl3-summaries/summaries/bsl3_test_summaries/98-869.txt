hypoxia refers to a depressed concentration of dissolved oxygen in water .
several federal agencies are involved in analyzing the problem , including the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , and the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
one model suggests that a 12% to 14% reduction in the use of fertilizer on croplands in the mississippi river basin would reduce the net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs by about 30% , without any loss in crop production .
in addition , spawning areas and other essential habitat can be destroyed by the lack of oxygen .
legislation was enacted by the 105 th congress to provide additional authority and funding for research and monitoring to address these concerns .
decreased concentrations of dissolved oxygen result in part from natural eutrophication when nutrients ( e.g. , nitrogen and phosphorus ) and sunlight stimulate algal growth ( e.g. , algae , seaweed , and phytoplankton ) , increasing the amount of organic matter in an aquatic ecosystem over decades and centuries .
noaa initiated the nutrient enhanced coastal ocean productivity ( necop ) program in 1989 to study the effects of nutrient discharges on u.s. coastal waters .
