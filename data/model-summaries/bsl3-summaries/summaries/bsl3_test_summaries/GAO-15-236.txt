this report examines ( 1 ) how dot regulates and provides oversight of oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges , and ( 2 ) how state agencies regulate oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges .
the department of transportation's ( dot ) federal highway administration ( fhwa ) provides about $40 billion each year to states to build , improve , and preserve the nation's road and bridge infrastructure through the federal - aid highway program .
the bridge repair cost $8.5 million in federal - aid highway funds .
to improve stewardship over the nation's highways and bridges , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the fhwa administrator to take the following action: conduct a study on state oversize - and overweight - permitting practices , including automated vehicle routing and escort driver certification , to identify areas of best practice and share the results with states .
as a part of that effort , states develop regulations for vehicle size and weight to be enforced in their state ( subject to certain federal limits ) and issue permits that allow motor carriers to operate oversize and overweight vehicles , for example to deliver manufactured housing or to move heavy construction equipment to a job site .
