 ( recommendation 1 ) .
congress passed the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) to improve the federal government's preparation for and response to natural and manmade disasters .
in this report , we examined: the challenges selected stakeholders have experienced related to emergency communications ; the emergency communications assistance — technical assistance and funding — provided by dhs and selected stakeholders' views on these efforts ; and the reccwgs established by the post - katrina act and their effect on emergency communications capabilities .
these provisions required that the department of homeland security ( dhs ) provide assistance to support the rapid establishment of interoperable emergency communications in urban areas and other areas deemed to be consistently at a high level of risk from disasters ; and the establishment of regional emergency communications coordination working groups ( reccwg ) in each of the 10 federal emergency management agency ( fema ) regions .
while dhs has provided assistance in the form of technical assistance and funding and congress has established the reccwgs ( commonly pronounced rec - wigs ) , natural disasters such as hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria in 2017 continued to test the nation's emergency communications capabilities .
