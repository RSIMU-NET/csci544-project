we are pleased to be here today to discuss our work on how the departments of energy ( doe ) and defense ( dod ) use the designations official use only ( ouo ) and for official use only ( fouo ) , respectively , to manage information that is unclassified but sensitive .
this report ( 1 ) identified and assessed the policies , procedures , and criteria that doe and dod employ to manage ouo and fouo information ; and ( 2 ) determined the extent to which doe's and dod's training and oversight programs assure that information is identified and marked according to established criteria .
in summary , both doe and dod base their programs on the premise that information designated as ouo or fouo must ( 1 ) have the potential to cause foreseeable harm to governmental , commercial , or private interests if disseminated to the public or persons who do not need the information to perform their jobs ; and ( 2 ) fall under at least one of eight freedom of information act ( foia ) exemptions .
my testimony today is based on our report issued earlier this month entitled managing sensitive information: departments of energy and defense policies and oversight could be improved ( gao - 06-369 ) .
