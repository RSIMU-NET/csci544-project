for activities funded through the annual appropriations process ( referred to as discretionary spending ) , congress differentiates between authorizations and the appropriations .
as currently provided in house rule xxi , the house bars legislative provisions from being reported in general appropriations bills ; amendments to general appropriations bills containing language that would add to or alter existing law are also prohibited .
under the rules of the house and senate , legislative provisions and appropriations for purposes not authorized by law typically may not be included in appropriations measures .
these rules are enforced on the house and senate floor through points of order , but if legislative provisions are enacted as a part of an appropriations measure , they have the full force of the law .
both the house and senate have internal rules encouraging the separation of money and policy decisions .
clause 5 of house rule xxii also prohibits the inclusion of legislative language in conference reports that accompany appropriations acts .
these rules stem from the principle that the process through which the activities of government are chosen should be distinct from the process through which those activities are funded .
authorizations comprise substantive law establishing government entities , activities , or programs , while appropriations provide budget authority to fund government agencies or programs by allowing them to obligate funds .
