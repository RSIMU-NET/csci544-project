without such matching , there is a substantial risk that ( 1 ) fraudulent or erroneous payments may be made without being detected and ( 2 ) cumulative amounts of disbursements may exceed appropriated amounts and other legal limits .
this report responds to your requests that we assess the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to reduce problem disbursements and its implementation of section 8137 of public law 103-335 , department of defense appropriations act , 1995 , which required that each disbursement exceeding $5 million be matched to the appropriate obligations in dod's official accounting records before the disbursement is made .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess dod's progress in reducing problem disbursements and ( 2 ) review dod's implementation of the requirements in section 8137 of public law 103-335 and section 8102 of public law 104-61 , for dod to match disbursements over $5 million with obligations in the official accounting records prior to making payments .
dod's problems with accounting for and reporting on disbursements will not be resolved until ( 1 ) weaknesses in control procedures that allow problem disbursements to occur are corrected and ( 2 ) improvements are made to dod's contract pay , disbursing , and accounting processes and systems .
