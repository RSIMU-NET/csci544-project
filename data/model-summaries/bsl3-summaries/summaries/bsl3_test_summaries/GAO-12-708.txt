the department of homeland security ( dhs ) estimated that as of january 2011 there were about 11.5 million aliens ( non - u.s. citizens ) living in the united states without lawful immigration status .
as of april 2012 , the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) had awarded four contracts and planned to award additional contracts to modernize its alien criminal response information management ( acrime ) system .
dhs's u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is responsible for apprehending and removing aliens who have violated immigration law .
to help ensure that ice acquires effective technology to support the secure communities program and effectively uses its workforce , we recommend that the director of ice take the following three actions to follow sound management practices: establish well - defined requirements prior to awarding additional develop an integrated master schedule that identifies all tasks to be performed by the government and current and future contractors , and links activities being performed by different contractors ; and develop a workforce plan to support the analysis of immigration status determinations under secure communities .
developing a workforce plan to guide workforce resource decisions could help ensure workforce decisions are made in an effective and cost - efficient manner .
