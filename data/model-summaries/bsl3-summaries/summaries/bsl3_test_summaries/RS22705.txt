the federal reserve ( fed ) is mandated to keep inflation low and stable , and alters interest rates in order to do so .
in recent years , the fed has focused attention on the core rate of inflation , a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy prices , in explanations of its policy decisions .
inflation , the general rise in the prices of goods and services , is important to policymakers for several reasons .
first , rising inflation is unpopular with the public , in part because some households are more adversely affected by inflation than others .
second , high or rising inflation can reduce productivity by distorting price signals , so that it is hard for businesses to tell if prices are changing in relative terms , and by individuals wasting resources in order to maintain the purchasing power of their wealth .
finally , inflation plays a key role in macroeonomic stabilization policy .
changes in inflation often indicate changes in the business cycle â€” rising inflation is often a sign that the economy is overheating and falling inflation is a sign that the economy is sluggish .
the most commonly cited measure of inflation is the percent change in the consumer price index ( cpi ) .
