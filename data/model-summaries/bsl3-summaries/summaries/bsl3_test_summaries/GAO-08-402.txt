the report identified these five general research categories as ( 1 ) instrumentation , metrology , and analytical methods ; ( 2 ) nanomaterials and human health ; ( 3 ) nanomaterials and the environment ; ( 4 ) health and environmental exposure assessment ; and ( 5 ) risk management methods .
nanotechnology encompasses a wide range of innovations based on the nanotechnology encompasses a wide range of innovations based on the understanding and control of matter at the scale of nanometers — the understanding and control of matter at the scale of nanometers — the equivalent of one - billionth of a meter .
as a result , the inventory of projects designed to address these risks is inaccurate and cannot ensure that agencies direct their future research investments appropriately .
in this context you asked us to report on ( 1 ) the extent to which selected research and regulatory agencies conducted research in fiscal year 2006 that primarily was focused on the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology ; ( 2 ) the reasonableness of the processes that agencies and the nni use to identify and prioritize federal research on the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology ; and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of the processes that agencies and the nni use to coordinate their research .
