the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , accelerated the deployment of advanced imaging technology ( ait ) systems , commonly referred to as full - body scanners , in response to the december 25 , 2009 , attempted terrorist attack on northwest airlines flight 253 .
to help ensure that tsa invests in screening technology that meets mission needs , the administrator of the transportation security administration should ensure that the following two actions are taken before procuring ait - 2 systems: measure system effectiveness based on the performance of the ait - 2 technology and screening officers who operate the technology , while taking into account current processes and deployment strategies , and use scientific evidence and information from dhs's science and technology directorate , and the national laboratories , as well as information and data provided by vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements , estimated time , and resources needed to achieve tsa's tier iv end state .
to mitigate those concerns , tsa began installing automated target recognition ( atr ) software on deployed ait systems in july 2011 .
