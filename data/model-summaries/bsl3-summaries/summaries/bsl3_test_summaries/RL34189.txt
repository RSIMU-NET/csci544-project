those who remain in north korea ( formally known as the democratic republic of north korea , or dprk ) also continue to suffer from a lack of food and other basic humanitarian provisions .
the north korean human rights act ( nkhra ) authorizes the president new funds to support human rights efforts , improve the flow of information , and to require the president to appoint a special envoy on human rights in north korea .
the increased international attention given to the situation of north koreans seeking refuge , primarily in china , has led congress to take a greater interest in the refugee situation and the underlying causes within north korea and across its borders .
these include the pursuit of nuclear weapons and missile programs ; a history of proliferating missiles ; reported threats to export parts of its self - declared nuclear arsenal ; and possible possession of chemical and biological weapons programs .
china generally refuses international agencies and non - governmental organizations ( ngos ) access to the north koreans who cross its border ; this and its periodic practice of deportation , have led many to ask about international law and the protection of refugees in china .
