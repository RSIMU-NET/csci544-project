for the united states , singapore is a crucial partner in trade and security cooperation , as the obama administration executes its rebalance to asia strategy .
though only about three times the size of washington , dc , and with a population of 5.5 million , the city - state of singapore punches far above its weight in both economic and diplomatic influence .
as a result , the nation is a firm supporter of both u.s. trade policy and the u.s. security role in asia .
singapore's value has only grown as the administration has given special emphasis to the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) as a platform for multilateral engagement .
its stable government , strong economic performance , educated citizenry , and strategic position along key shipping lanes make it a major player in regional affairs .
singapore's heavy dependence on international trade makes maintaining regional stability one of its foremost priorities .

maintaining strong relations with both china and the united states is a keystone of singapore's foreign policy .
