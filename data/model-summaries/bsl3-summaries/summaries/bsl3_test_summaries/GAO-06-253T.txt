second , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible to receive social security benefits ? .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the social security administration's ( ssa ) procedures for issuing social security numbers ( ssns ) and benefits to foreign - born individuals .
first , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for an ssn ? .
in both reports gao found that ssa was undertaking improvements in its procedures for issuing ssns and benefits to the foreign - born , but that ssa nonetheless remained vulnerable to errors and fraud .
in light of concern that foreign - born individuals may have been given ssns inappropriately as well as recent legislation that changes how ssa assigns numbers and awards benefits for foreign - born individuals , you asked us to address two questions .
in 2004 , an estimated 35.7 million foreign - born people resided in the united states , and many legitimately have ssns .
in february of 2005 , we reported on ssa's ability to develop and manage agreements with other nations to avoid duplicating social security and other taxes and benefits for workers who have been employed both in the u.s. and in another country , commonly known as totalization agreements .
