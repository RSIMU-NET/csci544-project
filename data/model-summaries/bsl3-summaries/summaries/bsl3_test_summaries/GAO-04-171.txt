to assist your committee in overseeing the agency's management of its microenterprise development program , you asked that we ( 1 ) determine the extent to which usaid's microfinance activities are meeting the program's key objectives , ( 2 ) assess the reliability of the agency's reporting on its overall microenterprise activities , and ( 3 ) examine the agency's role in identifying and disseminating microenterprise best practices .
the key objectives of usaid's microenterprise development program are to reduce poverty among microenterprise owners , workers , and families ; target the poor and the very poor ; encourage participation by women ; and develop sustainable microfinance institutions ( mfi ) .
recognizing this potential , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) has included microenterprise development in the agency's strategy for economic development and poverty reduction .
to determine whether the u.s. agency for international development's ( usaid ) microenterprise development program is meeting its key objectives , we first identified those objectives by reviewing the agency's policy guidance and the pertinent legislation .
the microenterprise for self - reliance and international anti - corruption act of 2000 , enacted on october 17 , 2000 , expressed strong congressional support for microenterprise projects , stated policy preferences for implementing such projects , and authorized increased funding .
