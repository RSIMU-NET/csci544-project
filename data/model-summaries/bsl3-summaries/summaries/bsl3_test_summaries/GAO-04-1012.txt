we were asked to provide information on ( 1 ) how key provisions of the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) reform act have affected program services , ( 2 ) what have been the challenges in implementing the taa reform act's new provisions , ( 3 ) whether demand for taa training has changed , and how states are meeting this demand , and ( 4 ) what is known about what the taa program is achieving .
partly in response to these concerns , congress passed the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) reform act of 2002 .
among the changes , the act shortened from 60 days to 40 days the time labor is given to process petitions filed on behalf of groups of workers to determine their potential eligibility for services ; established a deadline for workers to enroll in training , after they have been laid off or their petition has been approved , in order to maintain eligibility for extended income support payments ; created a health coverage tax credit ( hctc ) to help trade - affected workers who are enrolled in or have completed training , or have a waiver from this requirement , pay for health insurance ; created a wage insurance benefit for workers age 50 and older , subsidizing the difference between the prior and new wages of some trade - affected workers who find reemployment quickly ; and expanded the eligibility criteria for secondary workers â€” defined as those who are indirectly affected by international trade , because they supply component parts to or perform finishing work for directly affected firms .
