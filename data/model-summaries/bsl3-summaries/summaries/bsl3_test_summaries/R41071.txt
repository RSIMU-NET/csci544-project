china's accession to the wto , its recent efforts to negotiate bilateral trade agreements ( btas ) across asia ( including the asean - china fta ) , and its unilateral liberalization of its trade regime , has arguably placed china as a major competitor to the united states .
congress and the executive branch have historically identified the asia pacific economic cooperation forum ( apec ) as potentially important in the promotion of liberalized international trade and investment in asia , and possibly the rest of the world .
apec is unusual among various trade associations in its reliance on consensus - based , voluntary reductions in tariff and non - tariff trade barriers — as well as a variety of trade facilitation measures — to promote trade and investment liberalization not only between apec members , but for all international trade and investment , an approach often referred to as "open regionalism" ( see " apec's approach to trade liberalization " below ) .
in addition to its primary trade mission , apec provides a venue at which the united states can hold bilateral and multilateral discussions on non - economic matters of concern in the asia - pacific region , such as international security and human rights .
