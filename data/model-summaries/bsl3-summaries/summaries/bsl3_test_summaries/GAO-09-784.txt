this report discusses the ( 1 ) time it has generally taken for proposed projects to move through the new starts process , and what congress and fta have done to expedite the process , and ( 2 ) options that exist to expedite the process .
since the early 1970s , much of the federal government's share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through the federal transit administration's ( fta ) new starts program .
over the last decade , the new starts program has provided state and local agencies with over $10 billion to help design and construct transit projects nationwide .
through this program , fta identifies and recommends new fixed - guideway transit projects for grants , typically through full funding grant agreements ( ffga ) .
the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea - lu ) , which authorized the new starts program through fiscal year 2009 , identifies criteria for how fta evaluates and rates projects .
these issues and the upcoming reauthorization of all surface transportation programs , including the new starts program , have led stakeholders and policymakers to examine the existing evaluation and rating process and consider potential modifications and other options to reduce the complexity , cost , and time it takes for a new starts project to go through the pipeline .
