specifically , we are making the following recommendations to nara: the archivist of the united states should 1. require small and micro agencies that were determined to be at high risk of not complying with statutory and regulatory records management requirements to develop plans and timelines to address their records management weaknesses ( recommendation 1 ) 2. monitor the agencies' progress towards these efforts on a regular basis .
 ( recommendation 2 ) in addition , we are making 40 recommendations to 14 agencies to fully address the electronic recordkeeping requirements found in the managing government records directive and the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 in their policies and procedures .
advances in technology and electronic communications , such as email , have transformed agency operations while creating new opportunities with respect to the effective management of agency records .
of the 17 other agencies in our review , six agencies ( cfpb , commerce , nasa , nsf , opm , and the udall foundation ) concurred with our recommendations ; five agencies ( marine mammal commission , omb , ondcp , opic , and presidio trust ) did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with our recommendations ; and six agencies ( afrh , eac , fhfa , ftc , peace corps , and sigar ) stated that they had no comments on the report .
