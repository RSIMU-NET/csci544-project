the provisions that most directly relate to small businesses are ( 1 ) an employer penalty for not providing health insurance , ( 2 ) a tax credit to increase the affordability of health care for the smallest firms , and ( 3 ) small business health insurance exchanges designed to increase plan options and lower plan costs .
the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
111-152 ) contains several provisions to encourage employer - sponsored health coverage , particularly among small businesses .
on june 4 , 2013 , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) announced that it is delaying enforcement of the aca's requirement that the small business health options program ( shop ) exchanges offer more than one plan from 2014 to 2015 .
some maintain that the direct costs of the employer penalty and related compliance costs will be damaging to small businesses .
the implementation of the aca's provisions to encourage employer - sponsored health coverage , particularly those provisions that relate to small businesses , has been the subject of increasing attention .
several events have altered the aca's implementation since its enactment in 2010: the supreme court ruled in 2012 that the aca's requirement that states extend their medicaid benefits to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level was unconstitutional .
