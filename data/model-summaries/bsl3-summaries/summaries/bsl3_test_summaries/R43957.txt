the u.s. congress has a long history of engagement on u.s. policy toward sudan â€” since the end of apartheid in south africa , there is no country in africa on which congress has focused more sustained attention .
this bipartisan focus has been driven in part by diverse advocacy groups and public awareness campaigns on issues in sudan ranging from famine to modern - day slavery , religious persecution , genocide , and other violations of human rights and humanitarian law .
prior to the secession of south sudan , sudan was africa's largest nation by area , and the site of its longest running civil war .
u.s. sanctions limit sudan's access to u.s. dollars and , alongside debt arrears , impede sudan's access to international financial markets and institutions .
the secession of south sudan was a major financial blow to sudan , which lost 75% of its oil production , two - thirds of its export earnings , and half of its fiscal revenues .
mistrust between sudan and south sudan lingers , and unresolved disputes still threaten the stability of the region .
the north - south split did not resolve other simmering sudanese conflicts , notably in darfur , blue nile , and southern kordofan ( see figure 1 ) .
