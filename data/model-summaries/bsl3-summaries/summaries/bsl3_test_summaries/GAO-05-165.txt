as requested , this report discusses the views of nationally recognized experts on key issues concerning wastewater security , including the potential vulnerabilities of wastewater systems ; activities that most warrant federal support to mitigate the risk of terrorism ; and the criteria that the experts believe should be used to determine how any federal funds are allocated among recipients to improve their security and the methods the experts suggest should be used to distribute these funds .
in 2003 , congress responded by considering legislation that would have authorized $200 million for use in making grants to wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement security improvements , $15 million for technical assistance for small systems , and $5 million over 5 years for refinement to vulnerability assessment methodologies .
wastewater systems in the united states provide essential services to residential , commercial , and industrial users by collecting and treating wastewater and discharging it into receiving waters .
while more federal resources have been directed toward drinking water security than wastewater security , some maintain that wastewater systems , like drinking water systems , also possess vulnerabilities that could be exploited .
in light of the events of september 11 , 2001 , congress and the executive branch have placed increased attention on improving the security of the nation's water infrastructure — including wastewater systems — to protect against future terrorist threats .
