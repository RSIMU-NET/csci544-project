my statement today will identify ( 1 ) the extent to which the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has adopted market - based mechanisms for commercial uses of spectrum , ( 2 ) the extent to which market - based mechanisms have been adopted for federal government use of spectrum , ( 3 ) options for improving spectrum management , and ( 4 ) potential barriers to spectrum reform .
as you know , the radio - frequency spectrum is used to provide an array of wireless communications services that are critical to the u.s. economy and various government missions , such as national security .
demand for radio - frequency spectrum has exploded over the past several decades as new technologies and services have been — and continue to be — brought to the market in the private sector , and new mission needs unfold among government users .
the most frequently cited options include ( 1 ) extending fcc's auction authority , ( 2 ) reexamining the use and distribution of spectrum , and ( 3 ) ensuring clearly defined rights and flexibility in commercially licensed spectrum bands ; there was no consensus on these options , except for extending fcc's auction authority .
