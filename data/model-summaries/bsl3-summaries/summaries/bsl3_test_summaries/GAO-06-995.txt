specifically , we determined ( 1 ) the extent to which the air force has increased its use of commercial acquisition to obtain expected benefits and ( 2 ) the risks associated with air force use of commercial acquisition .
for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been urged by commissions , panels , and legislation to make increased use of commercial acquisitions to take advantage of the efficiencies of the commercial marketplace .
to help ensure the increased use of commercial acquisition , the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) established and the air force implemented two commercial acquisition goals to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2005 .
these were to double the dollar value of commercial acquisition contract actions awarded in 1999 ( for the air force this meant going from about $3 billion to about $6 billion ) and strive to increase the number of commercial contract actions awarded to 50 percent of all air force contract actions .
in setting these goals , osd expected that the increased use of commercial acquisition would provide dod with greater access to commercial markets ( products and service types ) with increased competition , better prices , and new market entrants and / or technologies .
