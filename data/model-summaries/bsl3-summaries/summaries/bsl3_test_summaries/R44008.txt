during recent congresses many bills have been introduced that would provide funding to states aiming to facilitate improvements in the quality of , and access to , early childhood education ( ece ) programs .
the importance of early learning for children's healthy development and positive outcomes in school and the workforce has become a subject of increasing interest to the public , members of congress , and the adm inistration .
increased congressional interest in early childhood care and education issues has been driven , in part , by research on the role of ece programs in raising academic achievement and other desired student outcomes .
the effectiveness of ece programs is usually measured by assessing children's cognitive functioning , school readiness , and / or social behavior .
nieer based its estimates on data from studies of two high quality preschool programs serving low - income children â€” the chicago child parent center ( ccpc ) and the perry preschool program .
in addition , there is a growing body of research exploring the cost - effectiveness of investments in high quality preschool .
the national institute for early education research ( nieer ) estimated the average lifetime benefits of universally available preschool for all three - and four - year - olds to be considerably larger than the costs for two years of prekindergarten .
