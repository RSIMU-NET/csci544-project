we are making 14 recommendations to energy to ( 1 ) improve controls over the review and approval process for contractor invoices ; ( 2 ) strengthen accountability for government - owned equipment purchased by contractors ; ( 3 ) improve reporting and control of overall contract costs , including subcontractor costs ; and ( 4 ) pursue opportunities for recovery of improper and questionable costs identified in this report .
specifically , we determined whether ( 1 ) internal controls over program payments were adequately designed to provide reasonable assurance that improper payments to contractors would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business and ( 2 ) program payments were properly supported as a valid use of government funds .
the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act of 2000 ( eeoicpa ) was passed by congress , in part , to provide for timely compensation of former nuclear weapons workers who sustained illnesses that could be linked to exposure to toxic substances while employed at a department of energy ( energy ) facility .
concerned with the relatively small number of finalized cases and the overall effectiveness of the program , the senate energy and natural resources committee held three hearings from november 2003 through march 2004 that highlighted programmatic challenges to achieving the program's objectives and energy's limited progress in overcoming them .
