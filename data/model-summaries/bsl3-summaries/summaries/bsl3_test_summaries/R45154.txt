since 1935 , the constitutional term of a congress has begun on january 3 of each odd - numbered year and has ended on january 3 of the next odd - numbered year .
a "lame duck" session of congress is one that takes place after the election for the next congress has been held but before the current congress has reached the end of its constitutional term .
a lame duck session may occur under the following circumstances: ( 1 ) by a previously enacted law prescribing an additional session of congress ; ( 2 ) following a recess within a session but spanning the election ; ( 3 ) under authority granted to the leadership at the time of a contingent adjournment or recess of the session ; ( 4 ) by continuing to meet , perhaps in pro forma sessions , throughout the period spanning the election ; and ( 5 ) in response to a presidential proclamation calling an extraordinary session .
as a result , any meeting of congress that occurs between the congressional election in november of an even - numbered year and the following january 3 is a lame duck session .
