congress established the national wild and scenic rivers system ( nwsrs ) in 1968 through the wild and scenic rivers act ( wsra ) .
the wsra established a policy of preserving designated free - flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations .
it also complemented the then - current national policy of constructing dams and other structures that altered flow along many rivers .
for individual wsrs , congress has made specific provisions concerning river management , land acquisition and use in river corridors , and other matters .
the act states that the studies are to discuss , among other things , the "outstandingly remarkable values" ( orvs ) that make the area worthy or unworthy of addition to the system ; current land ownership and use ; potential future uses of the land and water that could be affected by addition to the system ; the federal agency that would administer the area ; the cost of acquiring the land , if applicable ; and the extent to which management costs would be shared by state and local agencies .
ongoing issues for congress include whether to designate additional wsrs , how to address local and federal roles on nonfederal river segments , and more .
