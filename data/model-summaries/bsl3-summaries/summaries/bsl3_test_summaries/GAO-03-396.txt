since the mid - 1990s , gao has highlighted the need for the department of state and other agencies to establish a systematic process for determining their overseas staffing levels .
in august 2001 , the president's management agenda directed all agencies to “rightsize” their overseas presence to the minimum necessary to meet u.s. foreign policy goals .
in keeping with the administration's rightsizing initiative , we are recommending that the director of omb , in coordination with the secretary of state , ensure that application of our framework be expanded as a basis for assessing staffing levels at embassies and consulates worldwide ; and the secretary of state adopt the framework as part of the embassy mission performance planning process to ensure participation of all agencies at posts and the use of comparable criteria to address security , mission , cost issues , and rightsizing options .
shortly after the 1998 bombings of two u.s. embassies in east africa , two high level independent groups called for the reassessment of staffing levels at u.s. embassies and consulates .
to support the long - standing need for a successful rightsizing initiative , in 2002 we developed a framework that identifies critical elements of embassy operations — physical security , mission priorities and requirements , and cost — and also includes rightsizing options for consideration .
