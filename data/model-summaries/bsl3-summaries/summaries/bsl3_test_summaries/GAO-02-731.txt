because of the susceptibility of the program to fraud and abuse , the congress enacted the health care fraud and abuse control ( hcfac ) program as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) , public law 104-91 .
hcfac , which is administered by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( oig ) and the department of justice ( doj ) , established a national framework to coordinate federal , state , and local law enforcement efforts to detect , prevent , and prosecute health care fraud and abuse in the public and private sectors .
the medicare program is the nation's largest health insurer with almost 40 million beneficiaries and outlays of over $219 billion annually .
to facilitate providing the congress and other decision makers with relevant information on program performance and results , we recommend that the attorney general and the secretary of hhs assess the feasibility of tracking cost savings and expenditures attributable to hcfac activities by the various federal programs affected .
to accomplish the first objective , identifying and assessing the propriety of amounts reported for deposits in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as ( 1 ) penalties and multiple damages , ( 2 ) criminal fines , ( 3 ) civil monetary penalties , and ( 4 ) gifts and bequests , we did the following: reviewed the joint hhs and doj hcfac reports for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to identify amounts deposited to the trust fund .
