since 1988 , the medicaid program has offered transitional medicaid assistance , which provides certain families who are losing medicaid as a result of employment or increased income up to 1 year of additional medicaid health insurance coverage .
because the transitional medicaid provision is due to expire in september 2002 and you are considering its extension , you asked us to provide information on the role this program plays in supporting transitions from welfare to work .
transitional medicaid assistance was originally enacted for a 10-year period , and has twice been extended to help provide continued health insurance coverage to families moving into employment .
states have implemented a variety of initiatives intended to help families move from cash assistance to the workforce , including some enhancements to transitional medicaid .
employment in low - wage or part - time positions — which is common for these newly working individuals — frequently does not provide adequate access to affordable health insurance , whether through employer - sponsored or individually purchased health insurance , thus making transitional medicaid coverage an important option .
the enactment of federal welfare reform in august 1996 significantly changed federal welfare policy for low - income families with children in several ways , including establishing a 5-year lifetime limit on cash assistance .
