this report describes ( 1 ) states' practices for overseeing health insurance premium rates in 2010 , including the outcomes of premium rate reviews ; and ( 2 ) changes that states that received hhs rate review grants have begun making to enhance their oversight of health insurance premium rates .
finally , some states reported taking steps to review their current authority to determine if changes were necessary .
we selected these states — california , illinois , maine , michigan , and texas — based on differences among the five states in terms of their ( 1 ) state insurance departments' authority to oversee premium rates , ( 2 ) proposed changes to their existing practices for overseeing premium rates , ( 3 ) size , and ( 4 ) geographic location .
while oversight of private health insurance , including premium rates , is primarily a state responsibility , the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) established a role for the department of health and human services ( hhs ) by requiring the secretary of hhs to work with states to establish a process for the annual review of unreasonable premium increases .
