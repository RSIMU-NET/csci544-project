since its creation in 1958 , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has owned and operated a small fleet of aircraft to provide passenger transportation .
to assess reasonableness of costs , use , and agency oversight and management of the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) passenger aircraft services , we met with officials of nasa's office of infrastructure and administration aircraft management office and appropriate officials at the johnson space center , houston , texas ; marshall space flight center , huntsville , alabama ; kennedy space center , cape canaveral , florida ; wallops flight facility , wallops island , virginia ; and dryden flight research center , edwards , california .
in this regard , you requested that our audit address ( 1 ) the relative cost of nasa passenger aircraft services compared with commercial coach costs , ( 2 ) whether nasa's retention and operation of aircraft for passenger transportation was in accordance with applicable governmentwide guidance , and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of nasa's oversight and management of its passenger aircraft services .
immediate actions to dispose of all aircraft not needed to address mission requirements and adoption of more flexible , less costly alternatives to satisfy future mission requirements would best position nasa to meet its stewardship responsibilities for taxpayer funds it receives , and better enable it to meet its current fiscal challenges .
