in addition , in recent years , faa has been licensing an increasing number of commercial space launches , including those for the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) commercial cargo program , which contracts with commercial launch companies to transport cargo to the international space station ( iss ) .
my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) developments in the commercial space launch industry and ( 2 ) challenges faa faces in overseeing and promoting the industry .
the u.s. commercial space launch industry , which the federal aviation administration ( faa ) reports had estimated revenues of $617 million in 2015 , has experienced considerable change since the enactment of the commercial space launch amendments act of 2004 ( “the act” ) .
as part of its safety oversight responsibilities , faa licenses and permits launches as well as licenses launch sites .
for the 2015 report , we reviewed faa's guidance on its launch permit , licensing , and safety oversight activities ; interviewed faa officials , industry stakeholders , and experts who were selected on the basis of their knowledge of faa's oversight of the commercial space launch industry ; and visited spaceports where two 2014 launch mishaps occurred .
