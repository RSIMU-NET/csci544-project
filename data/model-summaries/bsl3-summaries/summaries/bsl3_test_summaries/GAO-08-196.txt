with the federal land transaction facilitation act of 2000 ( fltfa ) set to expire in july 2010 , we were asked to ( 1 ) determine the extent to which the bureau of land management ( blm ) has generated revenue for the fltfa program , ( 2 ) identify challenges blm faces in conducting future sales , ( 3 ) determine the extent to which the agencies have spent funds under fltfa , and ( 4 ) identify challenges the agencies face in conducting future acquisitions .
the four major federal land management agencies — the u.s. department of the interior's bureau of land management ( blm ) , fish and wildlife service , and national park service , and the u.s. department of agriculture's forest service — administer approximately 628 million acres , or about 28 percent of the land area in the united states .
blm , which manages approximately 256 million acres of federal land , is authorized to sell or exchange land identified in its land use plans ; 4 , the other three land management agencies have limited or no sales authority .
these public lands are mostly in the 11 western states and alaska , where the four agencies manage lands that constitute significant portions of the states' acreage , ranging from about 28 percent in washington state to about 81 percent in nevada .
