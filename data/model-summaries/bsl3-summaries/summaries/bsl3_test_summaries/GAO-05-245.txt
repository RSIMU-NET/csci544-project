in fiscal year 2003 , the federal food stamp program , administered by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) , reported it made payment errors totaling about $1.4 billion in benefits .
due to concerns about ensuring payment accuracy , we examined ( 1 ) what is included in the national food stamp payment error rate and how has the rate changed over time , ( 2 ) what is known about the causes of food stamp payment errors , and ( 3 ) what actions usda and states have taken to reduce these payment errors .
fns's quality control ( qc ) system measures payment accuracy and monitors how accurately states determine food stamp eligibility and calculate benefits .
in addition , some food stamp participants receive benefits from other programs , such as medicaid or the cash assistance program temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) .
fns and the states will continue to face a challenge in balancing the goals of payment accuracy , increasing program participation rates , and the need to contain program costs .
these differences add to the complexity of determining and recertifying eligibility and program benefits .
