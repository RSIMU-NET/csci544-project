ocr ( 1 ) investigates complaints it receives from patients and others regarding access to patient medical records , ( 2 ) audits a sample of providers to determine the extent to which their policies and procedures are compliant with hipaa , ( 3 ) reports to congress on compliance with hipaa , and ( 4 ) educates patients and providers about patients' rights to access their medical records .

we conducted interviews with relevant stakeholders , including representatives from seven release - of - information ( roi ) vendors and nine individuals or entities with expertise in hipaa , including hipaa lawyers in both private practice and who work in health policy .
