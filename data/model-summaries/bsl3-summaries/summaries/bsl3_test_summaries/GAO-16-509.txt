the objectives of this report are to assess ( 1 ) the extent to which lessons learned from implementing the interim cap goals were incorporated into the governance of the current cap goals ; ( 2 ) the extent to which gprama requirements for reporting on cap goal progress are included in the selected cap goal quarterly progress updates ; and ( 3 ) the initial reported progress in implementing the selected cap goals .
many of the results the federal government seeks to achieve require the coordinated effort of more than one federal agency , level of government , or sector .
the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) established a framework and processes aimed at encouraging a more crosscutting and integrated approach to federal performance , and improving transparency and accountability for these efforts .
effectively managing these government - wide efforts requires coordination between multiple federal agencies and transparent communications to the congress and decision makers about progress toward achieving results .
among other things , gprama requires the office of management and budget ( omb ) to coordinate with agencies to develop federal government priority goals ( known as cross - agency priority or cap goals ) — 4-year outcome - oriented goals covering a number of crosscutting mission areas — as well as goals to improve management across the federal government .
