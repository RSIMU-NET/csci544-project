i am pleased to be here today to discuss the findings and recommendations from our march 2009 report on the international atomic energy agency's ( iaea ) technical cooperation ( tc ) program and the actions the department of state and iaea have taken to implement the recommendations in that report .
in march 2011 , we reviewed documentation provided by state and iaea and interviewed state and department of energy ( doe ) officials to obtain updated information on actions taken to implement our 2009 recommendations .
it has the dual mission of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and verifying that nuclear technologies and materials intended for peaceful purposes are not diverted to weapons development efforts .
we also interviewed a doe official for his views regarding changes in the quantity and timeliness of information doe has received on tc proposals since our 2009 report and whether this information has improved doe's ability to assess proposed tc projects for potential proliferation concerns .
to that end , the tc program helps iaea member states achieve their sustainable development priorities by furnishing them with relevant nuclear technologies and expertise , and the program plays a role in facilitating article iv of the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons ( npt ) , which affirms that all states party to the treaty have a right to participate in the exchange of equipment , materials , and scientific and technological information for peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
