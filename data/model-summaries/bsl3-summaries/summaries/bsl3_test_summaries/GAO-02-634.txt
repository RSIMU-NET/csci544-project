because of your interest in the issues of prescription drug diversion and control , you asked us to address the following questions: ( 1 ) how do the 15 pdmps compare across states in terms of objectives , design , and operation ? .
 ( 2 ) what benefits have state pdmps produced ? .
fifteen states currently operate prescription drug monitoring programs ( pdmps ) as a means to control the illegal diversion of prescription drugs .
the increasing diversion of prescription drugs for illegal use is a disturbing trend in the nation's battle against drug abuse .
the most frequently diverted prescription drugs are those that are prone to abuse , addiction , and dependence , such as hydrocodone ( the active ingredient in lortab and many other drugs ) , diazepam ( valium ) , methylphenidate ( ritalin ) , and oxycodone ( the active ingredient in oxycontin and many other drugs ) .
according to the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , increases in the extent of prescription drug abuse and in emergency room admissions related to prescription drug abuse , as well as an increase in the theft and illegal resale of prescription drugs , indicate that drug diversion is a growing problem nationwide .
