my testimony is based on our report , released today , that discusses steps the forest service and interior agencies have taken to ( 1 ) address key operational areas that could help contain the costs of preparing for and responding to wildland fires and ( 2 ) improve their management of their cost - containment efforts .
wildland fire appropriations to prepare for and respond to wildland fires , including appropriations for reducing fuels , have increased from an average of $1.1 billion annually from fiscal years 1996 through 2000 to an average of more than $2.9 billion annually from fiscal years 2001 through 2005 ; adjusted for inflation , these appropriations increased from $1.3 billion to $3.1 billion .
accumulations of fuels , due in part to past suppression policies ; severe drought and weather in some areas of the country ; and continued development in or near wildlands — an area commonly known as the wildland - urban interface — have contributed to increased costs .
thus , to help the agencies manage their ongoing efforts to contain wildland fire costs effectively and efficiently , and to assist congress in its oversight role , we recommended in our report that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior work together to direct their respective agencies to ( 1 ) establish clearly defined goals and measurable objectives for containing wildland fire costs , ( 2 ) develop a strategy to achieve these goals and objectives , ( 3 ) establish performance measures that are aligned with these goals and objectives , and ( 4 ) establish a framework to ensure that officials are held accountable for achieving the goals and objectives .
