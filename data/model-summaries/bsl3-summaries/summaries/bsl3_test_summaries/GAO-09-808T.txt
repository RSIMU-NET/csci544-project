for example , a business chapter 7 bankruptcy case with assets of $50,000 to $499,999 is expected to take about twice as much judge time as a nonbusiness chapter 7 case with assets of $50,000 to $499,999 .
my statement today is based on the results of our 2003 review of documentation provided by the federal judicial center ( fjc ) and the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aousc ) and interviews with officials in each organization as well as selected updates conducted in june 2009 .
we assessed whether weighted case filings were a reasonable means of measuring bankruptcy judges' case - related workload and assessed the methodology of proposals to update the current case weights .
changes in the intervening years in such factors as case characteristics , case management practices , or new statutory and procedural requirements , such as the implementation of the 2005 bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act ( the bankruptcy reform act ) , may have affected whether the case weights continue to be a reasonably accurate measure of case - related judge workload .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the results of our 2003 review and assessment of bankruptcy court weighted case filings , the workload measure the judicial conference first considers in assessing the need for additional bankruptcy judges .
