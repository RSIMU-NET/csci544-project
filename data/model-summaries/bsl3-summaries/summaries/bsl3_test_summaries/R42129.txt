in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the perception that the unregulated over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives market contributed to systemic risk , the dodd - frank act ( p.l .
111-203 ) sought to remake the otc market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges .
derivative contracts are an array of financial instruments with one feature in common: their value is linked to , or derives from , changes in some underlying variable , such as the price of a physical commodity , a stock index , or an interest rate .
nevertheless , such firms have continued to be concerned that the act could impose indirect costs on them , or that the rulemaking process by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) could do so .
derivatives contracts — futures contracts , options , and swaps — gain or lose value as the underlying rates or prices change , even though the holder may not actually own the underlying asset .
clearinghouses require traders to put down cash ( called initial margin ) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses , and they require subsequent deposits ( called maintenance margin ) to cover actual losses to the position .
