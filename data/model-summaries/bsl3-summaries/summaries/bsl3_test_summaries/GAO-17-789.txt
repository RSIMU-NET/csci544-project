these key practices include ( 1 ) defining and articulating a common outcome ; ( 2 ) establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies ; ( 3 ) identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources ; ( 4 ) agreeing on roles and responsibilities ; ( 5 ) establishing compatible policies , procedures , systems , and other means to operate across agency boundaries ; ( 6 ) developing mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results ; and ( 7 ) reinforcing agency accountability for collaborative efforts through plans and reports , among others .
the objectives of this report are to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the navy and marine corps have completed training for amphibious operations priorities and taken steps to mitigate any training shortfalls , ( 2 ) the navy's and marine corps' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations incorporate leading collaborative practices , and ( 3 ) the marine corps has integrated selected virtual training devices into its operational training .
to achieve desired goals and align efforts to maximize training opportunities for amphibious operations , we recommend the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy , in coordination with the chief of naval operations and commandant of the marine corps , to clarify the organizations responsible and time frames to define and articulate common outcomes for naval integration , and use those outcomes to develop a joint strategy ; more fully establish compatible policies , procedures , and systems ; better leverage training resources ; and establish mechanisms to monitor results .
