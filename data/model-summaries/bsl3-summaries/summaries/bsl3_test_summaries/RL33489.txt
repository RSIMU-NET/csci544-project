doj oig lists grant management as a management challenge because ( 1 ) oig reviews continue to find that many grantees do not submit financial and progress reports ; ( 2 ) numerous deficiencies continue to be found in the cops office's monitoring of grantee activities ; ( 3 ) audits found that grants were not regularly awarded in a timely manner and grantees were slow to spend funds ; and ( 4 ) more than 375 audits of cops grants have resulted in significant dollar - related findings .
