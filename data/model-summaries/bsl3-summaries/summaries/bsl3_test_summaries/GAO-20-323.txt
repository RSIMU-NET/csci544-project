the department of defense ( dod ) relies on professional military education ( pme ) and joint professional military education ( jpme ) to prepare its military personnel , throughout their careers , for the intellectual demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically involve more than a single military service .
in this report , we assess the extent to which ( 1 ) the military services' pme programs have met civilian and jpme accreditation requirements , ( 2 ) the office of the secretary of defense has assessed the effectiveness of the military services' pme programs , and ( 3 ) the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) has monitored the military services' pme program budgets .
the usd ( comptroller ) focuses on budgetary formulation and execution ; financial management and oversight ; and accounting policy ; among other things .
where appropriate , we also considered select training and development leading practices ( which include education ) , standards for internal control in the federal government , and the dod financial management regulation to assess ousd ( p&r ) oversight of these programs .
 ( recommendation 7 ) .
