this report addresses ( 1 ) information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions during repair and alteration projects in federally owned buildings held by gsa and ( 2 ) how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen site conditions .
the general services administration ( gsa ) annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars making major and minor repairs and alterations to the more than 1,500 federally owned buildings that it holds .
to improve risk assessments for repair and alteration projects , we recommend that the administrator of gsa develop and implement a plan to periodically analyze information gsa already collects , for example , based on a representative sample of repair and alterations projects , in order to: identify the specific impacts unforeseen conditions have had on project costs , schedules , and scope of work ; analyze the causes of these conditions for those projects that experienced unforeseen site conditions ; and identify actions that will be taken to address the potential causes of unforeseen site conditions .
the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) identify information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions during selected repair and alteration projects in federally owned buildings held by the general services administration ( gsa ) and to ( 2 ) determine how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen site conditions .
