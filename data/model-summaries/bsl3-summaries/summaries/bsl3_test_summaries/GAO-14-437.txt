to determine the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) has developed procedures for managing the technical corrosion collaboration ( tcc ) program , we reviewed dod's guidance â€” the 2014 dod corrosion prevention and mitigation strategic plan .
in 2013 , the department of defense ( dod ) reported spending an estimated $20.8 billion annually to prevent and mitigate corrosion of all of its assets , including military equipment , weapons , facilities , and other infrastructure .
this report addresses to what extent dod ( 1 ) has established procedures for managing the tcc program , ( 2 ) can provide information on the amount of funds spent on the program since inception , and ( 3 ) has established goals for the tcc program and transitioned demonstrated results from projects to the military departments .
to help identify technology or methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion , and educate personnel about corrosion prevention and mitigation , dod funds research by universities and military research labs that participate in dod's technical corrosion collaboration ( tcc ) program , a research and development program .
congress has taken a series of legislative actions aimed at enhancing dod's ability to effectively address corrosion prevention and mitigation , and to provide congress with greater transparency over the department's corrosion - prevention and mitigation efforts .
