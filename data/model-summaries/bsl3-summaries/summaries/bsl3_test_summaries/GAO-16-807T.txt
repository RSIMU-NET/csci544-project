while the department has made progress in these efforts , it has also faced significant information technology challenges that contributed to our designation of va health care as a high risk area .
thank you for inviting me to testify at today's hearing on the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) electronic health record system — the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) — and the department's progress toward achieving interoperability with the department of defense ( dod ) .
for almost two decades , va has been working with dod to advance electronic health record interoperability between their systems , in an attempt to achieve the seamless sharing of health care data and make patient data more readily available to health care providers , reduce medical errors , and streamline administrative functions .
in addition , we have reported on actions that va has taken with regard to modernizing its electronic health record system .
also , for much of this same time period , va has been planning and taking steps toward the modernization of its electronic health record system , with the intent of ensuring that the department can effectively deliver care for the millions of veterans and others that it serves .
