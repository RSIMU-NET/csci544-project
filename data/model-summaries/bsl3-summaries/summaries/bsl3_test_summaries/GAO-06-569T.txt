these issues relate to ( 1 ) the reasonableness of cost structures and agent practices in the title insurance market that are not typical of other insurance markets ; ( 2 ) activities identified in recent investigations that may have benefited real estate or other professionals rather than consumers ; and ( 3 ) proposed regulatory changes that would affect the way that title insurance is sold .
as you are aware , title insurance is designed to ensure clear ownership of a property when it is sold or refinanced , and is a required part of most real estate purchases .
we also had discussions with officials from national organizations whose members are involved in the marketing or sale of title insurance ; the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) ; the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) ; several state regulatory officials ; title insurers and agents ; and industry consultants .
according to a recent national survey of lenders , title insurance can account for as much as one - third of loan origination and closing fees .
recent investigations and studies have raised questions about practices and competition within the industry , in part because title insurance differs markedly from other types of insurance .
