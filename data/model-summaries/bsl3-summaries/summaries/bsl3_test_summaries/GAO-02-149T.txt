on september 28 , 2001 , we released a report that describes ( 1 ) the research and preparedness activities being undertaken by federal departments and agencies to manage the consequences of a bioterrorist attack , ( 2 ) the coordination of these activities , and ( 3 ) the findings of reports on the preparedness of state and local jurisdictions to respond to a bioterrorist attack .
preparing to respond to the public health and medical consequences of a bioterrorist attack poses some challenges that are different from those in other types of terrorist attacks , such as bombings .
in summary , we identified more than 20 federal departments and agencies as having a role in preparing for or responding to the public health and medical consequences of a bioterrorist attack .
these agencies are participating in a variety of activities , from improving the detection of biological agents to developing a national stockpile of pharmaceuticals to treat victims of disasters .
federal spending on domestic preparedness for terrorist attacks involving wmds has risen 310 percent since fiscal year 1998 , to approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2001 , and may increase significantly after the events of september 11 , 2001 .
