specifically , this report addresses ( 1 ) dod's approach for fuel demand management , including at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan ; ( 2 ) the extent to which dod has initiatives to promote fuel efficiency at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan and efforts to coordinate and collaborate on such initiatives ; and ( 3 ) dod's efforts to measure the results of its fuel demand management initiatives and establish a baseline measure of fuel consumption in afghanistan .
dod's operational energy strategy established three overarching operational energy goals to: ( 1 ) reduce demand for energy in military operations , ( 2 ) expand and secure energy supplies , and ( 3 ) build energy security into the future force , and dod has begun to take steps to establish metrics to measure progress toward these goals .
the department of defense ( dod ) depends heavily on petroleum - based fuel to sustain its forward - deployed locations around the world â€” particularly at remote locations that are not connected to local power grids and must rely on fuel - consuming generators for heating , cooling , lighting , and other base support activities .
