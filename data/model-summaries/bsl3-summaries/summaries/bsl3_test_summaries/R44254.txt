long - standing u.s. policy has treated the u.s. - flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary to be available in times of war or national emergency .
when the united states is involved in an extended military conflict overseas , 90% or more of military cargoes are typically carried by ship .
this report explains the motivation behind cargo preference law , discusses issues concerning the cost - effectiveness of the program , and reviews attempts to apply cargo preference to the nation's oil trade .
government - impelled cargo is government - owned cargo such as military supplies , foreign aid such as food , and any privately owned cargo financed by the federal government , such as goods purchased with an export - import bank loan .
congress also has determined that for economic security reasons , the united states should have a commercial fleet active in international commerce .
regulations suggested , but not formally proposed , by the u.s. maritime administration ( marad ) would also require that some u.s. - bound cargo financed by the government be carried on u.s. - flag ships .
however , preference cargo is critical to some u.s. - flag ship lines , as u.s. - flag ships are not price - competitive with foreign - flag ships in carrying the overwhelming bulk of exports and imports transacted in the private sector .
