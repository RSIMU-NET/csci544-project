civilian agencies' efforts to ( 1 ) compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories and ( 2 ) review and report on their fiscal year 2010 inventories .
to satisfy the mandate , we assessed civilian agencies' efforts to ( 1 ) compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories and ( 2 ) review and report on their fiscal year 2010 inventories .
omb directed agencies to conduct a meaningful review of their fiscal year 2010 inventory and identify at a minimum ( 1 ) the special interest functions studied by the agency , including the dollars obligated to those specific product and service codes in fiscal year 2010 ; ( 2 ) the methodology used to support their reviews ; ( 3 ) their findings ; and ( 4 ) the actions taken or planned by the agency to address any identified weaknesses or challenges .
to assess agencies' efforts to compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories , we reviewed the act , omb guidance , and the proposed federal acquisition regulation ( far ) rule on service contract inventories .
congress has also expressed concern with agencies' reliance on contractors and has directed omb and other federal agencies to examine similar workforce issues , which include identifying functions that are not appropriate for contractors to perform or require increased government oversight .
