china has made clear advances in space capabilities over the past decade .
china sent humans into space in 2003 and 2005 , and orbited a lunar explorer in october 2007 that is paving the way for additional moon exploration .
the country has launched over 100 orbital missions since 1970 , including a string of 50 consecutive successful long march rocket launches from 1996 to 2006 , after overcoming technical problems with the help of u.s. companies in the mid - 1990s .
china's space program was initially institutionalized under the people's liberation army ( pla ) .
china's space activities and intentions are not transparent ; the dual - use nature of most space technology compounds the uncertainties of interpreting chinese decision making .
in a series of government reforms in the 1990s , the china national space administration ( cnsa ) — roughly equivalent to the u.s. national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) — was created under the civilian commission of science , technology and industry for national defense .
china is now a world leader in yearly space launches , yet remains notably less active than russia or the united states , as shown in table 1 .
