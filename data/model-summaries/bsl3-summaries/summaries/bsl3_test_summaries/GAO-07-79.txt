we examined the relationship between the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( joint commission ) and joint commission resources , inc. ( jcr ) as it relates to the independence of the joint commissions' hospital accreditation process from jcr's hospital consulting services .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the federal agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers medicare , has established conditions of participation that hospitals must meet to be eligible to participate in the medicare program .
in addition , even with appropriate policies and procedures in place , it will take ongoing monitoring and a concerted effort on the part of the leadership of both organizations to ensure that these policies and procedures are appropriately implemented by both their board and staff members .
in order to be eligible to receive payments from medicare — the federal program that provides health care benefits to over 42 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries — hospitals must meet certain criteria established by federal law .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) how the joint commission and jcr are related to one another through their governance structure and operations , and ( 2 ) the significant steps both organizations have taken to prevent the improper sharing of facility - specific information , obtained through their hospital accreditation and consulting activities , since the creation of jcr .
