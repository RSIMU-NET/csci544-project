this report examines ( 1 ) the number of mine plans the bureau of land management ( blm ) and the forest service approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , the time it took these agencies to complete the mine plan review process , and the extent to which these agencies track this process ; and ( 2 ) the challenges , if any , that have affected the length of time for blm and the forest service to complete the review process , and the actions , if any , these agencies have taken to address these challenges .
the mining law of 1872 encouraged development of the west by opening up federal land to exploration , extraction , and development of hardrock minerals such as gold , silver , and copper .
without modifying the system to provide such information , blm is limited in its ability to effectively oversee the extraction of minerals from federal land and manage the mine plan review process .
the forest service ( responding on behalf of agriculture ) generally agreed with the findings in the report and indicated that our recommendations are consistent with efforts they have underway or plan to incorporate .
