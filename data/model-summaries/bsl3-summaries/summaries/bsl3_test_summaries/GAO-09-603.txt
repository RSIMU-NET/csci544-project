specifically , we identified ( 1 ) to what extent fta's triennial reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 , ( 2 ) the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process , and ( 3 ) fta's performance measures for the triennial review and to what extent fta's measures meet key attributes of successful performance measures .
the department of transportation's federal transit administration ( fta ) fosters the development and maintenance of bus , subway , trolley , passenger ferry boat , and other public transportation systems through several grant programs to transit agencies serving both rural ( population less than 50,000 ) and urban communities ( population 50,000 or more ) .
we selected these grantees on several factors , including their past performance , as assessed by triennial reviews ; having both a triennial review and another fta oversight review in the same fiscal year ; and demographic features , such as size and geographic region .
to determine the extent to which the triennial reviews indicate grantees met federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 , we reviewed documentation on the federal transit administration's ( fta ) oversight tracking system ( otrak ) â€” the official electronic information system for tracking and monitoring oversight activities .
