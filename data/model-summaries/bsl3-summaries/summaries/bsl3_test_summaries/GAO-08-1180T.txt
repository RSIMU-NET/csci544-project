lanl , located in los alamos , new mexico , has a multibillion dollar annual budget and is one of three national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) laboratories responsible for designing and developing a safe , secure , and reliable nuclear weapons deterrent .
our testimony today discusses ( 1 ) physical security at lanl , ( 2 ) preliminary observations from ongoing work on physical security at livermore , and ( 3 ) cyber security at lanl .
in fiscal year 2007 , lanl budgeted nearly $200 million to provide the laboratory with physical and cyber security to protect the sensitive and classified assets on which laboratory employees rely to conduct their work .
a successful physical or cyber attack on nnsa sites containing nuclear weapons , the material used in nuclear weapons , or information pertaining to the people who design and maintain the u.s. nuclear deterrent could have devastating consequences for the site , its surrounding communities , and the nation's security .
for example , ( 1 ) its risk assessment was not comprehensive , ( 2 ) specific guidance was missing from policies and procedures , ( 3 ) the network security plan was incomplete , ( 4 ) system testing had shortcomings , ( 5 ) remedial action plans were incomplete and corrective actions were not always timely , and ( 6 ) the network contingency plan was incomplete and inadequately tested .
