the public health service act ( phsa ) establishes authority for a wide range of activities that directly or indirectly affect the health of the u.s. population .
for example , institutions may receive title vii grants to implement residency programs at medical and dental schools ; recruitment and retention initiatives in community - based educational settings ; and health workforce data collection activities within state health departments .
many title vii programs and activities were reauthorized in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
the aca also made sweeping changes to health care financing and delivery by restructuring the private health insurance market and setting minimum standards for health insurance coverage .
in title vii , health professions education , the phsa supports an education and training pipeline for professionals and pre - professionals to work in the medical , dental , public health , and allied health professions .
health policy experts expect this mandate combined with additional changes will increase health insurance coverage to be accompanied by a likely increased demand for health services and health care providers .
the aca also created the national health care workforce commission for federal health workforce planning , and state health care workforce development grants .
