 ( recommendation 1 ) the administrator of fra should work with railroads to engage state and local governments to ( a ) identify community - specific impacts of train operations , including longer trains , where streets and highways cross railroad rights - of - way and ( b ) develop potential solutions to reduce those impacts .
 ( recommendation 2 ) .
we are making the following two recommendations to fra: the administrator of fra should develop a strategy for sharing fra's research results with internal and external stakeholders and implement that strategy for its research on the safety impacts of very long trains .
this report examines what is known about changes in freight train length over time , views of selected stakeholders on safety considerations for operating longer trains and the potential impact of these trains on communities , and the extent to which fra is assessing any safety risks of operating longer trains .
in 2017 , the united states' freight rail system moved over 1.5- billion tons of goods across the country , including hazardous materials , bulk goods such as grain and coal , and consumer goods .
five of the seven railroads provided data on average train - length in feet over time ; however , only two railroads provided data for a period of at least 10 years .
