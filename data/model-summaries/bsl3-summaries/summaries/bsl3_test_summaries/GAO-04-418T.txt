in addition to this funding , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) administration for children and families ( acf ) monitors states' compliance with key federal goals , specified in part by the adoption and safe families act ( asfa ) of 1997 , to keep children safe and ensure their placement in stable and permanent homes .
my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) states' use of title iv - b funds in providing a wide array of services to prevent the occurrence of abuse , neglect , and foster care placements , as well as other child welfare services ; ( 2 ) factors that hinder states' ability to protect children from abuse and neglect ; and ( 3 ) hhs's role in helping states to overcome the challenges they face in protecting children from abuse and neglect .
since 1994 , designated federal matching funds have been available to states to develop and implement comprehensive case management systems — statewide automated child welfare information systems ( sacwis ) — to manage their child welfare cases as well as to report child abuse and neglect , foster care , and adoption information to the federal government .
