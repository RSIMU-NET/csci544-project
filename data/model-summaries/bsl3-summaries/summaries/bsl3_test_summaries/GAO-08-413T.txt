specifically , strategic human capital transformation and related management reforms ; dod's new pay - for - performance system , known as the national security personnel system ( nsps ) ; contractors in the workforce ; and personnel security clearances are among the serious challenges going forward .
specifically , we have performed in - depth reviews and issued reports on intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ) systems requirements , operations , and acquisitions ; on space acquisitions ; and on the space acquisition workforce â€” issues that are current and critical within the intelligence community .
first , gao has assisted congress for decades in its oversight role and helped federal departments and agencies with disparate missions to improve the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of their operations .
second , as requested , i will comment on the potential impact on gao's ability to perform audit work on personnel security clearances if the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) were to assume management of this issue from the office of management and budget ( omb ) .
human capital transformation and personnel security clearances also have been repeatedly identified as areas of weakness within the intelligence community by others , including the subcommittee on oversight , house permanent select committee on intelligence ; the congressional research service ; and independent commissions .
