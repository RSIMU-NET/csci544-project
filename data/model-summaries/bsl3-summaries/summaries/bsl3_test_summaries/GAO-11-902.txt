the department of defense ( dod ) spends billions of dollars each year to maintain operational systems and processes intended to support its mission .
in this regard , the department requested about $38 billion for its information technology ( it ) investments for fiscal year 2012 , including about $25 billion in combined investments at the departments of the air force , army , and navy ( don ) .
for decades , dod has been challenged in modernizing its systems environment to reduce duplication and increase integration between its systems .
further , dod's enterprise architecture approach relies on each level of its organization ( e.g. , dod - wide , military departments , and programs ) to develop a meaningful architecture .
while dod has been provided with considerable resources for its it systems environment , the department is not managing its systems in a consistent , repeatable , and effective manner that , among other things , maximizes mission performance while minimizing or eliminating system overlap and duplication .
because dod is provided with over $30 billion each year for its it systems environment , the potential for identifying and avoiding the costs associated with duplicative functionality across its it investments is significant .
