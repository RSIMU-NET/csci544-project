specifically , our report examines: how long doj has taken to resolve fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints and what factors have affected these time frames ; the extent to which doj has taken steps to resolve complaints more quickly and determine the impact of any such efforts ; and the extent to which doj's oig and doj - opr have complied with regulatory reporting requirements .
to ensure that complainants receive the periodic updates that they are entitled to and need to determine next steps for their complaint , such as whether or not to seek corrective action from oarm , we recommend that counsel , doj - opr tailor its new case management system or otherwise develop an oversight mechanism to capture information on the office's compliance with regulatory requirements and , further , use that information to monitor and identify opportunities to improve doj - opr's compliance with regulatory requirements .
this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing the following three objectives: determining how long the department of justice ( doj ) has taken to resolve federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) whistleblower retaliation complaints and what factors have affected these time frames , determining the extent to which doj has taken steps to resolve complaints more quickly and determine the impact of any such efforts ; and determining the extent to which doj's office of the inspector general ( oig ) and office of professional responsibility ( doj - opr ) have complied with regulatory reporting requirements .
