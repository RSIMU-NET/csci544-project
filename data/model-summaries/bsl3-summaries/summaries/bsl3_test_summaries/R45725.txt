the jones act , which refers to section 27 of the merchant marine act of 1920 ( p.l .
66-261 ) , requires that vessels transporting cargo from one u.s. point to another u.s. point be u.s. - built , and owned and crewed by u.s. citizens .
the jones act has been an issue in recent congresses , coming into prominence amid debates over puerto rico's economic challenges and recovery from hurricane maria in 2017 ; in the investigation into the sinking of the 40-year - old ship el faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015 ; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas .
the act provides a significant degree of protection from foreign competition for u.s. shipyards , domestic carriers , and american merchant sailors .
the law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the administration develop a national maritime strategy , including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping and enhance u.s. shipbuilding capability .
in may 2018 , the office of management and budget requested public comment on federal requirements that could be modified or repealed to increase efficiency and reduce or eliminate unnecessary or unjustified regulatory burdens in the maritime sector .
