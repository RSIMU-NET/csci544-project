my statement today will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which dhs has used its other transaction authority , ( 2 ) the status of dhs's implementation of gao's previous recommendations , and ( 3 ) the accountability challenges associated with the use of these agreements .
according to dhs officials , this authority , which is set to expire in september 2008 , is a critical tool because it has given the department the flexibility to attract new contractors to help develop and manage the mission of an integrated program of science and technology from basic research to production .
for this reason , it is important to monitor the use of this authority to help ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks to the government .
we have previously reviewed dhs's use of this authority and ethics related management controls and made recommendations for improvements .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) use of its other transaction authority .
however , the flexibility afforded by other transaction authority also carries the risk of reduced accountability and transparency .
operational challenges to successfully making use of other transaction authority include: attracting and ensuring the use of non - traditional contractors ; acquiring intellectual property rights ; financial control ; and maintaining a skilled acquisition workforce .
