as requested , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which the bureau has strengthened its procedures for counting group quarters compared to the 2000 census and ( 2 ) particular challenges and opportunities for an accurate group quarters count in brooklyn .
data from the census — a constitutionally mandated effort — are used to apportion seats in the congress , redraw congressional districts , help allocate more than $400 billion in federal aid to state and local governments , and redraw local political boundaries .
group quarters consist of college dormitories , prisons , nursing homes , and other facilities typically owned or managed by an entity providing housing , services , or both for the residents .
i am pleased to be here today at the brooklyn borough hall to discuss the u.s. census bureau's ( bureau ) efforts to conduct an accurate count of people living in dwellings known as group quarters as part of the 2010 census .
my testimony today is based on our completed and ongoing reviews of the bureau's efforts to build an accurate address list , including address canvassing , where temporary census employees go door - to - door verifying addresses , and an initial group quarters operation called group quarters validation , where the bureau determines whether an address is either a group quarters or conventional housing unit .
