to assist your committee in considering various fda reform proposals , you asked that we ( 1 ) determine how the eu now reviews and approves new drug applications ( nda ) and ( 2 ) explain why the emea was established , how it operates , and how it is financed .

the movement toward uniting individual european countries into a single marketplace has made the european union ( eu ) the largest pharmaceutical market in the world .
as part of its ongoing effort to establish a single european market for pharmaceuticals , the eu recently modified its drug approval procedures and created a new agency — the european medicines evaluation agency ( emea ) — to provide a faster and more efficient drug approval process that would benefit consumers and industry .
with a population of about 370 million , the eu represents a consumer base that is one - third larger than that of the united states .
