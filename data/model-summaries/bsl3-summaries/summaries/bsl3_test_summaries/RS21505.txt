in order to "improve portability and continuity of health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets," congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) on august 21 , 1996 , p.l .
subtitle f of title ii of hipaa is entitled "administrative simplification," and states that the purpose of the subtitle is to improve health care by "encouraging the development of a health information system through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information. .
section 262 directs hhs to issue standards to facilitate the electronic exchange of information .
hipaa requires health care payers and providers who transmit transactions electronically to use standardized data elements to conduct financial and administrative transactions .
in the absence of the enactment of federal legislation , hipaa required hhs to issue privacy regulations .
enforcement of the privacy rule began on april 14 , 2003 , except for small health plans ( those with annual receipts of $5 million or less ) who have until april 2004 to comply .
instead , the law provides that individuals must direct their complaints to hhs' office for civil rights ( ocr ) .
