the regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over what constitutes equitable distribution of federal highway aid among the states .
for many years , "donor states" ( mostly in the south , but also including some states in the midwest and the west ) have complained that they receive significantly less federal highway aid than their highway users pay into the highway account of the highway trust fund ( htf ; unless otherwise indicated all references to the htf are to the highway account ) .
the most recent multi - year authorization , the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea ; p.l .
a series of extension acts has extended safetea , most recently through december 31 , 2011 .
on the other side of the debate , "donee states," those that receive more federal highway aid than they pay in federal highway taxes , have opposed any reduction in their existing shares of total federal highway aid .
since 1982 , congress has included provisions in every surface transportation reauthorization act to address these distributional concerns by assuring that each state receives at least a specified proportion of its trust - fund contributions in highway grants .
