the department of defense ( dod ) , in its december 2001 nuclear posture review , provided a conceptual framework for transforming u.s. strategic capabilities to address the new security risks the united states faces .
specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) whether dod has clearly defined and instilled a common understanding and approach to its global strike concept throughout the department , ( 2 ) the extent to which dod has assessed and developed capabilities needed for global strike , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dod has identified the funding requirements and developed an investment strategy for acquiring new global strike capabilities .
the review proposed a new triad that would bring together the capabilities of nuclear and conventional ( nonnuclear ) offensive strike forces , active and passive defenses , a revitalized defense infrastructure , and enhanced command and control , planning , and intelligence capabilities .
in a september 2007 classified report , we discussed dod efforts to develop a near - term solution to convert some of its trident submarine - launched missiles as a means to deliver an intercontinental prompt conventional strike capability .
dod is also undertaking or has completed several analytical efforts to assess mid - and long - term options for prompt , long - range global strike and examining other conventional strike capability options , such as a new long - range bomber that would be available for global strike missions in less time - sensitive situations .
