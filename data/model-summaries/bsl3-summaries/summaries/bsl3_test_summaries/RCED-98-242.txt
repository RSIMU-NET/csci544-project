in fiscal year 1997 , the department of the interior's minerals management service ( mms ) collected about $4.1 billion in royalties from approximately 22,000 oil and gas leases on federal lands .
interested in the increased revenues that would result from the proposed regulations , as well as the oil industry's opposition to them , you asked us to address the following: ( 1 ) the information used by mms to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations ; ( 2 ) how mms has addressed concerns expressed by the oil industry and states in developing these regulations ; and ( 3 ) the feasibility of the federal government's taking its oil and gas royalties in kind , as indicated by existing studies and programs .
by law , the states in which these leases are located receive a share of the royalties collected , which are calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil or gas that is produced .
legislation mandating that mms accept federal oil and gas royalties in kind has been introduced in both the u.s. senate and the house of representatives .
to determine federal royalties , the proposed regulations define the price of oil not sold in arm's - length transactions differently in each of three domestic oil markets: ( 1 ) alaska and california ( including leases off the shore of california ) ; ( 2 ) the six rocky mountain states of colorado , montana , north dakota , south dakota , utah , and wyoming ; and ( 3 ) the rest of the country , including the gulf of mexico .
