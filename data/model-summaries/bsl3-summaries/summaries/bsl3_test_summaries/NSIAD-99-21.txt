our review focused on the operations of the canadian wheat board and the trade remedies applicable to the activities of state trading enterprises .
as you requested , we have reviewed issues involving canadian grain exports to the united states .
we reviewed the following: ( 1 ) cwb operations , government assistance to the cwb and the canadian farmer , and ongoing changes to the environment in which the cwb operates ; ( 2 ) the availability of data to ascertain cwb pricing practices , and efforts to increase the amount of data available ; and ( 3 ) the nature of trade remedies available to address the operations of stes , and the frequency with which these remedies have been applied to stes .
state trading enterprises ( ste ) have existed for some time and have been considered legitimate trading entities by the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) since 1947 .
to identify efforts to increase the amount of data available we evaluated whether the wto has made progress in increasing the amount of information available on the cwb and other stes as well as wto members' compliance with ste reporting requirements .
