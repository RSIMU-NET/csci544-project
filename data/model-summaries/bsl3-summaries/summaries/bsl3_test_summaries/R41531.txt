on april 20 , 2010 , the deepwater horizon oil drilling rig was reportedly nearing completion of a deepwater oil well ( owned by bp ) when an uncontained release of hydrocarbons ( oil and natural gas ) caused explosions and fire , resulting in 11 crew member fatalities .
some of these efforts may provide clues to the oil's fate .
multiple challenges hinder this objective: the complexity of the gulf system ; resources required to collect data ; and varied interpretations over the results and observations .
because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult , perceptions of the oil's fate may influence congressional interest and action , with consequences for the affected stakeholders .
the incident produced the largest oil spill that has occurred in u.s. waters , eclipsing the magnitude of the 1989 exxon valdez spill after four to five days .
for the purposes of this report , the term fate refers to the oil itself , not its actual or potential impacts on the gulf ecosystems or organisms .
the fate of the oil may be of interest to policymakers for other reasons , including oversight of oil spill response performance and assessment of the government's capability to monitor oil spills in the environment .
