i will focus my remarks today on dod's progress in ( 1 ) taking actions to strengthen the management of air force uas pilots , ( 2 ) addressing challenges the army faces to ensure that its uas pilots complete their required training and receive high - quality training , and ( 3 ) coordinating the training of uas pilots within dod .
thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss some of the unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) pilot personnel challenges that the department of defense ( dod ) faces .
the air force flies the mq - 1 ( predator ) , the mq - 9 ( reaper ) , and the rq - 4 ( global hawk ) while the army flies the rq - 7 ( shadow ) , the mq - 5 ( hunter ) and the mq - 1c ( gray eagle ) .
in recent years , the size , sophistication , and cost of dod's uas portfolio has grown considerably , as has the demand for trained uas pilots .
in april 2014 and may 2015 , we reported on these other issues and made ten recommendations to dod to improve the air force's management of uas pilots , address army uas pilot training challenges , and enhance dod coordination of uas pilot training .
