i am pleased to be here today to discuss two recently issued gao reports that assess the securities and exchange commission's ( sec ) response to trading abuses uncovered in the mutual fund industry .
as you know , trading abuses — including fraudulent market timing and late trading violations — were uncovered in many well - known companies in the mutual fund industry and raised significant concerns about the industry's ethical practices .
before september 2003 , sec did not examine fund companies for market timing abuses because agency officials ( 1 ) viewed other activities as representing higher risks , ( 2 ) concluded that companies had financial incentives to control frequent trading because it could lower fund returns , and ( 3 ) were told by company officials that the companies had established controls over frequent trading .
maintaining public confidence in the mutual fund industry is critical because about 95 million americans have invested more than $8 trillion in mutual funds , a significant share of the nation's privately held wealth .
more specifically , my testimony covers ( 1 ) the reasons that sec did not detect the market timing abuses at an earlier stage and lessons learned from the agency not doing so , ( 2 ) the steps sec has taken to strengthen its oversight of the mutual fund industry and strengthen industry business practices , and ( 3 ) enforcement actions taken by sec and criminal prosecutors in response to these abuses and sec management procedures related to the making of criminal referrals and ensuring staff independence from the mutual fund industry .
