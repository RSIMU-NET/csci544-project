i am here today to discuss our work on the nationwide problem of leaking underground storage tanks ( ust ) and the recommendations that we made to address this problem in our may 2001 report on the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) tank program .
because the states are primarily implementing the provisions of the program , we conducted a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia in the fall of 2000 to determine the extent to which tanks comply with program requirements , how epa and the states inspect tanks and enforce requirements , and whether upgraded tanks still leak .
to help states implement their programs , epa provides all states funding ( about $187,000 per state ) .
epa has authorized 32 states to implement the program with agency oversight and monitoring , while 16 states operate their own program under their own laws with limited epa oversight .
as you know , studies show that tanks leaking petroleum products and other hazardous substances contaminate the soil or water supplies and can pose health risks , such as nausea and kidney damage , as well as a costly cleanup burden .
