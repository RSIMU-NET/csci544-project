there has been increased concern over the size and sustainability of the united states' recent deficits and the country's long - run budget outlook .
this concern has brought the issues of the federal government's revenue needs and fundamental reform of the tax system to the forefront of congressional debates .
one place congress may turn to address these issues is the set of tax benefits for homeowners .
the goals of this report are five - fold: ( 1 ) briefly summarize the trends in homeownership ; ( 2 ) provide an overview of what tax benefits are available ; ( 3 ) analyze the rationales commonly provided for offering such benefits ; ( 4 ) analyze the effect of the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction on the homeownership rate , housing consumption , and the economy ; and ( 5 ) present policy options .
the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) has estimated that the cost to the federal government in terms of foregone revenue from these benefits will be approximately $136.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2017 .
economists have identified the set of tax benefits for homeowners as one area in which reform may improve economic efficiency .
