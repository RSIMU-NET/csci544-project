( see app . ii for data on contractor employees at the sandia and los alamos national laboratories. ) the number of clearances suspended was statistically disparate for one group , african - americans , in 3 of the 5 years: 1991 , 1992 , and 1993 . african - americans made up about 20 percent of the total number of employees holding clearances throughout this period . in calendar year 1991 , 40 percent ( 10 of 25 ) of those whose clearances were suspended were african - american . african - americans accounted for about 48 percent ( 27 of 56 ) of the clearances suspended in calendar year 1992 and about 36 percent ( 14 of 39 ) in calendar year 1993 . the disparities for african - americans in calendar years 1991 , 1992 , and 1993 were all significant , according to the fisher's exact test . the population of contractor employees at this site also includes asians , american indians , and hispanics . american indians and hispanics did not have their clearances suspended in this period . the number of asians whose clearances were suspended did not show a statistically significant disparity . ( see app . iii for data on the contractor employees at the savannah river site. ) the contractors we reviewed at doe's oak ridge facilities — martin marietta energy systems and m. k. ferguson of oak ridge company — employ about 21,000 people . over 10,000 of those employees have security clearances . doe suspended the security clearances of 164 of the contractor employees at its oak ridge facilities in fiscal years 1989 through 1993 — the largest number of suspensions at the locations we reviewed . for one group , african - americans , a statistically disparate number of clearances were suspended in 3 of the 5 fiscal years: 1989 , 1992 , and 1993 . about 17,000 of those employees have security clearances . doe suspended the security clearances of 163 contractor employees at the savannah river site during calendar years 1989 through 1993 . african - americans at oak ridge made up between 8 and 10 percent of the workforce holding clearances in the years we reviewed . although african - americans represented a small portion of the total population holding clearances , in fiscal year 1989 about 44 percent ( 14 of 32 ) of those whose clearances were suspended were african - american . major contributors to this report are listed in appendix v . to address the questions of the chairman , house committee on government operations , we had discussions on the suspension of security clearances with doe officials in the office of safeguards and security and office of civil rights at the department's headquarters and operations offices at albuquerque , savannah river , and oak ridge . we also obtained data on such suspensions from these officials . in addition , we discussed suspensions with contractors at the sandia and los alamos national laboratories , savannah river site , and oak ridge . our use of the fisher's exact test had a confidence level of 95 percent , which means that some of the results ( about 5 percent ) that were found to be statistically significant could be due to chance alone .
