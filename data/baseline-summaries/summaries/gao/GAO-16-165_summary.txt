mine location . all of the mine plans were located in 12 western states — alaska , arizona , california , colorado , idaho , montana , new mexico , nevada , oregon , utah , washington , and wyoming . nearly half were located in nevada or wyoming — with 11 and 21 mine plans , respectively . washington had the fewest — with 1 proposed mine ( see fig.3 ) . the average length of time it took blm and the forest service to complete the first three steps of the mine plan review process and approve 68 mine plans from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 was approximately 2 years . however , the time varied widely , ranging from about 1 month to over 11 years , among the 68 mine plans we reviewed . commodity types . most of the mine plans that blm and forest service received and approved were for gold , clay , and stone , according to agency data , and collectively these commodities accounted for 46 of the 68 total mine plans ( 68 percent ) approved from fiscal year years 2010 through 2014 ( see table 1 ) . mine size . the sizes of the mines proposed in these 68 plans varied greatly , ranging from 5 to 8,470 acres . the average proposed mine was approximately 529 acres , and the 68 mine plans totaled nearly 36,000 acres . figure 3 shows the total mine acreage by state . for example , 1 mine plan took less than 1 month for forest service officials in washington to review and approve . a forest service official told us this was , in part , because the mine was located in an area with existing mining operations , and the forest service determined that there was no need to conduct additional nepa analyses . in contrast , another mine plan in idaho took over 11 years for blm to review and approve , primarily because of disagreement with the operator over what needed to be included in the mine plan , according to blm officials . figure 4 shows the time frames for approving these 68 mine plans . of the 68 mine plans that blm and the forest service approved over this period , 13 ( 19 percent ) have not begun operations as of november 2015 , according to the agencies' data . for 4 of these 13 mines , the operator had not completed the fourth step of the mine plan review process — establishment of a reclamation bond , which entails furnishing bonds sufficient to fully cover estimated reclamation costs . according to blm officials , acquiring such bonds can be difficult for some operators , particularly operators with limited financial resources . for the remaining 9 of the 13 mine plans where operations had not begun as of november 2015 , the operator had completed all five steps of the mine plan review process . however , blm and forest service officials said that various factors may explain why these mines have not begun operating .
