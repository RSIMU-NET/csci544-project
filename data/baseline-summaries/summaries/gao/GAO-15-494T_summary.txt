pub . 112-144 , § 1001 , 126 stat . 993 , 1099-1100 ( 2012 ) ( codified at 21 u.s.c . authorize additional quota for that substance . fdasia requires that dea respond to these requests from manufacturers within 30 days . see gao , standards for internal control in the federal government , gao / aimd - 00-21.3.1 ( washington , d.c.: november 1999 ) and gao , executive guide: effectively implementing the government performance and results act , gao / ggd - 96-118 ( washington , d.c.: june 1996 ) . we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . it is important to note that completion of our work was significantly delayed by dea . in particular , dea refused to comply with our requests for information from and about yers / qms and arcos until intervention by senior doj officials . we first requested access to yers / qms materials and data in january 2013 , but did not obtain needed information until march 2014 . we recognize that dea has legitimate interests in protecting certain types of sensitive information from public disclosure . we share that interest as well and follow strict security guidelines in handling such information , which we provided in writing to dea . dea's prolonged resistance to sharing sensitive information with gao — an agency that has a broad statutory right of access to agency records — impeded our ability to conduct audit work efficiently and to provide timely information to congressional clients . we found significant weaknesses involving dea's management of the quota process for controlled substances . we found that dea had not responded to manufacturers' annual quota applications for bulk manufacturing and procurement quotas by its regulatory deadline of july 1 for any year from 2001 through 2014 . from our analysis of a random probability sample of yers / qms source documents , we estimate that dea took an average of 182 days in 2011 and 178 in 2012 beyond july 1 to establish annual bulk manufacturing and procurement quotas . similarly , dea has not proposed apqs on or before may 1 , as required by its regulations , for any year from 2001 through 2014 . we estimate that on average dea took nearly 60 days to respond to supplemental quota applications in 2011 and 2012 . while there are no required time frames for dea to respond to supplemental applications in the csa or dea's regulations , as of july 2012 , fdasia requires dea to respond to manufacturers' quota requests that relate to shortages caused by quotas within 30 days . although this 30-day time frame was not yet a requirement in 2011 and for much of 2012 , it is worth noting that dea responded to 21 percent of supplemental applications within 30 days during those years , suggesting this requirement could pose a challenge during a future shortage . dea officials attributed the agency's lack of compliance with its required time frames to inadequate staffing of the quota unit .
