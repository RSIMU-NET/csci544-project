this action was to be completed by september 2015 . however , as of august 2017 — 23 months after the due date — the department had not completed the coding assignment process . although , in august 2017 , opm provided a progress report to congress containing dhs data which stated that 95 percent of dhs - identified cybersecurity positions had been coded , our analysis determined that the department had assigned cybersecurity position codes to approximately 79 percent of its identified federal civilian cybersecurity positions . the primary reason for this discrepancy was that dhs did not include the coding of vacant positions , as required by the act . further , ochco officials stated they did not verify the accuracy of the components' cybersecurity workforce data . gao , information security: dhs needs to continue to advance initiatives to protect federal systems , gao - 17-518t ( washington , d.c.: mar . gao , high - risk series: progress on many high - risk areas , while substantial efforts needed on others , gao - 17-317 ( washington , d.c.: feb. 15 , 2017 ) . gao , cybersecurity: actions needed to strengthen u.s . capabilities , gao - 17-440t ( washington , d.c.: feb. 14 , 2017 ) . gao it workforce: key practices help ensure strong integrated program teams ; selected departments need to assess skill gaps , gao - 17-8 ( washington , d.c.: nov. 30 , 2016 ) . gao , federal chief information security officers: opportunities exist to improve roles and address challenges to authority , gao - 16-686 ( washington , d.c.: aug. 26 , 2016 ) . gao , federal hiring: opm needs to improve management and oversight of hiring authorities , gao - 16-521 ( washington , d.c.: aug. 2 , 2016 ) . gao , information security: dhs needs to enhance capabilities , improve planning , and support greater adoption of its national cybersecurity protection system , gao - 16-294 ( washington , d.c.: jan. 28 , 2016 ) . gao , federal workforce: opm and agencies need to strengthen efforts to identify and close mission - critical skills gaps , gao - 15-223 ( washington , d.c.: jan. 30 , 2015 ) . gao , cybersecurity human capital: initiatives need better planning and coordination , gao - 12-8 ( washington , d.c.: nov. 29 , 2011 ) . this is a work of the u.s. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states . the published product may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao . without coding cybersecurity positions in a complete and accurate manner , dhs will not be able to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce ; identify skill gaps ; and improve workforce planning . thus , in our recently issued report , we recommended that ochco collect complete and accurate data on all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions when it conducts its cybersecurity identification and coding efforts . dhs concurred with the recommendation and stated that , by june 29 , 2018 , it intends to issue memorandums to its components that provide instructions for the components to periodically review compliance and cybersecurity workforce data concerns to ensure data accuracy .
