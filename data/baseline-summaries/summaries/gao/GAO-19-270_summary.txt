some of these issues have resulted in litigation . the iris program has addressed many process challenges , such as by making changes to address the length of time it takes to develop chemical assessments and to increase transparency , but epa has not made progress toward producing chemical assessments . however , the release of documents related to iris assessments was delayed for nearly 6 months because epa leadership instructed the iris program not to release any assessment documentation pending the outcome of epa leadership deliberations concerning iris program priorities . the iris program in 2011 began making changes to address identified challenges , particularly the length of time the program took to produce assessments and the level of transparency in how the program prepared assessments . the program has made some progress since the beginning of 2017 toward producing assessments and is ready to release assessment - related documents . these changes were made in response to program implementation challenges identified by governmental , industry , academic , and non - governmental stakeholders in recent years . for example , in its 2011 report , nas identified timeliness and transparency as issues . in our review of the 2011 and 2014 nas reports and other documentation as well as our interviews with iris officials and leadership and officials in program and regional offices that use iris assessments , we identified the key actions the iris program has taken to address lack of timeliness in producing assessments and lack of transparency in how it produces assessments . developing iris assessments has historically been a lengthy process . because of the rigor of the iris process and the amount of literature that program staff must search and consider , producing an assessment typically takes several years , as we found in december 2011 . program and regional offices that use iris assessments understand this , and officials from several program and regional offices told us that despite the length of time it takes for the iris program to complete its assessments , they prefer these assessments as sources of information over other agencies' toxicity assessments . to address the length of time it takes to produce assessments , the iris program is ( 1 ) employing project management principles and specialized software that enable the program to better plan assessment schedules and utilize staff to make the systematic review process more efficient ; ( 2 ) focusing on better scoping assessments to create timely , fit - for - purpose products that address specific agency needs ; and ( 3 ) streamlining the peer review process as much as possible . the program has adopted project management principles and new software the first way in which the iris program is addressing the length of time it takes to produce assessments is by utilizing project management principles and new software that enable the program to better plan assessment schedules and utilize staff . iris officials said that by using these tools , iris staff are able to view project tasks , timelines , and milestones to manage their individual tasks and assessment work .
