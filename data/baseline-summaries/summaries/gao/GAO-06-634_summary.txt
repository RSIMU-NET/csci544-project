prototype . should be form , fit and function integrated with other key supporting elements / subsystems to demonstrate full functionality of subsystem . flight demonstration in representative operational environment such as flying test bed or demonstrator aircraft . technology is well substantiated with test data . technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions . in almost all cases , this trl represents the end of true system development . examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications . developmental test and evaluation in the actual system application . actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions , such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation . in almost all cases , this is the end of the last “bug fixing” aspects of true system development . examples include using the system under operational mission conditions . operational test and evaluation in operational mission conditions . in addition to the individual named above , jim morrison , assistant director ; greg campbell ; keith rhodes ; sylvia schatz ; erin schoening ; hai tran ; and ruthie williamson made key contributions to this report . nasa: implementing a knowledge - based acquisition framework could lead to better investment decisions and project outcomes . gao - 06-218 . washington , d.c.: december 21 , 2005 . nasa's space vision: business case for prometheus 1 needed to ensure requirements match available resources . gao - 05-242 . washington , d.c.: february 28 , 2005 . space acquisitions: stronger development practices and investment planning need to address continuing problems . gao - 05-891t . washington , d.c.: july 12 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: incentives and pressures that drive problems affecting satellite and related acquisitions . gao - 05-570r . washington , d.c.: june 23 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: space - based radar effort needs additional knowledge before starting development . gao - 04-759 . washington , d.c.: july 23 , 2004 . defense acquisitions: risks posed by dod's new space systems acquisition policy . gao - 04-379r . washington , d.c.: january 29 , 2004 . space acquisitions: committing prematurely to the transformational satellite program elevates risks for poor cost , schedule , and performance outcomes . gao - 04-71r . washington , d.c.: december 4 , 2003 . defense acquisitions: improvements needed in space systems acquisition policy to optimize growing investment in space . gao - 04-253t . washington , d.c.: november 18 , 2003 . defense acquisitions: despite restructuring , sbirs high program remains at risk of cost and schedule overruns . gao - 04-48 . washington , d.c.: october 31 , 2003 . defense acquisitions: improvements needed in space systems acquisition management policy . gao - 03-1073 . washington , d.c.: september 15 , 2003 . military space operations: common problems and their effects on satellite and related acquisitions . gao - 03-825r . washington , d.c.: june 2 , 2003 . military space operations: planning , funding , and acquisition challenges facing efforts to strengthen space control . gao - 02-738 . washington , d.c.: september 23 , 2002 .
