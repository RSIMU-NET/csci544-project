( see app . ii for examples of federal programs that can address tobacco prevention and reduction among youth. ) we identified two federal programs that focus only on tobacco use . the first , cdc's ntcp , focuses on preventing and reducing tobacco use among the general population , but it also explicitly targets tobacco use among youth . ntcp provides funds through cooperative agreements to all states . in fiscal year 2002 , ntcp provided about $58 million to states to address ntcp's four goals . hhs agencies also support activities that use various media , such as print , radio , television , and videotapes , to counteract the impact of tobacco product marketing . for example , cdc supports a variety of entertainment - related outreach activities that enlist celebrities as spokespersons to deliver antismoking messages and to increase prohealth messages in entertainment programming . ntcp's four goals are to ( 1 ) prevent youth from starting to smoke , ( 2 ) help youth and adults quit smoking , ( 3 ) minimize the public's exposure to secondhand smoke , and ( 4 ) identify and mitigate the factors that make some populations more likely to use tobacco than others . ntcp cooperative agreements specify the terms under which federal funds are provided to the states . under ntcp , cdc encourages states to use multiple types of interventions in their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use . cdc has developed guidance intended to assist states in designing , implementing , and evaluating their individual tobacco control programs . for instance , cdc recommends that states establish comprehensive tobacco control programs that include certain components , such as community - based programs to reduce tobacco use that include a wide range of prevention activities , such as engaging youth in developing and implementing tobacco control interventions , conducting educational programs for young people , parents , school personnel , and others , and restricting access to tobacco products ; school programs to implement school health policies that consist of tobacco - free policies , evidence - based curricula , teacher training , parental involvement , cessation services , and links between school and other community efforts and state media and educational campaigns ; marketing campaigns to counter protobacco influences and increase prohealth messages and influences , including paid television , radio , billboard , and print media campaigns ; cessation services to help people quit smoking ; enforcement of tobacco control policies by restricting minors' access to tobacco and restricting smoking in public places ; and statewide efforts to provide localities with technical assistance on how to evaluate tobacco programs , promote media advocacy , implement smoke - free policies , and reduce minors' access to tobacco . cdc officials told us that cdc also provides training and technical assistance to states in designing , implementing , and evaluating their tobacco control programs . for example , in fiscal year 2000 , cdc conducted three regional workshops for state health departments and education agencies aimed at helping such agencies develop coordinated plans to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco . according to cdc , representatives from 33 states participated in these workshops .
