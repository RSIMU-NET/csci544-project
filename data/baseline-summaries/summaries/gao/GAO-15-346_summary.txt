generalizable . while we have previously reported on inaccurate and incomplete utilization data in the database , we determined that the rpad data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of selecting installations to visit . using these factors , we selected the installation from each military service that had the greatest number of real property assets identified as being used by non - dod federal agencies , two installations that supported dod's arctic mission , and two installations that had a relatively small number of real property assets identified as being used by non - dod federal agencies . we also reviewed installation processes for identifying and managing unutilized and underutilized facilities . the installations we visited were selected from a universe of 100 installations located in the united states and its territories that dod considers large sites because the real property assets at these sites had plant replacement value of $1.794 billion or greater . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included a provision for gao to evaluate the potential for and obstacles to consolidation of federal tenants on installations that support arctic missions , focusing on federal entities with homeland security , defense , international trade , commerce , and other national security functions that are compatible with the missions of military installations , or can be used to protect national interests in the arctic region . to determine what options , if any , are available for dod to allow non - dod entities , including federal government agencies , to use unutilized and underutilized space on military installations and the factors dod considers , we reviewed applicable dod and military department guidance to identify ( 1 ) the circumstances under which non - dod tenants are allowed to utilize space on military installations including the order of priority among non - dod tenants , and ( 2 ) the types of agreements and understandings that installations are allowed to enter into with non - dod tenants . in addition , we interviewed responsible officials at osd , the military department headquarters , and seven selected installations to determine their roles in bringing a non - dod tenant onto a military installation and the factors that each considered . to identify the limitations and benefits of bringing non - dod federal agencies onto installations , we reviewed applicable dod and military department guidance , including regulations and instructions , to identify whether a process exists to promote the use of unutilized or underutilized space by non - dod federal agencies . we also interviewed osd , military department headquarters , and responsible installation officials to obtain their perspectives concerning the process by which non - dod entities are provided space on dod installations as well as the limitations and benefits that exist to allowing non - dod federal agencies to use space on military installations . to determine the extent to which dod and other federal agencies coordinate to better use unutilized and underutilized facilities on military installations , we reviewed general services administration ( gsa ) guidance on its process to seek and assign space to its clients and interviewed cognizant gsa officials concerning that process , to determine whether it includes coordination with landholding agencies such as dod .
