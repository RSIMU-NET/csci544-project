gao - 09-712 . washington , d.c.: august 12 , 2009 . the project is in the ninth year of its contract . the canada line light rail project in the vancouver area is a 35- year design - build - finance - operate - maintain concession agreement developed to link vancouver with its international airport and neighboring employment and population centers in anticipation of the 2010 winter olympics . a separate entity was created to oversee the project's development and the private partner provided one - third of the project's funding , including private equity capital , in exchange for periodic payments based on performance and ridership . fta's pilot program is expected to demonstrate potential benefits to using alternative approaches in transit . project sponsors we interviewed cited a range of potential benefits , such as achieving cost and time savings , as well as potential advantages to the public sector , such as increased financing flexibility ( see table 3 ) . dot outlined some of these same benefits and advantages in its 2007 report to congress on transit public - private partnerships and we similarly reported on them in 2008 for highway public - private partnerships . however , as we said then , benefits are not assured and should be evaluated by weighing them against potential costs and trade - offs . among the benefits from using alternative approaches , project sponsors told us that they may better meet cost and schedule targets as well as achieve cost and time savings by transferring risks to the private sector . with transit projects that use alternative approaches , project sponsors can transfer a range of key project risks to the private sector , such as those related to design and its effect on construction that would normally be borne by the project sponsor , so that the private sector is accountable for errors or nonperformance . by transferring these project risks , the project sponsor creates incentives for the private sector to keep the project on schedule and on budget as , for example , the private sector would be responsible for any excess costs incurred from design errors . in addition , when a project sponsor transfers multiple project risks to the private sector , it can potentially reduce the total cost and duration since a single contractor can concurrently perform project activities that would typically be carried out consecutively by multiple contractors under the conventional design - bid - build approach . project sponsors , stakeholders , and transit experts we interviewed told us that potential cost and time savings can be key incentives for using alternative approaches . for example , fta reported that minnesota metro transit's hiawatha corridor ( one of the seven completed new starts projects that used an alternative approach ) was completed 12 months ahead of schedule compared to using the conventional design - bid - build approach by allowing design and construction schedules to overlap . this saved an estimated $25 million to $38 million since early completion led to avoided administration costs using a design - build alternative approach . denver regional transportation district and the private sector completed the transportation expansion project 22 months ahead of schedule and within budget .
