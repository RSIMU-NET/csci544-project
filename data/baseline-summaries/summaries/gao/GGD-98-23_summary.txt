iv. ) dol provided no substantive comments ; however they did make one technical comment regarding the fact that nonqualified plans are not accorded preferential tax treatment . we clarified the report to reflect this comment . as agreed with the subcommittee , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the date of this report . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . these comments are discussed at the end of this letter . we did our review in washington , d.c. , from october 1996 to july 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . employers that sponsor dc plans generally establish certain minimum age and / or service requirements that employees must meet before they are allowed to participate in these plans . these eligibility requirements allow employers to reduce the administrative costs associated with establishing individual accounts for employees . flexibility to establish minimum participation requirements may be especially useful to employers facing high turnover rates . such requirements allow employers to use their resources to benefit employees who are more likely to remain with the employer for the long term . under erisa , as amended , employers cannot require employees to be over age 21 or to have completed more than 1 year of service with the employer . however , an exception applies to plans where participants immediately own all employer contributions made to individual accounts — employers may require that employees complete 2 years of service to be eligible to participate in these plans . of the 3,297 employers with 100 or more employees that sponsored only single - employer dc plans in 1993 , 51 percent ( 1,673 employers ) reported using some combination of age and length of service to determine when an employee was eligible to participate in the plan . the most common combination , which was used by 73 percent of these 1,673 employers , was that an employee must be age 21 with 1 year of service — the legal limit . for the 100 larger employers , 55 percent used only length of service to determine eligibility ( with most requiring 1 year of service ) , while 28 percent used a combination of age and service ( with 93 percent requiring an age of 21 and 1 year of service ) . figure 1 shows the distribution of employers according to the type of eligibility requirement used . although the summary plan documents did not provide information on the rate of participation among covered employees , we were able to determine the percentage of employees with active accounts in 1993 for 2,127 ( or 65 percent ) of the employers in our review using dol's research database .
