maintenance of effort . we have reported that there were numerous challenges for dot and states in implementing the transportation maintenance - of - effort provision in the recovery act . this provision required the governor of each state to certify that the state would maintain its planned level of transportation spending from february 17 , 2009 , through september 30 , 2010 , to help ensure that federal funds would be used in addition to , rather than in place of , state funds and thus increase overall spending . a january 2011 preliminary dot report indicated that 29 states met their planned levels of expenditure , and 21 states did not . states had a monetary incentive to meet their certified planned level of spending in each transportation program area funded by the recovery act because those that fail will not be eligible to participate in the august 2011 redistribution of obligation authority under the federal - aid highway program . states had until april 15 , 2011 , to verify their actual expenditures for transportation programs covered by the recovery act . dot is reviewing this information to determine if any more states met their planned levels of spending . the dot preliminary report summarized reasons states did not meet their certified planned spending levels , such as experiencing a reduction in dedicated revenues for transportation due to a decline in state revenues or a lower - than - expected level of approved transportation funding in the state budget . the preliminary report also identified a number of challenges dot encountered in implementing the provision , such as insufficient statutory definitions of what constitutes “state funding” or how well dot guidance on calculating planned expenditures would work in the many different contexts in which it would have to operate . as a result , many problems came to light only after dot had issued initial guidance and states had submitted their first certifications . dot issued seven pieces of guidance to clarify how states were to calculate their planned or actual expenditures for their maintenance - of - effort certifications . dot invested a significant amount of time and work to ensure consistency across states on how compliance with the maintenance - of - effort provision is certified and reported . as a result , dot is well - positioned to understand lessons learned — what worked , what did not , and what could be improved in the future . dot and state officials told us that while the maintenance - of - effort requirement can be useful for ensuring continued investment in transportation , more flexibility to allow for differences in states and programs , and to allow adjustments for unexpected changes to states' economic conditions , should be considered for future provisions . for example , the recovery act allows the secretary of education to waive state maintenance - of - effort requirements under certain circumstances and allows states to choose the basis they use to measure maintenance of effort . the maintenance - of - effort requirement for transportation programs proved difficult for states to apply across various transportation programs because of different and complicated revenue sources to fund the programs .
