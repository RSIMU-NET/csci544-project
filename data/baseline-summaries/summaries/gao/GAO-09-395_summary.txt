at your request , we reviewed the vpp . although the industries represented in the vpp did not change significantly from 2003 to 2008 , there were substantial increases in certain industries . the largest industry in the vpp was the chemical industry , which accounted for a 43 percent increase in the number of vpp sites , from 208 in 2003 to almost 300 in 2008 . the motor freight transportation industry , which had only 20 sites in 2003 , grew tenfold to just over 200 sites in 2008 , due in part to the growth in the number of postal service sites . in addition , the number of sites in the electric , gas , and sanitary services industries increased from about 50 sites to more than 200 during the same period . see figure 3 for a comparison of the largest industries represented in the vpp in 2003 and 2008 . while 4 federal worksites — including the tobyhanna army depot in tobyhanna , pennsylvania , and the national aeronautics and space administration langley research center in hampton , virginia — have participated in the vpp since the late 1990s , the number of federal worksites increased to almost 10 percent of all vpp sites in 2008 . at the end of 2008 , almost 200 vpp sites were federal agencies or postal service sites . the majority of these sites — 157 — were post offices , processing and distribution centers , and other postal facilities , while most of the remaining sites were department of defense facilities , such as naval shipyards , army depots , and air force facilities . in addition , from 2005 to 2008 , 7 osha area offices in 1 region were approved as new vpp sites as a result of osha's efforts to have all of its offices participate in the program so that they could be role models for the federal agencies . the average size — based on the number of employees — of vpp sites has become increasingly smaller in the last 5 years . from 2003 to 2008 , the average number of employees at vpp sites decreased from 501 to 408 . in addition , the median size of a vpp site decreased from 210 to 145 employees . as shown in figure 4 , the proportion of vpp sites with fewer than 100 workers increased from 28 percent in 2003 to 39 percent in 2008 . across all vpp sites , the number of employees covered by the vpp has grown to over 885,000 workers . a key factor influencing growth of the vpp has been osha's emphasis on expansion of the program . for example , in 2003 , the secretary of labor for osha announced plans to expand eligibility for the vpp to reach a larger number of worksites . these plans included adding more federal sites , such as department of defense facilities and certain types of construction sites . osha's national office has given each of its 10 regions targets for the number of new sites to be approved each year .
