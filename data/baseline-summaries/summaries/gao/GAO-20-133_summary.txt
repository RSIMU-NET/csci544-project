close out the directive . dhs is to close a directive after it has validated that all of the requirements listed in the directive have been completed by all federal executive branch departments and agencies ; the directive is no longer necessary because it has been revoked , suspended , or codified into law ; or the directive needs to be amended . fisma requires dhs to consult with nist , consider nist's standards and guidelines , and ensure that the directives it plans to implement do not conflict with nist's established standards and guidelines . consistent with this requirement , dhs's draft process calls for cisa to coordinate with stakeholders , such as nist and gsa , early in the directive identification process to incorporate their input as a necessary part of executing the directive process . cisa has not coordinated with key stakeholders early in the development process . according to nist officials in the information technology laboratory / computer security division , which is responsible for working on directive issues , cisa coordinates with them to ensure that a new directive does not conflict with nist guidance , but does not do so early in the process . specifically , the nist officials stated that often dhs did not reach out to nist on the most recent directives until 1 to 2 weeks before they were to be issued , and then did not incorporate the nist technical comments that were provided . as a result of the lack of timeliness in dhs's outreach to nist , the directives may not include all key technical considerations . in addition , cisa also has not coordinated with gsa on the directives early in the development process . for example , officials in gsa's office of the chief information officer told us that cisa did not coordinate with them on vendor issues before the directive on email and web security was issued . cisa officials acknowledged that , in the past , the agency mainly relied on an ad hoc approach to coordination and did not always coordinate early in the planning process with stakeholders , including nist and gsa , even though early coordination is called for in the current dhs process . cisa officials also explained that , in certain circumstances , they may need to accelerate the development process when a directive needs to be issued quickly due to elevated risk , such as the directive on addressing threats to network devices in response to a specific hacking threat . cisa officials told us that they have begun to have a more formalized coordination process with key stakeholders , including nist and gsa . nist officials also noted that dhs and nist have started regular coordination meetings to discuss directive - related issues earlier in the process . nevertheless , cisa has yet to determine when in the directives' development — for example , during early development and at directive approval — coordination with specific entities should occur . until cisa addresses this , a lack of effective coordination with stakeholders in the early stages of directives' development process and later in implementation is likely .
