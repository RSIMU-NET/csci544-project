gao - 08-956 . washington , d.c.: august 28 , 2008 . this contribution may be large . irs has long recognized that if payments made to businesses are not reported on 1099-miscs , it is less likely that they will be reported on payee tax returns . based on irs's most recent tax gap estimates , we reported that for tax year 2001 sole proprietors ( individual owners of unincorporated businesses ) understated their taxes by an estimated $68 billion because of underreporting their net income . an unknown proportion of this income could have been reported to irs on 1099-miscs but was not . other limited evidence also shows payer noncompliance with 1099-misc reporting requirements . in 2003 , we reported that some federal agencies failed to submit required 1099-miscs covering billions of dollars of payments . a 2007 report by the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) suggests that some state and local governments may also not be submitting required 1099-miscs . because of your concern about the tax gap , you asked us to study 1099- misc reporting and whether irs can make more use of 1099-misc information that it already receives . wages paid to employees must be reported on a form w - 2 . there are many other types of payments that must be reported and numerous exceptions to these general rules . irs provides eight pages of instructions detailing what payments to whom are reportable on the 1099-misc . the form — shown in figure 1 — consists of 14 boxes for reporting the various types of miscellaneous payments . the bush administration's fiscal years 2008 and 2009 budgets proposed legislative action further expanding 1099-misc reporting to include service payments of $600 or more to corporations by all third - party payers . according to the department of the treasury's estimate , the bush administration's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal would generate about $8.2 billion over the 10-year budget period from 2009 through 2018 , in part because of increased voluntary compliance and irs's ability to detect underreported payments received by businesses . for tax year 2006 , more than 5 million payers submitted more than 82 million 1099-miscs to irs , reporting over $6 trillion in payments . nonemployee compensation payments totaled about $2.3 trillion and accounted for about 55 percent of all 1099-miscs submitted . medical and health payments totaled about $1.2 trillion and accounted for about 25 percent of all 1099-miscs submitted . each of the remaining payment types accounted for less than 10 percent of the number of 1099-miscs submitted . figure 2 shows the distribution of 1099-misc payments types and amounts reported for tax year 2006 . in addition to the 8 pages of instructions for 1099-misc reporting , irs also has 19 pages of general instructions for third - party information reporting , detailing how and when payers are to submit 1099-miscs to payees and irs . payers must provide 1099-misc statements to payees by the end of january . payers submitting fewer than 250 1099-miscs may submit paper forms , which are due to irs by the end of february , along with a form 1096 , annual summary and transmittal of u.s. information returns .
