pub . chiefs of staff , and organizations within the office of the secretary of defense including the office of cost assessment and program evaluation , the director of operational test and evaluation , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for systems engineering , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for developmental test and evaluation , and the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics . to assess the extent to which the navy has the knowledge about resources it needs to develop the uclass system , we applied best practice standards developed by gao for using key product knowledge to support program investment decisions , and identified and reviewed relevant legislation such as the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 . we reviewed department of defense ( dod ) acquisition policy including dod instruction 5000.02 and recent better buying power memorandums . we analyzed requirements documents including the initial capabilities document , the draft capability development document , and relevant joint requirements oversight council ( jroc ) memorandums . we analyzed carrier availability schedules to identify potential testing schedule challenges . we also visited the four contractors who were awarded air system preliminary design review contracts — the boeing company , general atomics aeronautical systems inc. , lockheed martin corporation , and northrop grumman systems corporation — to discuss their work related to the program . we conducted this performance audit from june 2014 to may 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . in 2011 the navy received approval from dod to begin planning for a uclass acquisition program to address a capability gap in sea - based surveillance and to enhance the navy's ability to operate in highly contested environments defended by measures such as integrated air defenses or anti - ship missiles . the navy analyzed the potential of several alternative systems to provide these capabilities . in 2012 the jroc — the requirements validation authority for major defense acquisition programs — issued a memorandum providing direction and guidance for the navy to focus its efforts on delivering a timely , affordable system to meet the sea - based surveillance requirements . at that time the systems that would be needed to operate in a highly contested environment were deemed unaffordable . as a result , the navy updated its analysis of alternatives to include more affordable and feasible systems . navy leadership approved a draft set of requirements in april 2013 that emphasized affordability , timely fielding , and endurance , while deemphasizing the need to operate in highly contested environments . dod policy provides that the jroc , as the validation authority for major defense acquisition programs , will validate the requirements document — known as the capability development document — prior to releasing requests for proposals for development contracts and the decision review that initiates a system development program , known as a milestone b review . the jroc has not yet validated these requirements .
