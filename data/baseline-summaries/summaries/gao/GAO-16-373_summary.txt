staggered work shifts . va implemented staggered shifts for responders at the vcl primary center on september 6 , 2015 . staggered shifts are work schedules that allow employees to start and stop their shifts at different times as a way to ensure better coverage during peak calling periods . specifically , it helps schedule more employees to work when call volume is highest and fewer employees to work when call volume is lowest . additionally , staggered shifts help limit disruptions in service as responders begin and end their shifts . by comparing vcl telephone call data from september through december of 2014 to that of september through december of 2015 , we found that va's implementation of staggered shifts at the vcl primary center had mixed results . overall: the average percentage of calls answered per hour at the vcl primary center from september through december 2015 — after staggered shifts were implemented — was 75 percent , slightly less than the average of 79 percent answered during the corresponding period in 2014 before staggered shifts were implemented . however , the vcl received an average of about 1.3 more calls per hour during this period in 2015 than it received during the corresponding period in 2014 and , according to va officials , the vcl primary center employed fewer responder staff in 2015 than 2014 . by day of the week: the average percentage of calls answered per hour at the vcl primary center increased on mondays to 89 percent and tuesdays to 83 percent after va implemented staggered shifts , up from 78 percent and 79 percent , respectively , during the corresponding period in 2014 . these increases suggest that staggered shifts may have helped va answer more calls at the vcl primary center on these days because vcl call data from our analysis indicate that these days of the week typically experienced the highest number of calls prior to implementing staggered shifts , and va officials told us that they used the implementation of staggered shifts to schedule more responders on these days . however , the average percentage of calls answered per hour at the vcl primary center decreased on saturdays to 61 percent and sundays to 70 percent after va implemented staggered shifts , down from 78 percent and 80 percent , respectively , during the corresponding period in 2014 . by hours of the day: va answered a higher percentage of calls at the vcl primary center during the mid - day and evening hours after the implementation of staggered shifts . specifically , from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and from 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. the vcl primary center answered a higher percentage of calls compared with the corresponding periods in 2014 . however , va answered a lower percentage of calls at the vcl primary center during overnight hours — midnight to 9:00 a.m. — and in the early evening — 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. — compared to corresponding periods in 2014 .
