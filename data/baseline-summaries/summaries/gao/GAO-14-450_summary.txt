gao - 12-751r . washington , d.c.: may 31 , 2012 . coast guard: legacy vessels' declining conditions reinforce need for more realistic operational targets . gao - 12-741 . washington , d.c.: july 31 , 2012 . initial cost estimates are being developed for this project . as acquisition program costs increase across the portfolio , consuming significant amounts of funding , the coast guard is farther from fielding its planned fleet today than it was in 2009 , in terms of the money needed to finish these programs . in 2009 , we found that the coast guard needed $18.2 billion to field its original baseline , but it now needs $20.7 billion to finish fielding these same assets . for example , the estimated funding needed to complete the national security cutter increased by $2.2 billion since original estimates . given these cost increases and funding constraints , the coast guard and key stakeholders have acknowledged that the coast guard's acquisition portfolio is not affordable but , thus far , efforts to address this issue have not led to the significant trade - off decisions needed to improve its affordability . to balance its portfolio , coast guard budget officials stated that they use the 5-year capital investment plan . however , this plan presents data in a manner that makes the portfolio appear more affordable than it really is . this strategy would be acceptable as long as the coast guard incorporates the key performance parameters specifically related to the c4isr system into the vessel and aircraft test plans . in its response , dhs disagreed in general with our description of the c4isr system as not meeting goals , noting that , according to the coast guard , the original system was closed as a result of obsolescence and not due to performance and maintenance problems . while it is true that much of the original system — developed as part of deepwater — is obsolete because it was inextricably linked to the commercial vendor's proprietary software , performance problems were also an issue . we have previously reported on these problems , such as assets not having the capability to share data as envisioned and the system needing to be restarted during operations . in short , the system of systems capability that was the original intent has not been achieved . while dhs states that the c4isr program is one example of where the coast guard made tough decisions to provide the greatest capability of equipment while using the least amount of dollars , the coast guard invested $413 million to develop and field the original system that is now being replaced with seawatch . while dhs concurred with our fourth recommendation to develop a 20- year fleet modernization plan , the response does not fully address our concerns or set forth an estimated date for completion , as the response did for the other recommendations . dhs stated that the coast guard values long term planning and can assemble a profile of the anticipated service lives of the various assets and project this information to the future .
