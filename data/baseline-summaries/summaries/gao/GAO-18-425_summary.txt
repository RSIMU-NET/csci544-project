participation costs . the cost to students of participating in athletics was also mentioned by some athletics administrators as discouraging participation in public high school teams . the subject matter specialists and athletics administrators we interviewed had mixed views on the effect of costs on student participation . among the subject matter specialists , two said that the increasing prevalence of fees in high school sports programs is threatening participation by lower - income students . one athletics administrator agreed , saying that in the past he has dissuaded his school district from charging participation fees for this reason . another said that his school does not charge fees , but students could still be discouraged by the fundraising required for “extras” such as team t - shirts . in contrast , one subject matter specialist said that it is typically higher - income schools that charge students fees to participate in sports , and therefore fees do not generally affect students in lower - income schools . in addition to the four most commonly cited barriers from our survey , several research studies noted that cultural expectations around family responsibilities and gender roles may also discourage some student groups more than others . for example , one study found that hispanic girls quit sports to take care of younger siblings at higher rates than their white peers . competing responsibilities . over one - quarter of athletics administrators cited students' competing responsibilities as discouraging participation in public high school sports . this could include a range of responsibilities , including schoolwork , other school activities , and family obligations . among the athletic administrators we interviewed , one noted that many students at his magnet school were more focused on academics than athletics . a few cited examples of competing responsibilities that were tied to family resources . for example , two said that many of their students have jobs and family responsibilities that prevent them from participating in sports . one of these administrators said that his school's student population largely comes from lower - income families , and many are juggling jobs ; in response , the school changed practice schedules to better match students' availability , which has made it easier for more students to participate . lack of access to athletic feeder programs . some athletics administrators also mentioned a lack of access to athletic feeder programs — club or community - based youth sports programs that train younger children before they enter high school — as discouraging participation in sports at their public high schools . in addition , a few of the eight athletics administrators we interviewed saw this lack of access as being closely related to community or family resources . two of these administrators , who worked in lower - income schools , reported that younger children in their area have very little access to community or club sports and that students who do not have previous exposure to sports may lack the skills to participate at the high school level . one of these administrators also said that having more community youth sports might increase student interest in playing at the high school level . a third athletics administrator said that feeder programs help drive participation in high school sports .
