usps has large feca program costs . at the time of their injury , 43 percent of feca beneficiaries in 2010 were employed by usps . feca provides benefits to federal workers who sustained injuries or illnesses while performing federal duties , and benefits are not taxed or subject to age restrictions . various proposals to modify feca's benefit levels have been advanced . at the request of congress , we have provided information to assist it in making decisions about the feca program . in summary , to improve its financial situation , usps needs to reduce its expenses to close the gap between revenue and expenses , repay its outstanding debt , continue funding its retirement obligations , and increase capital for investment , such as replacing its aging vehicle fleet . in addition , as noted in prior reports , congressional action is needed to ( 1 ) modify usps's retiree health benefit payments in a fiscally responsible manner ; ( 2 ) facilitate usps's ability to align costs with revenues based on changing workload and mail use ; and ( 3 ) require that any binding arbitration resulting from collective bargaining takes usps's financial condition into account . as we have continued to underscore , congress and usps need to reach agreement on a comprehensive package of actions to improve usps's financial viability . in previous reports , we have provided strategies and options , to both reduce costs and enhance revenues , that congress could consider to better align usps costs with revenues and address constraints and legal restrictions that limit usps's ability to reduce costs and improve efficiency ; we have also reported on implications for addressing usps's benefit liabilities . if congress does not act soon , usps could be forced to take more drastic actions that could have disruptive , negative effects on its employees , customers , and the availability of reliable and affordable postal services . we appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the status of the u.s . postal service's ( usps ) financial condition and actions needed to address usps's financial challenges . we added usps's financial condition to our high risk list in 2009 , and usps continues to face a serious financial crisis as its mail volume declines . usps has not generated sufficient revenue to cover its expenses and financial obligations . while usps must continue its efforts to align costs with revenues , congressional action is needed to facilitate necessary changes and help the postal service begin to transition to financial sustainability . this testimony discusses ( 1 ) usps's financial condition , ( 2 ) its initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenues , and ( 3 ) actions needed to improve its financial situation . this testimony is based primarily on our past and ongoing work examining various aspects of usps's operations and our analysis of its recent financial results , an analysis that we performed from january 2013 to february 2013 . our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
