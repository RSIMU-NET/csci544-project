prototype . should be form , fit , and function integrated with other key supporting elements / subsystems to demonstrate full functionality of subsystem . flight demonstration in representative operational environment such as flying test bed or demonstrator aircraft . technology is well substantiated with test data . technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions . in almost all cases , this trl represents the end of true system development . examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications . actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions , such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation . in almost all cases , this is the end of the last “bug fixing” aspects of true system development . examples include using the system under operational mission conditions . defense acquisitions: business case and business arrangements key for future combat system's success , gao - 06-478t . washington , d.c.: march 1 , 2006 . dod acquisition outcomes: a case for change , gao - 06-257t . washington , d.c.: november 15 , 2005 . force structure: actions needed to improve estimates and oversight of costs for transforming army to a modular force , gao - 05-926 . washington , d.c.: september 29 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: resolving development risks in the army's networked communications capabilities is key to fielding future force , gao - 05-669 . washington , d.c.: june 15 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: future combat systems challenges and prospects for success , gao - 05-428t . washington , d.c.: march 16 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: future combat systems challenges and prospects for success , gao - 05-442t . washington , d.c.: march 16 , 2005 . nasa's space vision: business case for prometheus 1 needed to ensure requirements match available resources , gao - 05-242 . washington , d.c.: february 28 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: the army's future combat systems' features , risks , and alternatives , gao - 04-635t . washington , d.c.: april 1 , 2004 . defense acquisitions: assessments of major weapon programs , gao - 04-248 . washington , d.c.: march 31 , 2004 . issues facing the army's future combat systems program , gao - 03-1010r . washington , d.c.: august 13 , 2003 . defense acquisitions: army transformation faces weapon systems challenges , gao - 01-311 . washington , d.c.: may 2001 . best practices: better matching of needs and resources will lead to better weapon system outcomes , gao - 01-288 . washington , d.c.: march 8 , 2001 . this is a work of the u.s. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states . it may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao . however , because this work may contain copyrighted images or other material , permission from the copyright holder may be necessary if you wish to reproduce this material separately . should be approaching appropriate scale . may include integration of several components with reasonably realistic support elements / subsystems to demonstrate functionality . lab demonstrating functionality but not form and fit .
