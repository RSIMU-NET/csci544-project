( recommendation 6 ) . we provided a draft of this report to dhs and the american red cross ( red cross ) for review and comment . this change acknowledges that grantees cannot compel partners to participate , but they can , at a minimum , invite such partners to participate in the process . we continue to believe that grantees should be required to make an effort to include mass care providers in developing their mass care capability assessments , as this is vital for developing high quality assessments . fema has emphasized the importance of having an active relationship and ongoing communication with key partners before disasters strike . in its strategic plan , fema states that pre - disaster coordination and communication among partners is critical to improve response and recovery outcomes . thus , we do not believe it would be an undue burden to reach out to such partners as part of the capability assessment process . with regard to the remaining recommendations , dhs and fema described steps they have taken or plan to take to address the issues raised . while dhs concurred with recommendation 1 to direct fema to periodically review the esf - 6 leadership roles and responsibilities , the department considers this issue to be resolved because fema routinely conducts after - action reports and recently established a working group focused on performance metrics and corrective actions . we agree that these actions are important parts of effectively overseeing and evaluating esf activities and results . this enabled food to reach neighborhoods in need . insufficient supplies: according to puerto rico department of education officials , fema was initially reluctant to provide water to schools serving as shelters because the schools were supposed to have their own water supply from the puerto rico department of education's warehouses . in concurring with recommendation 3 , dhs and fema detailed several approaches they use to connect with local resources , including collaborating with voad groups at national , state , and local levels , and indicated that they consider this recommendation already implemented . however , puerto rico department of education officials said they only had enough water for shelter residents for 30 days . the reporting process at the time of the 2017 hurricanes did not require grantees to report specific estimates of their current capabilities for providing mass care , which resulted in an incomplete picture of capabilities . with regard to mass care capabilities , fema did not ask grantees to report the number of people they could shelter , or how long they could maintain sheltering operations . for example , one state affected by the 2017 hurricanes identified gaps in the state's capability to provide cots , blankets , laundry facilities , kitchens , and shelter facilities , but did not quantify the shortfall in its assessment submitted in december 2016 . in addition , it was optional for grantees to describe deficiencies in their mass care capabilities at the time of the 2017 hurricanes , according to fema officials . one grantee affected by the 2017 hurricanes had indicated in its assessment from december 2016 that there were gaps in several mass care capabilities , such as shelter equipment and training for family reunification .
