during 1996 , this baseline was reviewed by the ipt . through september 1996 , the ipt was estimating that the baseline could increase to $1.18 billion . at that time , the ipt ( 1 ) estimated higher expected costs for software development ; ( 2 ) estimated higher expected implementation , technical support , and maintenance costs because of the addition of necessary equipment ; and ( 3 ) included costs for communications because the baseline estimate overlooked them . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . some original software development will still be required . in august 1996 , the contractor projected that 124,000 new lines of software code will need development to meet faa's requirements . this estimate was revised in december 1996 to 140,000 new lines of code . stars is an outgrowth of the troubled advanced automation system acquisition . as originally designed , the terminal segment of this system , known as the terminal advanced automation system , would provide controllers in tracons with new workstations and supporting computer systems . however , in june 1994 , the faa administrator ordered a major restructuring of the acquisition to solve long - standing schedule and cost problems . these schedule delays were up to 8 years behind the original schedule , and estimated costs had increased to $7.6 billion from the original $2.5 billion estimated in 1983 . specifically , regarding terminal modernization , the administrator canceled the terminal advanced automation system and expanded the stars project to include all terminal facilities . in april 1996 , faa established a new acquisition management system , as directed by the congress . included in this system is the concept of life - cycle management , which is intended to be a more comprehensive , disciplined full - cost approach to managing the acquisition cycle , from analysis of mission needs and alternative investments through system development , implementation , operation , and , ultimately , disposal . under this new system , decisions related to resource allocation ( mission and investment ) are made by faa's joint resources council , which is composed of associate administrators for operations and acquisition and other key executives . decisions associated with program planning and implementation are made within integrated product teams ( ipt ) . ipts are responsible for bringing together all essential elements of program implementation , including scheduling , allocation of funding , and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders . to ensure successful program implementation , the acquisition management system dictates that these issues be resolved before contracts are awarded . ipts also generate schedule and cost baselines , which the joint resources council authorizes the teams to operate under .
