we will report separately on these assignments . before 1991 , the military services maintained separate finance and accounting operations that were duplicative and inefficient . dfas was created to standardize dod finance and accounting policies , procedures , and systems . as of september 1996 , dod estimates show that there were about 40,800 people performing finance and accounting activities — about 5,200 less than estimated in 1994 . however , there is some uncertainty about these numbers primarily because the military services do not centrally budget for or manage finance and accounting operations . as a dbof entity that is now part of the new defense - wide working capital fund , dfas tracks the number of personnel it employs so that it can accurately charge its customers for the full cost of operations . therefore , it generally knows how many people it inherited from the military services and its current on - board strength . dfas officials told us , for example , that by 1994 dfas had assumed control of 28,000 personnel — about 10,000 at the 5 large finance centers and about 18,000 at the 332 small , installation - level finance and accounting offices . as of september 1996 , this workforce had been reduced to 23,500 and dfas has plans to eliminate another 3,500 positions by the year 2000 . according to dod , most of these reductions are ( or will be ) made possible by economies of scale achieved by closing the 332 small finance and accounting offices and consolidating activities at the 5 centers and 21 operating locations . finance and accounting personnel and activities in the military services , however , are budgeted for and controlled at the installation level . consequently , service representatives said there were no specific plans to centrally assess or reduce the size of their finance and accounting network . for this reason , they were also uncertain of the number of people that remained after dfas assumed control of resources in 1994 or that are currently onboard . according to dod , however , there should have been about 18,000 finance and accounting personnel left with the military services in 1994 . in 1992 , dfas and the military services issued a data call to all installation - level finance offices , and in 1994 , estimated that the total number of people in dod's network was about 46,000 . on the basis of this estimate , dfas assumed control of 28,000 people , leaving about 18,000 people in the military services . to determine the number of people in the current military service network , the services ( at our request ) either issued another data call to their installations or prepared an estimate based on other available information . they reported to us that , as of september 30 , 1996 , approximately 17,300 people were performing finance and accounting activities in the military services . on the basis of a comparison of the original data call and the current estimate , about 700 fewer people are performing finance and accounting activities now than dod officials believe were doing so when dfas completed its transfer process in 1994 .
