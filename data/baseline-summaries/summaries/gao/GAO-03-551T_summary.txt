ici attributes this increase to two factors . first , funds with higher expense ratios , such as aggressive growth funds or international stock funds , have been popular lately and increased sales of these funds would increase the overall average . second , the decline in assets experienced by many stock funds as a result of the market decline since 2000 also means that such funds have fewer assets over which to spread their fixed operating costs and thus their expense ratio would rise as a percentage of their assets . recent press reports have also indicated that fees for mutual funds may be increasing . for example , a march 2003 press report presented data from lipper , inc. , a mutual fund research service , that shows that the median expense ratio for stock funds increased from 1.30 percent in 1998 to 1.46 percent in 2002 . although our june 2000 report found that fees for large stock and bond funds had generally declined between 1990 and 1998 , analysis of recent years shows that the average expense ratios for large stock funds have risen since 1998 while fees for bond funds have continued to decline . for our june 2000 report , we analyzed the change in expense ratios from 1990 to 1998 for 77 large stock and bond mutual funds , which because of their growth during this period — which collectively averaged over 600 percent — were likely to have experienced economies of scale in their operations that would allow them to reduce their expense ratios . to calculate the average expense ratios on the large mutual funds identified in our previous report , we weighted each fund's expense ratio by its total assets . the resulting asset - weighted average expense ratios represent the fees an average investor would expect to pay on every $100 dollars invested in these funds during this period . since our 2000 report one of the bond funds was liquidated , so our analysis for this statement presents comparable results for 76 funds . as shown in figure 1 , since 1990 , the average expense ratio charged by the large stock funds we analyzed , after generally rising during the mid - 1990s , declined the second half of the 1990s and then began rising again . the asset - weighted average expense ratio for these stock funds declined from 0.74 percent in 1990 to 0.70 percent in 2001 . however , the average expense ratio of these funds has increased recently by about 8 percent , from 0.65 percent in 1998 to 0.70 percent in 2001 . the average expense ratios for the large bond funds also generally declined between 1990 and 2001 , from 0.62 percent to 0.54 percent . however , unlike the stock funds , the bond funds have continued to decline since 1998 . various factors may explain the recent rise in stock fund expense ratios . ici and industry participants attribute recent increases in average expense ratios industrywide to asset declines among stock funds . for example , ici reported that total assets held by stock funds have declined from over $4 trillion in 1999 to about $3.4 trillion at the end of 2001 .
