prototype . should be form , fit , and function integrated with other key supporting elements / subsystems to demonstrate full functionality of subsystem . flight demonstration in representative operational environment such as flying test bed or demonstrator aircraft . technology is well substantiated with test data . technology has been proved to work in its final form and under expected conditions . in almost all cases , this trl represents the end of true system development . examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications . actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions , such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation . in almost all cases , this is the end of the last “bug fixing” aspects of true system development . examples include using the system under operational mission conditions . 10 quality of service algorithms 15 multi - spectral sensors and seekers air ( rotary wing / uav ) — to — ground air ( fixed wing ) — to — ground ( interim / robust solutions ) ground — to — ground ( mounted ) ground — to — air ( mounted ) . cumulative research , development , testing , and evaluation funding ( in millions of dollars ) . defense acquisitions: analysis of processes used to evaluate active protection systems . gao - 07-759 . washington , d.c.: june 8 , 2007 . defense acquisitions: role of lead systems integrator on future combat systems program poses oversight challenges . gao - 07-380 . washington , d.c.: june 6 , 2007 . defense acquisitions: assessments of selected weapon programs . gao - 07-406sp . washington , d.c.: march 30 , 2007 . defense acquisitions: future combat system risks underscore the importance of oversight . gao - 07-672t . washington , d.c.: march 27 , 2007 . defense acquisitions: key decisions to be made on future combat system . gao - 07-376 . washington , d.c.: march 15 , 2007 . defense acquisitions: improved business case key for future combat system's success . gao - 06-564t . washington , d.c.: april 4 , 2006 . defense acquisitions: improved business case is needed for future combat system's successful outcome . gao - 06-367 . washington , d.c.: march 14 , 2006 . defense acquisitions: business case and business arrangements key for future combat system's success . gao - 06-478t . washington , d.c.: march 1 , 2006 . defense acquisitions: future combat systems challenges and prospects for success . gao - 05-428t . washington , d.c.: march 16 , 2005 . defense acquisitions: the army's future combat systems' features , risks , and alternatives . gao - 04-635t . washington , d.c.: april 1 , 2004 . issues facing the army's future combat systems program . gao - 03-1010r . washington , d.c.: august 13 , 2003 . defense acquisitions: army transformation faces weapon systems challenges . gao - 01-311 . washington , d.c.: may 21 , 2001 . best practices: better matching of needs and resources will lead to better weapon system outcomes . gao - 01-288 . washington , d.c.: march 8 , 2001 .
