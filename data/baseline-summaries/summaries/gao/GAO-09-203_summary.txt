a basic element of cryptography is encryption . encryption can be used to provide basic data confidentiality and integrity by transforming plaintext into ciphertext using a special value known as a key and a mathematical process known as an algorithm . the national security agency recommends encrypting network services . if encryption is not used , user id and password combinations are susceptible to electronic eavesdropping by devices on the network when they are transmitted . although sec has implemented a network topology that employs extensive switching and limits eavesdropping to only the network segment accessible by the potential eavesdropper , it did not always ensure that information transmitted over the network was adequately encrypted . while the eavesdropping risk on the sec network is reduced by its topology , nonetheless , increased risk exists that individuals could capture user ids and passwords and use them to gain unauthorized access to network devices . to establish individual accountability , monitor compliance with security policies , and investigate security violations , it is crucial to determine what , when , and by whom specific actions have been taken on a system . organizations accomplish this by implementing system or security software that provides an audit trail for determining the source of a transaction or attempted transaction and monitoring users' activities . to be effective , organizations should ( 1 ) configure the software to collect and maintain a sufficient audit trail for security - relevant events ; ( 2 ) generate reports that selectively identify unauthorized , unusual , and sensitive access activity ; and ( 3 ) regularly monitor and take action on these reports . sec also requires the enforcement of auditing and accountability by configuring information systems to produce , store , and retain audit records of system , application , network , and user activity . sec did not adequately configure several database systems to enable auditing and monitoring of security - relevant events . for example , it did not configure one database to record successful log - ons or security violations for unauthorized modification of data , and three databases to safeguard log data against loss . as a result , there is increased likelihood that unauthorized activities or policy violations would not be detected . physical security controls are important for protecting computer facilities and resources from espionage , sabotage , damage , and theft . these controls involve restricting physical access to computer resources , usually by limiting access to the buildings and rooms in which the resources are housed , and periodically reviewing access rights granted to ensure that access continues to be appropriate based on criteria established for granting it . at sec , physical access control measures ( such as guards , badges , and locks , used either alone or in combination ) are vital to protecting its computing resources and the sensitive data it processes from external and internal threats . although sec has strengthened its physical security controls , certain weaknesses reduced its effectiveness in protecting and controlling physical access to sensitive work areas . for example , on multiple occasions sec employees entered electronically secured interior spaces by following another employee through an open door instead of using their badges to obtain access .
