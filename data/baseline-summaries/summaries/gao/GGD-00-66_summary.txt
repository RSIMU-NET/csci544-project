ii ) . on february 9 , 2000 , we received written comments from the department of veterans affairs' assistant secretary for planning and analysis . he agreed that the va could improve its managing of acquisition workforce training requirements . he also concurred with our recommendations and outlined the steps under way and planned for va to conform with statutory and policy requirements ( see app . the comments are addressed at the end of this letter . for fiscal year 1998 , the federal procurement data center reported that federal agencies had contract obligations of about $200 billion . acquisition refers to the process of obtaining goods , services , and space for use by the government . the acquisition process begins with a determination of a need for goods or services and includes deciding on solicitation and selection of sources ; award of contracts ; and contract administration , completion , and closeout . personnel in many different occupations perform these acquisition tasks , including those who are in the acquisition profession and those who are in other professions but who become involved in the acquisition process by performing such activities as determining requirements or monitoring contractor performance . although opm has data on the total number of federal employees in the gs - 1102 and gs - 1105 series , it does not have data on the numbers of acquisition personnel , such as contracting officers or contracting officer technical representatives who are in other job series . therefore , because agencies have acquisition personnel in job series other than the gs - 1102 and gs - 1105 series , it is not possible to determine the total number of acquisition personnel governmentwide at this time . gsa and va , however , have estimated the number of contracting officer representatives , contracting officer technical representatives , and other acquisition personnel they employ . most recent opm data show that as of march 1999 , there were a total of about 31,400 acquisition personnel in the gs - 1102 and gs - 1105 job series , of whom about 20,900 were in the department of defense and about 10,500 were in civilian agencies . according to gsa , as of december 1999 , it had 3,146 acquisition personnel , including 1,319 in the gs - 1102 and gs - 1105 job series , 1,383 contracting officers who were not in the gs - 1102 or gs - 1105 job series , and 444 contracting officer representatives or contracting officer technical representatives , who were not contracting officers . in addition , gsa also reported that 253 of the 1,383 contracting officers were contracting officer representatives or contracting officer technical representatives .
