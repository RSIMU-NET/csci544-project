ii . in july 1998 , we reported on our analysis of inventories of unresolved eeo complaints at federal agencies and eeoc and how trends in the number of complaints filed and the time taken to process them had contributed to inventory levels . we found that agencies' complaint inventories , and even more so , eeoc's hearings and appeals inventories , had increased since fiscal year 1991 ; as the size of inventories grew , so did the average length of time that cases had been in inventory as well as the proportion of cases remaining in inventory longer than allowed by regulations ; the size of the inventories and the age of cases in them increased as agencies and eeoc did not keep up with the influx of new cases ; with the increased caseloads , eeoc and , to some extent , agencies , took longer on average to process complaints , contributing to the size and age of inventories ; and the implications of these trends were that inventories of cases pending would grow even larger in the future , particularly at eeoc , and that cases would take even longer to process . in updating our analysis , we used preliminary data for fiscal year 1998 provided by eeoc and reviewed the agency's budget request for fiscal year 2000 and its annual performance plans for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 . we also examined eeoc's planned changes to the complaint process . in addition , because postal workers have accounted for about half of the complaints filed in recent years , we separately analyzed data reported by the u.s . postal service in order to compare statistics for the postal workforce with the nonpostal workforce ( see app . iii ) . appendix i contains details about our scope and methodology . we requested comments on a draft of this report from the chairwoman , eeoc , and the postmaster general . their comments are discussed near the end of this letter . we performed our work from march through may 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . since we last reported in july 1998 , agencies' complaint inventories and , even more so , eeoc's hearings and appeals inventories were , once again , higher . table 1 shows the trends in the inventories of complaints at agencies and of hearing requests and appeals at eeoc for fiscal years 1991 to 1998 . at agencies , the inventory of unresolved complaints had risen from 16,964 at the end of fiscal year 1991 to 34,286 by the end of fiscal year 1997 . one year later , agencies' inventories of unresolved complaints had increased by an additional 6 percent , to 36,333 . inventory levels increased at the postal service and nonpostal agencies in fiscal year 1998 , but growth was more rapid in the nonpostal agencies . compared with fiscal year 1997 , the postal service inventory increased by 3.3 percent , from 13,549 to 13,996 ( see app . iii , table iii.1 ) , while the inventories at nonpostal agencies rose by 7.7 percent , from 20,737 to 22,337 . overall , from fiscal year 1991 to fiscal year 1998 , complaint inventories at federal agencies rose by about 114 percent .
