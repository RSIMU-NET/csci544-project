this measure is applicable to cutters . unplanned maintenance days are the number of days that a vessel is not mission capable due to unforeseen maintenance issues and associated repair efforts . this measure is applicable to cutters . maintenance hours are the total number of hours that a vessel spent in maintenance , including both planned and unplanned maintenance . this measure is applicable to boats . achieved material availability rate is calculated based on a vessel's availability and performance . for cutters , the target availability rate range is between 53 percent and 65 percent . for boats , the target availability rate target is 80 percent . according to our analysis of coast guard data , the number of maintenance days for aton cutters generally decreased during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 , as shown in figure 8 . in addition , our analysis shows that the biggest decrease was with planned maintenance days . the coast guard has established a target range for the achieved material availability rate for aton cutters that includes a minimum rate of 53 percent to a maximum rate of 65 percent . according to our analyses of coast guard data , the achieved material availability rate for the aton cutters varied by cutter class during fiscal years 2016 through 2018 , with 10 of the 12 cutter classes having met or exceeded the minimum target material availability rate for all 3 years and the remaining 2 aton cutter classes having met or exceeded the minimum target material availability rate for 2 of the 3 years analyzed . while most of the aton cutters met coast guard availability rate targets during fiscal years 2016 through 2018 , officials in 7 of the 9 districts noted that maintaining some older aton cutters can take longer to repair because of old and obsolete equipment and the lack of available parts , which decreases their availability to conduct missions . figure 9 shows the achieved material availability rate for aton cutters for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 . according to our analysis of coast guard data , we found that the total number of maintenance hours for aton boats generally decreased during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 , although there was an increase from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 . figure 10 shows the total maintenance hours for aton boats during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 . in comparison to aton cutters , which have a target range for the achieved material availability rate , aton boats have a material availability threshold of 80 percent . according to our analyses of coast guard data , 4 of the 7 classes of aton boats consistently achieved the 80 percent availability threshold during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 . in particular , we found that the four smaller classes of aton boats — those 16 to 26 feet in length — consistently achieved the 80 percent availability threshold during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 , whereas the three larger classes of aton boats — those 49-feet in length and longer — failed to consistently meet the 80 percent availability threshold during this 5-year period .
