medigap policies can be expensive . the average annual medigap premium was more than $1,300 in 1999 . premiums varied widely based on the level of coverage purchased . plan a , which provides the fewest benefits , was the least expensive with average premiums paid of nearly $900 per year . ( see table 1. ) the most comprehensive plans — i and j — were the most expensive , with average premiums around $1,700 . ( see table 3. ) premiums also vary widely across geographic areas and insurers . for example , average annual premiums in massachusetts ( $1,915 ) were 45 percent higher than the national average . while varying average premiums may reflect geographic differences in terms of use of medicare and supplemental services and costs , beneficiaries in the same state may face widely varying premiums for a given plan type offered by different insurers . for example , in nevada , plan a premiums for a 65-year - old ranged from $446 to as much as $1,004 , depending on the insurer . similarly , in florida , plan f premiums for a 65-year - old male ranged from $1,548 to $2,123 ; and in maine , plan j premiums ranged from $2,697 to $3,612 . medicare eligible beneficiaries may elect to purchase supplementary medical insurance ( smi ) , known as part b , which helps pay for selected physician , outpatient hospital , laboratory , and other services . beneficiaries must pay a premium for part b coverage , currently $50 per month . beneficiaries are also responsible for part b deductibles , coinsurance , and copayments . most medicare beneficiaries have some type of supplemental coverage to help pay for medicare cost - sharing requirements as well as some benefits not covered by medicare . they obtain this coverage either through employers , medicare+choice plans , state medicaid programs , or medigap policies sold by private insurers . about one - third of medicare's 39 million beneficiaries have employer - sponsored supplemental coverage . these benefits typically pay for some or all of the costs not covered by medicare , such as coinsurance , deductibles , and prescription drugs . however , many beneficiaries do not have access to employer - sponsored coverage . a recent survey found that more than 70 percent of large employers with at least 500 employees did not offer these health benefits to medicare - eligible retirees . small employers are even less likely to offer retiree health benefits . approximately 15 percent of medicare beneficiaries enroll in medicare+choice plans , which include health maintenance organizations and other private insurers who are paid a set amount each month to provide all medicare - covered services . these plans typically offer lower cost - sharing requirements and additional benefits compared to medicare's traditional fee - for - service program , in exchange for a restricted choice of providers . the medigap prescription drug benefit has a $250 deductible , requires 50 percent coinsurance , and is limited to $1,250 or $3,000 depending on the plan purchased .
