these initiatives have had mixed results . for example , mcsap funding for activities related to nafta has resulted in a greater inspection presence at the border ; however , the inspector training initiative was less successful . in this regard , dot officials believe that one of the keys to ensuring that trucks from mexico are safe is to have mexico improve its truck inspection program so that more trucks are inspected there before traveling into the united states . however , u.s. efforts to fortify mexico's inspection program encountered problems . beginning in 1991 , dot provided about $278,000 to train mexican truck inspectors . from 1993 to 1995 , about 285 mexican inspectors received the necessary 2-week certification course . however , the lead u.s. trainer characterized these efforts as unsuccessful , since , as of late 1996 , only about 50 of these inspectors were still employed by the mexican truck inspection agency , and no regular truck inspection activity ever took place in mexico as a result of this training . dot is now prepared to provide additional funding ( about $96,000 left from the first training effort and more , if needed ) for further truck inspector training in mexico . to overcome one of the flaws of the first effort , which trained civilians who had limited authority to stop trucks along the roadside and issue citations , future training will be for mexico's federal highway patrol officers , who will have the requisite authority ( although truck inspections will not be their sole duty similar to state truck inspectors in the united states ) . according to dot officials , mexico's federal highway patrol is the most stable enforcement agency in mexico and therefore should not be affected by any economic or political changes in mexico . dot , again working with cvsa , had targeted the fall of 1996 to begin the new training . this target was not met and dot now expects the new training to begin in early 1997 . dot officials are negotiating with mexican officials to be sure that mexico provides assurances that the newly trained inspectors will be used to conduct inspections along the border . because of the delays in the federal effort and in order to develop working relationships with their mexican counterparts , both arizona and texas state officials have begun negotiating with mexico's federal highway patrol officials in adjacent mexican border states to begin their own training efforts in those states . dot officials told us that the intent of the training is that mexican inspectors will inspect northbound trucks , that is , those trucks entering the united states , and that the first vehicles to be inspected will be those of carriers that have applied for the authority to operate in the four u.s. border states . they added , however , that trucks belonging to these carriers will be inspected regardless of the trucks' destinations â€” either to the united states or within mexico . even if mexico establishes a truck inspection program , dot's expectation of having mexican officials inspect northbound trucks before they arrive in the united states may not be fully realized .
