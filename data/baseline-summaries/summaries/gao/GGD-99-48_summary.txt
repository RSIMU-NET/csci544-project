( see app . i for detailed explanations of screening and classification. ) once returns are classified and selected for audit , any identified audit issue is to be documented in the audit workpaper file . the irs staff who do the classification have varying degrees of training and audit experience . and third , we interviewed examination officials at the national office , as well as the directors , compliance chiefs , examination chiefs , and selected examination officials in 4 of irs' 10 service centers: andover , ma ; fresno , ca ; kansas city , mo ; and memphis , tn . ( see app . iv for a comparison of workloads at the service centers. ) we requested comments on a draft of our report . irs provided comments in a meeting on february 23 , 1999 , and a letter dated march 12 , 1999 . we have incorporated these comments as appropriate . revenue agents are the highest graded auditors and are required to have at least 24 hours of college - level accounting courses to audit the most complex tax returns from corporations , other businesses , and higher income individuals . tax auditors , who usually have some accounting education , audit less complex issues by meeting with taxpayers at the district offices . service centers use tax examiners to audit the simpler individual issues . tax examiners , who are not required to have any accounting education , audit simple issues through correspondence and are not trained to audit complex issues on business and investment schedules attached to tax returns . according to irs , tax returns assigned to the service centers are to involve only one or two simple tax issues , such as eic claims , that can be audited through correspondence . correspondence audits are to exclude complicated tax issues , such as those on business and investment schedules , and are designed to quickly review a taxpayer's support for the tax issues . the time needed to audit returns and establish the appropriate tax liability depends , in large part , on the number of letters irs sends to taxpayers and the sufficiency of the taxpayers' responses . irs typically sends two letters â€” one asking for information or documentation and at least one reporting any changes to the tax liability reported on the tax return as a result of the audit . ( see fig . irs service centers send an initial letter to notify taxpayers of the issues on the return to be audited and to request information on those issues within 30 days . if the taxpayer provides the information requested , a tax examiner is to determine whether it supports the audit issues . if it does provide the support , the tax return can be accepted as filed and the audit closed with no change in the reported tax liability . if the information does not support the issues , the tax examiner can request further clarification or documentation . after reviewing all the submitted information , the tax examiner determines whether additional taxes are warranted . should the taxpayer not provide information to support the audit issues , the tax examiner is to treat the issues as unsubstantiated and recommend additional taxes .
