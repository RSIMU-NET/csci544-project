this document is due in september 2016 . in may 2016 , we reported that coast guard headquarters does not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets , by mission . rather , headquarters' allocations of assets in the annual strategic planning directions that we reviewed for fiscal years 2010 through 2016 were based on assets' maximum performance capacities . for example , the strategic planning directions allocated each hercules fixed - wing aircraft 800 hours per year , each jayhawk helicopter 700 hours per year , and each 210-foot or 270-foot medium endurance cutter 3,330 hours per year , irrespective of the condition , age , or availability of these assets . as a result , we found that , as shown in figure 3 , the asset resource hours allocated in the strategic planning directions have consistently exceeded the asset resource hours actually used by coast guard field units during fiscal years 2010 through 2015 . for example , in fiscal year 2015 , the strategic planning direction allocated a total of 1,075,015 resource hours for field unit assets whereas the actual asset resource hours used was 804,048 hours , or about 75 percent of the allocated hours for that year . coast guard field unit officials we spoke with , and coast guard planning documents we reviewed for our may 2016 report , indicated that the coast guard is not able to achieve the resource hour allocation capacities set by the headquarters' strategic planning directions for several reasons , including the declining condition of legacy assets and unscheduled maintenance . further , we also reported that our review of coast guard planning documents and discussions with field unit officials showed that operational planning directions developed by field unit commands can differ from headquarters' strategic planning directions . for example , officials from one district told us on the basis of their analyses , they determined that their district could realistically use only about two - thirds of the performance capacity hours allocated by the strategic planning direction for boats for one mission . in response to our findings , we recommended that the coast guard more systematically incorporate field unit input to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions — in addition to asset maximum capacities currently used — in the annual strategic planning directions to more effectively communicate strategic intent to field units . the coast guard concurred with our recommendation and stated that it was taking actions to better incorporate field unit input for fiscal year 2017 . if implemented as planned , this would meet the intent of this recommendation . in may 2016 , we also reported that the coast guard does not maintain documentation on the extent to which risk factors have affected the allocation of asset resource hours to missions through its strategic planning directions . for example , coast guard officials told us that the coast guard conducts a national maritime security risk assessment every 2 years to inform its asset allocations ; however , the coast guard does not document how these risk assessments have affected asset allocation decisions across its missions .
