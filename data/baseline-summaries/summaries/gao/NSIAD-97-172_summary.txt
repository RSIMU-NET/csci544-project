all of these aircraft are being procured by the air force . in fiscal year 2000 , the navy is scheduled to begin procuring jpats aircraft . our analysis shows that dod can make better use of the price advantages that are included in the jpats contract . for example , as shown in table 3 , 30 aircraft can be procured more economically if 16 , rather than 18 , aircraft are procured in fiscal year 1998 and 14 , rather than 12 , aircraft are procured in fiscal year 1999 . if as few as 16 aircraft were procured in fiscal year 1998 , they could be acquired at the same unit price as currently planned because the unit price would not increase until fewer than 16 jpats aircraft were procured in fiscal year 1998 . deferring 2 aircraft from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999 would increase the quantity in fiscal year 1999 from 12 to 14 , resulting in a reduction of the unit price for fiscal year 1999 , from $2.905 million to $2.785 million . this deferral would not only save $1.360 million over the 2 years but also reduce the risk of buying aircraft before the completion of operational testing by delaying the purchase of two aircraft and permitting more testing to be completed . dod could also save money if it altered its plans to procure 26 aircraft in fiscal year 2000 , which is a quantity lower than the target of 32 aircraft . the unit price could be reduced by $104,212 , or 4 percent , if dod procured the target quantity . in addition , once the jpats aircraft successfully completes operational test and evaluation , the aircraft could be procured at the more economical , or target , rates . our analysis demonstrates that maintaining yearly production rates at least within the target range is more economical than production rates in the minimum range . as we previously reported , economical procurement of tested systems has often been hindered because dod did not provide them with high enough priority . the jpats cockpit is expected to meet dod's requirement that it accommodate at least 80 percent of the eligible female pilot population . production is scheduled to continue through 2014 . in 1996 , the air force and the navy calculated the number of jpats aircraft required using several factors , including projections of jpats mission capable rates and projected attrition rates based on historical experience . however , the data they used in their calculations contained various inconsistencies . for example , the projections of jpats aircraft mission capable rates of 91 percent and 80 percent used by the air force and the navy , respectively , to calculate the requirements differed substantially from each other and from the 94-percent rate included in the contract for procurement of the aircraft . the result of using lower mission capable rates to calculate aircraft quantities is that more aircraft would be needed to achieve annual flying hour requirements for training than if higher rates were used .
