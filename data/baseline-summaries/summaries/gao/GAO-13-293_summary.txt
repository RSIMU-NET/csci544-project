this changed the composition of the commands markedly . in fiscal year 2004 , military positions made up about three - quarters of total authorized positions supporting the combatant commands that we reviewed ; however , due to the substantial increase in the number of authorized civilian positions the proportion of military positions at the combatant commands is now just over half . according to dod officials , the increase in authorized civilian positions is due in part to dod - directed efforts to convert positions filled by military personnel or contractors to civilians . as part of the secretary of defense's 2010 efficiency initiative , baselines were established for the number of authorized civilian positions at the combatant commands for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 . we obtained documentation on the systems used to track their authorized manpower and assigned military and civilian personnel , and contractor full - time equivalents , and also interviewed officials on how often assigned personnel within the combatant commands , subordinate unified commands , and other activities are reviewed to ensure that the data are accurate and up to date . in addition , we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from the joint staff , geographic combatant commands , and service component commands on their processes for sharing information on command authorized manpower and assigned personnel . we also obtained and analyzed data included in the military departments' budget exhibits for operation and maintenance detailing combatant commands' authorized positions and mission and headquarters - support funding .
