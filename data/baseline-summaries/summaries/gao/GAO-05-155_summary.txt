invention begins . once basic principles are observed , practical applications can be invented . active research and development is initiated . this includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology . examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative . basic technological components are integrated to establish that the pieces will work together . this is relatively “low fidelity” compared to the eventual system . examples include integration of “ad hoc” hardware in a laboratory . fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly . the basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the technology can be tested in a simulated environment . examples include “high fidelity” laboratory integration of components . representative model or prototype system , which is well beyond the breadboard tested for trl 5 , is tested in a relevant environment . represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness . examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment . prototype near or at planned operational system . represents a major step up from trl 6 , requiring the demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment , such as in an aircraft , vehicle , or space . technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions . in almost all cases , this trl represents the end of true system development . examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications . actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions , such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation . examples include using the system under operational mission conditions . this report details our findings . in conducting our work , we reviewed dod and military department policy documents on s&t activities , as well as pertinent s&t reports and related material , to determine dod's progress in achieving program mission objectives . we assessed the dod space s&t strategy for compliance with the 2004 defense authorization act . we developed additional criteria with which to assess the space s&t strategy and identified barriers that may influence dod's ability to successfully implement s&t efforts for space . in doing so , we consulted with subject matter experts and reviewed our previous best practice reports . we reviewed documents from and conducted interviews with officials in dod , the army , the navy , the air force , the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) , the missile defense agency ( mda ) , nasa , and military department research laboratories . we also analyzed the fiscal year 2004 virtual major force program for space and unclassified dod budget documents to identify the amount of space research , development , test and evaluation ( rdt&e ) funding for fiscal years 2003 to 2009 and confirmed with dod officials responsible for maintaining this information that our analysis was correct . our review was conducted from november 2003 to november 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
