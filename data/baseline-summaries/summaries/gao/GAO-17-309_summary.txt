viii ) . due in part to this budget activity structure , the science and technology community typically sees its role as maturing technologies to no higher than technology readiness level 6 . as a result , until dod and the military services' recent prototyping initiatives , there were not many offices focused on further maturing technologies outside of acquisition programs . risk averse culture: although it is appropriate to minimize risks in acquisition programs , some officials stated that excessive risk aversion outside of acquisition programs can stifle innovation . according to the defense science board , over time , dod has become increasingly risk averse and experimentation has moved towards scripted demonstrations , testing , and training . pressure to justify budgets , demonstrate utility to the warfighter , and advance careers all contribute to this risk aversion . many prototyping and innovation initiatives we reviewed emphasized high transition rates of between 80 and 100 percent . generally speaking , transition means that a technology has been sufficiently matured and is ready to transition to a user such as a weapon acquisition program or the warfighter in the field . on one hand , a high transition rate can be an indicator that an initiative is generating a good return on investment and is developing capabilities that meet customers' needs . but , for prototyping initiatives with the stated purpose of encouraging innovation , particularly disruptive innovation , making high transition rates a goal could be counterproductive and lead to a lower tolerance for risk or failure . for private sector projects focused on innovation , companies can aim for transition rates as low as 20 to 50 percent . competing priorities: officials identified competition with projects the military services have previously funded and prioritized as a barrier to innovation efforts â€” both when requesting funding to prototype and later when trying to transition . innovation literature suggests that companies frequently face this same problem . resources are often not available for bolder projects because funds are consumed by pre - existing projects ; furthermore , companies are more likely to devote resources to sustaining innovation , which gradually improves on existing products , rather than riskier disruptive innovation . the secretary of defense testified to congress in september 2016 that he has seen the constant temptation over the years to starve new and future - oriented defense investments in favor of more established and therefore well - entrenched programs . he expressed concern that funding was being taken away from initiatives such as the strategic capabilities office , to instead pay for existing acquisitions . in fiscal year 2016 , 6.4-funded initiatives that focus on prototyping and innovation represented less than 4 percent of budget activity 6.4 funds . long budget timelines: long budget timelines make it difficult to start prototyping projects that address emerging threats in a timely manner . for example , as is illustrated in figure 8 , a project conceived in february 2017 might not be authorized and appropriated funding until october 2018 . projects that are expected to take 3 to 5 years to complete in effect require 5 to7 years from conception to completion . if there is a continuing resolution , it could take longer .
