open . as a result of passage of the digital accountability and transparency act ( data act ) in may 2014 , omb is working with the department of the treasury ( treasury ) and other members of the government accountability and transparency board to develop a long - term strategy to implement key transparency reforms including government - wide data standards . we will continue to monitor the progress of their efforts to implement key provisions of the act . open . omb and treasury are working to implement the data act , which includes several provisions that could address our recommendations once fully implemented . data submissions to the usaspending.gov website , the director of omb , in collaboration with treasury's fiscal service , should clarify guidance on ( 1 ) agency responsibilities for reporting awards funded by non - annual appropriations ; ( 2 ) the applicability of usaspending.gov reporting requirements to non - classified awards associated with intelligence operations ; ( 3 ) the requirement that award titles describe the award's purpose ( consistent with our prior recommendation ) ; and ( 4 ) agency maintenance of authoritative records adequate to verify the accuracy of required data reported for use by usaspending.gov . open . as part of their data act implementation efforts , omb and treasury have outlined a process for agencies to identify authoritative systems to validate agency spending information . in addition , the inspector general community is working on standard audit methodologies to verify the accuracy and completeness of agency reporting . for example , in our 2010 report we found that the description for one contract we reviewed read “4506135384 ! dummy loa,” while the award records indicated that the award was for the purchase of metal pipes . another was described as “cont renewals all types,” while the award records showed the contract was for an apartment building . this lack of basic clarity would make the data element difficult for others outside the agency to understand and would also limit the ability to meaningfully aggregate or compare this data across the federal government . we made recommendations to omb in 2010 and 2014 and to treasury in 2014 to improve the accuracy and completeness of award description , which have yet to be addressed . at that time , treasury officials neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations , while omb staff generally agreed with them stating that they were consistent with actions required under the data act . these omb staff said while they would consider interim steps to improve data quality , they did not want to inhibit agency efforts to work toward implementation of the act . appendix ii provides more information on the status of these recommendations . in subsequent discussions , omb staff stated that they are hesitant to make substantial changes to the reporting of award description , which focuses on the purpose of a federal award , before additional progress is made on the related and more complex issue of how to ascribe spending data to a specific government program .
