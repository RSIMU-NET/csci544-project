ii . reports concerning public - private competitions for the depot maintenance workloads at the closing san antonio and sacramento air logistics centers ( section 359 ) the act added section 2469a to title 10 the united states code to provide for special procedures for public - private competitions concerning the workloads of these two closing depots . it also required us to issue four reports . first , within 60 days of its enactment , the 1998 defense authorization act required us to review the c - 5 aircraft workload competition and subsequent award and report to congress on whether ( 1 ) the procedures used provided an equal opportunity for offerors to compete without regard to performance location , ( 2 ) the procedures complied with applicable law and the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , and ( 3 ) the award resulted in the lowest total cost to dod . second , the act required the secretary of defense to submit a determination to congress if any of the workloads were bundled in a single solicitation . we were required to report our views on the dod determination within 30 days . third , the act required us to review all dod solicitations for the workloads at the san antonio and sacramento alcs and report to congress within 45 days of the solicitations' issuance whether the solicitations provided “substantially equal” opportunity to compete without regard to performance location and otherwise complied with applicable laws and regulations . fourth , the act required us to review all dod awards for the workloads at the two closing alcs and report to congress within 45 days of the contract award whether ( 1 ) the procedures used complied with applicable laws and regulations and provided a “substantially equal” opportunity to compete without regard to performance location , ( 2 ) “appropriate consideration was given to factors other than cost” in the selection , and ( 3 ) the selection resulted in the lowest total cost to dod for performance of the workloads . this report addresses the fourth requirement for the award of the sacramento aircraft and commodity workloads . the 1995 base realignment and closure ( brac ) commission recommended closing the sacramento and san antonio air logistics centers ( alc ) and transferring their workloads to the remaining depots or to private sector commercial activities . in making these recommendations , the commission considered the effects of the closures on the local communities , on workload transfer costs , and the potential effects on readiness and concluded that the savings and benefits outweighed the drawbacks . the commission's report noted that given the significant amount of excess depot capacity and limited dod resources , closure was a necessity and would increase the use of the remaining centers and substantially reduce dod operating costs . the specific commission recommendations were as follows: realign kelly air force base , including the alc ; disestablish the defense distribution depot ; consolidate the workloads to other dod depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the defense depot maintenance council ; and move the required equipment and personnel to the receiving locations .
