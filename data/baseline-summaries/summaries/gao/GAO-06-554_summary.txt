survey . the questionnaire asked about each state's current and planned toll road facilities . we sent the questionnaire to the directors of state dots in 49 states and washington , d.c. we did not send a questionnaire to the louisiana dot because we administered our survey only a few weeks after hurricane katrina struck new orleans and the gulf coast . to minimize nonsampling error , such as measurement errors that can be introduced when respondents do not understand questions or when they do not have information to answer a particular question , we undertook several quality assurance steps . our social science survey specialists designed draft questionnaires and conducted pretests with state dot officials in four states . during these pretests , we assessed the extent to which respondents interpreted questions and response categories consistently , the time respondents needed to complete the survey , and the extent to which respondents had the information needed to answer the survey questions . no question 6: do any of these facilities charge tolls that vary by time of day ? yes 2 . no question 7: in what year did the first toll road facility in your state open to traffic ? ( please do not consider facilities that opened before 1938. ) question 8: in what year did the most recent toll road facility in your state open to traffic ?
