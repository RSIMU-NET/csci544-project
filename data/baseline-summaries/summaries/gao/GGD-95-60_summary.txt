teid agreed . although the committee noted that the soviet union had passed a new immigration law that would make the jackson - vanik requirement less of a problem in the future , the committee concluded that there was no basis for changing its previous recommendation not to extend further credit guarantees to the soviet union . the committee's recommendation notwithstanding , on june 11 , 1991 , the president announced his decision to extend another $1.5 billion in loan guarantees to the soviet union . iii ) . we summarize and evaluate most of usda's comments in chapter 6 , and some comments are addressed directly in other chapters of this report . we did our work between april 1992 and december 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . the fsu has been a major purchaser of u.s. bulk agricultural exports since 1972 ; until 1991 , it usually made such purchases with cash . however , owing to its increasing financial difficulties ( see ch . 3 ) , in the latter part of 1990 the soviets sought export credits to finance their imports of commodities and food products . the united states responded positively . between december 1990 and september 30 , 1993 , the united states offered to provide up to $5.97 billion in gsm - 102 export credit guarantees to the fsu and those successor states that qualified for the program . as of september 30 , 1993 , $5.02 billion had been provided , $0.949 billion was no longer available to the fsu , and $3.85 billion was still owed to the united states on fsu credit - guaranteed purchases . as a result of these sizable guarantees , the gsm - 102 program has become heavily exposed to default by russia , which has undertaken the responsibility as guarantor of the debt of the fsu . guaranteed sales to the fsu and / or its successor states accounted for 38 percent of all gsm sales in fiscal year 1991 and 43 percent in fiscal year 1992 ( including russia and ukraine ) . the fsu and its successor states now hold the largest portion of all outstanding gsm - 102 / 103 loan guarantees . in late november 1992 , russia began missing payments due on gsm - 102 debt for the fsu . by the end of september 1993 , russian defaults on fsu and russian debt totaled nearly $1.1 billion . at that time , the united states agreed to reschedule $1.1 billion of gsm - 102 debt . in january 1994 , russia again fell into default on gsm - 102 loans . by early june 1994 , the united states had agreed to reschedule another $882 million . as discussed in our 1993 report , the fsu was the world's largest producer of wheat and one of the world's largest producers of grains overall . it was also a major producer of potatoes , sugar beets , cotton , and sunflowers . despite its vast production of crops , however , the fsu was a net importer of food . its imports averaged just under $20 billion per year , about half of which was for grains and sugar .
