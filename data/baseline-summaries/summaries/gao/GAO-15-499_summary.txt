not mission dependent . facilities and infrastructure — such as cafeterias and parking structures , that do not link directly to programmatic goals but support secondary missions or quality - of - workplace initiatives . according to nnsa data , 3,777 ( or 62.1 percent ) of the agency's 6,085 facilities are designated as not mission dependent . nnsa's 2015 budget estimates for modernization total $293.4 billion over 25 years , an increase of $17.6 billion ( 6.4 percent ) from the $275.8 billion in estimates provided in 2014 . these budget estimates are provided in four program areas: stockpile , infrastructure , st&e , and other weapons activities . some budget estimates for individual programs within these four areas changed more significantly from 2014 to 2015 than the total budget estimates changed — decreasing by as much as 31 percent and increasing by as much as 71 percent — because of changes in programs' production schedules , scope , the methodology used to develop certain budget estimates , and budgetary structure . figure 2 provides a comparison of total budget estimates for nuclear modernization activities in nnsa's 2014 and 2015 budget materials . table 2 , which appears on the next page , details the changes in nnsa's 25-year budget estimates from 2014 to 2015 for modernization in four program areas: stockpile , infrastructure , st&e , and other weapons activities . within these four program areas , we found that some budget estimates for individual programs changed more significantly from 2014 to 2015 than the total budget estimates changed — decreasing by as much as 31 percent and increasing by as much as 71 percent — because of changes in ( 1 ) programs' scope , ( 2 ) production schedules , ( 3 ) the methodology used to develop certain budget estimates , and ( 4 ) budgetary structure . table 3 shows the changes in the 25-year budget estimates for those individual programs with estimates that changed more significantly than the total and identifies the causes for those changes . the 25-year budget estimates for the stockpile area changed significantly between the 2014 and 2015 budget materials for multiple reasons . specifically , budget estimates for leps decreased by $18.4 billion or 31 percent , and budget estimates for stockpile services increased by $11.3 billion or 37 percent . lep budget estimates decreased due to , among other things , delayed production schedules and changes in estimating methodologies while estimates for stockpile services increased due to changes in program scope and budgetary structure . the 2015 budget materials estimate that , over the next 25 years , $41.7 billion will be needed for nuclear weapon leps , which is a decrease of $18.4 billion ( 31 percent ) compared with the estimates contained in the prior year's budget materials . according to nnsa documents and officials , one reason for this decrease in budget estimates is delayed production schedules . the 2015 budget materials state that nnsa will complete three leps — the w76-1 , b61-12 , and the cruise missile — as well as the w88 alteration over the next 25 years , whereas the prior year's budget materials stated that the agency planned to complete these and an additional lep .
