southwest also emphasizes the speed of repairs . it stipulates specific repair turnaround times , and it applies penalties whenever these times are exceeded . manufacturers , suppliers , and third - party logistics providers are also playing a role in streamlining operations and improving the effectiveness of logistics activities . in many cases , these vendors enter partnership - type arrangements with customers that involve longer term relationships and more open sharing of information . the following are examples of vendors that are helping companies better meet logistics needs . boeing , one of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers , has adopted a policy in which it promises next - day shipment for all standard part orders unless the customer specifies otherwise . through its main distribution center in seattle , washington , and a network of smaller distribution centers worldwide , boeing is providing quick order - to - delivery times and making it possible for customers to move from just - in - case toward just - in - time stocking policies . tri - star , a distributor of aerospace hardware and fittings , offers an integrated supplier program in which it works closely with customers to manage expendable parts inventories . its services , which can be tailored to customer requirements , include placing a tri - star representative in customer facilities to monitor inventory bins at end - user locations , place orders , manage receipts , and restock bins . tri - star also maintains data on usage , determines what to order and when , and provides replenishment on a just - in - time basis . time also has a significant impact on cost . for example , the longer it takes to repair a part , the more inventory an organization must carry to ensure coverage while that part is out of service . condensing pipeline times , therefore , simultaneously improves responsiveness and drives down costs . complexity also plays an important role ; it adds to costly overhead and pipeline time . for example , if an organization holds multiple layers of inventory at different locations , it must provide the space , equipment , and personnel to accommodate this inventory at each location , all of which contribute to overhead costs . moreover , if a part must filter through each of these levels before finally reaching the end user , such as a mechanic , each stop along the way adds to pipeline time . as part of our continuing effort to help improve dod's inventory management practices , the ranking minority member , subcommittee on oversight of government management and the district of columbia , senate committee on governmental affairs , requested that we compare the air force's management of its $33 billion reparable parts inventory with the operations of leading - edge private sector firms . this report focuses on ( 1 ) best management practices used in the commercial airline industry to streamline logistics operations and improve customer service , ( 2 ) air force reengineering efforts to improve the responsiveness of its logistics system and reduce costs , and ( 3 ) barriers that may stop the air force from achieving the full benefits of its reengineering efforts .
