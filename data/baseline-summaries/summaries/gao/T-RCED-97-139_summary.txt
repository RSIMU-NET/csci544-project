this report is being issued today . in summary , for the 1994 and 1995 period we reviewed , we found that the administrative expense reimbursement rate of 31 percent of premiums paid to insurance companies resulted in reimbursements that were $81 million more than the companies' expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance . the reimbursement is calculated as a percentage of the premiums paid to the companies , regardless of the expenses incurred by the companies . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . regarding the cost of catastrophic insurance delivery , we found that , in 1995 , the government's total costs to deliver catastrophic insurance were less through usda than private companies . these costs potentially aided the companies in vying for market share and meant that one larger company , rather than several smaller companies , was delivering crop insurance to farmers . however , this consolidation was not required for the sale and service of crop insurance to farmers , provided no net benefit to the crop insurance program , and according to fcic , was not an expense that fcic expected its reimbursement to cover . for example , one company took over the business of a competing company under a lease arrangement . the lease payment totaled $3 million in both 1994 and 1995 . about $400,000 of this payment could be attributed to actual physical assets the company was leasing , and we recognized that amount as a reasonable expense . however , the remaining $2.6 million — which the company was paying each year for access to the former competitor's policyholder base — provided no benefit to the farmer and no net value to the crop insurance program . in 1996 , however , the underwriting gains on catastrophic policies were even higher — $58 million . the current arrangement for reimbursing companies for their administrative expenses — under which fcic pays private companies a fixed percentage of premiums — has certain advantages , including ease of administration . however , expense reimbursement based on a percentage of premiums does not necessarily reflect the amount of work involved to sell and service crop insurance policies .
