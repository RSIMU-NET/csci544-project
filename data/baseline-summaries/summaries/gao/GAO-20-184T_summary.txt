sba agreed to implement this 2016 recommendation . as part of this recommendation , we stated that sba's documentation should include milestones and timelines for when and how the method will be implemented . we also recommended that sba provide the appropriate level of access to and sharing of relevant subsidiary data across district offices , including primary and secondary lines of business and revenue data , once sba develops a database with the capabilities of collecting and tracking these revenue data . in august 2018 , sba informed us that regulations promulgated in 2016 allow it to change an 8 ( a ) anc - owned firm's primary line of business under certain circumstances if the greatest portion of the firm's revenues evolved from one line of business to another . in our 2016 report , we concluded that the new regulations were a step in the right direction but would be difficult to implement effectively without the proper tracking and visibility of revenue data that we describe above and in our 2016 report . in 2018 , sba officials noted that they were testing an analytics tool that , they said , would allow them to track revenues for anc - owned firms , as we recommended . sba's estimated completion date for the evaluation and implementation of this tool was december 31 , 2018 , but as of october 2019 , sba has not been able to provide documentation on whether this action has been implemented . we will continue to monitor sba's efforts to implement this recommendation . criteria thresholds for contract modifications: as we reported in 2006 , sba regulation requires that when the contract execution function is delegated to the procuring agencies , these agencies must report to sba certain 8 ( a ) information , including contract modifications . further , the agreements between sba and the procuring agencies that we reviewed in 2006 require that the agencies provide sba with copies of all 8 ( a ) contract modifications within 15 days of the date of the contract award . however , in our 2006 report , we found that contracting officers were not consistently following these requirements . figure 1 below illustrates one example we reported on in our 2016 report . insufficient staffing levels in sba's alaska district office: in our 2006 report , we noted that sba lacked adequate staffing levels in the alaska district office â€” a district office responsible for the oversight of the majority of anc - owned firms . our reports , and a 2008 report issued by the sba's office of the inspector general , have shown that inadequate staffing was a long - standing challenge and a consistent weakness that directly contributed to sba's inability to provide adequate oversight . in our 2012 report , we noted that anc - owned firms could quickly outgrow the program . it should be noted that we recommended that sba evaluate its staffing levels in 2006 , and in our 2016 report , we found that the staffing challenges persisted . as a result , we found that sba needed a sustained and comprehensive approach to staffing its alaska district office in order to conduct sufficient oversight of anc - owned firm activities .
