3 ) acquisition . officials stated that in doing so it will be desirable for the department's policy changes to retain some flexibilities that allow contracting officers to consider the unique circumstances of fms cases when selecting a contracting strategy . dod's revisions to its defense acquisition regulation are subject to its rule - making process and may not be finalized until fiscal year 2018 , according to dpap officials . in revising its regulations , dod is considering various factors , including the impact on the fms acquisition processes , potential adverse effects on pricing , and the process to review and approve waivers . officials from dpap and the program offices included in our review told us that restricting contracting strategies to require firm - fixed - price contracts could result in higher costs for the u.s. and foreign governments because it may limit their ability to combine u.s. and foreign requirements onto the same contract . dod is also weighing whether programs will be required to award separate firm - fixed - price contracts or use a single contract that incorporates different line items and corresponding contract types for the u.s. versus foreign portions . combining requirements on the same contract can allow the u.s. government and fms customer to benefit from economies of scale , which materialize in the form of cost savings when additional units are procured . however , a decrease in the number of units procured may have the opposite effect as it reduces economies of scale , thus potentially leading to increased prices . upon the contractor's delivery of items included in the letter of offer and acceptance , the fms customer will take custody and make arrangements for their transport . the foreign customer may pay the u.s. government to deliver these items or arrange for a freight forwarder authorized to manage these deliveries . 5 ) case closure . an fms case is a candidate for closure when all materiel and services have been delivered and the fms customer has not requested for the case to be kept open . any remaining funds may be made available to the foreign country . figure 2 summarizes the role of selected entities in the fms process . each year , federal agencies procure a variety of products and services in support of their respective missions and activities . agencies acquire products and services through contracts that specify the government's requirements , the price and payment arrangements agreed upon by the government and the vendor , and other terms and conditions . there are several different contract types and selection is the principal means that dod has for allocating cost risk between the government and the contractor . to fulfill fms requirements , dod generally follows the same acquisition process it uses to meet its own military needs . in this regard , dod follows federal and defense acquisition regulations , which provide uniform policies and procedures to guide the acquisition of goods and services . at times , dod may combine fms purchases with its own procurements .
