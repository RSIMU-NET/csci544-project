we disagree . as we point out , such notification would not require prior approval of the funding shift itself , but would be initiated whenever the funding shift exceeded a certain amount to be determined by the congress . these and other details of the notification procedure could be worked out between congressional committees and dod to further ensure that dod's ability to obligate funds for the timely delivery of health care services was not impaired . further , as the report points out , notification could involve fewer reports than a quarterly reporting process for dhp subactivities . thus , in our view , notification may well offer a less burdensome means of facilitating congressional oversight of dhp funding changes during budget execution . dod also suggested several technical changes to the draft , which we have incorporated where appropriate . dod's comments are presented in their entirety in appendix ii . as agreed with your office , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date . at that time , we will send copies to senator wayne allard , senator robert c. byrd , senator max cleland , senator daniel k. inouye , senator carl levin , senator ted stevens , senator john warner , representative neil abercrombie , representative steve buyer , representative john p. murtha , representative david obey , representative ike skelton , representative floyd spence , and representative c.w . bill young in their capacities as chairman or ranking minority member of senate and house committees and subcommittees . we will also send copies at that time to the honorable william s. cohen , secretary of defense ; the honorable william j. lynn , iii , under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) ; the honorable sue bailey , assistant secretary of defense ( health affairs ) ; and the honorable jacob j. lew , director , office of management and budget . copies will be made available to others upon request . if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report , please contact stephen p. backhus , director , veterans' affairs and military health care issues , on ( 202 ) 512-7101 or daniel brier , assistant director , on ( 202 ) 512-6803 . other contributors to this report include carolyn kirby ( evaluator - in - charge ) , jon chasson , craig winslow , and mary reich . table i.1: defense health program budget requests , budget allocations , and actual obligations , fiscal years 1994-96 $2,583,114 $2,592,596 $3,062,708 $2,706,329 $2,658,394 $2,988,546 $3,035,259 $3,026,670 $2,954,594 $2,923,325 $2,933,625 $3,453,467 $3,098,704 $3,056,769 $3,413,238 $3,454,685 $3,452,996 $3,412,121 $4,325,682 $4,378,006 $3,771,326 $4,478,287 $4,508,287 $3,781,168 $4,267,097 $4,267,097 $3,720,333 ( continued ) ( continued ) $9,080,538 $9,326,635 $9,344,210 $9,613,331 $9,591,331 $9,625,162 $9,865,525 $9,886,961 $9,867,636 the tricare support office program element incorporated only office of champus costs in these years . medical centers , hospitals , and clinics — conus medical centers , hospitals and clinics — oconus armed forces institute of pathology 79,457 ( continued ) .
