( see fig . not all issuers in the individual and small group markets participated in the exchanges in 2014 , and several exchanges had fewer than 3 participating issuers . enrollment through the exchanges was generally more concentrated among a few issuers than was true for the individual and small group markets overall in 2014 . for our examination of issuer participation in the first year of the exchanges , we reported that fewer issuers participated in most state health insurance markets in 2014 compared to 2013 , though exiting issuers generally had small market shares in that prior year . specifically , we found that from 2013 to 2014 , the number of issuers participating in individual markets decreased in 46 states , while fewer states' small - group and large - group markets had decreased participation ( 28 and 22 states , respectively ) . ( see fig . however , across the three types of markets , those issuers exiting each state market before 2014 generally had less than 1 percent of the market in the prior year . there were also issuers that newly entered state markets in 2014 . their market shares in 2014 varied across the three types of markets , with some newly entering issuers in the individual market capturing a market share of over 10 percent . most newly entering issuers in 2014 participated in the exchanges and they generally had a larger share of the enrollment sold through the exchanges than through the overall markets . in addition , some newly entering issuers captured a majority of their exchange market , with co - ops having a higher proportion . since 2014 , there have been additional changes to the number of issuers entering and exiting the individual and small group markets . for example , most of the co - ops that offered coverage in the exchanges in 2014 have since discontinued offering coverage . in addition , in an analysis of data from exchanges in states that used the ffe and state - based exchanges , where available , hhs has since reported that the number of issuers offering health plans through the exchanges decreased from 2016 to 2017 , reflecting multi - state withdrawals by a few large insurers . in 2015 , we reported that individual market consumers generally had access to more health plans in 2015 — a year after the initial implementation of key ppaca provisions — than in 2014 . consumers in most of the counties analyzed in the 28 states for which we had sufficiently reliable data for plans offered either on or off an exchange had six or more plans from which to choose in three of the four health plan metal tiers ( bronze , silver , and gold ) in both 2014 and 2015 . the percentage of counties with six or more plans in those metal tiers increased from 2014 to 2015 .
