nnsa did not approve this schedule , however . prior to fiscal year 2005 , nnsa did not tie overhead costs to specific weapon systems . however , in an attempt to provide a more accurate estimate of total costs by weapon , nnsa created accounts for the w76 warhead that captured a pro - rated portion of general costs , such as research and production support at the laboratories and production facilities . for example , nnsa included the pro - rated cost of forklift operators , who load and unload trucks for all weapon systems . thus , a portion of these overhead costs was added to the 2005 baseline to better account for the full the costs of the program . however , nnsa discovered that this approach constrained flexibility . if priorities shifted and changes needed to be made to overhead activities , resources could not be easily redirected to different weapon systems . any change would require congressional approval because such overhead costs were tied to a specific weapon system as a budget line item . consequently , in fiscal year 2006 , nnsa reported the production and research support accounts separately . while this change restored some flexibility for overall nnsa complex management , the transition reduced clarity about the total cost of a weapon system . accounting changes have persisted , with , for example , some baseline years including large expense items , such as employee benefits , and other baseline years excluding such costs . a lack of a consistent baseline approach with similar cost assumptions and criteria makes it difficult to track the costs of the program over time and determine how well nnsa develops cost estimates . refurbishing the nuclear weapons stockpile is a difficult task . nnsa must draw on the scientific expertise of the nuclear weapons laboratories and the manufacturing and engineering expertise of the nuclear weapons production facilities . recognizing this challenge , nnsa and dod have developed multiple tools for managing the refurbishment effort: phase 6.x , risk management strategies , test and evaluation plans , and a lessons learned document from the w87 life extension program . by selectively using these guidance documents , however , nnsa has incurred significant cost increases and schedule delays that it could have avoided . in addition , nnsa did not include any cost or schedule contingencies in its baseline to address the unforeseen technical challenges that arose . if nnsa had more carefully followed the phase 6.x process , it might have had sufficient time in its schedule to develop and test key materials that it had not manufactured in decades and address unforeseen technical issues . moreover , nnsa did not fully implement its risk management strategy to address one of the highest risks to the w76 life extension program â€” the manufacturing of fogbank . if nnsa had effectively implemented its risk management strategies , schedule delays and cost increases might have been avoided or mitigated . most importantly , if nnsa had started operations of the new facility on schedule , it would have had more time to address manufacturing challenges . in fact , the 1-year delay in the startup of the new fogbank facility corresponded almost exactly to the 1-year program delay .
