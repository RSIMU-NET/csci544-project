we have previously reported on this issue . in march 1995 , in minorities and women on farm committees ( gao / rced - 95-113r , mar . 1 , 1995 ) , we reported that minority farm owners and operators , nationwide , accounted for about 5 percent of those eligible to vote for committee members , and about 2 percent of the county committee members came from a minority group . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . these fsa officials are federal employees . we found that the applications of nonminority farmers were disapproved for similar reasons . under the acp , fsa generally paid farmers up to 75 percent of a conservation project's cost , up to a maximum of $3,500 annually . we did not evaluate the quality and thoroughness of the staff's activities . with respect to the representation of minority employees in the farm service agency's field offices , usda's database showed that , as of october 1996 , 32 percent of the employees serving the 101 counties with the highest number of minority farmers are members of a minority group . moreover , for the same period , 89 percent of these minority employees were either county executive directors or program assistants . minority farmers make up about 17 percent of the farmer population in these counties . furthermore , in 36 of the 101 counties , at least one minority farmer is a member of the county committee . finally , the applications of minority farmers for the agricultural conservation program and for the direct loan program were disapproved at a higher rate nationwide than for nonminority farmers for october 1 , 1994 through march 31 , 1996 . we found that disapproval rates for minority farmers were also higher at three of the five county offices and three of the five district loan offices we visited . however , our review of the information in the application files at these offices showed that decisions to approve or disapprove applications were supported by information in the files and that decision - making criteria appeared to be applied to minority and nonminority applicants in a similar fashion . within usda , fsa has the overall administrative responsibility for implementing agricultural programs .
