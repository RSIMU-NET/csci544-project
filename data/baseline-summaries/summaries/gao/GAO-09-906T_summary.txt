gao - 09-68 . washington , d.c.: november 24 , 2008 . improving fire management decisions . the agencies have recently undertaken several efforts to improve decisions about firefighting strategies . in one such effort , the agencies in 2009 began to use a new analytical tool , known as the wildland fire decision support system . this new tool helps line officers and fire managers analyze various factors — such as the fire's current location , adjacent fuel conditions , nearby structures and other highly valued resources , and weather forecasts — in determining the strategies and tactics to adopt . for example , the tool generates a map illustrating the probability that a particular wildland fire , barring any suppression actions , will burn a certain area within a specified time , and the structures or other resources that may therefore be threatened . having such information can help line officers and fire managers understand the resources at risk and identify the most appropriate response — for example , whether to devote substantial resources in attempting full and immediate suppression or to instead take a less intensive approach , which may reduce risks to firefighters and cost less . other efforts include ( 1 ) establishing experience and training requirements for line officers to be certified to manage fires of different levels of complexity , and ( 2 ) forming four teams staffed with some of the most experienced fire managers to assist in managing wildland fires . steve gaty , assistant director ; david p. bixler ; ellen w. chu ; jonathan dent ; and richard p. johnson made key contributions to this statement . wildland fire management: interagency budget tool needs further development to fully meet key objectives . wildland fire management: federal agencies lack key long - and short - term management strategies for using program funds effectively . gao - 08-433t . washington , d.c.: february 12 , 2008 . wildland fire management: better information and a systematic process could improve agencies' approach to allocating fuel reduction funds and selecting projects . a number of factors have contributed to these increases . uncharacteristic accumulations of vegetation that can fuel wildland fires , due in part to past fire suppression policies and land management practices , and severe regional weather and drought have led to higher - intensity fires and longer fire seasons . at the same time , continued development in and near wildlands , an area often called the wildland - urban interface , has placed more homes at risk . a series of damaging wildland fires in the 1990s led the forest service and the interior agencies to reassess their approach to managing fire . it also prompted a sustained effort , known as the national fire plan , on the part of federal agencies and congress to improve fire suppression capabilities , reduce fuels , restore fire - adapted ecosystems , and help communities better withstand wildland fire . growing recognition of the long - term fiscal challenges facing the nation has also led congress , the agencies , and others to focus on ensuring that federal wildland fire activities are appropriate and carried out in a cost - effective manner .
