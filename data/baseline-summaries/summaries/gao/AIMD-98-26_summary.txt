we disagree . these costs were precipitated by the relocation action to allow arena construction and , accordingly , were an allowable cost of the sports arena project . as of september 30 , 1997 , collections for the 1997 arena tax had totaled about $9 million and were sufficient to meet 1997 principal and interest payments ( about $5.9 million annually ) on the bonds issued to finance the predevelopment expenses . the district forecasts arena tax collections of $9 million for each year that the bonds are outstanding . for 1995 and 1996 , the trustees for the lockbox collected arena tax revenues of about $9.3 million and $9.6 million , respectively . based on an analysis performed by the district's lead underwriter for the sports arena special tax revenue bonds , if future arena tax collections remain in the $9 million range , and if revenues from the ground lease of the arena and the $6 million in the debt service reserve , including interest earnings , are used , the bonds could be paid off in 2002 , well before the 2010 maturity date of the longest term bonds . the approximately $9 million in dedicated tax revenues collected as of september 30 , 1997 , compares favorably with 1995 and 1996 collections ; therefore , it is likely that collections will also exceed $9 million in 1997 . as was done in previous years , taxpayers were instructed to send their payments to a lockbox under the control of bank trustees . we verified that these funds were transferred to the trustee for the bonds and placed in accounts for principal and interest payments . the combined total of $18.6 million in dedicated tax revenues collected for 1996 and 1997 is being used to pay principal and interest on the sports arena bonds . the district's sports arena special tax revenue bonds are comprised of about $15.4 million in serial bonds , which have stated maturity dates from 1996 to 2000 , and $44.5 million of term bonds with stated maturity dates from 2001 to 2010 . as of november 30 , 1996 , the district had paid principal and interest of $5.8 million on its serial bonds . the bond resolution requires that any additional tax collected over the amount needed to pay debt service on bonds be placed in a super sinker fund and be used to redeem term bonds earlier than their due dates.the serial bonds cannot be redeemed earlier than their stated maturity dates . according to the bond trustees , on may 1 , 1997 , about $2.5 million of term bonds had been redeemed , and interest of about $1.6 million had been paid . of the $18.6 million collected in dedicated tax revenues as of september 30 , 1997 , the district has used about $9.9 million for debt service , leaving about $8.7 million in the debt service fund . in addition , according to the bond trustee , as of september 30 , 1997 , the district had approximately $6.5 million , including about $500,000 in interest earnings , in the debt service reserve fund .
