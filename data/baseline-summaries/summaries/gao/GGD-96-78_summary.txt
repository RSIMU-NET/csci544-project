( app . iv contains the president's memorandum on gun dealer licensing. ) in response to the president's memorandum , atf implemented a number of actions to improve the thoroughness and effectiveness of screening applicants for federal firearms licenses . for example , in late 1993 and early 1994 , atf significantly revised the firearms licensing process to obtain more information about applicants to determine whether they met the requirements of gca . the decline occurred in every state . atf received substantially fewer applications for licenses ; in particular , applications for new licenses dropped very sharply from april 1993 to april 1994 , during the first year of declines . also , in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 , the number of atf denials of both new and renewal applications remained relatively small , but there was a substantial increase in the number of new applications abandoned and withdrawn . similarly , during the same years , as a result of atf inspections , the number of licenses revoked remained small , but the number of licenses voluntarily surrendered was high . the number of federal firearms dealer licenses ( classes 01 and 02 ) rose steadily until april 1993 , when they peaked at 260,703 . the number declined sharply since then . as of september 30 , 1995 , there were 168,395 dealer licensees â€” the lowest number since fiscal year 1980 . to provide the context for interpreting the more recent decline , figure l depicts trend data on the number of federally licensed firearms dealers at the end of fiscal years 1975 to 1995 , and appendix ii lists the actual number of dealers at the end of each fiscal year . as shown in figure 2 , the decline in the number of firearms dealer licenses from april 1993 through september 1995 occurred throughout the country . the overall average decline among the states was approximately 35 percent , ranging from 23 percent in montana to 45 percent in hawaii . the decline in the number of firearms dealer licenses occurred in all regions of the country . the percentage decline was almost identical for each region of the country represented by atf's five regulatory enforcement district offices , ranging from 34.5 percent in atf's midwest district to 37.1 percent in atf's southeast district . declines in the number of firearms dealer licenses were primarily a function of declines in the number of new applications and of renewals of existing licenses . over the past 3 years , a large decline occurred in applications for both new licenses and for renewals of existing licenses . according to atf officials , the number of new applications increased dramatically between december 1992 and march 1993 to a high of 7,003 , primarily because of publicity concerning the ease of obtaining firearms licenses . the number of new applications then declined to the level prior to the increase , and remained at approximately this level for the remainder of 1993 . another sharp decline occurred beginning in february 1994 , and the number has remained fairly steady since then , with 485 new applications being received in september 1995 .
