( see table 1. ) appendix ii: severity of abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes , 2013 through 2017 cms restructured its deficiency code system beginning on november 28 , 2017 . due to these coding changes , we did not analyze cms data cited by surveyors after the implementation of that change . percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding . elder abuse: federal requirements for oversight in nursing homes and assisted living facilities differ . elder justice: goals and outcome measures would provide doj with clear direction and a means to assess its efforts . gao - 19-365 . washington , d.c.: june 7 , 2019 . management report: cms needs to address gaps in federal oversight of nursing home abuse investigations that persisted in oregon for at least 15 years . gao - 19-313r . washington , d.c.: april 15 , 2019 . medicaid assisted living services: improved federal oversight of beneficiary health and welfare is needed . gao - 18-179 . washington , d.c.: january 5 , 2018 . medicaid managed care: cms should improve oversight of access and quality in states' long - term services and supports programs . gao - 17- 632 . washington , d.c.: august 14 , 2017 . medicaid personal care services: cms could do more to harmonize requirements across programs . gao - 17-28 . washington , d.c.: november 23 , 2016 . nursing homes: consumers could benefit from improvements to the nursing home compare website and five - star quality rating system . gao - 17-61 . washington , d.c.: november 18 , 2016 . elder abuse: the extent of abuse by guardians is unknown , but some measures exist to help protect older adults . ( see appendix ii. ) in addition , abuse deficiencies cited in 2017 were more likely to be categorized at the highest levels of severity — deficiencies causing actual harm to residents or putting residents in immediate jeopardy — than they were in 2013 . in light of the increased number and severity of abuse deficiencies , it is imperative that cms have strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse ; however , we found oversight gaps that may limit the agency's ability to do so . specifically , we found that cms: ( 1 ) cannot readily access data on the type of abuse or type of perpetrator , ( 2 ) has not provided guidance on what information nursing homes should include in facility - reported incidents , and ( 3 ) has numerous gaps in its referral process that can result in delayed and missed referrals to law enforcement . in our june 2019 report , we found that cms's data do not allow for the type of abuse or perpetrator to be readily identified by the agency . specifically , cms does not require the state survey agencies to record abuse and perpetrator type and , when this information is recorded , it cannot be easily analyzed by cms .
