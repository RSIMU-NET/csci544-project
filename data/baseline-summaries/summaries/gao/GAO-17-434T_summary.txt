we recommended that interior provide clarifying guidance . in august 2015 , interior stated the department was considering further guidance . as of december 2016 , however interior had not provided additional guidance . in our june 2015 report , we found that bia's long - standing workforce challenges , such as inadequate staff resources and staff at some offices without the skills needed to effectively review energy - related documents , were factors hindering indian energy development . further , in november 2016 , we found that some bia offices had high vacancy rates for key energy development positions , and some offices reported not having staff with key skills to review energy - related documents . for example , bia agency officials in an area where tribes are considering developing wind farms told us that they would not feel comfortable approving proposed wind leases because their staff do not have the expertise to review such proposals . consequently , these officials told us that they would send a proposed wind lease to higher ranking officials in the regional office for review . similarly , an official from the regional office stated that they do not have the required expertise and would forward such a proposal to senior officials in interior's office of the solicitor . the director of bia told us that bia agency offices generally do not have the expertise to help tribes with solar and wind development because it is rare that such skills are needed . through the indian energy service center , bia plans to hire numerous new staff over the next 2 years , which could resolve some of the long - standing workforce challenges that have hindered indian energy development in the past . however , bia is hiring new staff without incorporating effective workforce planning principles . specifically , bia has not assessed key skills needed to fulfill its responsibilities related to energy development or identified skill gaps , and does not have a documented process to provide reasonable assurance its workforce composition at agency offices is consistent with its mission , goals , and tribal priorities . the published product may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao . more detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in each of the three reports . we conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . in june 2015 , we found that bia did not have the necessary geographic information system ( gis ) mapping data for identifying who owns and uses resources , such as existing leases . in a june 2015 report , we found that bia review and approval is required throughout the development process , including the approval of leases , right - of - way ( row ) agreements , and appraisals .
