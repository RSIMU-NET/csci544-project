according to 10 u.s.c . § 129a , the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness ( usd p&r ) has overall responsibility for the development of guidance on the implementation of policies and procedures for determining the most appropriate and cost - efficient mix of military , civilian , and contractor personnel to perform the mission of dod . in addition , usd p&r is , among other things , to provide oversight policy , assess the size and shaping of the civilian workforce , and develop policies , plans , and programs to ensure the readiness of the total force . dod's september 2014 report outlined reductions achieved in civilian personnel for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and planned reductions for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 . the reductions in civilian personnel are further grouped by military component and civilian hiring status of direct , reimbursable , or foreign . the report also outlines reductions achieved in military personnel using military average strength by active , reserve , and national guard status for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and planned reductions for these personnel for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 . additionally , the report outlines reductions achieved in funding for contracted services for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and planned reductions for contracted services for fiscal year 2014 and 2015 . section 955 gave dod authority to exempt certain civilian and contractor functions from reductions . most of the september 2014 report provides details on these exclusions — for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 . as a result , about 70 percent of the civilian workforce was excluded from the savings goals over the period . the exclusions are categorized by personnel functions such as depots , medical , and shipyards as well as by military component and the department's defense - wide agencies such as the defense commissary agency and defense contract audit agency . similar to the september 2014 report , the february 2015 report that was included in budget justification materials accompanying the president's budget for fiscal year 2016 outlines achieved and proposed civilian personnel reductions for fiscal years 2014 through 2020 and reductions to contractor personnel spending through fiscal year 2016 . in addition , the proposed reductions in civilian personnel are further categorized by hiring status , as in the initial report provided in september 2014 . further the february 2015 report details exclusions taken by the department based on the categories identified in the initial report — personnel functions , military components , and dod's defense - wide agencies . see table 1 for an overall summary of the reductions reported by dod for each workforce . dod's september 2014 and february 2015 reports did not fully address most statutory requirements related to the civilian and contractor workforces . specifically , of the six statutory requirements , dod partially addressed three statutory requirements and did not address three statutory requirements . table 1 summarizes the statutory requirements and our assessment of the extent to which dod's reports addressed these requirements . during our discussions with ousd comptroller officials , they acknowledged that both reports did not fully address the requirements of section 955 .
