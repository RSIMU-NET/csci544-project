, large and medium hub ) airports . it is based on a combination of formula grants — which are often referred to as “entitlement grants” within this program — that go to all national - system airports , and discretionary grants that faa awards for selected eligible projects . in 2015 , we reported that , for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 , national - system airports received an average of $3.3 billion annually in aip grant funding . grant awards in fiscal year 2016 totaled almost $3.3 billion . pfc collections: congress last raised the pfc cap in 2000 to $4.50 per flight segment , with a limit on the total pfcs that a passenger can be charged per round trip of $18 total . large and medium hub airports that collect pfcs of $3 or less per flight segment have their aip entitlement funding reduced by 50 percent ; any of these airports that collect pfcs of more than $3 have their aip entitlement funding reduced by 75 percent . most of these aip reductions to large and medium airports are distributed to smaller airports through the aip . we found in 2015 that for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 , commercial airports had an annual average of $1.8 billion of their pfc collections available for capital projects after deducting interest payments on debt . ninety percent of that amount was collected by larger airports . of the $90 billion in faa approved pfc collections , 34 percent has been committed for landside projects , such as terminals ; 34 percent for the interest payments on debt used to pay for capital projects , and 18 percent for airside projects , such as runways and taxiways . as of january 2017 , 96 of the top 100 airports have been approved to collect pfcs . state grants: airports can also obtain funding for capital development projects from state grants . this money is often used to provide the airport's share of matching funds required for aip - funded projects . according to the results of a survey we conducted in collaboration with the national association of state aviation officials ( nasao ) , for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 , states provided an annual average of $477 million to national system airports , with $345 million ( 72 percent ) going to smaller airports and $131 million ( 28 percent ) going to large and medium hub airports . capital contributions: capital contributions are funds contributed for infrastructure projects by the airport sponsor or entities that use the airport , such as airlines or tenants . according to faa data on commercial airports' annual financial reports , for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 , commercial airports received an annual average of $644 million in capital contributions . of this amount , $419 million went to larger airports and $225 million went to smaller airports . airport - generated net income: airports generate both aeronautical revenues , such as revenues earned from leases with airlines and landing fees , and non - aeronautical revenues , such as earnings from terminal concessions and parking fees .
