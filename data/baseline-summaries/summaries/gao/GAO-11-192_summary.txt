several factors accounted for these changes . for example: based on the at&l guidance , the air force included $6.7 billion in research and development , $2.9 billion in maintenance of real property contracts , and $0.1 billion in miscellaneous construction , education and training , and transportation contracts in fiscal year 2009 that it had previously excluded in fiscal year 2008 . the remaining $2.4 billion increase reflects additional obligations in fiscal year 2009 on services that were included in both fiscal years . based on the at&l guidance , the navy excluded $5.3 billion of services associated with early stages of research and development activities in fiscal year 2009 that it had previously included . in addition , the navy included a net increase of about $0.3 billion in contract actions under $100,000 and deobligations in fiscal year 2009 that had previously been excluded . this overall $5 billion decrease , however , was partially offset by a $3.8 billion increase in obligations in fiscal year 2009 on services that were included in both fiscal years . the navy and air force reported an increase in the number of contractor ftes in their inventories from fiscal year 2008 to 2009 , although our analysis found that the navy's reported increase was in error . according to a navy official , the navy used a different set of labor rates and ratios from those specified under the at&l approach to simplify the fte calculations . had the navy used at&l's proscribed approach , the navy would have reported 207,604 contractor ftes for fiscal year 2009 , a decrease of 14 percent from fiscal year 2008 . more generally , our analysis indicates that the use of the at&l formula for fiscal year 2009 produced a lower number of contractor ftes for the navy and air force than their respective fiscal year 2008 formulas would have produced had the approach not changed , as shown in figure 3 . the effect of the change in estimating contractor ftes was even more pronounced on specific categories of services . for example , applying at&l's formula resulted in the air force reporting 7,902 contractor ftes associated with systems engineering services for fiscal year 2009 . if the air force's fiscal year 2008 formula were applied , the inventory would have shown 12,661 ftes . at the same time , the air force spent more on systems engineering services in fiscal year 2009 than it did in fiscal year 2008 . for the navy , even though it obligated more for program management support services in fiscal year 2009 , using the at&l formula would have resulted in 3,374 contractor ftes whereas using the navy's fiscal year 2008 formula would have produced 8,025 ftes . although the army's approach for compiling its inventory did not change from fiscal year 2008 to 2009 , officials attributed the $8.9 billion increase in the amount of spending reported and the 23 percent increase in the number of contractor ftes to better reporting through the cmra system . in particular , army officials responsible for cmra said that the fiscal year 2009 inventory contains more data for weapon systems support services than was included in the fiscal year 2008 inventory .
