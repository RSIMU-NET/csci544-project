we disagree . our report stated that the contract with westwood did not fully reflect actual duties that were subsequently performed and provided three examples of such . the quotation provided by energy in its comments is from the statement of work section of the westwood contract entitled “advisory committee activities” that only addresses the work that westwood should perform in support of the advisory committee , and therefore this language does not address the other activities westwood performed . energy states that a complete cost proposal was obtained from westwood . however , energy does not address that our report stated that westwood's cost proposal was not incorporated into the prime contact with tdi nor was any other binding agreement created between energy and westwood relative to its cost proposal . thus , as our report also stated , without an effective contractual agreement , including negotiated rates , it was not possible for energy to adequately review the amounts tdi billed for costs attributed to what energy characterizes as the subcontractor , westwood . we reaffirm this position . a formal agreement between a prime and a subcontractor not only protects the interests of the parties involved , but also those of the government . additionally , as discussed in the agency comments and our evaluation section of our report , after - the - fact detective controls , such as the defense contract audit agency audits are not a replacement for real - time monitoring and oversight of contract costs . at the time of our first inquiry , energy told us it was still updating and finalizing the locations and conditions of the government - owned equipment that sea purchased . on september 29 , 2005 , the director of the office of information management within the office of environment safety and health stated that “the identification and recording process is still underway.” this was 8 months after expiration of the sea contract in december 2004 . our report also stated that an inventory of contractor - purchased , government owned equipment that westwood purchased was not conducted until december 2005 , nearly 9 months after westwood's contract expired , which energy does not dispute . we did not review energy's work in 2006 to address the missing items . we do not agree with energy's statement that “at no time did energy exceed a contractually negotiated and established contact ceiling.” our report stated that energy did not establish internal control monitoring practices to effectively manage overall contract costs , including using contract ceilings to manage and encourage cost - effectiveness . we found , for example , that westwood was paid amounts that exceeded the “not to exceed” ceiling on other direct costs each year under its first contract , which covered the 3 ½ year period august 2001 through february 2005 as well as under the second contract that began in september 2004 . as a specific example , the other direct cost ceiling was $600,000 in year 3 , but westwood was paid $2,421,176 , or $1,821,176 more than the “not to exceed” limit per the contract .
