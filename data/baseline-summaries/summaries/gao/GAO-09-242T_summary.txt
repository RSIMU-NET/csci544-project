some of these steps should be specifically addressed in the legislation . it will be important to keep in mind , however , that the affected parties will cooperate only if the assistance program offers a better alternative than bankruptcy . the government should not expect creditors , for example , to make concessions that will cost them more than they would expect to lose in a bankruptcy proceeding . finally , congress should provide the board with enough flexibility to balance requirements in each recipient's business plan to achieve and maintain profitability . the board could be the logical entity to establish and implement clearly defined eligibility criteria for potential borrowers , consistent with statutory direction provided by congress , and establish other safeguards to help protect the government's interests and limit the government's exposure to loss . the safeguards could vary , depending on the nature of the financial assistance tools used . examples of safeguards over loans and loan guarantees that have been used in the past include the following: potential borrowers have been required to demonstrate that they meet specific eligibility criteria , consistent with congressional direction as to the problems to be addressed and the objectives and goals of the assistance . potential borrowers have been required to demonstrate that their prospective earning power , together with the character and value of any security pledged , provided reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan in accordance with its terms . potential borrowers have been required to clearly indicate the planned use of the loans so that the board could make appropriate decisions about the borrower's financial plan and terms and conditions , as well as collateral . the government has charged fees to help offset the risks it assumed in providing such assistance . for loan guarantees , the level of guarantee has been limited to a given percentage of the total amount of the loan outstanding . to further enhance accountability and promote transparency , the board should monitor the status of federal assistance on a regular basis and require regular reporting from companies receiving assistance . this reporting should , at a minimum , include information on cash flow , financial position , and results of independent audits . in addition , the board should be required to provide periodic reports to congress . this reporting should include status reports on the amount and types of assistance provided to the auto manufacturing industry , periodic assessments of the effectiveness of the assistance , and status of any repayments of loans that the federal government has provided to the industry . in addition to providing oversight and accountability of the federal funds , the board could be charged with overseeing efforts of the assisted companies to implement required changes and reform . the board would likely need to consider industry - specific issues in implementing financial assistance and industry reform . employee compensation would be one of those issues , and a very complex one . benefits for auto industry workers represent a significant long - term financial commitment of the companies seeking assistance , much of it to retirees and their families .
