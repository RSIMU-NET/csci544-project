this work is ongoing . in phase 3 , which is not yet underway , the dod ig will provide oversight of the construction of the projects , ensure that all required reporting is taking place , and review the results of the projects . findings: as of june 9 , 2010 , the dod ig and military service audit agencies had posted reports on about 27 individual site reviews on www.recovery.gov . these reports have found management of recovery act contracting to be generally good , although they suggest areas for improvement at some specific installations , such as ensuring that all recovery act - related clauses are included in every contract , or developing a plan to manage recipient reporting . doe works to advance the national , economic , and energy security of the united states ; to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission ; and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex . doe received approximately $36.7 billion in funding under the recovery act . of this , $32.7 billion was for the award of grants and contracts . however , many programs involved comparatively little contracting by doe — for instance , the weatherization assistance program ( $5 billion ) provided grants to states . by contrast , funding for cleanup of nuclear sites ( $6 billion ) is spent primarily through contracts . doe program areas receiving recovery act funding are listed in table 4 . as of may 2010 , doe had obligated more than $7.1 billion of recovery act funds through contracts . most of the doe recovery act contracting funds to date were obligated within the last two quarters of fiscal year 2009 , from april through september 2009 . figure 5 shows doe obligations of recovery act funds through contracts by fiscal quarter . nearly all — almost 100 percent — of the funds that doe obligated under recovery act contract actions were on existing contracts , as shown in figure 6 . about 97 percent of all recovery act funds at doe were on contract actions coded in fpds - ng as awarded competitively . however , among the small amount of funds obligated through new contracts , 92 percent were obligated on noncompetitively awarded contracts . of the 16 contract actions we reviewed at doe's environmental management consolidated business center , all were orders or modifications on existing noncompetitive contracts . several added funding to existing remediation projects for sites with radioactive contamination . for example , $1.9 million in recovery act funds were obligated on a contract for environmental remediation for the uranium mill tailings remediation action in moab , utah . other contracts were for administrative support and involved smaller amounts of recovery act funds . for instance , doe issued an order on an existing contract for monitoring and reporting support . table 5 provides additional details on some noncompetitive contract actions we reviewed at the environmental management consolidated business center . these examples illustrate the variety of services and supplies being acquired , the amount of recovery act funding used , and the reason a contract action was not competed .
