homes . hcfa has also added requirements that home health agencies demonstrate experience and expertise in home care by serving a minimum number of patients before initially certifying them as medicare providers . however , these steps may not go far enough to protect vulnerable beneficiaries . we are now reviewing hcfa's oversight of state nursing home complaint investigations and inspections and will report to the congress on these issues this year . because its mission has been rapidly growing and changing , hcfa officials have worked hard to strengthen the agency's management capabilities . despite these efforts , problems remain that hamper effective agency operations . while hcfa has developed a new focus on planning , including publishing a strategic plan , it does not require units to develop detailed plans to carry out day - to - day operations . the agency has completed its reorganization , but the resulting structure has contributed to various communication and coordination problems . last year , hcfa lacked sufficient trained staff with the skills to effectively implement its top priorities . it hired more staff with needed skills in 1998 , but it has not completed a long - term strategic approach to meet its future human resource needs . hcfa staff and managers are also concerned that its performance and award systems are not well linked to accomplishing its mission and that many managers are overburdened and lack managerial skills . these types of problems are found in other agencies , but hcfa still must be diligent in addressing them . similarly , according to managers and staff , the performance appraisal system does not give staff a sense of satisfaction when they perform well because it fails to recognize outstanding efforts . some cited the prior performance system as preferable because exceptional performers could benefit by receiving more rapid pay increases . the administrator found that the performance appraisal system for executives was also not useful in holding managers accountable and made changes this year to better differentiate senior managers' performance . the executive appraisal system has changed to a system with five levels of performance . each executive manager has a performance agreement that is linked to performance goals for his or her set of responsibilities . many managers and staff members also told us that the current awards program is not working . although the program is intended to motivate staff , the opinions we gathered suggest that it may have just the opposite effect . each unit establishes its own panel that makes award decisions and controls award amounts . panels consist of an equal number of union - appointed and management - appointed representatives . each panel sets its own criteria for making awards and determining the portion of its awards budget to give to managers for “on - the - spot” awards , which are awarded directly to staff for performance on specific projects throughout the year . managers told us that they would like to be able to distinguish among the accomplishments of staff members and reward them accordingly , but both managers and staff perceive the awards process as lacking equity and integrity .
