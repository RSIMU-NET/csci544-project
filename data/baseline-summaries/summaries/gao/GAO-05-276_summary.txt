this undermined its ability to assess governmentwide trends and issues . in addition , the lack of a complete management watch list necessarily inhibited omb's ability to track progress overall and to represent the full set of investments requiring corrective action . we continue to believe that these activities could be facilitated by an aggregate management watch list . as agreed with your offices , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the report date . at that time , we will send copies to other interested congressional committees and to the director of the office of management and budget . we also will make copies available to others upon request . in addition , the report will be available at no charge on the gao web site at www.gao.gov . should you or your offices have questions on matters discussed in this report , please contact me at ( 202 ) 512-9286 , or lester p. diamond , assistant director , at ( 202 ) 512-7957 . we can also be reached by e - mail at pownerd@gao.gov , or diamondl@gao.gov , respectively . rmos work as liaisons between federal agencies and the presidency . in formulating the budget , they evaluate agency requests for funding and evaluate agency management and financial practices . rmos also evaluate and make recommendations to the president when agencies seek new legislation or the issuance of presidential executive orders that would help agencies to fulfill their organizational objectives . according to omb officials , the oira and e - gov analysts , along with rmo program examiners , evaluate agency exhibit 300 business cases as part of the development of the president's budget . the results of this review are provided to agencies through what is called the “passback” process . that is , omb passes the requests back to agencies with its evaluation , which identifies any areas requiring remediation . the final step in the budget process , occurring after the congress has appropriated funds , is apportionment , through which omb formally controls agency spending . according to the antideficiency act , before the agency may spend its funding resources , appropriations must be apportioned by periods within the fiscal year ( typically by quarters ) or among the projects to be undertaken . although apportionment is a procedure required to allow agencies to access their appropriated funds , omb can also use apportionment to impose conditions on agency spending , such as changes in agency practices ; it is one of several mechanisms that the clinger - cohen act authorizes omb to use to enforce an agency head's accountability for the agency's it investments . the president's budget for fiscal year 2005 included about 1,200 it projects , totaling about $60 billion . of this total number of projects , omb reported in the budget that slightly over half — 621 projects , representing about $22 billion — were on a management watch list . according to omb's march 2004 testimony , this list consists of mission - critical projects that needed to improve performance measures , project management , it security , or overall justification .
