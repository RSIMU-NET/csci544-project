( see app . i for a more detailed table of the data. ) cocaine: virtually all the cocaine consumed in the united states is produced along the south american andean ridge — primarily , in colombia . the u.s. interagency counternarcotics community prepares an annual assessment ( the interagency assessment of cocaine movement ) that , among other things , estimates the amount of cocaine departing south america toward the united states . from 2000 to 2006 , the iacm reported an increase in the estimated amount of cocaine flowing through mexico to the united states — from 66 percent in 2000 to 77 percent in 2003 and 90 percent in 2006 . between 2000 and 2002 , the cocaine estimated arriving in mexico rose about 23 percent — from 220 to 270 metric tons . in 2003 , it declined over 60 metric tons , or about 22 percent . for 2004-2006 , the iacm did not provide “point” estimates for cocaine flow because of certain methodological concerns ; rather , a range was provided for each year . the midpoint of the iacm range of cocaine estimated arriving in mexico during 2006 ( about 380 metric tons ) was about 160 metric tons more than the estimate for 2000 . using the midpoint of the iacm ranges , the amount of cocaine estimated arriving in mexico during 2000-2006 averaged about 290 metric tons per year . despite the apparent increases in cocaine arriving in mexico , the amount of cocaine reported seized in mexico and along the u.s. - mexico border for 2000-2006 did not increase proportionately , with 43 metric tons reported seized in 2000 , a low of 28 metric tons seized in 2003 , and a high of 44 metric tons in 2005 . reported seizures for 2000-2006 averaged about 36 metric tons a year , or about 13 percent of the estimated amount of cocaine arriving in mexico . heroin: during 2000-2005 , the estimated amount of heroin produced for export in mexico averaged almost 19 metric tons a year — ranging from a low of 9 metric tons in 2000 to a high of 30 metric tons in 2003 . although the estimated amount of heroin produced declined in 2004 and 2005 , the 2005 estimate ( 17 metric tons ) was nearly double the estimated amount produced in 2000 . reported heroin seizures in mexico and along the u.s. - mexico border averaged less than 1 metric ton or less than 5 percent a year of the estimated export quality heroin produced in mexico between 2000 and 2005 . marijuana: during 2000-2005 , the estimated amount of marijuana produced in mexico each year averaged about 9,400 metric tons — ranging from a low of 7,000 metric tons in 2000 to a high of 13,500 metric tons in 2003 . although estimated production declined to 10,100 metric tons in 2005 , this was over 3,000 metric tons more than the estimated production in 2000 . reported seizures of marijuana in mexico and along the u.s. - mexico border ranged from about 2,150 metric tons in 2000 to nearly 3,500 in 2003 — averaging less than 2,900 metric tons a year , or about 30 percent of the annual production estimates .
