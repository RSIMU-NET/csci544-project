over 200 potential ucas were selected for this review . from this selection , we expected to collect data on approximately 10 to 12 at each command we visited for a total of 80 to 96 ucas . in the end , we collected data on 92 ucas from which we eliminated 9 and analyzed the remaining 83 ucas valued at a total of $6.1 billion . we also reviewed relevant proposed changes to dfars . to determine the accuracy of uca information available to senior officials , we analyzed and compared information on ucas from the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) , dod's newly implemented semi - annual uca reports , and the local acquisition command - generated uca reports . we noted any differences in information among the various sources and documented those contract actions which did not appear in dod's semi - annual report , but were recorded in fpds - ng and the local reports . we also discussed these discrepancies with dod officials at both the local level and osd level to try to understand the underlying cause of these differences . the longest took over 582 days to definitize . we also found 18 contract actions that were undefinitized beyond 180 days , including one from the aeronautical systems center awarded in february 2008 , which as of december 2009 had yet to be definitized after more than 645 days . officials at the local commands stated that they attempt to follow defense acquisition requirements for definitization within 180 days . however , we found increased management emphasis on definitization time frames at the rock island contracting center . first , we selected one contracting command from each of the three military services ( air force , army , and navy ) and one defense agency based on its placement within the top 50 percent of total - dollar value of ucas issued during fiscal year 2008 as recorded in the fpds - ng system . second , for comparative purposes , we selected one contracting command from each of the three military services ( air force , army , and navy ) and one defense agency that fell outside of the top 50 percent of total - dollar value of ucas issued during fiscal year 2008 as recorded in the fpds - ng system . the contracting commands in this second group were then selected using subjective criteria which included commands with significant uca use recommended by the services , the command's geographic location , and the command's history of uca use . the specific contracting commands we selected for our review were: tank - automotive and armaments command contracting center , rock island contracting center , rock island , illinois naval sea systems command , washington , d.c . specifically , the rock island contracting center focused on definitizing ucas within 150 days . of the 12 ucas we reviewed at this location , 11 were definitized within the 180-day time frame . we found no relationship between the dollar value of the contract action and the length of time it took to definitize . likewise , final contract - type did not appear to influence the timeliness of definitization .
