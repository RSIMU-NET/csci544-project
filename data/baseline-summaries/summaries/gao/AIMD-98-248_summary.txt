these examinations were completed in june 1998 . to its credit , frs made the ffiec year 2000 examination procedures more specific to alleviate shortcomings reported in our previous testimonies . these shortcomings included using vague terms ( such as well into , largely , and well underway ) to describe year 2000 progress and not collecting all the data needed to determine where banks are in the year 2000 correction process . according to frs , the results of its on - site year 2000 examinations show that , as of june 30 , 1998 , 96 percent of the 1,618 institutions examined are performing satisfactorily . this does not mean that these institutions are year 2000 ready , but rather that they are proceeding on schedule in accordance with the five - phase year 2000 approach described in ffiec's may 5 , 1997 , guidance . frs also reported that 4 percent of the institutions examined needed to improve their year 2000 programs , while less than 1 percent was performing unsatisfactorily . banks needing improvement were generally behind schedule , not fully aware of the status of year 2000 efforts , and insufficiently committed to the effort . banks performing unsatisfactorily were seriously behind schedule , did not understand or recognize the impact of the year 2000 problem , and were only minimally committed to the effort . frs is taking actions to deal with institutions in these latter two categories . for example , as of june 30 , 1998 , frs had issued notification letters to these institutions requiring that they take formal corrective actions to address year 2000 deficiencies . frs is also requiring these institutions to report monthly on how they are progressing in correcting identified deficiencies . frs and the other ffiec members are planning to conduct another round of examinations , which will end on march 31 , 1999 . to accomplish this , they recently developed detailed examination procedures that focus primarily on an institution's plans and processes for achieving year 2000 readiness , with particular emphasis placed on the final phases of the year 2000 project — testing and implementation — and on the institution's contingency plans . on june 23 , 1998 , frs also issued guidance directing each reserve bank to develop a plan — referred to as a year 2000 supervisory review plan — by july 15 , 1998 , to ensure that these follow - on examinations are completed on time . in addition to assessing the status of financial institution year 2000 readiness , frs has issued guidance to assist in other critical year 2000 tasks . for example , in may 1998 , frs issued guidance in conjunction with ffiec on contingency planning . this guidance was modeled on our business continuity and contingency planning guide , which provides a conceptual framework for helping large agencies manage the risk of potential year 2000-induced disruptions to their operations . the frs guidance emphasized that management and directors should place a high priority on developing , validating , and implementing an institution's year 2000 contingency plan and take into account the impact of external systems belonging to other financial institutions , service providers , customers , and suppliers of power and telecommunications .
