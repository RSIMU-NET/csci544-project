not applicable . ii. ) in fiscal year 1995 , when crada activity peaked , sandia had 254 active cradas — 40 percent of all nnsa cradas . sandia participated in 153 cradas ( 44 percent of all cradas ) in fiscal year 2000 and 120 cradas ( about 50 percent of all cradas ) in the first half of fiscal year 2001 . the number of cradas at lawrence livermore national laboratory has dropped even more — from 159 in fiscal year 1995 to 26 in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2001 . lawrence livermore has shifted its emphasis from using cradas with private partners to using procurement contracts with its contractors to develop new technologies important for its mission , according to laboratory officials . figure 1 shows funding sources for cradas at nnsa laboratories and production facilities for fiscal years 1991 through 2000 . as figure 1 and table 1 show , crada expenditures at nnsa's laboratories and production facilities peaked in fiscal year 1995 . in that year , doe contributed $222 million , including $205 million in technology partnership program funding , and private partners contributed $167 million in direct and in - kind support for crada activities . as doe's dedicated funding for technology partnerships declined , the proportion of private partners' direct and in - kind contributions increased and has constituted more than half of all crada funding since fiscal year 1997 . in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2001 , doe contributed $19 million and private partners contributed $61 million in direct and in - kind support for crada activities . ( see table 6 in app . ii for crada funding at individual nnsa facilities. ) table 2 shows the extent to which nnsa's laboratories and production facilities used the other primary types of technology development partnerships . generally , partnerships that relied on doe funds have decreased , while those predominantly funded by businesses have grown . for example , technical assistance for small businesses , which was primarily funded by doe's technology partnership program , dropped sharply — from about 1,700 actions that assisted small businesses in fiscal year 1995 to about 500 in fiscal year 2000 . in contrast , work - for - other agreements , which are wholly funded by businesses , grew substantially from 209 agreements in fiscal year 1995 to 987 agreements in fiscal year 2000 . similarly , technology licensing agreements have greatly increased during this period . ( see tables 7 , 8 , and 9 in app . ii for each nnsa facility's participation in each of these partnerships. ) user facility agreements , which provide access to unique nnsa experimental research equipment and facilities , increased from 103 in fiscal year 1995 to 165 in fiscal year 1998 and then decreased to 96 agreements in fiscal year 2000 . businesses have provided more direct funding for work - for - other agreements than for any of the other types of partnerships . ( see table 10 in app . ii. ) nnsa officials and laboratory managers identified various advantages and disadvantages of collaborative research under a crada . ( see table 3. ) an advantage of collaborative research under a crada is often accompanied by a disadvantage .
