( see table 3. ) during fiscal year 2003 , dod took an average of more than 1 year from the time dss received a personnel security questionnaire to the time it issued an eligibility determination . from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2003 , the number of days to determine clearance eligibility for clean cases increased from 301 days to 332 days , whereas the time increased for issue cases from 516 days to 615 days . backlogs and delays can have adverse effects — delays in renewing security clearances for industry personnel and others who are doing classified work can lead to a heightened risk of national security breaches . in a 1999 report , the joint security commission ii pointed out that delays in initiating reinvestigations create risks to national security because the longer the individuals hold clearances , the more likely they are to be working with critical information and systems . in addition , delays in determining security clearance eligibility for industry personnel can affect the timeliness , quality , and cost of contractor performance on defense contracts . according to a 2003 information security oversight office report , industrial contractor officials who were interviewed said that delays in obtaining clearances cost industry millions of dollars per year and affect personnel resources . the report also stated that delays in the clearance process hampered industrial contractors' ability to perform duties required by their contracts and increased the amount of time needed to complete national - security - related contracts . industrial contractors told us about cases in which their company hired competent applicants who already had the necessary security clearances , rather than individuals who were more experienced or qualified but did not have a clearance . industry association representatives told us that defense contractors might offer monetary incentives to attract new employees with clearances — for example , a $15,000 to $20,000 signing bonus for individuals with a valid security clearance , and a $10,000 bonus to current employees who recruit a new employee with a clearance . in addition , defense contractors may hire new employees and begin paying them , but not be able to assign any work to them — sometimes for a year or more — until they obtain a clearance . contractors may also incur lost - opportunity costs if prospective employees decide to work elsewhere rather than wait to get a clearance .
