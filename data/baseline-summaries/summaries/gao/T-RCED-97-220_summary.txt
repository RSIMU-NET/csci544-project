this concludes my statement . i would be pleased to respond to any questions you or the members of the committee may have . results act: observations on the national science foundation's draft strategic plan ( gao / rced - 97-203r , july 11 , 1997 ) . results act: observations on the department of energy's draft strategic plan ( gao / rced - 97-199r , july 11 , 1997 ) . the results act: observations on commerce's june 1997 draft strategic plan ( gao / ggd - 97-152r , july 14 , 1997 ) . results act: observations on nasa's may 1997 draft strategic plan ( gao / nsiad - 97-205r , july 22 , 1997 ) . results act: observations on environmental protection agency's draft strategic plan ( gao / rced - 97-209r , july 30 , 1997 ) . results act: observations on the department of transportation's draft strategic plan ( gao / rced - 97-208r , july 30 , 1997 ) . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . another example of potential overlap is in science education . energy's draft strategic plan states that it will use its laboratories and the nation's universities to contribute to the nation's science and mathematics education . similarly , nsf's authorizing legislation directs it to initiate and support science and engineering education programs at all levels and in all fields of science and engineering . environmental quality is another area of potential overlap . while there are linkages among themes , goals , objectives , and responsible components , the goals and objectives are not as results - oriented as they could be . for example , the goal to support restructuring export controls for the 21st century could be made more results - oriented by identifying the purpose of the restructuring . moreover , the draft plan does not explicitly discuss the program evaluations used to establish general goals and objectives and has no schedule for future program evaluations . commerce's draft plan also does not identify crosscutting programs and activities or whether such shared responsibilities were coordinated in the development of the draft plan .
