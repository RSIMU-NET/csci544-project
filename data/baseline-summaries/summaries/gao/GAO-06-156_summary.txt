( see fig . the motor carrier industry comprises approximately 677,000 interstate carriers operating some 7.9 million large trucks and employing several million drivers . carriers frequently enter and exit the industry ; in 2004 , the industry had a net gain of approximately 31,000 interstate carriers . there are more fatalities each year resulting from passenger vehicle crashes than from truck crashes ; however , the likelihood that a fatality will occur is greater for crashes that involve large trucks . in 2004 , 5,190 fatalities resulted from large truck crashes while 38,531 fatalities resulted from passenger vehicle crashes ( based on preliminary data ) . although large trucks are involved in 4 percent of all accidents , they contribute to 12 percent of the fatalities . as a result , fatality rates — the number of fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled — involving truck crashes are consistently higher when compared to passenger - vehicle - only crashes . ( see fig . large - truck fatality rates have generally been falling since the mid - 1990s — from 2.76 in 1995 to 2.29 in 2004 ( based on preliminary data ) . although there has been a reduction in the fatality rate , the number of fatalities has increased in each of the last two years , reaching 5,190 in 2004 . according to fmcsa , truck crashes result in costs totaling more than $20 billion annually . this act was in response to a 1988 fmcsa - commissioned study that pointed to a higher rate of violations of safety regulations and higher crash rates among carriers that had recently entered the motor carrier industry . in fiscal year 2003 , the agency began implementing the new entrant audit program and conducted 7,000 audits . as fmcsa fully implemented the program in 2004 , this number increased to more than 25,000 . we determined that the data elements were sufficiently reliable for our purposes . we conducted our work from october 2004 to december 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . ( see app . i for additional information on our scope and methodology. ) for example , the agency has a program — geared toward new entrants to the industry — to encourage awareness of the federal motor carrier safety regulations . however , fmcsa officials told us that the agency is committed to applying strict enforcement to egregious offenders who demonstrate non - compliance with the regulations or unsafe driving practices . fmcsa has also made progress in assessing the effects of its enforcement programs on safety in terms of reducing crashes , injuries , and fatalities . this is because the industry has grown faster than has fmcsa's ability to conduct compliance reviews . ( see figs . in 1995 , fmcsa performed about 9,200 compliance reviews , reaching about 2.7 percent of the nation's estimated 350,000 carriers . in 1998 , when fmcsa conducted its lowest number of compliance reviews — about 6,400 — the industry had grown almost 40 percent to an estimated 480,000 carriers . as a result , fmcsa's compliance reviews covered only about 1.3 percent of the industry .
