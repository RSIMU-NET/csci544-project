previous vba projections have been mixed in their accuracy . for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 , vba's projections of rating - related claims receipts varied from an underprojection of about 11 percent to an overprojection of about 19 percent , as shown in table 1 . this funding included support for about 9,350 ftes . from fiscal year 1998 through 2003 , staffing levels for vba's compensation and pension programs increased significantly , particularly for staff who process compensation and pension claims at vba's 57 regional offices , as shown in figure 1 below . in fiscal year 1998 , vba had 6,770 compensation and pension ftes ; by fiscal year 2003 , employment had increased by about 38 percent to 9,352 ftes . compensation and pension fte levels rose by about 900 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 . staffing levels increased because vba hired hundreds of new rating specialists and vsrs in anticipation of a large number of future retirements . also , these additional staff helped vba respond to a sharp drop in the production of rating - related claims decisions in fiscal year 2001 . in fiscal year 2002 , these decisions rose from about 481,000 to about 797,000 , and to about 827,000 in fiscal year 2003 . in fiscal year 2003 , vba's 57 regional offices received about 735,000 rating - related claims from veterans and their families for disability benefits . this included about 167,000 original claims for compensation of service - connected disabilities ( injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated while on active military duty ) and about 434,000 reopened compensation claims . in addition , about 90,000 original and reopened claims were filed for pensions for wartime veterans who have low incomes and are permanently and totally disabled for reasons not service - connected and for their survivors . in addition , vba received about 28,000 original claims for dependency and indemnity compensation by deceased veterans' spouses , children , and parents and to survivors of service members who died on active duty . vba officials stated that productivity improvements , workload changes , and attrition of experienced claims processing staff are considered throughout the annual budget process . however , vba's budget justification did not clearly explain how these factors affected its request . early in this process , the compensation and pension service makes a budget request that is reviewed by vba's office of resource management , under the direction of vba's chief financial officer and becomes part of vba's total request . vba's request eventually becomes part of va's overall budget request , which is submitted to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for review . vba's fiscal year 2005 budget justification identified a number of initiatives and projections that could affect its staffing levels . for example , implementing specialized claims processing teams in vba's regional offices and consolidating pension maintenance work at three regional offices could affect staffing levels . also , vba projected it would receive more disability compensation claims than in previous years , based on such factors as the enactment of concurrent receipt legislation in 2003 .
