subcontracting achievement . in fiscal year 2017 , 15 of 24 agencies met their subcontracting goals compared to 16 of 24 in the prior year . however , among the small business subcategories , more agencies met at least three subcategory goals in 2017 ( 14 agencies ) than in fiscal year 2016 ( 10 agencies ) ( see table 4 ) . peer review evaluations element . the fiscal year 2017 government - wide score for the peer review of section 15 ( k ) compliance ( a score of 19.25 out of a maximum 20.00 ) was nearly identical to the government - wide score for fiscal year 2016 , once we adjusted for changes in the scoring scale between the 2 years . the government - wide score in fiscal year 2016 was 9.60 out of 10 , which equates to 19.20 on a 20-point scale . number of small business prime contractors . the overall number of small business prime contractors declined between fiscal years 2016 and 2017 . the number of prime contractors overall decreased from 120,009 in fiscal year 2016 to 117,480 in fiscal year 2017 , a decrease of approximately 2 percent . however , the 24 agencies , in aggregate , had more small business prime contractors in three of the four small business subcategories in fiscal year 2017 than in the prior year ( see table 5 ) . comparison with prior scorecard weighting formula . we found that agencies' numerical scores for fiscal year 2017 were generally lower under the revised scorecard methodology than they would have been under the fiscal year 2016 methodology's weighting of scorecard elements . twenty - two of 24 agencies had a lower score than they would have had under the prior methodology's weighting . the revised methodology adjusted the weight of multiple scorecard elements , and there are a variety of reasons why an agency might have received a lower score than under the fiscal year 2016 methodology's weighting . however , reducing the weight for prime contracting achievement under the revised methodology could explain at least part of the lower score for 21 of the 22 agencies . the overall median score for fiscal year 2017 was about 7 points lower than it would have been under the weighting formula used in fiscal year 2016 . ( the median score for fiscal year 2017 scorecards was 111 and would have been 118 under the prior methodology's weighting formula. ) in june 2018 , sba officials told us they were not preparing a plan for evaluating the effects of scorecard revisions because they thought such a plan would be premature . at that time , sba officials said they had identified some aspects of the revised methodology for further review , including two issues related to the peer review evaluations â€” the peer review scoring scale and whether agencies believed sba's requests for supporting information were reasonable . in july 2018 , however , sba officials said that , in response to our preliminary findings , they had begun to develop a plan for evaluating the revised scorecard methodology's effects , if any , on meeting the government - wide procurement goals .
