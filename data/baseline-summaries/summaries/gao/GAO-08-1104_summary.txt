aggregate funding method . this method , as used by the judicial survivors' annuities system ( jsas ) plan , defines the normal cost rate as the level percentage of future salaries that will be sufficient , along with investment earnings and the plan's assets , to pay the plan's benefits for current participants and beneficiaries . the following discussion is intended to illustrate the use of the aggregate funding method . for plan year 2007 , the jsas's actuary estimated the present value of future benefits for participating judges and beneficiaries was $649,628,473 and the jsas had assets amounting to $491,788,627 . the difference between these amounts , $157,839,846 , must be financed through future contributions to be paid by the participating judges and the federal government . using the same assumptions as used to estimate the present value of future benefits , the actuary estimated the present value of participating judges' future salaries to be $3,078,464,410 so that the amount to be financed represented 5.13% ( $157,839,846 divided by $3,078,464,410 ) of the future participating judges' salaries . this percentage is the jsas's normal cost rate . if all the actuarial assumptions proved exactly correct , then a total contribution of 5.13% of the participating judges' salaries annually would make up the difference between the jsas's future payments and its assets ( the $157,839,846 mentioned above ) . the jsas's actuary also estimated the present value of participating judges' future contributions to be $78,123,909 . thus the federal government's share for plan year 2007 is the difference between $157,839,846 and $78,123,909 , or $79,715,937 . federal government's actuarially recommended contribution rate . the federal government's actuarially recommended contribution rate is equal to the federal government's share of future financing ( $79,715,937 ) divided by the present value of the participating judges' future salaries ( $3,078,464,410 ) . for the plan year 2007 the rate was 2.59% ( $79,715,937 divided by $3,078,464,410 ) . thus , the actuarially recommended federal contribution is the product of the federal government's actuarially recommended contribution rate and the participating judges' salaries . the federal government's contribution is approved through an annual appropriation . it has varied , both above and below the actuarially recommended amount . lump sum payout . under jsas , a lump sum payout may occur upon the dissolution of marriage either through divorce or death of spouse . payroll contributions cease , but previous contributions remain in jsas . also , if there is no eligible surviving spouse or child upon the death of a participating judge , the lump sum payout to the judge's designated beneficiaries is computed as follows: lump sum payout equals the total amount paid into the plan by the judge plus 3 percent annual interest accrued , less 2.2 percent of salaries for each participating year ( forfeited amount ) . this is our fifth report since the passage of the 1992 act . our objectives were to determine whether participating judges' contributions for the 3 plan years ending on september 30 , 2007 , funded at least 50 percent of the jsas costs and , if not , what adjustments in the contribution rates would be needed to achieve the 50 percent ratio .
