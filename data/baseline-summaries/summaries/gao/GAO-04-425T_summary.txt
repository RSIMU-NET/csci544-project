gao - 03-815t . washington , d.c.: may 22 , 2003 . ( see fig . over the past two decades the provision of long - term care has been shifting away from institutions and nursing homes towards more noninstitutional long - term care services in va and in other programs . in recognition of this change in approach to how long - term care is provided , the federal advisory committee on the future of va long - term care recommended , in 1998 , that va update its long - term care policy by meeting the growing demand for long - term care through significant expansion of its capacity to provide home and community - based services — also known as noninstitutional long - term care services — while maintaining its nursing home capacity at the 1998 level . va provides a continuum of noninstitutional long - term care services to provide care to veterans needing assistance . the continuing rapid rise in the veteran population likely to be in greatest need of long - term care — - those 85 years and older — - poses a major challenge for va health care . answers to these four questions can help policymakers , va , and its stakeholders better understand the best ways to meet va's long - term care challenge . we look forward to continuing to work with you on these significant issues . mr. chairman , this concludes my prepared remarks . i will be pleased to answer any questions you or other members of the committee may have . for further information regarding this testimony , please contact me at ( 202 ) 512-7101 . individuals making key contributions to this testimony include james c. musselwhite , thomas a. walke , and pamela a. dooley . va long - term care: veterans' access to noninstitutional care is limited by service gaps and facility restrictions . va long - term care: service gaps and facility restrictions limit veterans' access to noninstitutional care . gao - 03-487 . washington , d.c.: may 9 , 2003 . department of veterans affairs: key management challenges in health and disability programs . gao - 03-756t . washington , d.c.: may 8 , 2003 . long - term care: availability of medicaid home and community services for elderly individuals varies considerably . gao - 02-1121 . washington , d.c.: september 26 , 2002 . medicare: utilization of home health care by state . gao - 02-782r . washington , d.c.: may 23 , 2002 . va long - term care: the availability of noninstitutional services is uneven . gao - 02-652t . washington , d.c.: april 25 , 2002 . va long - term care: implementation of certain millennium act provisions is incomplete , and availability of noninstitutional services is uneven . gao - 02-510r . washington , d.c.: march 29 , 2002 . va long - term care: oversight of community nursing homes needs strengthening . gao - 01-768 . washington , d.c.: july 27 , 2001 . this is a work of the u.s. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states . it may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao .
