employee concerns . in the fpac business center , officials from one union representing employees told us that confusion among employees about their roles and responsibilities could affect both internal employee satisfaction and the overall ability of the business center to serve the fpac mission and its customers . specifically , these union officials noted employees' confusion about how to reconcile differences among the work procedures that each of the three fpac agencies used before the reorganization . officials from this and one other union also stated that employees have reported that business center leadership has not taken action to address such employee concerns . as a result , according to officials from both unions , fpac business center employees are experiencing low morale , confusion , frustration , and anxiety about the changes , affecting their ability to deliver services . in response , fpac officials told us in november 2019 that the fpac business center is working on empowering employees , hiring , establishing a culture of accountability , building trust and engagement , and addressing other issues that have arisen in the business center's first year of operation . for example , these officials said they were reviewing the business center's organizational structure to determine whether there is a need for adjustments to further streamline operations and improve service . usda officials cited several reasons the department has not assessed the effect of the business center reform effort undertaken in response to the secretary's november 2017 memorandum . natural resources and environment . officials in the natural resources and environment mission area said that unlike other administrative services , which are grouped under the business center , financial management responsibilities are divided between the business center's office of strategic planning , budget , and accountability and the forest service's office of the chief financial officer . according to these officials , this arrangement strengthens internal controls by separating responsibility for allocating and spending financial resources from responsibility for accounting for how the resources are spent . one business center — in the trade and foreign agricultural affairs mission area — provides information technology and financial management services for foreign agricultural service employees and has agreements in place with other usda components to provide human resources , procurement , and property management services for the mission area . according to the deputy assistant secretary for administration , usda accepted these mission areas' decisions about financial management because they ensured accountability of field - level staff to the administrative service's headquarters leadership . according to usda's deputy assistant secretary for administration , the department regularly reviews data on administrative services , including services provided by the business centers . however , the department does not use these or other data to assess the effectiveness and impact of its business centers and as of november 2019 did not plan to do so . beginning in 2018 , usda created an online monitoring system to compile data from mission areas on the status of their administrative services . the system has “dashboards” displaying data specific to financial management , human resources , information technology , procurement , and property management , among other things . each of the dashboards presents metrics gathered from various databases across mission areas .
