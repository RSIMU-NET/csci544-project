modify interfaces . validation — test , verify , and validate converted or replaced platforms , applications , databases , and utilities . test the performance , functionality , and integration of converted or replaced platforms , applications , databases , utilities , and interfaces in an operational environment . implementation — implement converted or replaced platforms , applications , databases , utilities , and interfaces . implement data exchange contingency plans , if necessary . in addition to following the five phases described , the year 2000 program should also be planned and managed as a single large information system development effort . agencies should promulgate and enforce good management practices on the program and project levels . according to dfas officials , they have been working on the year 2000 issue since 1991 , although the year 2000 program did not officially begin until march 1996 . as of april 1997 , dfas was tracking 216 systems for year 2000 purposes: 71 of the 216 were to be renovated to become year 2000 compliant , 79 were expected to be replaced by migration or interim migration systems , and 66 were designated by dfas as already compliant.of the 71 systems dfas expects to make compliant through renovation , 32 were reported as being in the assessment phase , 36 were in the renovation phase , one was in the implementation phase , and two systems did not show a phase . dfas has estimated that it will cost $33.7 million to renovate its systems , which contain about 63 million lines of code , to meet year 2000 requirements . dfas has taken a number of positive steps to ensure that its personnel are fully aware of the impact should dfas finance and accounting systems not be compliant at the turn of the century . during the awareness phase , dfas developed a year 2000 strategy that adopts the five - phased approach of awareness , assessment , renovation , validation , and implementation . the strategy , which is embedded in dfas' written executive plan , establishes accountability for year 2000 systems compliance from dfas headquarters management to individual system / program managers at the center level . the deputy director for information management , who serves as the dfas chief information officer ( cio ) , is responsible for managing the year 2000 program , and overseeing efforts to ensure that all dfas systems are year 2000 compliant by december 31 , 1998 , and within existing funding . as of april 1997 , dfas had taken the following actions as part of its efforts to address the year 2000 problem: established a year 2000 systems inventory , prepared cost estimates for systems to be renovated , instituted a quarterly year 2000 status reporting process , appointed a project manager to provide year 2000 guidance and track year established a year 2000 certification program that defines the conditions that must be met for automated systems to be considered as year 2000 compliant . dfas has also performed and documented an analysis of personal computers and workstations , which covered the year 2000 hardware problems , test procedures and results , and corrective actions .
