( see fig . according to faa , while physically in different locations , the facilities are united in their purpose and will eventually be integrated to share capabilities and information . while sharing a common purpose , each facility offers different testing capabilities and brings together different participants from different communities , as follows:  the florida test bed is located in a private facility at which companies , including lockheed martin and boeing , come together with academia and faa to test technologies that fit into the nextgen vision . private participants contribute financially to research and demonstration projects and collaborate to test concepts and technologies . these activities are guided by memorandums of understanding among all the participants . embry - riddle is currently working on a model agreement to govern the contributions of its private partners that will help delineate which components ( hardware , software , and infrastructure ) will be provided by the government and which by private participants . the model is meant to provide a cost - sharing method and also help engage participants and provide a means for them to have a vested interest in seeing the development of the technology all the way through to implementation . currently , faa pays the operating costs of the florida test bed while embry - riddle and participating companies contribute technology and technical staff . private participants may invest directly in software or hardware support . the facility — which has just undergone an expansion — provides access to the systems currently used in the nas and to some of the major navigation , surveillance , communications , and weather information programs that are under development . it also has a dedicated area to support demonstrations and a separate space for the participating companies to test integration — where a greater contribution from the private sector is envisioned .  the texas test bed is a collaborative effort between nasa and faa built on the grounds of faa's fort worth air route traffic control center . it supports nextgen research through field evaluations , shadow testing , the evaluation of simulations , and data collection and analysis . the researchers at the facility have agreements to receive data feeds from the airlines operating at the dallas - fort worth airport , as well as various data feeds from airport and air traffic control facilities .  the new jersey test bed , located at faa's national scientific test base , conducts research and development for new nextgen systems . in june 2010 , this facility opened the nextgen integration and evaluation capability area where scientists use real - time simulation to explore , integrate , and evaluate nextgen concepts , such as area navigation , trajectory - based operations , and unmanned aircraft system operations in the nas . in addition , in 2008 , faa entered into a lease to build the next generation research and technology park ( the park ) adjacent to the new jersey test bed . the park is a partnership intended to engage industry in a broad spectrum of research projects , with access to state - of - the - art federal laboratories .
