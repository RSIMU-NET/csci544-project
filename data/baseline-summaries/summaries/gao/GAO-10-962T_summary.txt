gao - 10-794 . washington , d.c.: july 28 , 2010 . defense management: u.s. southern command demonstrates interagency collaboration , but its haiti disaster response revealed challenges conducting a large military operation . gao - 10-801 . washington , d.c.: july 28 , 2010 . difficulties with leveraging interagency personnel are not unique to africom . we have previously reported that personnel systems often do not recognize or reward interagency collaboration , which could diminish interest in serving in interagency efforts . africom officials said that it would be helpful to have additional interagency personnel at the command , but they understand that staffing limitations , resource imbalances , and lack of career progression incentives for embedded staff from other federal agencies may limit the number of personnel who can be brought in from these agencies . despite challenges , africom has made some efforts that could improve interagency collaboration within the command , such as expanding its interagency orientation process . last fall , the command conducted an assessment of the embedded interagency process to analyze successes and identify lessons learned , including recommendations on how to integrate interagency personnel into command planning and operations . in july 2010 , africom stated that it had established an interagency collaborative forum to assess , prioritize , and implement the recommendations from the assessment . southcom's recent experience in responding to the haiti earthquake serves as a reminder that while interagency collaboration is important in addressing security challenges , dod's commands must also be prepared to respond to a wide range of contingencies , including large - scale disaster relief operations . gao - 10-504 . washington , d.c.: april 15 , 2010 . homeland defense: dod needs to take actions to enhance interagency coordination for its homeland defense and civil support missions . gao - 10-364 . washington , d.c.: march 30 , 2010 . interagency collaboration: key issues for congressional oversight of national security strategies , organizations , workforce , and information sharing . gao - 09-904sp . washington , d.c.: september 25 , 2009 . military training: dod needs a strategic plan and better inventory and requirements data to guide development of language skills and regional proficiency . gao - 09-568 . washington , d.c.: june 19 , 2009 . influenza pandemic: continued focus on the nation's planning and preparedness efforts remains essential . gao - 09-760t . washington , d.c.: june 3 , 2009 . u.s. public diplomacy: key issues for congressional oversight . gao - 09-679sp . washington , d.c.: may 27 , 2009 . military operations: actions needed to improve oversight and interagency coordination for the commander's emergency response program in afghanistan . gao - 09-615 . washington , d.c.: may 18 , 2009 . foreign aid reform: comprehensive strategy , interagency coordination , and operational improvements would bolster current efforts . gao - 09-192 . washington , d.c.: april 17 , 2009 . iraq and afghanistan: security , economic , and governance challenges to rebuilding efforts should be addressed in u.s. strategies . gao - 09-476t . washington , d.c.: march 25 , 2009 . drug control: better coordination with the department of homeland security and an updated accountability framework can further enhance dea's efforts to meet post - 9 / 11 responsibilities .
