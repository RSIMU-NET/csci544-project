superintendent of documents policy no . 38 , dated may 28 , 1984 , provides that publication inventories are to be reviewed quarterly to determine the quantities that are to be retained and those that are excess . this policy applies to inventories that are managed by headquarters staff . a separate procedure ( superintendent of documents policy no . 38.6 ) applies to inventories in gpo's bookstores . under the existing policies and procedures , inventory management specialists ( ims ) in the documents control branch are to review quarterly the amount of inventory for the publications they manage . this review is conducted to identify whether the inventory should be reduced based on the sales history and projected life cycle of the publication . as part of the superintendent of documents' existing policy , which was issued by the current public printer when he was the superintendent of documents , once an ims determines the number ( if any ) of copies of a publication that are excess , he or she is to call the issuing agency to determine whether it wants the extra copies . as part of the inventory review process for publications of high dollar value or with a large number of copies on hand , the ims then is to complete form 3880 , which includes such information as the estimated printing and binding cost of the publication , anticipated sales , total copies sold , and whether the issuing agency wants any of the excess copies . ( the form does not include the holding cost of retaining the copies in inventory. ) this completed form is to be sent to a documents survey board consisting of the director of documents sales service , the chief of the sales management division , and the chief of the documents control branch . if the survey board approves the form , the ims then must prepare a notice to be sent to gpo's warehouse in laurel , maryland . at the warehouse , the excessed stock ( i.e. , stock not wanted by the issuing agency ) is to be identified and moved to a separate area for periodic pick up by a contractor , who is required by the contract to shred the documents and have them recycled . the contractor is not permitted to resell the documents other than for recycling . during the major reduction in september 1996 , the superintendent of documents' staff followed his orders and disregarded policy and normal procedures in order to reduce the inventory of excess publications before october 1 , 1996 . when the superintendent of documents realized that the sales program expected a substantial loss , he told his staff in a june 1996 memorandum that , while developing an action plan to increase revenue and reduce expenses , they should: “ignore politics and external influences . disregard current policies and practices that inhibit creativity and impede change.” according to the superintendent of documents , his instruction to ignore politics and external influences referred to frequent requests from issuing agencies to have more copies of publications in the sales inventory than gpo believes can be sold .
