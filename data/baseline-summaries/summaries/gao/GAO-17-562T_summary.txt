, partially or not addressed ) . we estimate that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be realized should congress and executive branch agencies fully address open actions . contact points for the individual areas listed in our 2017 annual report can be found at the end of each area in gao - 17-491sp . contact points for our congressional relations and public affairs offices may be found on the last page of this statement . in our 2011 to 2017 annual reports , we directed 97 actions to congress , of which 61 remain open . of the 61 open congressional actions , 9 are partially addressed and 52 are not addressed , as of march 1 , 2017 . table 4 highlights examples of these results . congress has also implemented a number of key government - wide statutory requirements in recent years that could help identify areas of fragmentation , overlap , or duplication , or help address issues we raise in this report , including the following: the program management improvement accountability act . the act seeks to improve program and project management in certain federal agencies . among other things , the act requires the deputy director of the office of management and budget ( omb ) to adopt and oversee implementation of government - wide standards , policies , and guidelines for program and project management in executive agencies . it further creates a program management policy council to act as an interagency forum for improving practices related to program and project management . this interagency collaboration and strengthened program management could help reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication among federal agencies . as shown in figure 4 , 10 agencies have at least 20 open actions . in our 2011 to 2017 reports , we directed 168 actions to the department of defense ( dod ) in areas that contribute to dod's effectiveness in providing the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of the united states . as of march 2017 , 95 of these 168 actions remained open . dod represented about 15 percent of federal spending in fiscal year 2016 , with outlays totaling about $637.6 billion . our work suggests that effectively implementing our open actions , including those related to areas listed in table 6 , could yield substantial financial benefits . in our 2011 to 2017 reports , we directed 98 actions to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) in areas that contribute to hhs's mission to enhance the health and well - being of americans . hhs administers medicare , which in fiscal year 2016 financed health services for over 57 million beneficiaries at an estimated cost of $696 billion . hhs also administers medicaid , which covered an estimated 72.2 million low - income people in fiscal year 2016 at a cost of $575.9 billion . hhs represents about 28 percent of the fiscal year 2016 federal budget , with outlays totaling about $1.2 trillion . as of march 2017 , 56 of hhs's 98 actions remained open . our work suggests that effectively implementing these actions , such as those related to areas listed in table 7 , could yield substantial financial benefits .
