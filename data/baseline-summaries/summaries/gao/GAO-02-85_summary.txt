( see fig . bls estimates that there will be 31.8 million older labor force participants in 2015 , an average annual increase of 4.0 percent from 2000 . however , this rapid growth is expected to level off by the mid - 2020s . bls estimates that 33.3 million older persons will be in the labor force in 2025 , an average annual increase of only 0.5 percent from 2015 . this expected increase is a result of the aging of the baby boom generation and a general trend in greater labor force participation among older persons . the oldest baby boomers are currently 55 years old , and the youngest will turn 55 in 2019 . the percentage of older persons who participate in the labor force has been growing , especially among females age 55-64 , a trend that is expected to continue . ( see fig . currently , 30 percent of all persons 55 and older participate in the labor force , a number that is expected to grow to 37 percent by 2015 , according to projections by bls . this increase in labor force participation among older workers is primarily driven by the growth in the number of older women and their labor force participation rates . labor force participation rates of women between the ages of 55 and 64 have been steadily increasing from 42 percent in the mid - 1980s to 52 percent in 2000 . a further increase in the participation rate to 61 percent is expected to occur by 2015 , according to bls . the labor force participation rate of women age 65 and older is currently 9 percent . this is up from the low point of slightly more than 7 percent in the mid - 1980s but is lower than the 10 percent levels of the 1950s . bls projects the growth in the participation rate in this age group to grow to 10 percent by 2015 . the labor force participation rates of males over age 55 have been stable for several years and are projected to increase in the future . older male labor force participation hit a low point in the mid - 1990s that was part of a downward trend that had been occurring for several decades . since then , the labor force participation rates of males between the ages of 55 and 64 have held steady at approximately 67 percent ; bls projects an increase to 69 percent in 2015 . labor force participation rates of males 65 and older also held steady at about 17 percent during the 1990s and are projected to rise to nearly 20 percent by 2015 . as the number of older workers grows , older workers will also become a larger percentage of all workers . in 1950 and 1960 , older workers comprised 17 percent and 18 percent of the labor force , respectively . ( see fig . as the relatively large baby boom generation entered the workforce between 1960 and 1990 , the proportion of older workers fell to 12 percent of the total as the number of workers under age 55 swelled .
