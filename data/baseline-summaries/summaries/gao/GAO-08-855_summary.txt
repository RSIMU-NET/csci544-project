most of the agencies had 1 or 2 such individuals . therefore , we did not include any additional agencies in our review . to identify the number of senior - level federal officials who registered as foreign agents after leaving government service between calendar years 2000 and 2007 , we obtained a list from justice , which contained 4,113 names , of all individuals registered as foreign agents during those years . we provided these names to the office of personnel management ( opm ) to match against all executive branch senior federal employees in its central personnel data file ( cpdf ) . as computerized name matching can be difficult because of inconsistent use or spelling of titles , first names , middle names and initials , hyphenated names , and suffixes between different data sets , we asked opm to make their initial match as broad as possible , so that we could manually check a broad range of potential or near matches . house and senate advocacy , including member and senator meetings . executive branch monitoring , liaison , and advocacy . u.s. policy consultant worked with members of the sonora state government to develop and implement a plan to improve exchange of information and coordination between the state of sonora and u.s. government agencies in an effort to eliminate organized criminal activities and terrorists along the border . this assistance included arranging meetings with key members of the u.s. government ; assisted in preparation and plans ; prepared briefings and documents ; and attended meetings between sonora government officials and u.s. officials . educated members of the u.s. congress and other audiences regarding the free trade agreement and plan colombia . opm provided us with a list of 183 individuals ( of the nearly 8,000 senior employees who left government service between 2000 and 2007 ) containing both exact and near matches . in addition , we received descriptive information on each of the 183 individuals , including date of birth , year of departure from federal service , and former federal agency . we manually reviewed the 183 names and eliminated 139 of them that clearly were not matches , for example , ones where the last name was spelt differently , or the first name was completely different . this procedure narrowed the list to 44 individuals . finally , we obtained the registration statements for all 44 individuals from the fara registration unit and matched birth dates . from this process , we identified 29 former senior federal officials that registered as foreign agents between calendar years 2000 and 2007 . in addition , we compared the dates the former senior level officials had registered with fara against the dates on which they had officially separated from the federal government , and identified those officials whose registrations occurred less than 1 year after their separations . the scope of our review did not include assessing compliance with the post - government employment restrictions by any of the former 29 former senior federal level employees who registered as foreign agents .
