the reclassifications were completed in january 2005 . then , in 2009 and 2010 , dcaa found over $185 million in unallowable costs that are pending negotiations with dcma and settlement of contractor claims . in 2010 , dcaa auditors found the contractor did not comply with the cost accounting standard associated with insurance costs , which resulted in an estimated $1.6 million in costs that were misallocated . dcaa reported that the contractor did not respond to dcaa's finding because it had not completed its management review of the allocated costs . further , according to the auditors , dcaa's incurred cost audit reports could be delayed as the auditors coordinate the issuance of audit reports with various investigative agencies . dcaa auditors do not expect to complete the 2004 and 2005 incurred cost audits for this contractor before the end of fiscal year 2011 . in may 2011 , the contractor withdrew its 2006 through 2009 incurred cost proposals and stated that it plans to delay its submission of the 2010 incurred cost proposal until november 2011 .  for another major contractor , dcaa identified that the contractor's accounting practices were not compliant with cost accounting standards . dod has $316 million in obligations on over - age , cost - type iraq contracts awarded to this contractor with performance between 2004 and 2009 . dcaa reported in 2006 that the contractor's accounting practices did not sufficiently remove unallowable costs from a cost proposal , which dcaa auditors stated put additional onus on them to test whether the costs were allowable . in one case , dcaa auditors found the contractor had included over $500,000 in bonuses to senior executives in the incurred cost proposal , even though these costs are expressly unallowable under law . the contractor disagreed with dcaa's findings but agreed to remove these costs from its proposal . as of july 2011 , dcaa has completed 5 of the 18 incurred cost audits required to close the contracts .  dcaa identified deficient subcontract management systems , disputes over unallowable costs , and challenges with access to records as contributing to delays in completing incurred cost audits for another contractor . dod has $212 million in obligations on over - age , cost - type iraq contracts awarded to this contractor . in 2005 , 2006 , and 2009 , dcaa auditors reported significant deficiencies in the contractor's subcontract management system that resulted in potential unreasonable and unallowable costs being billed to the government , subcontracts being awarded noncompetitively , and inadequate price analysis . as a result , dcaa auditors had to audit the subcontractors' costs , even though doing so is generally the prime contractor's responsibility . the contractor generally disagreed with dcaa's findings but stated it would evaluate and revise its procedures where necessary to comply with dcaa's recommendations . in addition , in 2010 and 2011 , dcaa auditors reported the contractor had over $22.5 million in unallowable subcontract costs , some of which have been appealed by the contractor and some of which are being settled by dcma . finally , in 2010 , dcaa auditors repeatedly requested but were denied access to support for the 2006 incurred cost proposal , including a $2.3 million procurement file .
