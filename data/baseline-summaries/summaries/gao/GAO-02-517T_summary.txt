some of these recommendations were more than a decade old . ops has been working to improve its responsiveness over the last several years by initiating activities in response to the recommendations and improving communications with the safety board . the safety board has been encouraged by ops' efforts to improve its responsiveness , particularly in the areas of excavation damage , corrosion control , and data quality . however , the safety board remains concerned about the amount of time ops has been taking to implement recommendations . as of february 2002 , ops had not implemented 42 recommendations , several of which date from the late 1980s and deal with issues considered critical to pipeline safety , such as requiring operators to inspect their pipelines . ops maintains that its progress is better than the safety board indicates . according to ops officials , the majority of the recommendations deal with integrity management and excavation damage prevention , which the agency's ongoing initiatives should fulfill before the end of 2002 . we also reported in may 2000 that ops had not implemented 22 out of 49 statutory requirements that were designed to improve pipeline safety . similar to the open safety board recommendations , several of these unfulfilled requirements dated from the late 1980s and early 1990s and were related to important pipeline safety issues , such as internal inspections and identification of pipelines in populated or environmentally sensitive areas . since may 2000 , ops has been working to complete these requirements . as of february 2002 , 8 of the 22 requirements were closed as a result of ops' actions , 9 requirements were still open , and the remaining 5 were reclassified as “closed” because ops considered them to be superseded by amendments or other requirements or because the agency did not believe it was required to take further action . ops plans to fulfill the majority of the open requirements before the end of 2002 . in our ongoing work , we are examining several issues that could affect ops' ability to implement its integrity management and data improvement initiatives and , ultimately , fulfill the safety board's recommendations and statutory requirements . these issues include ( 1 ) performance measures for the integrity management approach , ( 2 ) sufficient resources and expertise to oversee operators' integrity management programs , ( 3 ) consistent and effective enforcement of integrity management program requirements , and ( 4 ) requirements for integrity management programs for operators of gas transmission pipelines . performance measures: in may 2000 , we reported that ops had not developed programwide performance measures for the risk management demonstration program , even though the act required such measures to demonstrate the safety benefits of the program . ops still has not developed such measures . despite the lack of quantifiable performance measures for the demonstration program , ops moved forward with integrity management programs and faces the challenge of developing performance measures for this new approach to regulating pipeline safety . such measures are essential to determine whether the new approach is successful and what improvements may be needed .
