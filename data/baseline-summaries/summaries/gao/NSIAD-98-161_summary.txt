dod has submitted its plan . our analysis of data obtained from the defense manpower data center ( dmdc ) indicates that dod is still on schedule to achieve acquisition workforce reductions of 25 percent by the end of fiscal year 2000 . dod reduced its acquisition workforce 15.8 percent ( or 59,974 ) during fiscal years 1996 and 1997 . this reduction is nearly two - thirds of the reduction of 95,153 personnel that dod must achieve to meet its 25 percent , 5-year target . despite these reductions , potential savings cannot be directly tracked in dod budget accounts . in addition , some of the potential savings dod anticipates it will achieve through these reductions may be offset by other costs . our analysis of data obtained from dmdc indicates that during fiscal years 1996 and 1997 , dod reduced its acquisition workforce at a significantly higher rate than it reduced its overall workforce . at the end of fiscal year 1995 , dod employed 380,615 persons in its acquisition organizations . at the end of fiscal year 1997 , the total number of personnel employed dropped to 320,641 â€” a reduction of 59,974 ( or 15.8 percent ) . since the 25-percent planned reduction by the end of fiscal year 2000 is 95,153 , dod achieved nearly two - thirds of the target during the 2-year period . table 1 provides an analysis of workforce reductions that have already taken place in each of the acquisition organizations . by contrast , at the end of fiscal years 1995 and 1997 , respectively , dod employed 2,319,401 and 2,158,927 persons overall . this overall reduction of 160,474 ( or 6.9 percent ) during the same period was less than one - half of that achieved in dod's acquisition workforce . while most of the reductions in the acquisition workforce have been achieved directly through personnel reductions , a significant portion was also attained by disestablishing the army information systems command and distributing the majority of its personnel into a nonacquisition organization ( i.e. , an organization outside the purview of dod instruction 5000.58 ) . dod's civilian acquisition workforce comprises nearly 40 percent of dod's overall civilian workforce and is paid primarily through operations and maintenance ( o&m ) and rdt&e funding . the congressional budget office estimates that the average annual salary and benefits of an acquisition worker is about $53,000 . using this average , the personnel reduction in acquisition organizations during fiscal years 1996 and 1997 represents a potential savings of approximately $3.2 billion . however , dod's accounting systems are unable to directly track workforce reductions in acquisition organizations to dod budget accounts . for example , although , since 1995 , the civilian payroll portion of dod's o&m budget has been reduced by approximately $3.6 billion ( roughly 9 percent ) , it is unclear how much of that decline is accounted for by acquisition workforce reductions . during the same period , the rdt&e account actually increased approximately $826 million ( more than 2 percent ) . it is also unclear how much of that increase is accounted for by acquisition workforce changes because dod's rdt&e account does not break out civilian payroll .
