this discussion is in appendix i of our report . in our view , the fact that some of these llrw management approaches have already been evaluated by nrc and doe does not lessen the need for their inclusion in a report to the congress . we revised the draft recommendation to more clearly reflect the need to evaluate and report on the usefulness of developing a national radioactive waste management plan and to conduct further analysis if deemed appropriate . our views on the potential usefulness of such a plan are provided on pages 37-38 of this report . we revised our second recommendation to clarify this point . the purpose of our report was to identify the extent to which other countries use approaches to address four areas of u.s. llrw management that we identified in previous reports as having some limitations . the nation's nuclear waste — proposals for organization and siting . gao / emd - 79-77 . washington , d.c.: june 21 , 1979 . need for greater regulatory oversight of commercial low - level radioactive waste . gao / emd - 78-101 , washington , d.c.: august 16 , 1978 . major unresolved issues preventing a timely resolution to radioactive waste disposal . gao / emd - 78-94 . washington , d.c.: july 13 , 1978 . nuclear energy's dilemma: disposing of hazardous radioactive waste safely . gao - 103414 . washington , d.c.: september 12 , 1977 . nuclear energy's dilemma: disposing of hazardous radioactive waste safely . gao / emd - 77-41 . washington , d.c.: september 9 , 1977 . institutional and jurisdictional issues in nuclear waste management . gao - 102168 . washington , d.c.: may 20 , 1977 . improvements needed in the land disposal of radioactive wastes — a problem of centuries . gao / red - 76-54 . washington , d.c.: january 12 , 1976 . border security: investigations successfully transported radioactive sources across our nation's borders at selected locations . gao - 06-545r . washington , d.c.: march 28 , 2006 . nuclear security: doe needs better information to guide its expanded recovery of sealed radiological sources . gao - 05-967 . washington , d.c.: september 22 , 2005 . nuclear security: federal and state action needed to improve security of sealed radioactive sources . gao - 03-804 . washington , d.c.: august 6 , 2003 . nuclear nonproliferation: u.s. and international assistance efforts to control sealed radioactive sources need strengthening . gao - 03-638 . washington , d.c.: may 16 , 2003 . nuclear nonproliferation: doe actions needed to ensure continued recovery of unwanted sealed radioactive sources . gao - 03-483 . washington , d.c.: april 15 , 2003 . we did not recommend adopting any of the approaches identified as in use on other countries , only to evaluate and report to the congress on their usefulness to improve management of this waste in the united states . in our view , assigning responsibility for waste disposal in the llrw policy act is not synonymous with establishing a national radioactive waste management plan . we revised our recommendation to clarify that nrc and doe need to evaluate and report on the usefulness of developing such a plan .
