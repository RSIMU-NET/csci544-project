regulation . in the information provided to the president , doe did not demonstrate that a defense hlw repository could be easier or quicker to demonstrate regulatory compliance , as doe reported , nor did it assess the potential effect on its analysis if the regulatory benefits could not be realized . the information doe provided to the president stated that regulatory compliance for a defense hlw repository would be simpler to demonstrate and could result in nrc licensing a defense hlw repository sooner than it might a single , commingled repository . doe acknowledged that for any repository , the regulations — first developed by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and nrc in the early 1980s to assess radiation containment requirements to protect future populations — need to be updated . doe's cost estimate , however , did not estimate the cost of major activities that would be required to develop its two proposed nuclear waste repositories . for example , doe's estimates did not include the following costs: site selection . this would likely require scientific investigation of several candidate locations , along with a lengthy consent - based siting process . doe's past experience with site selection indicates that site selection could cost billions of dollars . for example , a 2013 doe study estimated that site selection costs for a new repository will exceed $3 billion , based on the historical costs incurred by yucca mountain . notably , because doe now must site two repositories , the cost of selecting a site would apply twice — once for each of the two separate sites . site characterization . site characterization cost about $2.6 billion for wipp and about $8.5 billion for yucca mountain , according to doe officials . as with site selection , the costs of site characterization for two repositories would apply twice — once for each of the two separate sites . waste transportation . doe excluded the cost of packaging , shipping , and transporting the nuclear waste . in 2013 , doe had separately estimated these costs to be a total of about $20 billion . in response to our analysis , doe officials stated that doe was not required to provide the president with comprehensive estimates of life - cycle costs that met industry best practices , in part because of the early stage of their plan's development and because potential sites had not been selected , which could change repository costs . in response to our analysis , doe officials stated that they believed the development of their estimates were well - documented . doe officials said that departmental orders do not require the same level of analysis at this early stage that is required at later stages . we note , however , that even rough - order - of - magnitude estimates benefit from identification of potential sensitivities , and including them is an industry best practice . without analyzing how doe's assumptions or conditions may affect the results of its cost estimates , doe's estimates cannot be viewed as credible . according to omb guidance , poor cost estimates can undermine a program or create an unexecutable plan .
