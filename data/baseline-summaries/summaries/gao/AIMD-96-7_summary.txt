we will report later on these areas . we conducted our work primarily at navy and dfas headquarters in washington , d.c. , and at dfas , cleveland center . our work was performed from august 1993 through october 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . the following are examples of these problems . in 1989 , we reported to the secretary of the navy that the navy's consolidated financial reports for fiscal year 1986 were unreliable and understated assets by $58 billion.in 1994 , we reported a $163 billion discrepancy between the value of property , plant , and equipment that the navy reported for fiscal year 1993 and the amounts shown in the supporting information various navy commands submitted to dfas.in its fiscal year 1994 federal managers' financial integrity act ( fmfia ) ( public law 97-255 ) report to the secretary of defense , the navy reported that none of the 28 operating accounting systems it evaluated complied with appropriate accounting standards and related requirements . between 1989 and 1992 , a former military sealift command supply officer established a fictitious company , submitted over 100 bogus invoices , and received an estimated $3 million in fraudulent payments . with regard to internal control breakdowns over disbursements , over 2 years ago , we reported that the navy had a severe and persistent problem with unmatched disbursements , which , in december 1992 , amounted to about $13.6 billion . as of august 31 , 1995 , the navy's unmatched disbursements and other problem disbursements totaled $18.6 billion , by far the most of any dod component , with over 67 percent of the dod total , as shown in table 1 . particularly troubling , the navy continues to have difficulty in solving its problem disbursements . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . for example , from october 31 , 1994 , through june 30 , 1995 , the navy and dfas resolved about $7.6 billion in unmatched disbursements , which is significant . this reduction was , however , largely eclipsed by $6.7 billion in new unmatched disbursements . also , problems in keeping records on navy disbursements have distorted governmentwide financial reporting . dfas , cleveland center , incorrectly recorded billions of dollars of fiscal year 1995 navy disbursements to a nonbudgetary deposit fund account . according to department of the treasury officials , this error resulted in the treasury understating by at least $4 billion the federal government's overall budget deficit reported as of june 30 , 1995 . thus , maintaining accurate financial records and producing reliable financial information on the navy's operations is a meaningful process with relevance to and significant ramifications for the government as a whole . with respect to actual and potential violations of the anti - deficiency act , for fiscal years 1993 and 1994 , and through the first 10 months of fiscal year 1995 , the navy investigated 25 cases of potential anti - deficiency act violations involving about $166 million . of these , 18 cases have been closed with the following results .
