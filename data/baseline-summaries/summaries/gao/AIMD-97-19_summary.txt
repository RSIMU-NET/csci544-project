they concurred with the information presented . all land has been acquired for the arena site . however , the final cost for one of the parcels of land acquired will be determined by the outcome of legal proceedings . construction of the metrorail connection is about 25 percent complete as of october 18 , 1996 . all district employees have been relocated ; however , office improvements on the new space have not been completed . finally , the two old buildings have been demolished and relocating utilities and securing regulatory approvals are nearly complete as of october 18 , 1996 . the district is awaiting final bills for these activities . the district's project manager for the sports arena stated that based on the project's current status and known estimates for predevelopment costs , as of september 30 , 1996 , the district does not expect to exhaust the $5 million capital reserve fund established to cover cost overruns . we verified that no funds had been expended from the capital reserve fund . the changes to the predevelopment costs are highlighted in the following table . as of october 18 , 1996 , the total cost for the gallery place metrorail connection was estimated at about $19.4 million , a $2.4 million increase from our last report ; but the district's cost remains the same — $3 million . the majority ( $2 million ) of the increase reflects the cost of needed construction changes to the station because of the sports arena . for example , new vent shafts will be added in order to accommodate the construction of the sports arena . this increase was offset by the developer's contribution of $2 million to the cost of the metrorail connection . the other $360,000 increase reflects a decision by wmata to upgrade the station elevators from hydraulic elevators to traction elevators . the funding for this upgrade is being provided by wmata . as of october 18 , 1996 , the metrorail connection budget contained a $1.1 million reserve for contingencies ( as shown by note c to table 1 ) — a decrease of $400,000 since our last report . wmata officials stated that their maximum responsibility to the project is limited to their $2.4 million contribution . they also stated that they will not absorb any unanticipated costs . wmata officials stated that an example of unanticipated costs is the discovery of asbestos in sections of the duct work running through the station's mezzanine . included in the $4.3 million budget was an estimate of $1.4 million for overtime costs to meet the revised november 30 , 1995 , deadline to relocate bell atlantic utility lines . as of october 18 , 1996 , the budget for bell atlantic utility lines has been reduced from $4.3 million to $2.5 million or by $1.8 million ; while the amount of $300,000 for the relocation of the other utilities has remained the same . as of october 1996 , according to the district's project manager for the sports arena , 13 underground oil tanks and 4 water separators were removed from the site , along with 109,000 tons of contaminated soil and approximately 5,100 tons of hazardous soil .
