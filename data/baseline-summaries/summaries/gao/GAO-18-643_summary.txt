( see fig . local 689 employee contributions reported for fiscal year 2017 were about $22 million , which was about 17 percent of the $127.5 million reported for wmata's contribution to their pension plan for that year . in addition , according to wmata's fiscal year 2017 comprehensive annual financial report , non - represented and local 2 employees hired on or after january 1 , 1999 are not eligible for the defined benefit pension plan . wmata also reported that local 689 and local 2 employees hired on or after january 1 , 2010 , metro special police hired after february 25 , 2016 , and non - represented employees hired after january 1 , 2017 are not eligible for retiree health benefits . most recently , wmata created a trust to fund wmata's retiree health benefits and invested $3 million in the trust . wmata's pension plans , due to their relative size and maturity and investment decisions , pose a particular risk to wmata's financial operations: relative size and maturity: the size of wmata's pension plans and the overall maturity of the plans' participants pose a combined financial risk to wmata . wmata's pension plans assets and liabilities are large relative to its business operations . for example , in fiscal year 2017 , wmata's pension assets ( $3.6 billion ) were about 5 times more , and its pension liabilities ( $4.7 billion ) about 6.5 times more than its annual wages and salaries ( $728 million ) . because of their relative size , changes in the value of these assets or liabilities — for example , as a result of underperforming investments or revisions to actuarial assumptions — could significantly affect wmata's operations . in addition , wmata's pension plans are considered “mature” by actuarial measures , meaning , for example , that they have a high proportion of retirees compared to active members . a 2017 wmata board of directors pension subcommittee report indicated that if wmata's assumed rate of return across all five plans decreased from 7.66 percent to 7 percent , wmata's required annual pension contribution would increase $42 million , a 26 percent increase , from 22 percent of wages and salaries ( $160.7 million ) to about 28 percent of wages and salaries ( $203 million ) . investment decisions: wmata's pension plans assume higher rates of return than state and local pension plans generally do , according to a recent national association of state retirement administrators report . for the 2017 plan year , wmata's largest pension plan had an assumed rate of return of 7.85 percent per year , and the weighted average assumed rate of return for wmata's five plans combined was 7.66 percent . the average assumed rate of return among the largest state and local government plans was 7.52 percent in 2017 , and dropped to a planned 7.36 percent for fiscal year 2018 . if wmata's pension plan assets return significantly less than assumed , wmata's unfunded liabilities will be higher than anticipated , potentially resulting in a spike in required contributions , as occurred in the years following the 2007-2009 financial crisis ( see fig . wmata's pension plans are largely invested in the stock market , which also poses risk .
