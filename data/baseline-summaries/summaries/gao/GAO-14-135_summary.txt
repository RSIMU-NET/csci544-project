we obtained responses from 10 of them . the results of these interviews cannot be generalized to all sblf banks but provide insights to reasons for variation in lending . to describe trends in small business credit markets and how these trends may have affected a bank's ability to lend , we used a number of survey indicators to describe market conditions as of june 2013 and before the implementation of sblf . these indicators included data from a survey conducted by the national federation of independent business on whether members' borrowing needs are being satisfied ; a survey by wells fargo addressing banks' ease or difficulty in obtaining credit ; and data from the federal reserve senior loan officer opinion survey on the demand for credit across small firms and whether lending standards have tightened or eased . we also relied on the results report of treasury's first sblf annual survey . we also interviewed treasury officials responsible for the program and contacted representatives of the national federation of independent business , who regularly survey small businesses , and the american bankers association and independent community bankers association , who represent the interests of community banks . to determine the reliability of these data sources , we interviewed company representatives as appropriate to learn about their data collection methods and any changes to their controls . we also reviewed previous gao work and survey methodologies to determine if there were any changes made that would affect the data's reliability . based on our analysis we determined that , while the survey indicators were not independently critical to our findings , they were sufficiently reliable together to document patterns in the small business credit markets and how these may affect a bank's ability to lend . to determine the reliability of the treasury survey data we used , we interviewed treasury officials on their procedures for reviewing the survey responses , reviewed the nonresponse rate ( none ) , and checked for consistency . based on these steps , we determined that the data collected by treasury were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on credit standards to sblf banks . to determine actions treasury has taken to evaluate sblf participant lending patterns , we reviewed multiple treasury documents , including the sblf lending growth reports issued in october 2012 , and january , april , july , and october 2013 , the first sblf annual lending survey instrument , and the june 2013 results report for the first annual lending survey , as well as relevant supporting documentation of these reports . we also interviewed treasury officials to understand the agency's efforts to assess program performance of sblf . we also reviewed our 2011 and 2012 reports on sblf to document treasury's past efforts in assessing sblf performance . in addition , we reviewed gao guidance on program evaluation and past gao work on federal government performance management and compared treasury's actions to this guidance and work . further , we reviewed impact evaluations conducted by other federal agencies and gao to enhance our understanding and provide examples of impact analysis and statistical techniques . we conducted this performance audit from march 2013 to december 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
