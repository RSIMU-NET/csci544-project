this report contains recommendations to you . 720 , the head of a federal agency is required to submit a written statement of the actions taken on our recommendations to the senate committee on governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform not later than 60 days after the date of the report . one of these plans addresses military personnel priorities . the other plan addresses quality of life issues affecting service members and their families . according to dod officials , the plans are intended to complement one another and , together with a third human capital plan addressing civilian personnel , constitute dod's overall human capital strategy . we have undertaken a separate review of dod's civilian human capital strategic management . for this report , our specific objectives were to review the extent that these two plans , in addressing active duty military benefits , promote ( 1 ) the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and ( 2 ) the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions â€” the two critical success factors identified in our model . we also reviewed dod's plans for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans . in conducting our work , we recognized that federal agencies employ a wide variety of approaches to manage human capital . these human capital approaches may include policies and practices for recruitment , compensation ( which includes pay as well as benefits ) , promotion , career development , and retention . we conducted our review from june to september 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . according to the plan , dod needs to establish a process and forum to regularly review the progress of its human capital strategy in order that its strategy will remain viable and relevant . a senior dod official told us that implementing the plan will be a long - term endeavor . one of the human capital goals in the military personnel strategic plan is to sustain the strategic management process and maintain its viability . the plan calls for the establishment of a defense human resources board by march 2003 . however , dod officials have not decided on the roles and responsibilities of the board , the composition of the board , or how the board would work with existing processes . dod , in developing its human capital plans addressing military personnel and quality of life , has made progress in adopting a more strategic approach to human capital management . since the military personnel strategic plan is intended to be a dynamic document that periodically will be assessed and refined , dod will have opportunities to incorporate additional elements of human capital strategic planning in future iterations of the plan . a positive step toward such improvements would be the establishment of an oversight process enabling senior dod officials to oversee the progress and implementation of the human capital plans . such a process could assist in the integration and alignment of benefits and other human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and in promoting a fact - based , performance - oriented approach to human capital management .
