this concludes my prepared remarks . i would be happy to answer any questions you may have . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . other agencies responded by submitting some or all of the rules that they had failed to previously file . several agencies are still working with us to assure 100 percent compliance with cra . some told us they were unaware of cra or of the cra filing requirement . overall , our review disclosed that: 279 rules should have been filed with us ; 264 of these have subsequently 182 were found not to be covered by cra as rules of particular applicability or agency management and thus were not required to be filed ; 37 rules had been submitted timely and our database was corrected ; and 15 rules from six agencies have thus far not been filed . we do not know if oira ever followed up with the agencies to ensure compliance with the filing requirement ; we do know that oira never contacted gao to determine if all rules were submitted as required . as a result of gao's compliance audit , however , 264 rules now have been filed with gao and the congress and are thus now effective under cra . in our view , oira should have played a more proactive role in ensuring that agencies were both aware of the cra filing requirements and were complying with them . one area of consistent difficulty in implementing cra has been the failure of some agencies to delay the effective date of major rules for 60 days as required by section 801 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( a ) of the act . eight major rules have not permitted the required 60-day delay , including the immigration and naturalization service's major rule regarding the expedited removal of aliens . our office has experienced varying degrees of responses from the agencies . this language mirrors the exception in the administrative procedure act ( apa ) to the requirement for notice and comment in rulemaking . ยง 553 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( b ) .
