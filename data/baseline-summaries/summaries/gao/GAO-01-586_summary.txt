( we planned to survey all transit authorities required to submit plans for a dbe program . however , the federal transit administration could not provide an accurate list of these transit authorities. ) the 36 transit authorities we surveyed are the largest transit authorities in the nation as defined by the number of unlinked passenger trips in 1999 . they also received about two - thirds of all federal transit grant funds obligated in 1999 . our survey was designed to obtain information on the issues that tea - 21 directed us to examine , including the participation rates of dbes in usdot - assisted contracts , the annual gross receipts of dbes and non - dbes , and the cost of administering the dbe program . to help design our survey , we obtained input from usdot , states , and transit authorities . after we developed our survey , we pre - tested the questionnaire with officials of 4 state departments of transportation ( states ) and 5 transit authorities .
