see table 14 . i would be pleased to answer questions . for further information on this testimony or our april 26 , 2018 report , please contact j. christopher mihm , managing director , strategic issues , at ( 202 ) 512-6806 or mihmj@gao.gov , and jessica lucas - judy , director , strategic issues , at ( 202 ) 512-9110 or lucasjudyj@gao.gov . contact points for the individual areas listed in our 2018 annual report can be found at the end of each area in gao - 18-371sp . contact points for our congressional relations and public affairs offices may be found on the last page of this statement . in our 2011 to 2018 annual reports , we directed 100 actions to congress , of which 58 remain open . table 5 highlights examples of these results . these financial benefits continue to grow as we identify and document additional agency actions that respond to our recommendations . for example , in recent months cms has formalized changes to its oversight of spending allowed for large medicaid demonstrations , which allow states to test new ways to deliver or pay for care . these demonstrations , by hhs policy , should not raise federal costs over what the program would have cost without the demonstration â€” that is , they should be budget neutral . but our past work has shown that the spending hhs had authorized for these demonstrations was much higher than what was justified , as hhs had allowed states to use questionable methods when proposing spending for their demonstrations . cms's new policy partially responds to a longstanding recommendation we have made to better ensure that valid methods are used to demonstrate budget neutrality . in our 2011 to 2018 annual reports , we directed 698 actions to executive branch agencies , including 65 new actions identified in 2018 . of the 698 actions , 307 remained open as of march 2018 . of these open actions , 164 were partially addressed and 143 were not addressed or new . we anticipate that cms's recent actions could potentially reduce the federal government's liability for medicaid by billions , or tens of billions , annually . as shown in figure 3 , seven agencies have at least 25 open actions . the following sections highlight examples of open actions across those seven major agencies . in our 2011 to 2018 reports , we directed 176 actions to dod in areas that center on dod's effectiveness in providing the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of the united states . as of march 2018 , 74 of these 176 actions remained open . dod represented about 14 percent of federal spending in fiscal year 2017 , with outlays totaling about $635.5 billion . our work suggests that effectively implementing these open actions , including those related to areas listed in table 7 , could yield substantial financial benefits and improve dod's effectiveness . in our 2011 to 2018 reports , we directed 111 actions to hhs in areas that contribute to hhs's mission to enhance the health and well - being of americans .
