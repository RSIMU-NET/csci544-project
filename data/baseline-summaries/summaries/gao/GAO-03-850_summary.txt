( see fig . apart from the annual appropriation from the superfund trust fund , epa collects funds from other sources to pay for the activities of the superfund program . these funds , called offsetting collections , are deposited into the trust fund but are not subject to the annual appropriation process . the largest source of these collections is payments by responsible parties as part of settlement agreements to fund response actions at specific sites . these responsible parties typically are unable or unwilling to perform the response action . epa uses these funds to help finance site cleanups in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreements . in fiscal year 2002 , epa collected about $130 million from this source . other sources of offsetting collections include states , which pay a small portion of the cleanup costs at sites , and other federal agencies , which pay for services provided by epa . the total amount collected from these additional sources in fiscal year 2002 was about $40 million . during fiscal years 1993 through 2002 , in constant 2002 dollars , epa's annual program expenditures remained between $1.3 and $1.7 billion . however , epa's superfund program expenditures steadily decreased by $255 million from fiscal years 1999 through 2002 . in responding to this report , epa noted that this decrease followed a $100 million reduction to the superfund enacted appropriation during fiscal year 2000 and subsequent years . during fiscal years 1993 through 2002 , remedial actions consumed the largest share of program expenditures . remedial actions are generally costly , long - term projects that are designed to provide a permanent remedy at a complex and highly contaminated site . management and administration expenditures consumed the second largest share of program expenditures . figure 5 shows the percentages of epa's superfund program expenditures in fiscal year 2002 . of the 1,233 sites on the npl at the end of fiscal year 2002 , 21 percent were in the preconstruction phase that largely consists of sites in study and design , 31 percent had construction activities under way , and 47 percent were in the “construction complete” stage . the number of construction completions serves as the program's key measure of progress for sites on the npl . epa continues to add sites to the npl , adding 283 new sites during fiscal years 1993 through 2002 . during that same time frame , epa deleted 221 sites from the npl because no further cleanup response was necessary . in fiscal year 2002 , epa funded more investigations and studies at npl sites than responsible parties , while responsible parties paid for , and sometimes also performed , about half of the actions related to the sites' cleanup design , construction , and maintenance of remedies . as shown in table 2 , at the end of fiscal year 2002 , there were 1,233 sites on the npl , 265 sites had been deleted , and 62 sites were proposed to the npl . of the total 1,233 npl sites at the end of fiscal year 2002 , 158 were federal facilities , sites owned or operated by a federal agency .
