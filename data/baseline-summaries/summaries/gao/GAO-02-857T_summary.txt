recommendations from our 2000 report are being addressed regarding other issues . the u.s. proposals require u.s. approval before either country can pledge or issue future compact funds as a source for repaying debt . the proposals also exclude a “full faith and credit” pledge that made it impracticable to withhold funds under the original compact . in addition , the u.s. proposals provide specific uses for infrastructure projects and require that some funds be used for capital project maintenance . we also recommended that interior ensure that appropriate resources are dedicated to monitoring future assistance . the rmi government submitted such a petition in september 2000 . under the most recent ( may 2002 ) u.s. proposals to the fsm and the rmi , new congressional authorizations of approximately $3.4 billion would be required for u.s. assistance over a period of 20 years ( fiscal years 2004 through 2023 ) . the share of new authorizations to the fsm would be about $2.3 billion , while the rmi would receive about $1.1 billion ( see table 1 ) . this new assistance would be provided to each country in the form of annual grant funds , extended federal services ( that have been provided under the original compact but are due to expire in 2003 ) , and contributions to a trust fund for each country . the first two goals have been met through the compact and its related agreements . for the rmi , the u.s. proposal also includes funding to extend u.s. access to kwajalein atoll for u.s. military use from 2017 through 2023 . in addition to new authorized funding , the u.s. government will provide ( 1 ) continuing program assistance amounting to an estimated $1.1 billion to the two countries over 20 years and ( 2 ) payments previously authorized of about $189 million for u.s. access to kwajalein atoll in the rmi through 2016 . if new and previous authorizations are combined , the total u.s. cost for all compact - related assistance under the current u.s. proposals would amount to about $4.7 billion over 20 years , not including costs for administration and oversight that are currently unknown . under the u.s. proposals , annual grant amounts to each country would be reduced over time , while annual u.s. contributions to the trust funds would increase by the grant reduction amount . annual grant assistance to the fsm would fall from a real value of $76 million in fiscal year 2004 to a real value of $53.2 million in fiscal year 2023 . annual grant assistance to the rmi would fall from a real value of $33.9 million to a real value of $17.3 million over the same period . this decrease in grant funding , combined with fsm and rmi population growth , would also result in falling per capita grant assistance over the funding period – particularly for the rmi ( see fig . the real value of grants per capita to the fsm would decrease from an estimated $684 in fiscal year 2004 to an estimated $396 in fiscal year 2023 . the real value of grants per capita to the rmi would fall from an estimated $623 in fiscal year 2004 to an estimated $242 in fiscal year 2023 .
