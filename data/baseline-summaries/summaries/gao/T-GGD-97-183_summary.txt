ii. ) our analysis also showed that the judicial conference approved additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships only when the weighted case filings would be 1,500 or more per judgeship after adding the requested judgeship ( s ) to the district's current authorized number of judgeships . if the weighted case filings would drop below 1,500 per judgeship after adding the requested judge ( s ) , the bankruptcy committee and the conference approved a temporary judgeship or no increase in judgeships . in two districts , the committee approved both one permanent and one temporary judgeship â€” the southern district of new york in 1993 , and the district of maryland in 1997 . currently , the second judge in the district is a recalled judge . our analysis excluded the travel data for the recalled judge because we did not receive or report travel data for recalled judges in the 15 districts for which we reported in our correspondence of august 8 , 1997 . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . the first factor is weighted filings . based on the results of a study of the time bankruptcy judges devoted to individual categories of bankruptcy cases,each case filed is assigned to 1 of 17 categories . each category is determined on the basis of the bankruptcy chapter under which the case is filed , and within each chapter , the dollar value of the debtor's assets or liabilities . a case weight is assigned to each of the 17 categories , representing the average amount of judicial time the case would be expected to require . generally , to be eligible for an additional judgeship , the judicial conference expects a bankruptcy district to have a minimum annual average of 1,500 weighted filings for each current authorized judgeship . to be eligible for a permanent judgeship , the judicial conference's standard is that a district's weighted filings per judgeship must be 1,500 or higher after adding any judgeships to the district's existing judgeship total . for example , a district with 5 judges could qualify for an additional permanent judgeship if its weighted filings per judgeship would be at least 1,500 with 6 judgeships ( its existing 5 plus the requested position ) .
