audiovisual . these products cover a variety of topics . for example , ntis sells a 21-minute tape called “ergonomic programs that work” for $55.00 from the occupational safety and health administration . according to ntis records , these generated about $136,000 in sales in fiscal year 2000 . we estimate that about 470,000 of ntis' 2.46 million reports ( 19 percent ) could be readily obtained through one or more of the four sources at the time that we searched . the remaining 2 million reports ( 81 percent ) could be readily obtained only from ntis . as shown in figure 5 , the same ntis reports often were available at more than one of the four web sites . for example , of the 10,000 reports published in 2000 , we estimate that 56 percent were available from the issuing organization , 40 percent from sources identified through google.com , 17 percent from sources identified through firstgov.gov , and 6 percent from gpo . for reports in all age categories , the source with the greatest probability of having the ntis report was the issuing organization , and the source with the least probability was gpo . for reports published from 1989 to 2000 , google.com was able to locate more than twice the percentage of reports than either firstgov.gov or gpo's web site search engines could locate . as shown in figure 6 , reports published in 2000 were over five times more likely to be available elsewhere than reports published in 1988 or earlier , and the percentage not readily available from these sources increased with the age of the report . for example , we estimate that only 12 percent of the 1.8 million reports published in 1988 or earlier were readily available from the other sources . “arizona - 1997 census of agriculture state and county data . volume 1 . geographic area series part 3,” march 1999 , national agricultural statistics service , 328 pages .

( at ntis , a paper copy costs $23 , microfiche $12. ) as shown in figure 7 , reports published from 1997 to 2000 were considerably more likely to be available free on the internet than were reports published in other years . as shown in figure 8 , we found reports that ntis had sold since 1995 were more likely to be available elsewhere than reports that had not sold . specifically , we estimate that 44 percent of the reports that sold in all age strata since 1995 were readily available elsewhere , compared with only 17 percent of the reports that did not sell since 1995 .
