the other replacement project is isrp . isrp is a single , integrated system that is to perform the functions of two systems that are not year 2000 compliant — the distributed input system that irs uses to process tax returns and the remittance processing system that irs uses to process tax payments . irs completed the year 2000 critical portions of scmc by january 31 , 1999 . specifically , in early october 1998 , irs completed its implementation of the 16,000 terminals that are needed for frontline customer service and compliance activities . also , as of january 31 , 1999 , all 10 service centers were using sacs . originally , irs had planned to have the other aspects of scmc besides sacs — that is , the tax processing activities of the 10 service centers — moved to the 2 computing centers by december 1998 . as of january 31 , 1999 , the tax processing activities for three service centers had been moved to the computing centers . irs is determining the number of additional service centers that are to be moved in 1999 . scmc officials have developed several different schedule options for moving the tax processing activities of the remaining seven service centers . at the time we prepared this statement , irs officials had not yet selected a schedule option . according to irs officials , the tax processing activities of all 10 service centers do not need to be moved before 2000 because the existing mainframes in each of the 10 service centers have been made year 2000 compliant . thus , in all likelihood , at the start of the 2000 filing season , some service centers will be processing their data locally , whereas others will have their data processed at the computing centers . irs' year 2000 end - to - end test is designed to include both processing scenarios . both functions of isrp — tax return processing and remittance processing — were to be implemented in november 1998 . however , as a result of problems that occurred during the pilot test of isrp and the contingency option irs implemented for the 1999 filing season to address those problems , 4 of the 10 service centers are not to begin using the remittance processing portion of isrp until august 1999 . for the 1999 filing season , the contingency option for isrp is to retain enough of the old tax processing and remittance processing equipment in the service centers so that irs could revert to the old systems if isrp experiences problems . however , four of the service centers did not have enough floor space to accommodate both the old tax processing and remittance processing systems and the isrp equipment . as a result , these four service centers are to continue using the old remittance processing equipment during the 1999 filing season and convert to isrp in august 1999 . these four service centers were among the top five remittance processing centers during the peak of the 1998 filing season . we recognize that this contingency option may have been the only feasible one for irs .
