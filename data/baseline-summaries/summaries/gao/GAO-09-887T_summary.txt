these products and services are described in table 3 . in addition , center weather service unit meteorologists receive and disseminate pilot reports , provide input every 2 hours to the aviation weather center's creation of the collaborative convective forecast product , train faa personnel on how to interpret weather information , and provide weather briefings to nearby terminal radar approach control facilities and air traffic control towers . we also interviewed relevant agency officials . all of our work for this report was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . a more detailed description of the scope and methodology of our draft report is provided in attachment 1 . faa is responsible for ensuring safe , orderly , and efficient air travel in the national airspace system . the agency's ability to fulfill its mission depends on the adequacy and reliability of its air traffic control systems , as well as weather forecasts made available by nws and automated systems . nws responded with three proposals , but faa rejected these proposals in september 2008 , noting that while elements of each proposal had merit , the proposed costs were too high . faa requested that nws revise its proposal to bring costs down while stating a preference to move towards a single center weather service unit with a back - up site . in addition , nws risks continued investments in trying to create a product for faa without clear information on what the agency wants . neither faa nor nws have ensured that the restructuring of the center weather service units fits with the national vision for a next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) â€” a long - term initiative to transition faa from the current radar - based system to an aircraft - centered , satellite - based system . our prior work on enterprise architectures shows that connecting strategic planning with program and system solutions can increase the chances that an organization's operational and information technology ( it ) environments will be configured to optimize mission performance . our experience with federal agencies has shown that investing in it without defining these investments in the context of a larger , strategic vision often results in systems that are duplicative , not well integrated , and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface . the joint planning and development office is responsible for planning and coordinating nextgen . as part of this program , the joint planning and development office envisions restructuring air traffic facilities , including en route centers , across the country as well as a transitioning to new technologies . however , nws and faa efforts to restructure the center weather service units have not been aligned with the joint planning and development office's vision for transforming air traffic control under the nextgen program .
