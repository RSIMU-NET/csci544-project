pub . 110-343 , div . c , tit . v , sub . b , §§ 511-512 , 122 stat . mhpaea , passed as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 , expands the parity requirements established by the mental health parity act of 1996 ( pub . 104-204 , tit . vii , §§ 701-702 , 100 stat . 2874 , 2944-2950 ( sept. 26 , 1996 ) , the first federal mental health parity law , which required parity in annual and aggregate lifetime dollar limits . mhpaea expanded the 1996 federal parity requirements to include parity more broadly in financial requirements ( including cost - sharing requirements ) , treatment limitations , and in - and out - of - network covered benefits . mhpaea also requires parity for substance use disorder benefits . employers that choose to cover mh / su , mhpaea does not require coverage of specific diagnoses . most employers that responded to our survey offered coverage of mh / su both in their most current plan year — 2011 or 2010 — and in 2008 , before mhpaea was passed . mhpaea also requires us to examine trends in coverage for mh / su . approximately 2 percent of employers reported that they offered coverage for only mental health conditions in 2008 but not substance use disorders , and continued to offer coverage for only mental health conditions in the current plan year . conversely , a small percentage of employers — about 2 percent of those employers that responded to our survey about their coverage of mh / su for both plan years — reported discontinuing their coverage of both mh / su or only substance use disorders in the current plan year . for this study , we report on: ( 1 ) the extent to which employers cover mh / su through private health insurance plans , and how this coverage has changed since mhpaea was passed in 2008 ; and ( 2 ) what is known about the effect of health insurance coverage for mh / su on enrollees' health care expenditures ; access to , or use of , mh / su services ; and health status . to determine the extent to which employers cover mh / su both currently and in 2008 , we surveyed a stratified random sample of small , medium , large , and very large employers about their most popular health plans for the most current plan year — either 2011 or 2010 — as well as for 2008 . we conducted a survey of employers because we were unable to identify a published national employer survey that included specific detailed information about employers' mh / su benefits prior to and following mhpaea — namely , information about diagnoses included in or excluded from coverage . we fielded our web - based survey between may 18 , 2011 , and july 1 , 2011 , to 707 employers , selected from the sampling frame we developed using the lexis nexis corporate database . we received usable responses from 168 employers , after following up with nonrespondents to encourage their participation , for a 24 percent response rate .
