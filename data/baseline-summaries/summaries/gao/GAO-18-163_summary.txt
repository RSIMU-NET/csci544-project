ii ) . to assess the reliability of the data elements we analyzed for our study , we ( 1 ) performed electronic testing of required data elements ; ( 2 ) reviewed existing information about the data and the systems that produced them ; and ( 3 ) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data . this sample informed our selection of borrowers . we emailed borrowers who attended these 12 schools and requested interviews with them , and selected 3 of the 12 schools for interviews with school officials and document requests . to select the 12 schools , we analyzed cdrs for the 2009-2013 cohorts from education's cohort default rate database ; 3-year forbearance rates for fiscal years 2009-2012 from education's annual risk assessment data ; and 3-year repayment rates for fiscal years 2009-2014 from education's college scorecard data . we selected the 12 schools from the population that had a cdr calculated for 2013 . we excluded schools whose 2013 cdr was calculated using a different formula that education uses for schools with fewer than 30 borrowers entering repayment in a particular cohort . to be considered for selection , schools had to have had cdrs of 25 percent or above for cohort years 2009-2013 and also be in the following: 1 ) top 20 percent of year - to - year decreases in cdr ; 2 ) top 20 percent of year - to - year increases in 3-year forbearance rates ; or 3 ) top 20 percent of 3-year forbearances that resulted in default after the 3- year cdr period ended . this analysis resulted in a list of 312 schools , which we randomized within strata based on combinations of institutional control ( public , nonprofit , and for - profit ) , maximum length of degree programs offered ( less than 4-year or 4-year and above ) , and school size ( fewer than 1,000 borrowers entering repayment in a given fiscal year and 1,000 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given fiscal year ) . we removed schools that had fewer than 1,000 borrowers entering repayment in a given fiscal year to mitigate the wide variations in forbearance rates and cdrs that may occur at smaller schools . finally , we judgmentally selected a total of 12 schools from across the remaining strata , choosing the schools from each stratum in the randomized order . we conducted interviews with officials at 3 of these schools ( public , nonprofit , and for - profit ) and reviewed documentation on the strategies they use to reduce borrower defaults during the cdr period . to examine how default management strategies may affect borrowers , we obtained record - level data from education's national student loan data system ( nslds ) related to the 12 schools we focused on in our review , including data on all loans that entered repayment from fiscal years 2011-2014 and contact information for the borrowers that took out these loans . we weighted the sample toward borrowers whose loans were in deferment , forbearance , or were consolidated during the cdr period or defaulted after the cdr period .
