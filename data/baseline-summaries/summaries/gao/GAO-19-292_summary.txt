( see table 1. ) the proportions were similar for both helicopter and fixed - wing transports in each year . dot has not yet acted on the remaining two recommendations . air ambulance providers added helicopter bases from 2012 through 2017 , according to our analysis of the adams data . specifically , there were 752 bases in the 2012 data and 868 bases in the 2017 data . when we compared the data for each year , there were 554 bases in both years of data ( i.e. , existing bases ) , 314 bases in the 2017 data only ( i.e. , new bases ) , and 198 bases in the 2012 data only ( i.e. , closed bases ) ; the new and existing bases are shown in figure 3 . new bases in areas with existing coverage: for just under half of the new helicopter bases in the adams data , the area served overlapped with existing air ambulance coverage by more than 50 percent . in 2017 , the median price charged by air ambulance providers for a transport was approximately $36,400 for a helicopter transport and $40,600 for a fixed - wing transport , according to our analysis of fair health data . the prices charged in 2017 were an increase of over 60 percent from 2012 , when the median price charged was approximately $22,100 for a helicopter transport and $24,900 for a fixed - wing transport . there is limited information on what insurers pay for out - of - network services . while out - of - network transports may result in balance billing , the fair health data we analyzed do not indicate the extent to which patients received balance bills and , if so , the size of the bills . in addition , as we previously reported , there is a lack of comprehensive national data about the extent and size of balance bills , and air ambulance providers are generally not required to report such data . however , some states have attempted to collect information from patients about balance billing for air ambulance services . therefore , to provide insights into potential balance bill amounts , we reviewed data on consumer complaints that two of our selected states had received about specific incidents of balance billing for 2014 through 2018 . data for maryland contained about two dozen complaints with information on the specific amount of balance bills , and those amounts ranged from $12,300 to $52,000 . this addition in bases also increased the total area served by helicopter bases by 23 percent . , closed bases ) ; the new and existing bases are shown in figure 4 . both the existing and new bases are more prevalent in the western and southern parts of the united states .
