however , these criteria are not documented . see table 1 for more information on these requests . our preliminary observations indicate that epa's procedures for processing congressional requests for scientific advice from the sab do not ensure compliance with erddaa because the procedures are incomplete and do not fully account for the statutory access designated congressional committees have to the sab . specifically , epa policy documents do not clearly outline how the epa administrator , the sab staff office , and members of the sab panel are to handle a congressional committee's request for advice from the sab . in addition , epa policy documents do not acknowledge that the sab must provide scientific advice when requested by select congressional committees . epa's written procedures for processing congressional committee requests to the sab are found in the sab charter and in the following two documents that establish general policies for how epa's federal advisory committees are to interact with outside parties: epa policy regarding communication between members of federal advisory committee act committees and parties outside of the epa ( the april 2014 policy ) , and clarifying epa policy regarding communications between members of scientific and technical federal advisory committees and outside parties ( the november 2014 policy clarification ) . collectively , the sab's charter , epa's april 2014 policy , and epa's november 2014 policy clarification provide direction for how epa and the sab are to process requests from congressional committees . however , these documents do not clearly outline procedures for the epa administrator , the sab staff office , and members of the sab panel to use in processing such requests . by modifying the charter when it is renewed to reflect the language in the november 2014 policy clarification — that congressional requests should be forwarded to the appropriate dfo — epa can better ensure that its staff process congressional committee requests consistently when the agency receives such a request . moreover , neither the april 2014 policy nor the november 2014 policy clarification clearly documents epa's procedures for reviewing congressional committee requests to determine which questions would be taken up by the sab , consistent with the federal standards of internal control . because epa's procedures for reviewing congressional committee requests are not documented , it will be difficult for epa to provide reasonable assurance that its staff is appropriately applying criteria when determining which questions the sab will address . epa officials told us that internal deliberations in response to a congressional request follow those that the agency would apply to internal requests for charges to the sab . specifically , officials told us that epa considers whether the questions are science or policy driven , whether they are important to science and the agency , and whether the sab has already undertaken a similar review . in addition , under erddaa , the sab is required to provide requested scientific advice to select committees , regardless of epa's judgment .
