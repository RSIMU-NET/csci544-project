( see figs . in 1991 , the 25 percent of areas with the lowest physician supplies per 100,000 people had an average of 106 physicians per 100,000 people . by 2001 , the 25 percent of areas with the lowest physician supplies per 100,000 people had an average of 132 physicians per 100,000 people . similarly , the 25 percent of areas with the highest physician supplies per 100,000 people had an average of 319 physicians in 1991 and 362 physicians in 2001 . see appendix iii for information on physician supply by state metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in 1991 and 2001 . all 48 statewide nonmetropolitan areas experienced an increase in the number of physicians per 100,000 people from 1991 to 2001 and 301 of 318 metropolitan areas experienced an increase in physicians per 100,000 people . overall , the nonmetropolitan areas had higher proportional growth in physicians per 100,000 people than the metropolitan areas , but the disparity in the supply of physicians per 100,000 people between the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas persisted . rates of growth in the number of physicians per 100,000 people , the supply of physicians per 100,000 people , and the mix of generalists and specialists among categories of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties varied . among the five county categories we analyzed , nonmetropolitan counties with a large town had the biggest increase in physicians per 100,000 people from 1991 to 2001 and more physicians per 100,000 people than either nonmetropolitan counties without a large town or rural counties , but still fewer than metropolitan counties . like metropolitan counties , nonmetropolitan counties with large towns had more specialists than generalists , while other nonmetropolitan counties had more generalists than specialists . the 48 statewide nonmetropolitan areas , including those with the lowest supplies of physicians per 100,000 people in 1991 , registered gains in physicians per 100,000 people between 1991 and 2001 . however , this growth rate was not even across all statewide nonmetropolitan areas and 7 areas remained below 100 physicians per 100,000 people . five of these 7 statewide nonmetropolitan areas — iowa , indiana , louisiana , oklahoma , and texas — that remained below 100 physicians per 100,000 people , had average increases in physicians per 100,000 people that were less than the 23 percent average increase for the nonmetropolitan united states . the remaining 2 — statewide nonmetropolitan alabama and tennessee — had increases in physicians per 100,000 people that exceeded the national nonmetropolitan area average , but the number of physicians in these areas was so low in 1991 that this growth was not enough to elevate their physician supply above 100 per 100,000 people in 2001 . in the aggregate , the 318 metropolitan areas of the united states experienced an increase in physicians per 100,000 people between 1991 and 2001 . however , 17 ( 5 percent ) metropolitan areas experienced declines in the number of physicians per 100,000 people during this period . ( see table 2. ) in 2001 , 11 of these areas had physician supplies per 100,000 people that were below the national average of 239 physicians per 100,000 people .
