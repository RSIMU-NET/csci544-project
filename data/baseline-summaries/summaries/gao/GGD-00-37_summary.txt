ii ) . on december 3 , 1999 , we also met with various representatives from the office of irs' chief operations officer , which is responsible for the various programs we reviewed , to discuss irs' comments . in his letter , the commissioner said that ( 1 ) our draft report provided a fair and balanced assessment of irs' efforts to improve processing while providing taxpayers with top quality service and ( 2 ) irs would make every effort to resolve the issues noted in the draft report . regarding our recommendation to analyze the effect of not achieving the planned sample size for monitoring the accuracy of responses to tax law calls , the commissioner said that irs has completed such an analysis and is in the process of filling 20 additional monitoring positions . he said that with the additional staff , irs will be able to meet the desired sampling plan for tax law and other telephone calls . irs' actions appear responsive to our recommendation . those types can be detected only through an audit . in 1999 , irs continued to target for in - depth review certain types of eic claims that irs had identified as the main sources of eic noncompliance . these targeted eic claims include those that involve ( 1 ) the use of a qualifying child's ssn on multiple returns for the same tax year , ( 2 ) erroneous claims of head - of - household filing status , and ( 3 ) misreported income . taxpayers whose returns were identified for inclusion in one of these programs were to be audited to determine if their eic claims were valid . for fiscal year 1999 , irs anticipated a potential caseload of 421,393 cases involving multiple uses of the same qualifying child's ssn . however , the actual caseload was 344,572 because taxpayers had either filed their tax year 1998 returns without the questionable ssn ( 57,024 ) or did not file any tax year 1998 return ( 19,797 ) . as of august 28 , 1999 , irs had completed audits on 204,912 cases ( out of the 344,572 ) and had recommended that $379.6 million in erroneous claims not be paid . although filing status per se does not affect either eic eligibility or amount ( except that married taxpayers filing separate returns are ineligible for the eic ) , irs' april 1997 study had shown that erroneous filings as head of household often occurred with an eic overclaim . from october 1 , 1998 , to august 28 , 1999 , irs had completed 256,365 audits examining taxpayers' head - of - household status and recommended that $517.1 million in erroneous claims not be paid . irs' misreported income projects focus on eic claims that ( 1 ) appear to be inflated by the inclusion of nonqualifying income , such as investment income , in the computation of earned income or ( 2 ) involve earned income , such as self - employment income , that can be used to qualify for the eic but cannot be verified through a third party .
