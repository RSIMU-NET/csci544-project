( fig . 1 shows estimated and actual costs for each year. ) however , the air force had 125 aircraft in its inventory in fiscal year 2009 rather than the 143 aircraft projected in the 2005 cost estimate . also , the aircraft fleet actually flew 68,261 hours over this time period rather than the 134,618 hours projected in the 2005 cost estimate . on a per flight hour basis , the fiscal year 2009 actual o&s costs were $51,829 , or 88 percent higher than the $27,559 forecast in 2005 after accounting for inflation . the use of contractor logistics support for the f - 22a further complicated comparisons of actual costs to the estimated costs developed in 2005 . although the f - 22a has been supported under contractor logistics support arrangements since before 2005 , the estimates included the costs for government - provided logistics support of the aircraft . for example , for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 , the o&s cost estimate projected that contractor logistics support would cost $736 million . however , actual contractor logistics support costs for the f - 22a were $2.1 billion . for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 , f - 22a contractor logistics support costs were 60 percent of the total actual o&s costs reported in the air force's vamosc system . due to the use of this support arrangement , however , the air force's vamosc system reports all of the amounts paid to the f - 22a contractor under a single cost element instead of under multiple individual cost elements . in contrast , program officials confirmed that various contractor - provided cost elements — such as repair parts , materials and supplies , depot maintenance , and sustaining support — were included in the production milestone o&s cost estimate as separate items . further , according to officials , prior to 2008 the program office did not obtain from the contractor cost reports that provide details of how the amounts paid to the contractor were spent in terms of dod's recommended o&s cost elements by fiscal year . therefore , it is not possible to compare a significant amount of the actual o&s costs for the f - 22a to the production milestone estimate at the cost element level . of the remaining f - 22a o&s costs not covered by contractor logistics support , mission personnel costs constituted the largest proportion — approximately 22 percent — of the total actual o&s costs reported for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 . compared with the estimates developed in 2005 , actual mission personnel costs were $34 million ( 20 percent ) higher for fiscal year 2008 and $113 million ( 62 percent ) higher for fiscal year 2009 . the 2005 estimate provided for 1,335 maintenance personnel for each f - 22a wing ( which was projected to number 72 aircraft ) , but according to air force officials the current authorized personnel for an f - 22a wing ( now numbering 36 aircraft ) is 1,051 maintenance personnel . while the number of aircraft per wing was reduced by half , the number of personnel was reduced by about 21 percent .
