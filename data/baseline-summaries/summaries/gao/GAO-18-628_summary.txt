oversight of mcos . according to officials from arizona and florida , the states chose to use mltss because it afforded better oversight of providers and had the potential to improve patient outcomes . specifically , officials said that managing a limited number of mcos , who in turn have contracts with hcbs providers , allows for better oversight and outcomes , and has led to service delivery improvements , compared to paying providers on a fee - for - service basis . for example , florida officials explained that they recently consolidated three smaller fee - for - service programs into their mltss program . prior to that consolidation , the three fee - for - service programs provided hcbs to approximately 7,500 individuals with aids , traumatic brain injury / spinal cord injury , and individuals with cystic fibrosis . officials said that they did not believe providers in these smaller fee - for - service programs were providing good care , based on service utilization analyses that showed some beneficiaries were not accessing any services beyond one case management service per month . furthermore , the officials also told us that it was harder to assess quality of care in the fee - for - service programs compared to mltss . officials said that now that these beneficiaries receive care under the mltss waiver , there is more accountability and improved quality of care . representatives from aging and developmental disability professional groups we interviewed said that states may also choose to implement mltss programs to achieve greater budget predictability and control costs . cms's recent report on the growth of mltss also notes states' desire for improvements in quality of care and outcomes ; increased access to hcbs providers ; and better care coordination , among other factors . we have previously reported that although mltss can provide states with the opportunity to enhance and encourage the provision of hcbs , oversight at the state and federal levels is critical to ensure that individuals with ltss needs are able to obtain needed care in a timely fashion . in addition , our prior work on mltss payment rates found that five states — including arizona and florida — set clear financial incentives in their mco payment rates for greater use of community - based care , while one state's rate structure included higher payments for beneficiaries receiving institutional care . this state's rate structure could have created an incentive for mcos to move higher - cost beneficiaries from the community to an institution . additionally , we found that most of the states reviewed for that prior work were not specifically linking payments with mltss program goals such as beneficiary outcomes and that federal oversight of states' mltss payment structures was limited . we made several recommendations to improve cms's oversight of states' payment structures for mltss . cms agreed with our recommendations and reported actions it planned to take to address them . officials from the three selected states that do not use mltss cited various reasons for this , such as stakeholder opposition and state law restrictions on enrolling individuals receiving ltss in managed care .
