internal impacts . fda described internal impacts resulting from each of the 17 selected projects , many of which related to advancing fda's scientific understanding in a particular area . for 12 selected projects , fda reported that the projects resulted in new information about the topic that fda was using or considering using for future work . for example , one goal of ocet's project looking at the feasibility of using electronic health records in public health emergencies was advancing fda's understanding of the possibilities and limitations of using electronic health data . the findings from this project indicated that structured data in electronic health records could help the agency assess the risk of adverse events , particularly those that are severe . however , the results also indicated that this near real - time data still had some built - in delays and that the data search process cannot be fully automated . this provided fda with information it can use as it considers using electronic health records in emergency situations . for 9 selected projects , fda reported that the results led the agency to plan or conduct additional studies or activities that represent the logical next step in the particular area being studied . for example , initial results from an orsi study of the use of social media to provide early signals of drug safety concerns showed a relationship between data obtained from social media and from fda's adverse event reporting system . using that information , fda then conducted a retrospective study for 10 safety concerns to see if there was evidence of those adverse events in social media before fda became aware of them . fda has since reported that the analysis identified specific limitations of the tool fda uses in monitoring safety concerns . other internal impacts were related to changes in agency practices . for 8 selected projects , fda reported that the results led to the development of standards , methods , tools , or training for fda internal use . for example , an oip project was designed to create a tool to help secure global supply chains against the infiltration of counterfeit or substandard products . the project resulted in the production of a “roadmap” that fda could use to develop such a system . for 5 selected projects , fda reported that the results led to either a change in guidance or regulation or the decision to not make a previously proposed change . for example , cder funded a study of surrogate endpoints that could speed the development of new therapies for breast cancer . fda used results from this study to inform its development of guidance to industry that described study designs in which a surrogate endpoint may be accepted by fda as reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug . in response to a statutory requirement , cder also examined whether quantitative information could be added to drug advertising to maximize consumer and health care professional understanding of the benefits and risks of the drug .
