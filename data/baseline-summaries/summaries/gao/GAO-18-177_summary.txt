accessibility of information . ads - b technology also introduces risks to aircraft , personnel , equipment , and operations , because it provides information to the public that was not previously accessible . faa filters information about dod's flights so that the information is not available to the public via any faa data feed . according to faa officials , this filtering was effective for protecting such information for mode - s equipped dod aircraft until the 2012 timeframe , when the capability of third - party networked receivers started to allow position determination for such aircraft . with ads - b , aircraft location and other information is broadcast from the aircraft , where faa cannot filter it . while individuals and groups could obtain additional information about dod flights operating with mode s , such as an aircraft's fixed address , information such as geographic location and velocity was not included in broadcasts . individuals could estimate location and velocity of dod flights by locating the signal through privately owned receiver networks . by equipping military aircraft with ads - b technology , individuals and groups would receive additional identifiers , location information , and airframe information through aircraft broadcasts and , as a result , could identify and track aircraft without the use of fixed address databases and with less receiver infrastructure . historical data . ads - b technology better enables individuals and groups to track flights in real time and use computer programs to log ads - b transmissions over time . therefore , individuals or groups could observe flight paths in detail , identify patterns - of - life , or counter or exploit dod operations . while norad and dod officials told us that they will benefit from information provided by ads - b technology , norad , dod , and professional organizations' documents and officials also noted that electronic warfare - and cyber - attacks — and the potential divestment of secondary - surveillance radars as a result of reliance on ads - b — could adversely affect current and future air operations . for example , a 2015 institute of electrical and electronics engineers article about ads - b stated that ads - b is vulnerable to an electronic - warfare attack — such as a jamming attack — whereby an adversary can effectively disable the sending and receiving of messages between an ads - b transmitter and receiver by transmitting a higher power signal on the ads - b frequencies . the article notes that while jamming is a problem common to all wireless communication , the effect is severe in aviation due to the system's inherently wide - open spaces , which are impossible to control , as well as to the importance and criticality of the transmitted data . as a stand - alone method , jamming could create problems within the national airspace . jamming can also be used to initiate a cyber - attack on aircraft or ads - b systems .
