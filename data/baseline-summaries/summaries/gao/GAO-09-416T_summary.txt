dts underutilization . our january 2006 and september 2006 reports noted the challenge facing the department in attaining planned dts utilization . more specifically , as discussed in our september 2006 report , we found that while the military services have issued various memorandums that mandate the use of dts to the fullest extent possible at those sites where dts has been deployed , sites were still using legacy travel systems to process tdy travel . additionally , we found that the department did not have reasonable quantitative metrics to measure and reliably report on the extent to which dts was actually being used . as of the issuance of our september 2006 report , dts utilization rates reported by dod were based on the dts voucher analysis model developed in calendar year 2003 using military service data , which were not verified or validated . furthermore , pmo - dts officials acknowledged that the model had not been updated with actual data over the years . as a result , estimated dts utilization reported to dod management and the congress was questionable . in our september 2006 report , we recommended that ( 1 ) the department develop a process by which the military services would use validated quantitative data from dts and their individual legacy systems to identify the total universe of dts - eligible transactions on a monthly basis and ( 2 ) these data be used to update the dts voucher analysis model to report actual dts utilization rates . our preliminary observations show that while the department has taken some action to implement this recommendation , dod still does not have reasonable quantitative metrics to measure the extent of dts utilization as its metrics continue to be based , at least in part , on estimates . dtmo officials stated that dod no longer uses the dts voucher analysis model to report dts utilization . instead , in march 2007 , dtmo began consolidating travel voucher processing data provided by the military services and publishing this information in the defense travel enterprise quarterly metrics reports . these reports include metrics for dts fielding , dts voucher processing , and dts reservation module usage performance . these reports are provided to dod management and the military services and include military service data for legacy systems and data available from dts . unused airline tickets . we reported in january 2006 that dod had not recovered millions of dollars in airline tickets that dod travelers purchased but did not use . to address this issue , we recommended that the department consider the viability of using commercial databases to identify unused airline tickets , for which reimbursement should be obtained , and to help ensure that the actual travel taken was consistent with the information shown on the travel voucher . in its efforts to implement this recommendation , dtmo found that commercial sources could not readily identify unused airline tickets . in implementing this recommendation , dtmo officials acknowledged that the ongoing cto initiative , which is scheduled for completion by june 2009 , requires ctos to identify and cancel an unused airline ticket 30 days after the planned trip date and then initiate the refund process .
