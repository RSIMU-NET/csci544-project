( fig . 3.4 shows maverick missiles stored outside. ) among the serviceable ammunition stored at installations were items that were beyond repair and designated for disposal and occupying considerable space . as of september 1995 , 12 percent , or 3.2 million square feet , of the stockpile's storage capacity was occupied by stocks designated as beyond repair or for disposal . for example , about 300,000 tons of items designated for disposal were stored inside at an annual cost of about $8 million and occupied nearly 2.8 million square feet . aggregated , these stocks would fill at least two storage installations that could be used to store serviceable stocks . we found the following examples of individual types of ammunition with questionable needs . in one case , 251,000 propelling charges ( for 155-millimeter guns ) that had been condemned but not designated for disposal were taking up 36,031 square feet ( see fig . in another case , 715 unserviceable nike hercules rocket motors with no requirements occupied 31,212 square feet . one depot was storing 458 of these items , some of which were manufactured in 1959 . according to an official there , these rocket motors occupied 16 to 20 storage sites at that depot ( see fig . two types of 3-inch , 50-caliber gun ammunition occupied about 15,000 square feet , even though the navy no longer has any weapon in active inventory that uses this ammunition . according to an official at one installation , this ammunition has had few or no issues in 15 years . in yet another case , 5,382 navy mk25 mines that appeared in the army's wholesale inventory database as belonging to the navy did not appear in the navy's inventory database , and was occupying 49,552 square feet . about 2,200 ( 40 percent ) of these mines had been suspended because their condition was unknown . we noted that some of these mines at one installation were manufactured in 1954 , and at another installation , none of these mines had moved in over 10 years ( see fig . the proliferation of small , fragmented lots of ammunition also impedes the efficient management and use of ammunition storage space . according to the 1993 report on the wholesale stockpile , about 32,000 fragmented lots were stored largely because of base closures and the return of ammunition from europe and operation desert storm . installations were forced to store the returned ammunition without knowing whether additional quantities of the same lots would be received . these lots were often stored in more than one location . to optimize storage space and reduce inventories and surveillance , ammunition from the same lot in the same condition should be located in one storage structure when possible . if personnel have to fill requisitions from several locations , response time is delayed and issue costs increase . our analysis shows that since october 1993 , the number of fragmented lots in the stockpile has increased 14 percent . these lots — some of which were stored in more than three structures — occupy 24 percent ( 5.9 million square feet ) of the total storage space ( see fig .
