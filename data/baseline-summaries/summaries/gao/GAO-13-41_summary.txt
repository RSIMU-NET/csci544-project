most of these cpus were in rural areas . forty - nine percent of small - town rural cpus with fixed - price contracts generated less revenue for usps than the compensation usps provided in fiscal year 2011 . according to usps officials , while usps does not retain any revenue from these cpus after compensating them , operating a post office in the same locations would be more onerous from a cost perspective . given the resources required to seek opportunities and open new cpus , usps may be unable to meet all local needs for cpus with existing resources . other terms and conditions are standardized in all contracts . for example , all cpus are required to offer the same basic set of products and services such as stamps , priority mail , express mail , and certified mail . in addition , all cpus are contractually prohibited from selling services , including private mailboxes and others , that are competitive with usps's products , and all cpu contracts specify usps's rights to inspect the cpu at any time during operating hours . cpu contracts are valid for an indefinite period , but cpu contracts specify that the cpu operator or usps can terminate a contract and close the cpu at any time with 120 days notice . usps management and oversight of cpus , including identifying and justifying the need for new cpus , is done at the district and local levels . staff at the district and local levels oversee day - to - day operations of cpus and identify the need for new cpus . when a district identifies the need for a new cpu , it approaches local businesses in the targeted area as potential partners and engages in a competitive application process . usps has other partnerships with private entities to provide retail postal services , similar to cpus . usps launched a retail partnership called the village post office in july 2011 in which existing small businesses provide a limited range of postal products and services in small communities where underutilized yet costly post offices may close , be consolidated with another nearby post office , or have their hours of service reduced . partnerships with national and regional retailers to provide postal services . these partnerships differ from cpus in that they will not be subject to the same prohibitions as cpus on selling competing services , and with them , usps is attempting to expand access at a national or regional level as opposed to addressing specific local needs as cpus do . village post offices sell a more limited range of usps products and services than cpus do . local usps staff solicit a local business for a village post office opportunity and a usps contracting officer agrees to enter into a contract if they believe that the terms and conditions of that village post office present a best value to usps . ( see fig . during this same period , usps's share of total retail revenues from all retail alternatives increased from about 24 percent to 35 percent . usps projects that by 2020 , retail alternatives will account for 60 percent of its retail revenues .
