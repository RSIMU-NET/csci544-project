pp . focusing on reunification and discharge rates among children in foster care in illinois between fiscal years 1976 and 1992 , the researcher examined the effect of selected factors such as age , race , and type of foster care placement on the likelihood of reunification or discharge . testa , mark f. â€œprofessional foster care: a future worth pursuing ? what permanency goals are pursued ? to obtain a broader perspective on the issues surrounding kinship care , we interviewed researchers , public policy advisers , physicians , attorneys , family court judges , social workers , adoption caseworkers , and representatives of organizations that have an interest in foster care or child welfare in general . we asked for their opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of kinship care , the quality of kinship care , additional safeguards needed in the system , if any , and the effect of kinship care on foster care outcomes . we also interviewed state program officials to obtain information about kinship care in their state and their opinions about kinship care in general . we surveyed open foster care cases in california and illinois to obtain information about the quality of care that children in kinship care receive relative to that of foster children in other foster care settings , as well as information about the effect of kinship care on permanency goals and the time children spend in foster care . each state selected a simple random sample of open foster care cases for our survey , from all cases that were in its foster care system on june 1 , 1997 , and had been there continuously since at least march 1 , 1997 . each sample was intended to represent the entire population of open foster care cases in the state during that time . the samples allowed us to make statements about the experiences of the foster children who made up the foster care population during that time . because these samples were not drawn from a population of all children who entered the foster care system in a state , however , they do not represent the experiences of all foster children who entered the system . foster children who spend a relatively short time in the system may be underrepresented in our samples , while children who spend more time in foster care may be overrepresented . furthermore , while the survey results based on these samples can be generalized to the population of open foster care cases during the specified time in each state , they do not represent the foster care population nationally or in any other state . the foster care cases in california and illinois combined account for about one - quarter of the entire foster care population nationwide and about half of all kinship care cases . after our samples were drawn , we learned that 22 of the sampled cases from california and 2 from illinois had not been in foster care continuously from march 1 , 1997 , through june 1 , 1997 , and we excluded them from our study .
