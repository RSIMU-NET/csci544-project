we have addressed this comment in the report . our report makes reference to dod's use of reconnaissance assets during hurricane rita . while we have added additional information about dod's integration efforts , these additional efforts do not diminish our finding that integration problems led to inefficiencies and duplication of effort . although aviation officials expressed safety concerns to us , we agree that the fact that military search and rescue efforts were conducted under extreme conditions without any aviation accidents constitutes a considerable accomplishment , so we have revised our search and rescue section . we evaluated these technical comments and incorporated them as appropriate . our report recognizes that the military forces , which responded to hurricane katrina , were operating within existing regulatory and policy guidelines , such as the nrp , dod's strategy for homeland defense and civil support , and the current mobilization authorities , and the report recommends adjustments to some of these guidelines . the focus of this report was the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina , not hurricanes rita and wilma . however , where appropriate , we have incorporated information about lessons learned from katrina , such as the use of reconnaissance assets to assess damage from hurricane rita . we modified the report to show that commands had issued planning and warning orders prior to katrina's landfall . however , our report emphasizes the need for deliberative , advanced planning in addition to crisis action planning . we continue to believe that the solution to long - standing damage assessment problems requires military involvement . the first army comments provide additional information about the aviation picture over new orleans , but as stated in the report , search and rescue tasks were being assigned from two sites that were not integrated . this led to some duplication of effort . military officials told us that many of their troops worked directly with local officials and performed whatever tasks were most needed . they said that many of these tasks were not captured in official statistics or mission assignments . we agree that some operational overlap was inevitable , but limitations in planning led to inefficiencies and some duplication of effort . in addition to the contact named above , the following individuals also made contributions to this report: john pendleton , assistant director ; krislin bolling ; ann borseth ; alissa czyz ; amy dingler ; michael ferren ; richard geiger ; kenya jones ; tina kirschbaum ; patricia lentini ; brian mateja ; thomas mills ; elizabeth morris ; robert poetta ; gina saylor ; natalie schneider ; frank smith ; leo sullivan ; and steve woods . reserve forces: actions needed to better prepare the national guard for future overseas and domestic missions . gao - 05-21 . washington d.c.: november 10 , 2004 . reserve forces: observations on recent national guard use in overseas and homeland missions and future challenges . gao - 04-670t . washington d.c.: april 29 , 2004 . homeland defense: dod needs to assess the structure of u.s . forces for domestic military missions . gao - 03-670 . washington d.c.: july 11 , 2003 . chemical weapons: fema and army must be proactive in preparing states for emergencies .
