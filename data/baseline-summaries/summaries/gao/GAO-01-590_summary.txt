( see app . iii for more information on our human capital framework. ) although hud has begun to use our human capital self - assessment checklist to assess its human capital plans for the department as a whole , it has not developed a strategic human capital management plan for the homeownership centers . to its credit , hud has used napa's resource estimation model to determine the workforce needs at the centers and begun to consider succession planning . however , strategic human capital planning involves much more than determining workforce needs . integrating the results of its workforce analysis with other aspects of human capital planning , such as workforce deployment and training strategies , will enable hud to better position the centers for the future . as it reviews the centers' current and future workforce and training needs and plans for upcoming retirements at the centers , it can benefit from using our human capital self - assessment checklist to guide its efforts . to address the human capital challenges facing hud's homeownership centers , we recommend that the secretary of housing and urban development direct the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner to assess the deployment of the centers' workforce in light of current organizational needs , develop a plan for locating center staff where they are needed , and deploy the staff accordingly ; develop a training curriculum for center staff that ensures that available training funds are allocated and used to develop the skills that the staff need to perform their responsibilities ; and use tools , such as our human capital self - assessment checklist , to develop a strategic human capital management plan for the homeownership centers that considers all areas of human capital management , including the size of the workforce , workforce deployment , training , and oversight of contractors . the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner provided written comments on a draft of this report in a june 22 , 2001 , letter , which is reprinted in appendix iv . overall , hud agreed with our three recommendations , commenting as follows on each: hud stated that it is assessing the deployment of the centers' workforce in the course of implementing a resource estimation and allocation process . hud proposes to reduce the number of outstationed staff through attrition and develop a plan for redistributing the centers' workload . hud noted that it is currently identifying core skill requirements for each major program area and plans to develop a training curriculum for center staff that addresses these requirements . hud agreed that there is room for improvement in its human capital planning and management strategy . it noted that , in addition to using our human capital self - assessment checklist and implementing a resource estimation and allocation process , it is developing agency staffing plans and performing workforce analysis . it further noted that , because the human capital planning and management issues cited in our report are not unique to the homeownership centers , the department is addressing these issues in the overall context of its resource management efforts . hud also provided technical comments on specific issues discussed in the report .
