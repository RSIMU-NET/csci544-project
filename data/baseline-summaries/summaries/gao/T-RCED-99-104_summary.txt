ii ) . for the past few years , we have reviewed the accuracy of hud's budget proposals for the tenant - based and project - based components of this program and have found many inconsistencies . for example , in july 1998 , we reported that the department had not identified all available section 8 project - based unexpended balances and accounted for them in its budget process . as a result , hud requested $1.3 billion in its fiscal year 1999 request for project - based funding that it did not need to cover shortfalls in current contracts . however , some of these programs or initiatives may have been funded in prior years . fha mutual mortgage insurance and cooperative management housing insurance funds program account mortgage insurance limitation in fha's mutual mortgage insurance and cooperative management housing insurance funds 105 ( table notes on next page ) the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . balances in excess of those needed to fund shortfalls could be used to offset hud's request for contract renewal funding . hud's fiscal year 2000 budget justification raises other issues about its section 8 program request that we believe warrant review . these issues include the basis for the contract renewal costs for the section 8 project - based program for fiscal year 2000 — more than $3 billion — as well as the basis for renewal costs beyond 2000 . the budget proposal shows that hud's estimates of the unit costs of some project - based housing are substantially higher than hud projected just a year ago . moreover , unlike prior years , hud's fiscal year 2000 budget does not provide estimates of section 8 costs in the years following 2000 . therefore , we have requested information that would support hud's assumptions and source data for both the number of units and average unit costs for this program in fiscal year 2000 and for several years thereafter . this request includes seven set - asides totaling $210 million . five of the set - asides ( $60 million ) will be funded within the cdbg program and two ( $150 million ) in the home program .
