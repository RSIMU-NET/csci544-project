these practices are described later in this report . in addition , we interviewed dhs , fps , and gsa headquarters officials about how they work together . specifically , fps's law enforcement and protective security services authority include: ( 1 ) protecting federal employees and visitors in approximately 8,900 federal facilities under the control and custody of gsa ; ( 2 ) enforcing federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting such property and persons ( including proactively patrolling facilities , responding to incidents , and exercising arrest authority ) ; and ( 3 ) investigating criminal offenses against these facilities and persons . to fund its operations , fps collects security fees from the agencies it protects and does not receive a separate appropriation . fps conducts its mission by providing security services through two types of activities: physical security activities such as conducting facility risk assessments and recommending countermeasures — such as security cameras , bollards , barriers , physical access control systems , magnetometers , and x - ray machines — aimed at preventing incidents . we have previously reported that written agreements are most effective when they are regularly updated and monitored . in our prior work , we have reported on delays in updating the moa , and in 2012 , we recommended that the administrator of gsa ensure that the agency identifies the jurisdictions of all gsa buildings and that these data are provided to fps officials to better equip them to manage roles and responsibilities at gsa buildings , and an updated moa would help gsa implement the needed changes to address this issue . fps and gsa officials at the headquarters level have not been able to agree on the level of detail about roles and responsibilities or the services that should be included in the moa . after resuming negotiations in august 2015 , according to gsa , the issues needing further negotiation include: more detailed information on fps's billing to gsa for security costs and timely completion of facility security assessments ( fsa ) . according to fps , the issues needing further negotiations include: more clearly defining roles and responsibilities to improve fps and gsa collaboration on security matters and clarifying language that may have previously been subject to misinterpretation by parties in the field . as of october 2015 , fps and gsa officials told us that they plan to address the responsibilities for the condition of countermeasures — such as security cameras , magnetometers and x - ray machines — and fixtures — such as bollards , guard booths , and blast - resistant windows — at facilities in updating the moa . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . fps and gsa share responsibility for protecting federal facilities . fps is primarily responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in federal facilities held or leased by gsa . law enforcement activities such as proactively patrolling facilities , responding to incidents , conducting criminal investigations , and exercising arrest authority .
