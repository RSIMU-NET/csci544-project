additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . stdp is scheduled to be phased out in december 1996 . although oha has proposed that ssa extend expanded screening unit activities through december 1997 , as of september 1996 ssa had made no final decision on this . expanded prehearing conferencing , however , will remain active until june 30 , 1997 , when regulatory authority for senior attorneys to allow appealed cases expires . in fiscal year 1997 , ssa expects to implement certain features from its ongoing efforts to redesign the disability claims process . one of the features being tested is a new decision - making position to help expedite appealed claims through the process . like activities under stdp's expanded screening unit and prehearing conferencing initiatives , this position will enable someone other than an alj to review and allow some appealed cases , eliminating the need for an alj hearing . ssa acknowledges that it will not reach stdp's goal of reducing the backlog of appealed cases to 375,000 by december 1996 . in fact , oha's backlog of about 515,000 appealed cases as of august 1996 — about 22 months into stdp — was 3 percent higher than the backlog of about 500,000 that existed at the plan's inception . although ssa will not reach stdp's backlog reduction goal , the agency believes that the plan has helped to reduce the growth in the backlog of appealed cases awaiting a decision . since peaking at about 552,000 in december 1995 , oha's backlog decreased steadily by an average of about 4,600 appealed cases per month through august 1996 or by about 37,000 total appealed cases . as shown in figure 1 , oha's backlog decreased during each of the last two fiscal quarters of 1996 . as of august 31 , 1996 , the backlog was 515,009 appealed cases . oha's current projections indicate that its backlog of appealed cases will be approximately 498,000 at the end of calendar year 1996 or about 123,000 above stdp's target . oha is relying on increased productivity from its aljs and attorneys to increase its ability to dispose of cases and facilitate reaching this revised target . according to oha , its inability to reach stdp's backlog reduction goal is due to start - up delays , overly optimistic projections on the number of appealed cases that could be processed , and an unexpected increase in the number of appealed cases . figure 2 illustrates the disparity between the number of appealed cases oha expected to allow under stdp through december 1996 and the actual number that have been allowed through august 1996 — 22 months since the plan was initiated . start - up delays associated with prehearing conferencing — the initiative expected to have the greatest impact on reducing oha's backlog of appealed cases — have hindered ssa's ability to reach stdp's goals . to implement this initiative , ssa had to seek a regulatory change to give about 600 oha senior and supervisory staff attorneys the authority to decide certain appealed cases that were formerly limited to alj jurisdiction .
