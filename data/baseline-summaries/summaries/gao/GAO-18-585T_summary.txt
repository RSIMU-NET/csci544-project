referrals for investigation . according to the six plan sponsors we interviewed , the referrals can be made to cms's national benefit integrity medicare drug integrity contractor ( nbi medic ) , which was responsible for identifying and investigating potential part d fraud , waste , and abuse , or to the plan sponsor's own internal investigative unit , if they have one . after investigating a particular case , they may refer the case to the hhs - oig or a law enforcement agency , according to cms , nbi medic , and one plan sponsor . based on cms's use of the oms and the actions taken by plan sponsors , cms reported a 61 percent decrease from calendar years 2011 through 2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the oms criteria of high risk — from 29,404 to 11,594 beneficiaries — which agency officials considered an indication of success toward its goal of decreasing opioid use disorder . in addition , we found that cms relied on separate patient safety measures developed and maintained by the pharmacy quality alliance to assess how well part d plan sponsors were monitoring beneficiaries and taking appropriate actions . in 2016 , cms started tracking plan sponsors' performance on three patient safety measures that were directly related to opioids . the three measures were similar to the oms criteria in that they identified beneficiaries with high dosages of opioids ( 120 mg med ) , beneficiaries that use opioids from multiple providers and pharmacies , and beneficiaries that do both . however , one difference between these approaches was that the patient safety measures separately identified beneficiaries who fulfill each criterion individually . our october 2017 report also found that cms tracked the total number of beneficiaries who met all three oms criteria as part of its opioid overutilization oversight across the part d program . however , the agency did not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high doses of opioids — regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies used — and who therefore may be at risk for harm , according to cdc's 2016 guidelines . these guidelines noted that long - term use of high doses of opioids — those above a med of 90 mg per day — are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible . based on the cdc guidelines , outreach to part d plan sponsors , and cms analyses of part d data , cms has revised its current oms criteria to include more at - risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018 . the new oms criteria define a high user as an individual having an average daily med greater than 90 mg for any duration ; receiving opioids from four or more providers and four or more pharmacies , or from six or more providers regardless of the number of pharmacies , for the prior 6 months . based on 2015 data , cms found that 33,223 beneficiaries would have met these revised criteria .
