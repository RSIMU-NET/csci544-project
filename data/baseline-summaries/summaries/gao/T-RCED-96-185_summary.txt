fda is responsible . mr. chairman , this concludes my prepared remarks , we would be happy to respond to any questions you may have . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . some of these cases resulted in reactive arthritis . for example , one institution that treated 565 patients from this outbreak confirmed that 13 patients had developed reactive arthritis after consuming contaminated milk . in addition , 14 deaths may have been associated with this outbreak . listeria can cause meningitis and stillbirths and is fatal in 20 to 40 percent of cases . all foods may contain these bacteria , particularly poultry and dairy products . illnesses from this pathogen occur mostly in single cases rather than in outbreaks . the largest outbreak in north america occurred in 1985 in los angeles , largely in pregnant women and their fetuses . more than 140 cases of illness were reported , including at least 13 cases of meningitis . at least 48 deaths , including 20 stillbirths or miscarriages , were attributed to the outbreak . soft cheese produced in a contaminated factory was confirmed as the source . campylobacter may be the most common precipitating factor for guillain - barre syndrome , which is now one of the leading causes of paralysis from disease in the united states . campylobacter infections occur in all age groups , with the greatest incidence in children under 1 year of age . the vast majority of cases occur individually , primarily from poultry , not during outbreaks . researchers estimate that 4,250 cases of guillain - barre syndrome occur each year and that about 425 to 1,275 of these cases are preceded by campylobacter infections . while the overall annual cost of foodborne illnesses is unknown , the studies we reviewed estimate that it is in the billions of dollars . the range of estimates among the studies is wide , however , principally because of uncertainty about the number of cases of foodborne illness and related deaths . other differences stem from the differences in the analytical approach used to prepare the estimate .
