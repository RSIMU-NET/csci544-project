ii. ) for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 , pbs overestimated rental revenues by a combined total of $308.1 million , that according to the pbs' chief financial officer , was absorbed by reducing planned expenditures and using carryover balances without the need for congressional action . in addition , pbs reported a combined overestimate of $773.5 million for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 , which pbs dealt with as i will explain in a moment . it is important to note that the fiscal year 1996 and 1997 overestimation from the historical analysis does not match the amount reported to congress in january 1997 because the revenue estimates were made at different times . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . in using national averages , pbs relied on less accurate data for estimating than if it had used project - specific data . in addition , in its calculations , the national average rental rate for government - owned space was changed from $40 to $44 per square foot without supporting documentation explaining the reason for the change . additional problems with pbs' rental revenue estimation process have also been identified . for example , in july 1997 , arthur andersen reported that pbs lacked documentation for its budget methodology , including fbf , and had problems with its information and analysis systems as well as its pricing policies and practices . official , pbs will issue a directive on documenting the rental estimating process by april 1998 . in our review of pbs' fiscal year 1999 rental revenue estimate , we found that documentation had been prepared on the decisions , assumptions , and steps involved in the process . having such a benchmark , we believe , would put pbs in a better position to identify variances that need to be investigated so that it can explore and fix the causes of excessive variances , improve its estimation process , and determine its effectiveness over time . note 1: rental income does not include reimbursables , outleasing , and miscellaneous income ; therefore , these numbers are less than rental revenue in gsa's financial statements . this historical analysis does not match revenue overestimation reported to congress in january 1997 because the revenue estimates were made at different times . note 2: n / a = not available . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony .
