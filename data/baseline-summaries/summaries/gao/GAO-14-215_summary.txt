gao - 09-632t . our prior work has shown that strategic human capital management has been a pervasive challenge facing the federal government , and has led to government - wide and agency - specific skills gaps . our february 2011 update to our high risk list noted that federal strategic human capital management was a high risk area because current and emerging mission critical skills gaps were undermining agencies' abilities to meet their vital missions . to help close these skills gaps , we reported that actions were needed in three broad areas: planning , to identify the causes of , and solutions for , skills gaps and to identify the steps to implement those solutions ; implementation , to put in place corrective actions to narrow skills gaps through talent management and other strategies ; and measurement and evaluation , to assess the performance of initiatives to close skills gaps . with respect to pay and benefits as measured by each full - time equivalent ( fte ) position , total government - wide compensation grew by an average of 1.2 percent per year from 2004 to 2012 ( $106,097 to $116,828 â€” about a 10 percent overall increase ) . much of this growth was driven by increased cost of personnel benefits , which rose at a rate of 1.9 percent per year ( a 16.3 percent increase overall ) . according to omb , the government's contribution to the federal employee health benefits ( fehb ) program rose , on average , 5.2 percent from 2004 to 2011 and 4.7 percent from 2011 to 2012 . one study showed that employer contributions for premiums for family insurance coverage nationwide grew by about 58 percent from 2004 through 2012 , for an average annual increase of around 5 percent.spending rose at an average annual rate of 1 percent per year ( a 7.9 percent increase overall ) . while government - wide spending on pay and benefits rose slightly , some agencies had significant increases in their spending on compensation per fte . for example , the department of state's spending on pay and benefits per fte increased by 4.5 percent per year , on average , from 2004 through 2012 . in total , government - wide spending on pay and benefits increased by $51 billion , from $193.2 billion to $244.3 billion ( an average annual increase of 3 percent and an overall increase of 26.4 percent ) from 2004 to 2012 . in terms of employee pay per fte , spending on pay and benefits as a proportion of the federal discretionary budget remained relatively constant ( at about 14 percent ) from 2004 to 2010 , with slight increases in 2011 and 2012 . specifically , the proportion spent on pay increased by 0.6 percent and the proportion spent on benefits increased by 0.5 percent from 2004 to 2012 . according to omb , a portion of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the growth in federal civilian employment at certain agencies , locality pay adjustments , across - the - board pay increases , and ( as previously stated ) increases in the government's share of fehb program premiums .
