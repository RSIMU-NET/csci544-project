( app . i contains a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. ) we performed our work between january and december 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . in 2000 , approximately 59 million people aged 55 and over resided in the united states . the proportion of people aged 55 and over living in each state ranged from about 13 percent in alaska to about 27 percent living in florida ( see fig.1 ) . in program year 2000 , older workers received employment and training services from various federal employment and training programs , including the senior community service employment program ( scsep ) , the workforce investment act ( wia ) , and trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) programs . these programs have various eligibility requirements and offer employment and training services through different mechanisms . title v of the older americans act of 1965 authorizes scsep to promote part - time community service activities specifically for low - income older individuals and to foster economic self - sufficiency through unsubsidized employment . scsep , funded at $440.2 million in program year 2001 , is limited to people 55 years and older with incomes at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty level . for program year 2000 , labor allotted 78 percent of the funds to 10 national grantees , including the aarp foundation , experience works ( formerly green thumb ) , and the national council on the aging , inc. ( see appendix ii for a complete list of national grantees and funds expended in program year 2000. ) the remaining 22 percent was allotted to each of the 50 states , district of columbia , puerto rico , and the other territories . at least 75 percent of scsep funds must be used to subsidize participants' wages â€” typically for minimum wage jobs in nonprofit and public sector agencies . the remaining funds may be used for such activities as assessments , counseling , training , and job placement assistance . section 502 ( e ) of title v authorizes limited funds to be used for projects placing older workers in unsubsidized employment in the private sector . ( see appendix iii for more details on how these funds were used in program year 2000. ) these projects are intended to emphasize training for jobs that reflect required technological skills . taa programs assist u.s. workers who lose their jobs because of increased imports from , or shifts in production to , foreign countries . these programs provide benefits such as trade re - adjustment allowances ( extended income support beyond normal unemployment insurance benefits ) , services such as job training , and funds for job search and relocation . groups of workers or their representatives can petition the department of labor for certification of eligibility to apply for services or benefits under taa programs . in fiscal year 2001 , taa programs received about $407 million to provide income support and training benefits .
