( the u.s. contractor ) , no major delays have occurred in implementing the project because of the high level of cooperation from balakovo plant management and russian authorities . by working cooperatively with balakovo plant personnel , doe , brookhaven , and sonalysts , inc. developed 12 job - specific training courses and 6 general training courses for the plant . as of may 1996 , 6 of the 12 job - specific training programs and 3 of the 6 general courses had been completed . along with the training , doe is providing both course - specific equipment and equipment for the training center , such as circuit boards , soldering work stations , laser alignment equipment , computers , printers , and audiovisual equipment . equipment shipped from the united states to the balakovo training center has experienced some customs problems .
