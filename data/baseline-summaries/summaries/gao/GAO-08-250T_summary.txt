the smithsonian concurred with this recommendation . the governance committee found that previous policies regarding expense reimbursement ( including travel ) and conflict - of - interest policies were not well - defined , which contributed to the lack of oversight of certain practices of the former secretary as well as the failure to actively manage apparent conflicts of interest at the smithsonian . the board has clarified management policies on travel and expense reimbursement , and created new ones , such as prohibiting senior executives from serving on the boards of for - profit companies . we have not independently validated these changes to assess whether they will be effective in improving oversight , and it is not yet clear how these policies will improve the governance of the institution in practice . a compensation range to guide the search for a new secretary has been established . in response to concerns about the compensation of the former secretary ( which included , among other things , a housing allowance that some regents were unaware of ) , the board contracted for a study to identify a compensation range to guide the search for a new secretary , with the goals of making the secretary's compensation transparent and balancing the smithsonian's public trust status with the need to attract the best leader . according to a board of regents' staff member , the study included benchmarking with about 30 comparable organizations . in october , the board of regents approved the range recommended by the study to be used in the recruitment process . we have not independently validated this recommended range . several recommendations have not yet been fully implemented but are actively being considered and debated . for example , at the direction of the regents , the smithsonian is examining the extent to which smithsonian business ventures ( sbv ) , a centralized business entity responsible for the smithsonian's various business activities , should follow smithsonian - wide policies for areas such as contracting and travel . previously , sbv adopted its own policies and was not subject to all smithsonian policies . the efforts underway are preliminary and final actions have not yet been taken , but the regents report them as being on track toward implementation . in addition , in august 2007 , the acting secretary established a task force to review the entirety of sbv and make recommendations on its governance , structure , and the role of revenue - generating activities within the smithsonian . those recommendations will be presented to the acting secretary by the end of the year and to the regents at their january 2008 meeting . the board of regents is continuing to study other important issues related to improving governance at the smithsonian . in particular , some observers have suggested that the size and composition of the board contributed to the lack of oversight of management practices , and in response , the board of regents , with the assistance of outside consultants , is evaluating potential structural changes to the board . the report is due in january 2008 . any changes to the size and composition of the board would require legislative action .
