iii. ) in each year , more than 31 of the 46 states for which we had data had three or fewer issuers in the shop exchange ; therefore between one and three issuers held 100 percent of the market share for the state . among states with four or more issuers , the market share of the three largest issuers was typically at least 80 percent . for example , california had 6 participating issuers from 2015 through 2017 in the shop exchange , and the market share for the three largest issuers in that state ranged from 92 to 93 percent across the 3 years . ( see fig . on average , the number of participating issuers in the shop exchange decreased slightly from 2015 through 2017 . however , in a few states , there were larger changes in issuer participation and concentration . for example , ohio's shop exchange had 7 participating issuers in 2015 , decreasing to 4 issuers in 2017 . across this time period , the market share of the three largest issuers in ohio's shop exchange increased from 59 percent to 98 percent . conversely , new york's shop exchange had 10 issuers in 2015 , decreasing to 8 issuers in 2017 ; but the market share of the three largest issuers decreased by almost 7 percentage points within that time . further , we found that in at least 38 of 46 states each year from 2015 through 2017 , the largest issuer held at least 50 percent of the shop exchange market share . in 23 states , the market share of the largest issuer increased during this period , with a median increase of 11 percentage points , and in 6 additional states the largest issuer was the only issuer in the shop exchange and thus held 100 percent market share for all 3 years . ( see fig . for example: in kentucky , the market share of the largest issuer in the shop exchange increased by 56 percentage points , from 42 percent in 2015 to 98 percent in 2017 . in 2015 , the largest issuer was kentucky health cooperative , a co - op that exited the shop exchange after 2016 . the second largest issuer in 2015 , wellpoint inc. group , increased market share over this time period , from 33 percent in 2015 to 98 percent in 2017 , becoming the largest issuer . the market share of the other remaining issuer in kentucky's shop exchange , baptist health plan , inc. , decreased from 19 percent in 2015 to 1 percent in 2017 . in ohio , the market share of the largest issuer in the shop exchange increased by 54 percentage points , from 29 percent in 2015 to 83 percent in 2017 . across this time period , the largest issuer changed from medical mutual of ohio ( which had 29 percent market share in 2015 and 8 percent in 2017 ) to wellpoint inc. group ( which had 12 percent market share in 2015 and 83 percent in 2017 ) . this increase in the largest issuer's market share corresponded with a decrease in issuer participation .
