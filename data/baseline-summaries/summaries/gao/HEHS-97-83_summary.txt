dod . to accomplish the first objective , vri compared the annual life cycle cost of various types of mhss mental health care providers with the annual life cycle cost of a prescribing psychologist . to address the remaining two objectives , vri conducted what it referred to as a feasibility analysis of the pdp . vri issued a report on this work on may 17 , 1996 . to determine the relative cost - effectiveness of training and employing prescribing psychologists relative to other dod health care providers , vri compared its estimate of dod's average annual life cycle cost of a prescribing psychologist with its estimate of this cost for clinical psychologists , psychiatrists , physicians specializing in internal medicine , and physicians specializing in family practice . it calculated these costs on the basis of three scenarios: the “base” case scenario , which is the status quo , a combination of psychologists and psychiatrists , with no prescribing psychologists in the mhss ; the “start - up” case scenario for prescribing psychologists , which had all the same elements of the base scenario but accounted for the introduction of prescribing psychologists into the mhss ; and the “optimal” case scenario for prescribing psychologists , which represented a modification of the start - up scenario . costs in the start - up scenario included the nonrecurring , fixed costs associated with the pdp development and initial implementation as well as other costs for the pdp that vri also believed would diminish or disappear in the long run . the optimal scenario represents the pdp in a long - term , steady state , during which no recurring costs associated with start - up and optimal class size would accrue . in this scenario , vri set the cost of supplies and training to levels that indicate long - term efficiency . the following are the main steps in vri's cost - effectiveness analysis: 1 . calculate life cycle costs for active - duty military psychiatrists , family practitioners , internists , and clinical psychologists ; then calculate the cost per full - time equivalent ( fte ) for each of these by dividing their respective life cycle cost by their respective expected length of service ( length of service minus unproductive time while in training ) . calculate life cycle costs for prescribing psychologists using actual and anticipated costs for a pdp sized at six and at three psychologists per class ; and then , under both the start - up and base scenarios , calculate the cost per fte for prescribing psychologists assuming that they ( 1 ) serve as clinical psychologists before entering the pdp and ( 2 ) after which they prescribe psychotropic medication . calculate the cost per fte for the combination of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists that could be replaced by a prescribing psychologist . compare the annual life cycle cost per fte of prescribing psychologists under start - up and optimal scenarios with the cost per fte of the psychologist - psychiatrist combination . vri's estimates of the annual life cycle cost per fte of various types of providers accounted for the cost of acquiring each type of provider , training costs , “force” costs , and retirement costs associated with each .
