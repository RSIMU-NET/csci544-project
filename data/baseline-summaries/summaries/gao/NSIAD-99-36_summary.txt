ii ) . we performed our review between august 1997 and september 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . we obtained dod comments on a draft of this report . the comments have been summarized in chapters 2 through 5 and are presented in their entirety in appendix v . by the end of fiscal year 1998 , dod had completed action on about 85 percent of 451 brac commissions' recommendations for the four brac rounds . the four brac commissions actually generated 499 recommendations ; however , only 451 of these ultimately required action because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of a later commission . according to dod documentation , all of the 1988 and 1991 round recommendations have been completed within the statutory 6-year period . furthermore , from the first round to the second , the services accelerated the pace at which they completed recommendations , from an average of just under 5-1 / 2 years for the first round to just over 3 years for the second . dod's plans to complete remaining 1993 and 1995 round recommendations indicate that the pace will be consistent with the 1991 round . despite timely completion of brac recommended actions , disposal of unneeded base property is proceeding slowly . about 464,000 acres were designated as unneeded real property at closing or realigning locations , but , as of march 1998 , only about 31 percent of the property designated for nonfederal users had actually been transferred by formal deed , and only 8 percent of the property designated for federal entities had actually been transferred . dod and service officials cited various impediments such as environmental cleanup that extend property disposal time frames . to help ease this situation , dod has been using interim leasing to get usable property to users quicker until a deed transfer can be issued . nonetheless , dod has much to do before it completes the transfer of its unneeded property . dod has typically reported to the congress on its progress in implementing brac actions that the services have defined as major . according to a dod official , dod has completed 77 of 152 major recommendations . however , what constitutes a major or minor recommendation is not always apparent because the services define these terms differently . we analyzed all brac commissions' recommendations directed to the military departments and defense agencies . our count of 499 recommendations is based on the brac commissions' reports , which are somewhat arbitrary in the way they enumerate recommendations . for example , a closure or a realignment in which several missions are disestablished or relocated may count as one recommendation or several . the types of recommendations are shown in figure 2.1 . overall , according to dod data , 383 , or about 85 percent , of 451 recommendations were completed as of september 30 , 1998 , including all recommendations associated with the 1988 and 1991 rounds ; 68 actions remain in process . for the 1993 and 1995 rounds , the completion rates were 87 and 60 percent , respectively , at that time . further , dod reported completing recommendations within mandated time frames .
