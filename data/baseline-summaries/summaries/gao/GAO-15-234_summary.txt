number of employees . the number of employees at hubzone firms ranged from 1 to 496 , with a median of 4 employees for all years except 2009 and 2010 , in which the median was 5 . current definition . under the current definition , 424 nonmetropolitan counties would qualify as a hubzone . lowest state unemployment rate . if 140 percent of the lowest state unemployment rate ( 2.9 percent ) was applied to all counties and states , almost 1,700 counties would qualify . under this scenario , for example , texas would go from 16 qualified nonmetropolitan counties to almost 150 . highest state unemployment rate . if 140 percent of the highest state unemployment rate ( 9.8 percent ) was applied to all counties and states , there would only be 54 qualified nonmetropolitan counties nationwide . thirty - four states would not have any qualified nonmetropolitan counties , while kentucky and mississippi would have the most , with 9 each . applying u.s. average unemployment rate . if 140 percent of the u.s. average unemployment rate ( 7.4 percent ) was applied uniformly to all counties and states , 301 nonmetropolitan counties would qualify . average of all state unemployment rates . if 140 percent of the average of all state unemployment rates ( 6.8 percent ) was used , about 450 counties would qualify . under this scenario , states with relatively high unemployment rates would have additional nonmetropolitan counties ( such as georgia , which would have 17 additional qualifying counties ) , while states with relatively low unemployment rates would have fewer qualifying counties ( such as virginia , which would have 20 fewer ) . in addition to comparing all nonmetropolitan counties against the same unemployment rate , the qualifying criteria could be changed from the current standard ( data from 1 year ) to use a 5- or 10-year average unemployment rate to determine if a nonmetropolitan county qualified for the program . such a change could minimize the wide variations that can occur by using the 1-year rates . for example , the average unemployment rates that equaled 140 percent of the u.s. unemployment rate ranged from 6.4 percent in 2006 and 2007 to 13.4 percent in 2010 . similarly , the difference between the states with the highest and lowest unemployment rates ranged from 6 percentage points in 2004 to about 14 percentage points in 2010 . however , using a 5- or 10-year average unemployment rate would result in fewer counties qualifying as a hubzone . using a 5-year unemployment rate . if a 5-year average unemployment rate were used , 345 nonmetropolitan counties would qualify . with the change from 1- to 5-year , additional counties in 6 states would become eligible , while the number of eligible counties in 21 states would decrease . the net number of affected counties would range from 6 added to 15 eliminated . using a 10-year unemployment rate . if a 10-year average unemployment rate were used , 377 nonmetropolitan counties would qualify . under this adjustment , 10 states would have more counties eligible and 18 would have fewer .
