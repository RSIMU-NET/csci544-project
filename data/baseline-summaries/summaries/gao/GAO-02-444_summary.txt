106-230 requires . data on forms filed between july 2000 , when the law became effective , and march 2002 suggest that many organizations are not meeting this requirement . as of march 2002 , irs had received 11,586 electronic and 13,752 paper forms 8871 . an irs official said irs is aware of this discrepancy of nearly 2,000 more paper forms than electronic forms . although the p.l . 106-230 penalties cover timeliness of filings , irs does not check the timeliness of forms 8871 and only checks timeliness for one aspect of forms 8872 . for forms 8871 , irs officials said that they did not check whether section 527 organizations filed within the required 24 hours . for forms 8872 , irs monitored the filing timeframes that govern the required pre - and post - election periods for federal general elections , but not other timeframes . finally , irs does not perform checks to determine whether section 527 organizations have filed all required forms 8871 and 8872 . our analysis of irs data indicates that some section 527 organizations may not be meeting the filing requirements . 107-155 , determining the level of irs and fec disclosure or oversight of a section 527 organization depends on the activities of the organization . these include the timing , operations , and parties involved in the activities . according to fec officials , this raises the possibility that section 527 organizations will report some activities to irs and others to fec , even during the same time in an election cycle . the overlapping agency responsibilities for section 527 organizations raises questions about the degree and type of coordination that will be needed for future section 527 disclosure and oversight efforts by irs and fec . for example , section 501 ( c ) ( 5 ) unions will be prohibited from spending their treasury funds for newly defined electioneering communications . fec will need to oversee union activities to enforce this prohibition while irs will continue to have responsibility for overseeing whether section 501 ( c ) ( 5 ) unions engage in political activities that exceed those permissible for tax - exempt organizations . similarly , if a section 527 organization runs a “promote or attack” advertisement as defined by p.l . 107-155 , disclosure and oversight responsibility depends on whether the organization coordinated with a candidate's committee . thus , both agencies will need to know whether the advertisements run by section 527 organizations include such advertisements . irs does not use existing data , such as from the form 990 , that it receives from section 527 and other tax - exempt organizations to identify section 527 organizations that might not be filing required forms 8871 and 8872 , or section 501 ( c ) ( 4-6 ) organizations that should have established a separate segregated fund for their political activities and filed forms 8871 and 8872 . some options exist for starting to match these data to identify noncompliance such as unfiled forms 8871 and 8872 . irs could use the form 990 data to calculate the ratio of a section 501 ( c ) organization's political activity expenditures to its total expenses .
