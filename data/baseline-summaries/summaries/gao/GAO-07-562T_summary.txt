washington , dc . gao - 07-512t . washington , d.c.: march 7 , 2007 . high - risk series: an update . gao - 07-310 . this can significantly increase the time it takes to decide a claim . in december 2006 , we recommended that vba assess whether it could systematically utilize an electronic library of historical military records rather than submitting all research requests to jsrrc . vba agreed to determine the feasibility of regional offices using an alternative resource prior to sending some requests to jsrrc . va has recently taken several steps to improve claims - processing . in its fiscal year 2008 budget justification , va identified an increase in claims - processing staff as essential to reducing the pending claims inventory and improving timeliness . according to va , with a workforce that is sufficiently large and correctly balanced , it can successfully meet the veterans' needs while ensuring good stewardship of taxpayer funds . the fiscal year 2008 request would fund 8,320 full - time equivalent employees working on compensation and pension , which would represent an increase of about 6 percent over fiscal year 2006 . the commission is scheduled to report the results of its study to the congress in october 2007 . several factors are continuing to create challenges for va's claims processing , despite its steps to improve performance . while va made progress in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 reducing the size and age of its pending claims inventory , it has lost ground since then . this is due in part to increased filing of claims , including those filed by veterans of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts . other factors include increases in claims complexity , the effects of recent laws and court decisions , and challenges in acquiring needed evidence in a timely manner . va's steps to improve performance include requesting funding for additional staff and undertaking initiatives to reduce appeal remands . va's inventory of pending claims and their average time pending has increased significantly in the last 3 years , in part because of an increase in the number of claims . the number of pending claims increased by almost one - half from the end of fiscal year 2003 to the end of fiscal year 2006 , from about 254,000 to about 378,000 . during the same period , the number of claims pending longer than 6 months increased by more than three - fourths , from about 47,000 to about 83,000 ( see fig . similarly , as shown in figure 2 , va reduced the average age of its pending claims from 182 days at the end of fiscal year 2001 to 111 days at the end of fiscal year 2003 . however , by the end of fiscal year 2006 , average days pending had increased to 127 days . meanwhile , the time required to resolve appeals remains too long . the average time to resolve an appeal rose from 529 days in fiscal year 2004 to 657 days in fiscal year 2006 . the increase in va's inventory of pending claims , and their average time pending is due in part to an increase in claims receipts .
