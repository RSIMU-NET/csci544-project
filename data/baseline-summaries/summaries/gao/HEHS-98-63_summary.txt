( see app . iii for further details on our analyses. ) we did use the 1989-90 survey as a point of comparison for the overall portion of undergraduates who worked while enrolled . similarly , we focused our analysis of undergraduate students' work patterns on students included in npsas' 1992-93 and 1995-96 surveys who enrolled as undergraduates for their first term during the may 1 through april 30 time period , and attended full - time for a full year ( 9 months ) . what information is available concerning the amounts of education debt parents incur ? our review was based in large part on our analysis of data collected by the department of education as part of the national postsecondary student aid study ( npsas ) . we focused our analysis primarily on two academic or student years: 1992-93 and 1995-96 . we focused on 1995-96 because it was the most recent year for which data were available . we chose 1992-93 for a comparison because it ( 1 ) predated the most recent round of increases in maximum limits on the amounts of loans available through the government's major student loan programs , and ( 2 ) like 1995-96 , was a year in which the department identified students who had graduated from their academic programs . the use of these survey data allowed us to estimate averages for the student population as a whole , as well as narrow the comparison to groups that had completed their educational programs . appendix i describes our methodology in further detail . appendix ii provides additional data , including confidence intervals , for the estimates presented . the 1985 through 1995 period saw an increase in both the number of college students and the proportion of the college - aged population in colleges , universities , training schools , and other postsecondary institutions . in 1995 , more than 34 percent of all 18- to 24-year - old u.s. residents were attending postsecondary schools , compared with slightly less than 28 percent in 1985 . what changes have occurred in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who work and the number of hours they work ? how do undergraduate borrowing and work patterns differ by type of school , year in school , dependency status , family income , and race / ethnicity ? many who attend also plan to stay longer: two - thirds of college freshmen now intend to go beyond a baccalaureate degree , compared with about half in 1980 . in part , this interest in postsecondary education likely reflects students' recognition that such education is associated with higher incomes later in life . as the number of students has increased , so has the size of the government's student loan programs . by the end of fiscal year 1996 , the estimated outstanding amount of loans provided by the department of education's two largest loan programs , the principal sources of loans for postsecondary education , had reached $112 billion , up from $91 billion a year earlier and from $65 billion in 1990 , in constant 1995-96 dollars . the higher education amendments of 1992 increased the maximum amount that students could borrow .
