gao - 08-1109r . washington , d.c.: september 26 , 2008 . epa agreed with our recommendations in these areas . gao - 08-1111r . washington , d.c.: september 18 , 2008 . addressing human capital issues . epa has struggled for several years to identify its needs for human resources and to deploy its staff throughout the country in a manner that would do the most good . we found that epa's process for budgeting and allocating resources does not fully consider the agency's current workload , and that in preparing requests for funding and staffing , epa makes incremental adjustments , largely based on an antiquated workforce planning system that does not reflect a bottom - up review of the nature or distribution of the current workload . moreover , epa's human capital management systems have not kept pace with changes that have occurred over the years as a result of changing legislative requirements and priorities , changes in environmental conditions in different regions of the country , and the much more active role that states now play in carrying out day - to - day - activities of federal environmental programs . to remedy its antiquated and unscientific methods for determining workload and allocating staff resources , we recommended that epa substantially improve its resource planning by identifying the factors that derive the national and regional workload and develop more realistic allocation systems for deploying staff with the requisite skills and capabilities to areas of the country where they are most needed to address the highest - priority needs . epa has not paid sufficient attention to human capital issues over the years . during the past several years , epa has taken a number of actions to improve its workforce management . for example , the agency has developed a strategic approach to ensure that it has , and will continue to have , the requisite competencies to carry out its programs effectively . nonetheless , the number of regional staff at individual offices and their skills and competencies continue to be driven primarily by historical staffing patterns rather than a fresh assessment of regional needs , given the regional workload and the role that states play in the enforcement process , which varies greatly from region to region . improving development and use of environmental information . critical , reliable environmental information is needed to provide better scientific understanding of environmental trends and conditions and to better inform the public about environmental progress in their locales . we found substantial gaps between what is known and the goal of full , reliable , and insightful representation of environmental conditions and trends to provide direction for future research and monitoring efforts . epa has struggled with providing a focus and the necessary resources for environmental information since its inception in 1970 . while many data have been collected over the years , most water , air , and land programs lack the detailed environmental trend information to address the well - being of americans . epa program areas have also been hampered by deficiencies in their environmental data systems .
