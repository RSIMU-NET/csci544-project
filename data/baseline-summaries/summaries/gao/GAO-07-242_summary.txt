occ has used the authority twice . all four regulators said that section 38's dismissal authority under section 38 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( f ) is valuable as a deterrent and a potential tool , despite their infrequent use of it — fdic has used the authority six times since 1992 and occ once ; the federal reserve and ots have never used the authority . they said that the pca authority occupies the middle ground between moral suasion and the removal and prohibition authority under section 8 ( e ) of fdia . according to the regulators , the first step in confronting problem officers and directors is moral suasion — that is , reminding the board of directors that it has an obligation to ensure that the institution is competently managed . in many cases , we were told that this reminder often is enough to force the resignations of problem individuals . dismissal under section 38 represents a “middle of the road” option — it results in a ban from serving as an officer or director in the institution in question . in order to be reinstated , the dismissed individual must demonstrate that he or she has the capacity to materially strengthen the institution's ability to become adequately capitalized or correct unsafe or unsound conditions or practices . regulators also have a more severe option — removal under section 8 ( e ) , which results in an industrywide prohibition and consequently , requires proof of a high degree of misconduct or malfeasance . as a result , according to officials we interviewed from one trade group , management might be less willing to discuss with examiners issues or problems that could prompt a lower rating , although raising and resolving such problems ultimately might be good for both the institution and the insurance fund . fdic officials acknowledged the concern , and said that fdic and the other federal regulators plan to monitor the new system for adverse effects . however , they said that it was important to include camels ratings in the assessment of risk because the ratings provide valuable information about institutions' financial and operational health . finally , officials from one trade association and one of the large banks with whom we spoke also expressed concern that regional or smaller institutions could be disadvantaged under the new system . officials from two credit rating agencies echoed this view , saying that larger , more diverse institutions ( by virtue of factors such as revenue , geography , or range of activities ) typically have steadier income , which increases security and decreases risk . in contrast , regional or smaller institutions can have geographic or line - of - business concentrations in their lending portfolios that could hurt supervisory or credit ratings , leading to higher deposit insurance premiums . fdic said that while size or geography could affect an institution's risk profile , management could offset that risk by maintaining superior earnings or capital reserves , requiring higher collateral requirements on loans , or using hedging vehicles .
