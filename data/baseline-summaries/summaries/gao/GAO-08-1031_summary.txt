( see app . ii for data on iraqi crude oil export revenue from these different sources. ) crude oil export revenues increased an average of about 30 percent each year from 2005 to 2007 due to increases in oil exports and price . for 2008 , we estimate that iraq could generate between $73.5 billion to $86.2 billion in total revenues . table 1 displays the projected total revenues , based on six scenarios projecting oil export revenues by varying price and volume of exports . these scenarios assume that tax and other revenues ( a small portion of total revenues ) will be $6.9 billion for 2008 but that export oil revenues will vary based on the price iraq receives for its oil and the volume it exports . as a result , we project that iraq could generate between $66.5 billion and $79.2 billion in oil revenues in 2008 , more than twice the average annual amount iraq generated from 2005 through 2007 . these scenarios use the actual prices iraq received for its oil exports over the first 6 months of 2008 , as reported by the central bank of iraq . for the last 6 months of 2008 , we varied the volume exported from 1.89 to 2.01 mbpd and price received from $96.88 to $125.29 per barrel . for a detailed discussion of these scenarios , see appendix iii . the following section provides information on the government of iraq's estimated expenditures from 2005 through 2007 , expenditure ratios from 2005 through 2007 , and estimated expenditures for 2008 . from 2005 through 2007 , the iraqi government spent an estimated $67 billion on a variety of operating and investment activities , as reported by the ministry of finance . as displayed in table 2 , iraq's expenditures can be divided between operating and investment expenditures . operating expenses include salaries and pensions , operating goods and services , interest payments , subsidies to public and private enterprises , social benefits , and other transfers . investment expenses include capital goods and capital projects such as structures , machinery , and vehicles . our analysis of ministry of finance data on iraqi expenditures from 2005 through 2007 found the following: iraq spent 90 percent of the $67 billion on operating expenses and a smaller portion of these funds — about 10 percent — on investment expenses . iraq's dollar expenditures grew by about 23 percent per year , from $17.6 billion to $26.6 billion , largely due to increased spending on iraqi security personnel . ( see app . v for details on expenditures by the security ministries and other selected ministries. ) however , annual average growth rates computed in iraqi dinars were 13 percent per year . growth rates in dinar may be more informative since iraq spends its budget in dinars . we conducted this performance audit from may to august 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . appendix i contains a more detailed description of our scope and methodology . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
