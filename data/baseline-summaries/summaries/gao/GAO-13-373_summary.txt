maine . maine has conducted one replacement pilot and has one ongoing program . maine housing authority's ( mainehousing ) replacement pilot — conducted from november 2008 through august 2010 — was the largest - scale pilot we identified to replace older manufactured homes . under the pilot , maine replaced 35 older manufactured homes with new , energy star - rated manufactured homes . the program was funded with approximately $2 million in state funds provided by the housing opportunities for maine ( maine home ) fund along with $148,000 in mortgage financing from mainehousing's home mortgage program . according to maine officials , the intent of the program was for the beneficiary to secure a 30-year first mortgage at a 5.25 percent interest rate with home mortgage program funds for part of the cost of the replacement home and a second deferred mortgage with the maine home funds for the balance — deferred in this case meaning that beneficiaries made no interest or principal payments if they stayed in the home . however , of the 35 beneficiaries , 9 could afford the 30-year first mortgage . loans for these 9 beneficiaries ranged from $8,000 to $40,000 , which covered an average 24 percent of the cost of their replacement homes , with the balance covered by the second , deferred maine home mortgage . for the remaining 26 beneficiaries who were unable to afford the 30-year first mortgage , the replacement was wholly funded using a maine home deferred mortgage . under either loan structure , no down payment or application fee was required . according to maine officials , potential beneficiaries were selected with input from community action agencies and were drawn from liheap rolls . to be eligible , beneficiaries' manufactured homes were required to have been built before 1976 and deemed unsuitable for weatherization . beneficiaries were also required to own the land on which the home was situated . the first pilot ended in 2010 when all the available funding was used , and officials told us they have another pilot ongoing . montana . montana's replacement pilot — conducted from december 2008 through september 2010 — replaced 19 manufactured homes with more energy efficient models . it was initially conceived not as a pilot , but as an ongoing program ; however , when private underwriting for loans for replacement homes could not be secured , the program was turned into a pilot . under the pilot , beneficiaries received a replacement home using a combination of state funds and federal grant funds . total funding for the program was approximately $804,448 and consisted of $354,886 from the state's general fund and about $449,562 funded by a combination of montana board of housing first - time homebuyer assistance and the u.s. hud's home investment partnerships ( hud home ) program . under the pilot , beneficiaries received a deferred , forgivable 15-year loan , which required no down payment and no monthly payments on the loan . like montana's pilot , the beneficiary was not required to own the land on which the home was situated ; however , unlike montana , the pilot required the beneficiary to have only a 1-year lease on the land .
