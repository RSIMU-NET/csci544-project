( see fig . nevertheless , pdmps cover about 47 percent of the nation's population , about 47 percent of the nation's dea - registered practitioners , and about 45 percent of the nation's pharmacies . some states have attempted to address these concerns statutorily . for example , some state laws to regulate controlled substances and to operate a pdmp include health privacy protection provisions . in addition , states with pdmps generally have statutory and regulatory protections to limit access and use of confidential health care data , as well as statutory penalties for misuse . ( 2 ) what benefits have state pdmps produced ? ( 3 ) what challenges do states face in implementing and using pdmps ? ( 4 ) what efforts are being made at the national level to address the illegal diversion of prescription drugs ? to address the questions concerning the state pdmps , we reviewed information from dea and the national alliance for model state drug laws on the features of the existing programs . to gain a more in - depth understanding of these programs and the challenges they face , we studied the pdmps in kentucky , nevada , and utah . we selected these three because they were the most recently established programs . we interviewed pdmp administrators and stakeholders in these three states . we also discussed pdmps with officials from purdue pharma l.p. , the manufacturer of oxycontin and other prescription drugs . to determine what activities are being pursued at the national level to reduce illegal diversion of prescription drugs , we interviewed experts from dea , the national alliance for model state drug laws , the national association of state controlled substance authorities , and the bureau of justice assistance in the department of justice , and reviewed pertinent documents . we performed our work from october 2001 through april 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . the diversion and abuse of prescription drugs are associated with incalculable costs to society in terms of addiction , overdose , death , and related criminal activities . dea has stated that the diversion and abuse of legitimately produced controlled pharmaceuticals constitute a multibillion - dollar illicit market nationwide . one recent example of this growing diversion problem is the controlled substance oxycodone , the active ingredient in over 20 prescription drugs , including oxycontin , percocet , and percodan . oxycontin has become the nation's number one prescribed narcotic medication for treating chronic severe and moderate pain . a single 40-milligram oxycontin tablet legally selling for about $4 is worth about $40 on the illicit market . as of february 2002 , oxycontin has been involved in 464 deaths from prescription drug abuse , as reported by dea on the basis of medical examiners' autopsy findings for 2000 and 2001 from 32 states . combating the illegal diversion of prescription drugs while ensuring that the pharmaceuticals remain available for those with legitimate medical need involves the efforts of both federal and state government agencies . the controlled substances act of 1970 provides the legal framework for the federal government's oversight of the manufacture and wholesale distribution of controlled substances . the states address these issues through their regulation of the practice of medicine and pharmacy .
