pub . 112-239 , ยง 864. items . because the cap is concerned with cost - based contracts , we excluded commercial item contracts , as well as contractors that only had obligations on firm fixed price contracts and / or fixed - price with economic price adjustment contracts . we based our selection of contractors on data from usaspending.gov . we selected contractors from four strata based primarily on fiscal year 2012 contract obligations: ( 1 ) contractors with obligations greater than $25 billion ( 2 contractors selected ) ; ( 2 ) contractors with obligations between $2 billion and $25 billion ( 8 contractors selected ) ; ( 3 ) contractors with obligations between $15 million and $2 billion ( 10 contractors selected ) ; and ( 4 ) contractors with obligations between $1 million and $15 million ( 10 contractors selected ) . this sample is not generalizable , but is designed to illustrate the potential impact that reducing the cap would have on contractors of varying sizes . for the purposes of this report , we refer to contractors from the first two selection groups as large - tier contractors , the third group as mid - tier contractors , and the fourth group as small - tier contractors . the 30 contractors received about 25 percent of all fiscal year 2012 dod contract obligations . we requested data on a number of items , including the estimated number of employees with compensation costs that would have been allowable but for the cap and exceeded the contractor fiscal year 2010 cap of $693,951 ; the fiscal year 2011 cap of $763,029 ; and , for fiscal year 2012 , the amount of $763,029 . contractors included data on the estimated number of employees whose compensation would have exceeded the cap had it been set at the salaries of the president and vice president in fiscal years 2010-2012 , the estimated number of contractor employees performing under government contracts who were granted stock options or restricted stock , and the potential effects of reducing the cap . in our data request , we asked for data on most questions for fiscal years 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 . usaspending.gov is a free , publicly accessible website established by the office of the cap of $763,029 is for fiscal year 2011 and subsequent contractor fiscal years , unless and until revised by the office of federal procurement policy . at the time of this review it had not published a revised cap amount for 2012 . therefore , for the purposes of this review , we used the 2011 cap for analysis of 2012 data . to simplify the data request , we collected for fiscal year 2011 information on some questions where we determined one year of information was sufficient to provide useful insights , such as questions related to the number of employees at different management levels and a question about employee job titles . in these instances , we chose fiscal year 2011 rather than fiscal year 2012 to ensure that contractors would have the information available at the time of our request .
