additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . cost estimates for these projects were not available . according to a u.s. embassy official , no specific assignments of military personnel have been made to date . another factor affecting the mobile basing concept's implementation is the may 1 , 1994 , decision to stop sharing certain drug - trafficking information with the governments of colombia and peru , which we reported on in august 1994 . this step was taken because of legal concerns about the probable criminal liability of u.s. personnel who provide information that could lead to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft suspected of transporting illegal drugs . according to u.s. officials , the sharing of real - time information is critical to ensuring that they can take timely action against drug - trafficking activities to increase the risks associated with these activities . the officials stated that the policy decision had impacted on their ability to conduct antidrug operations . although the impact that the policy has had on the flow of drugs being shipped from peru to colombia is unclear , it is clear that pilots flying between peru and colombia have changed their operations , since there is little fear of interception by u.s. and peruvian forces as long as detection capabilities remain negligible and there is no sharing of information . various u.s. reports and officials have stated that , before the may decision , drug traffickers wanted to minimize their exposure to the air interdiction threat . thus , they ( 1 ) used fewer flights with larger drug loads , ( 2 ) flew mainly in the early evening hours , and ( 3 ) spent on an average only about 10 to 12 minutes in loading and unloading their cargoes . u.s. officials in peru said that since the policy change , drug traffickers have changed their operations and ( 1 ) have begun multiple flights with smaller drug loads and ( 2 ) have begun flying during the day , and some traffickers have doubled their time on the ground . in addition , u.s. officials stated that an analysis of flight patterns indicates that traffickers are reverting to more direct air routes from peru into colombia instead of the indirect and more time - consuming routes they were taking before the cutoff of information . dea officials advised us that the policy to not share real - time information has caused them to forego law enforcement operations against illegal drug activities . u.s. embassy personnel stated that u.s. personnel are not allowed to leave the hotel unless they are transported in official vehicles to and from work because of security concerns . according to nas personnel , morale at santa lucia was much better because personnel were free to move around the base after work and tended to interact more readily . with the loss of u.s. support to santa lucia , the government of peru agreed to administer the base and maintain it as a location from which antidrug operations could be conducted .
