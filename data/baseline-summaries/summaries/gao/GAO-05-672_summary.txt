( see fig . after several days of extensive searches in the area , dtra recovered both stolen sources . because the source of this information is sensitive , we did not report its origin . dtra officials told us they found this data to be unreliable , but it did match well with sources found at some sites . for our assessment of the data , we reviewed the inventory and interviewed key dtra and contractor staff who worked with this information . we found major discrepancies , including duplications resulting in multiple counts of the same sources and evidence of incomplete data . therefore , we did not use this data in our report . we assessed the reliability of a may 2004 inventory of sources collected in iraq that dtra had created before the removal mission , and we determined that , for the purposes of this report , the inventory was not sufficiently reliable to ascertain the number and types of sources , but the inventory was reliable enough to identify the general locations of places where sources were found . to assess this data , we obtained responses to questions regarding data reliability by interviewing key dtra and contractor staff who worked with this information . we also corroborated the data whenever possible with doe experts and doe's inventories of collected sources taken to the united states and those left in iraq . dtra's contractor staff told us they were unable to open some containers and counted each of them as one source . details of our methodology are provided in appendix i . widespread looting — including looting of radiological sources — became a major problem in iraq after the march 2003 coalition forces invasion , complicating u.s. efforts to secure and collect radiological sources . media reports of the looting at iraq's tuwaitha nuclear research center , for example , brought public attention to the scattering of radioactive materials throughout populated areas , posing health and safety risks to iraqis . in may 2003 , the iaea , which had inventoried nuclear and radiological materials at tuwaitha , raised concerns about iraqi citizens' exposure to radiation and publicly asked the united states to secure these materials . given the extensive looting , dod could not assume that facilities and items within them , including radiological sources , would remain intact or in place for later collection without being secured . many facilities that were no longer under the control of iraqis , such as abandoned government research facilities and industrial complexes , were looted . for example , a 2004 government report on the search for wmd stated that looters often destroyed sites after a coalition military unit moved through an area , since the coalition did not have the forces available to secure the various sites thought to be associated with wmd . according to one dtra official , the looting was more extensive than he had ever seen before . the looting was reported to have included removing wiring and pipes from walls and from the ground ; stealing desks , windows , sinks , and floors ; and even dismantling and removing whole buildings .
