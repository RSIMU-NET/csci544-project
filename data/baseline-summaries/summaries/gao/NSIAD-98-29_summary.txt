iv ) . dod stated that on november 13 , 1997 , air force headquarters provided guidance to the air force materiel command requesting a plan to correct deficiencies in managing suspended stock and initiate aggressive corrective actions . the plan is due to the air force by mid - december 1997 . we are sending copies of this report to other appropriate congressional committees , the secretaries of defense and the air force , and the director of the office of management and budget . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . we were not able to determine the value of these unnecessary repair costs . inventory managers have missed opportunities to fill orders with usable items because of the untimely handling of suspended inventory . as a result , suspended inventory is not available for use when needed by customers . when demands are made on the supply system and assets are not available to fill those demands , backorders result . for the suspended items in our sample , warner robins had over 2,000 concurrent backorders , worth about $53 million . about 65 percent of these backorders were essential to a weapon system's operation and thus adversely affected the system's ability to carry out all or portions of its assigned operational missions . if the duration of suspensions had been monitored and usability had been determined within a reasonable amount of time , over 500 of our sample items , worth about $7 million , could have been used to fill some of the backorders , as shown in table 2 . the following examples show how weaknesses in the management of suspended inventory can affect access to potentially usable inventory: warner robins had four data entry keyboards on backorder â€” two of which were classified as mission critical . the keyboards , valued at $16,000 each , are used on b - 52h aircraft . warner robins inventory records showed two keyboards ( see fig . 6 ) had been suspended in reclaimed inventory for over 2 years . in august 1997 , two b - 52h aircraft were not fully operational ( i.e. , unable to fly portions of their missions ) due to the unavailability of these keyboards . one aircraft had been unable to fly portions of its mission for 175 days and the other for 24 days . at the time of our visit , the item manager had not taken action to resolve the status of the keyboards . the scope and methodology of our work are described in appendix i . at the end of fiscal year 1996 , the air force reported that it was managing inventory valued at $29.3 billion . dod uses a coding system to categorize the condition of its inventory .
