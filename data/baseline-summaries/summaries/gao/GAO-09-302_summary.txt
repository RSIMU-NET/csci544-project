some examples are discussed below . because efforts to implement some of these initiatives are still in the early stages , their effect on the reliability of gwot cost reporting is uncertain . dod has undertaken several initiatives to improve the accuracy and reliability of its gwot cost data . first , to promote the goal of continually improving its cost - of - war processes and reports , in february 2008 , dod required its components to statistically sample and validate their fiscal year 2008 gwot obligation transactions on a quarterly basis beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 . dod also required its components to review randomly sampled non - gwot obligations to determine whether the transactions were properly classified as non - gwot versus gwot . according to dfas officials , the new requirement has improved the reliability of reported gwot obligations because dod components are taking actions to improve their gwot cost reporting procedures and are making corrections when errors such as missing or illegible supporting documentation , missing codes , and miscoded transactions are found . dfas plans to include a requirement to review and validate gwot obligation data in an update to volume 3 , chapter 8 of the dod financial management regulation . second , dod is initiating a new contingency cost - reporting system in fiscal year 2009 called the contingency operations reporting and analysis system . dod's goals are to automate the collection of gwot cost data from dod components and improve the timeliness of cost - of - war reporting . this system pulls elements of gwot transaction data directly from dod components' accounting systems into its data store . limited features of the system became available for use in october 2008 and it should be fully operational by september 2009 . upon completion of the project , this system should allow dod and external users to have a consolidated location to view and analyze data for the cost of war , disaster relief , and all other contingencies . users will have access through a web browser and should be able to filter data and perform various analyses . previously , the dod components individually gathered and manually entered their gwot cost data monthly into a template provided by dfas for cost - of - war reporting . according to dfas officials , the new system is designed to ensure better reliability and eliminate the possibility of manual errors . third , dfas is issuing a redesigned monthly cost - of - war report through the contingency operations reporting and analysis system , starting in fiscal year 2009 , to replace dod's monthly supplemental and cost of war execution report , which was provided to external customers , including congress , the office of management and budget , and gao . the first new cost - of - war report , commonly referred to as the contingency operations status of funds report , was issued in december 2008 and covered costs for october 2008 . according to dod , this redesigned report should improve transparency over gwot costs by comparing appropriated gwot supplemental and annual funding to reported obligations and disbursements .
