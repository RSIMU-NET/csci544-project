ii ) . the commissioner said that he generally agreed with all of our recommendations . the commissioner commented , however , that irs would not consider revising the form 2210 underpayment schedule before legislative action is taken to amend section 6621 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( b ) and expand the es special rule to the new periods . irs believes that expanding the special rule would provide the greatest relief to taxpayers and that revising the form 2210 without incorporating that change would not be justified by the lesser benefits derived from revising the underpayment schedule . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . we are sending copies of this report to the secretary of the treasury , commissioner of internal revenue , and other interested parties . we will make copies available to others upon request . the major contributors to this report are listed in appendix vii . if you have any questions , please contact me on ( 202 ) 512-9110 . in figures iii.1 and iii.2 , we compare section a , lines 21-29 , of the current form 2210 underpayment schedule with our revised section a for a hypothetical taxpayer . the hypothetical taxpayer had underpayments of $5,000 in each es payment period , and made es payments of $3,000 on april 15 , $1,000 on june 15 , $2,000 on july 30 , $4,500 on september 15 , and $9,500 on january 15 . in tables iv.1 and iv.2 , we compare the es penalty calculations necessary using the instructions on the current form 2210 with the es penalty calculations necessary if the instructions for the calculations were revised in accordance with the revisions made to simplify the form's underpayment schedule . eight calculations are necessary under the current instructions to determine the total es penalty . three calculations for the $2,000 underpayment are needed to account for ( 1 ) the $1,000 payment on june 15 , ( 2 ) the interest rate change on july 1 , and ( 3 ) the $2,000 payment on july 30 . three calculations for the $5,000 underpayment are needed to account for ( 1 ) the interest rate change on july 1 , ( 2 ) the $1,000 payment on july 30 , and ( 3 ) the $4,500 payment on september 15 . two calculations for the $4,500 underpayment are needed to account for ( 1 ) the interest rate change on october 1 , and ( 2 ) the $9,500 payment on january 15 . the revised instructions affect underpayments outstanding through more than one es payment period , and the difference involves the period used to calculate the es penalty . the difference is illustrated in tables iv.1 and iv.2 by the calculations used to compute the es penalty for the $2,000 underpayment .
