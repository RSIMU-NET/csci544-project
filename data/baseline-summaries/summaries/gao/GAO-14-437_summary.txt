( app . iii provides additional details of the number of graduates and research articles , by tcc participant ) . corrosion office officials stated that it is difficult to measure the success of research and purposely did not set target numbers for students or research papers because sheer numbers would not show the full extent of the benefits received from the number of students educated or the research papers published . we acknowledge that it can be difficult to measure the success of research . for example , we previously found that evaluating the effectiveness of research programs can be difficult and noted challenges , such as research results may take a long time and research may not achieve its intended results but can lead to unexpected discoveries that provide potentially more - interesting and valuable results . the corrosion office has established a research goal for producing solutions that tangibly reduce the effect of corrosion on dod infrastructure and weapon systems ; however , the office has not established a process for transitioning any results of the demonstrated research projects to the military departments . dod instruction 5000.67 , which implements section 2228 of title 10 of the united states code , establishes policy , assigns responsibilities , and provides guidance for corrosion prevention and control within dod . the instruction requires the corrosion office to develop a long - term strategy for corrosion prevention and mitigation that , among other things , provides for a coordinated research and development program that includes the transition of new corrosion - prevention technologies to military departments . in addition , federal internal control standards state that agencies should establish procedures and mechanisms that enforce management's directives , such as the process of adhering to requirements , which in this case is the requirement to transition tcc results to the military departments . the corrosion office has a process to monitor that the contractual agreements of the tcc research projects are being accomplished . specifically , according to corrosion office officials , the corrosion office , among other things , periodically tracks the status of the tcc projects . however , the office's ultimate goal , officials stated , is to transition results of the demonstrated tcc projects , when possible , to the military departments . corrosion office officials defined success as the production of products or knowledge that can be used by the military departments as they develop and implement corrosion - control technologies within their services . for example , officials cited one ongoing project as an example of a success story: the project has identified important information about a technique of using fasteners to accelerate corrosion during outdoor exposures.accelerated testing is an approach that expedites the corrosion of material or its properties and will allow officials to obtain more information from a given test time than would normally be possible . according to corrosion office officials , this project will provide information that the military departments can use as they design and conduct their future tests . however , the corrosion office does not have a process for how it will transition the results of this project to the military departments in accordance with the section 2228 of title 10 of the united states code and dod instruction 5000.67 .
