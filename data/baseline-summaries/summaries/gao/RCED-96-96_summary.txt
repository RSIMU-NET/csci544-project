ii . for information on these pathogens and the illnesses they cause. ) although many people associate foodborne illnesses primarily with meat , poultry , eggs , and seafood products , many other foods , including milk , cheese , ice cream , orange and apple juices , cantaloupes , and vegetables , have also been involved in outbreaks during the last decade . bacterial pathogens are the most commonly identified cause of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses . bacterial pathogens can be easily transmitted and can multiply rapidly in food , making them difficult to control . cdc has targeted four of them — e . coli o157:h7 , salmonella enteritidis , listeria monocytogenes , and campylobacter jejuni — as those of greatest concern . ( see app . iii. ) cdc is also concerned about other bacterial pathogens , such as vibrio vulnificus and yersinia enterocolitica , which can cause serious illnesses , and clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus , which cause less serious illnesses but are very common . the chemical causes of foodborne illnesses are primarily natural toxins that occur in fish or other foods but also include heavy metals , such as copper and cadmium . viral pathogens are often transmitted by infected food handlers or through contact with sewage . only a few viral pathogens , such as the hepatitis a and norwalk viruses , have been proven to cause foodborne illnesses . finally , parasitic pathogens , such as trichinella — found in undercooked or raw pork — multiply only in host animals , not in food . cdc officials believe that viral and parasitic pathogens are less likely than bacterial pathogens to be identified as the source of an outbreak of foodborne illness because their presence is more difficult to detect . the existing data on the extent of foodborne illnesses have weaknesses and may not fully depict the extent of the problem . public health experts believe that the majority of cases of foodborne illness are not reported because the initial symptoms of most foodborne illnesses are not severe enough to warrant medical attention , the medical facility or state does not report such cases , or the illness is not recognized as foodborne . however , according to the best available estimates , based largely on cdc's data , millions of people become sick from contaminated food each year , and several thousand die . in addition , public health and food safety officials believe that the risk of foodborne illnesses is increasing for several reasons . for example , as a result of large - scale food production and broad distribution of products , those products that may be contaminated can reach a great number of people in many locations . furthermore , new and more virulent strains of previously identified harmful bacteria have been identified in the past several decades . also , mishandling or improper preparation can further increase the risk . between 6.5 million and 81 million cases of foodborne illness and as many as 9,100 related deaths occur each year , according to the estimates provided by several studies conducted over the past 10 years .
