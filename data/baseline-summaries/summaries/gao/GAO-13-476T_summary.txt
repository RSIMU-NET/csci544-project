this report was mandated by pub . 112-88 , § 3 , 125 stat . as part of this act , the fdic inspector general ( ig ) was also required to conduct a separate study on the impact of bank failures . these issues , we analyzed call report data ; reviewed inspectors general ( ig ) reviews of individual bank failures ; conducted econometric modeling ; and interviewed officials from federal and state banking regulators , banking associations , banks , and market experts . we also coordinated with the fdic inspector general on its study . we conducted this performance audit from february 2012 to december 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . ten states concentrated in the western , midwestern , and southeastern united states — all areas where the housing market had experienced strong growth in the prior decade — experienced 10 or more bank failures between 2008 and 2011 ( see fig.1 ) . together , failures in these 10 states comprised 72 percent ( 298 ) , of the 414 bank failures across all states during this time period . within these 10 states , 86 percent ( 257 ) of the failed banks were small institutions with assets of less than $1 billion at the time of failure , and 52 percent ( 155 ) , had assets of less than $250 million . twelve percent ( 36 ) were of medium - size banks with more than $1 billion but less than $10 billion in assets , and 2 percent ( 5 ) were large banks with assets of more than $10 billion at the time of failure . in the 10 states with 10 or more failures between 2008 and 2011 , failures of small and medium - size banks were largely associated with high concentrations of commercial real estate ( cre ) loans , in particular the subset of acquisition , development , and construction ( adc ) loans , and with inadequate management of the risks associated with these high concentrations . our analysis of call report data found that cre ( including adc ) lending increased significantly in the years prior to the housing market downturn at the 258 small banks that failed between 2008 and 2011 . this rapid growth of failed banks' cre portfolios resulted in concentrations — that is , the ratio of total cre loans to total risk - based capital — that exceeded regulatory thresholds for heightened scrutiny established in 2006 and increased the banks' exposure to the sustained downturn that began in 2007 . specifically , we found cre concentrations grew from 333 percent in december 2001 to 535 percent in june 2008 . at the same time , adc concentrations grew from 104 percent to 259 percent . the trends for the 36 failed medium - size banks were similar over this time period . in contrast , small and medium - sized banks that did not fail exhibited substantially lower levels and markedly slower growth rates of cre loans and as a result had significantly lower concentrations of them , reducing the banks' exposure .
