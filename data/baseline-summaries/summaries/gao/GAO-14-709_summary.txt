controlled . the activation handbooks and staffing timeline templates that each of the six institutions modified minimally met the requirements for a controlled schedule , as illustrated in table 9 . two of the activating institutions provided versions of bop's activation handbook and staffing timeline templates that contained some indication that information on key dates and activities was updated at some point in time by the activating institutions . however , those activation handbook and staffing timeline templates modified by each institution did not indicate whether they had been updated at regular intervals , or that they reflected the actual status of the respective activations . how has bop covered the costs of maintaining the six institutions ? how will the addition of each institution likely affect system - wide crowding rates ? why did doj purchase the thomson correctional center , and how , if at all , will it affect costs ? to determine whether bop has activated the six institutions within estimated time frames , we reviewed documents that accompany bop's annual congressional budget justifications , called budget exhibits , from fiscal years 2008 through 2014 that include timelines for when bop expects to activate new institutions . we also analyzed data from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) human resources database , enterprise human resources integration ( ehri ) statistical data mart , for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 to determine the extent to which staffing challenges identified by institutions in the activation process affected bop's ability to meet estimated time frames related to activation . further , we reviewed legislation enacted from relevant fiscal years , specifically fiscal years 1999 through 2006 , and associated reports to identify the process through which specific institution locations are identified , as well as bop's assessments of proposed locations for new institutions . we also interviewed agency officials on the challenges , if any , institutions face related to activation and the actions bop has taken to mitigate the effects of those challenges . to determine how bop has covered the costs of maintaining the six institutions while waiting for congressional direction on activation funding , we reviewed bop's annual congressional budget justifications from fiscal years 2008 through 2015 . we also reviewed bop's annual spend plans , which doj or its components develop after receiving an appropriation , for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to identify congressionally directed activation funding . further , we analyzed data on actual obligations bop made from fiscal years 2010 , or the first year bop made activation - related obligations for those six institutions , through march 2014 to fund and activate the six institutions to determine the total cost of new institution activations . we also reviewed program statements , which are bop's formal policies and procedures , related to using appropriated funds for building projects . to determine how each new institution will likely affect system - wide crowding rates , we evaluated bop's long - range capacity plan that accompanied bop's fiscal year 2015 congressional budget justification . that plan includes bop's estimates of the future inmate population and crowding rates through fiscal year 2020 , and assumes that all six institutions in our review will be fully populated , or fully activated , by fiscal year 2016 .
