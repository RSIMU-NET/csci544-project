( in some cases , the available information on the measure was insufficient for us to place it into one of the three categories , so we labeled these measures as “unclear.” ) as figures 1 and 2 below illustrate , our analysis of the 36 efficiency measures from our selected programs and a random sample of the remaining efficiency measures indicates that about half of the efficiency measures contained typical elements by including both an input and an output or outcome . as illustrated in figure 1 , for the 21 selected programs ( listed in appendix ii ) , we determined that 58 percent of the efficiency measures included both elements and 42 percent did not . in its guidance to programs , omb stated that , although both output and outcome - oriented efficiency measures were acceptable , outcome efficiency measures were preferred . because we obtained more in - depth information on the selected programs' measures , we further analyzed whether those that included both elements were output - or outcome - oriented and found most to be output - oriented . figure 2 summarizes estimates for the remaining 1,355 efficiency measures , based on a random sample of 100 of those measures . we estimate that 48 percent of the measures included both elements , 26 percent did not , and the remaining 26 percent were unclear . of those that did not contain both elements , the missing element was most often an input .
