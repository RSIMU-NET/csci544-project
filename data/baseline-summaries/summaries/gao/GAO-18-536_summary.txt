these responses from the interviews are not generalizable . to describe actions taken by ceq , we reviewed guidance and regulations issued by the council and interviewed ceq officials about the council's actions to help streamline the environmental review process for federal transportation projects . we also interviewed the department of transportation ( dot ) and federal resource agency officials to discuss the extent to which ceq actions resulted in streamlining environmental reviews . we conducted this performance audit from march 2017 to july 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . enacted in 1970 , nepa , along with subsequent ceq implementing regulations , sets out an environmental review process that has two principal purposes: ( 1 ) to ensure that an agency carefully considers information concerning the potential environmental effects of proposed projects ; and ( 2 ) to ensure that this information is made available to the public . dot's federal highway administration ( fhwa ) and federal transit administration are generally the federal agencies responsible for nepa compliance for federally funded highway and transit projects . project sponsors — typically state dots and local transit agencies — may receive dot funds , oversee the construction of highway and transit projects , develop the environmental review documents that are approved by federal agencies , and collaborate with federal and state stakeholders . in addition , the clean water act and the endangered species act are two key substantive federal environmental protection laws that may be triggered by a proposed transportation project and that may require the federal resource agencies to issue permit decisions or perform consultations before a project can proceed . section 404 of the clean water act generally prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material , such as clay , soil or construction debris , into the waters of the united states , except as authorized through permits issued by the corps . before the corps can issue a section 404 permit , it must determine that the discharge of material is in compliance with guidelines established by the environmental protection agency . the corps issues two types of permits: individual permits: issued as a standard permit for individual projects , following a case - by - case evaluation of a specific project involving the proposed discharge of dredged or fill material and / or work or structures in navigable water . general permits: issued for categories of projects the corps has identified as being similar in nature and causing minimal individual and cumulative adverse environmental impacts . general permits may be issued on a state , regional , or nationwide basis . in fiscal year 2016 , the corps completed approximately 250 individual permits and 10,750 general permits for transportation projects , based on agency data .
