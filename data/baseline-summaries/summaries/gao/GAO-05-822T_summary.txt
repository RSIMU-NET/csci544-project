( see figure 3. ) the number of worksite arrests declined by about 84 percent from 2,849 in fiscal year 1999 to 445 in fiscal year 2003 . ( see figure 4. ) the difficulties that ins and ice have experienced in proving that employers knowingly hired unauthorized workers and in setting and collecting fine amounts that meaningfully deter employers from knowingly hiring unauthorized workers have limited the effectiveness of worksite enforcement efforts . in particular , the availability and use of fraudulent documents has not only undermined the employment verification process , but has also made it difficult for ice agents to prove that employers knowingly hired unauthorized workers . in 1996 , the department of justice office of the inspector general reported that the proliferation of cheap fraudulent documents made it possible for the unscrupulous employer to avoid being held accountable for hiring illegal aliens . in 1999 , we reported that the prevalence of document fraud made it difficult for ins to prove that an employer knowingly hired an unauthorized alien . ice officials told us that employers who they suspect knowingly hire unauthorized workers can claim that they were unaware that their workers presented false documents at the time of hire , making it difficult for agents to prove that the employer violated irca .
