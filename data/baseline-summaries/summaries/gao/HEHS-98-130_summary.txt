iii. ) while the drug detection mechanisms were designed to collect information on the use of a variety of drugs , including cocaine , they generally targeted different populations and covered different geographic locations and time periods . a description of the drug detection mechanisms nida sponsored follows . nhsda , a nationally representative household survey established in 1972 , was used to estimate drug use in the general population on the basis of a sample of permanent household members aged 12 and older . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . this change in drug use pattern ( from only snorting to also smoking cocaine ) would later be recognized as an early warning sign of the emergence of crack cocaine . from dawn data , nida found that , between 1976 and 1982 , cocaine smoking accounted for about 2 percent of cocaine - related emergency department episodes ; however , by 1985 , cocaine smoking accounted for 8 percent of such episodes . it was not until the late 1980s , however , that adjustments were made to dawn data that differentiated between freebasing — another form of cocaine smoking — and crack cocaine smoking . moreover , cewg began reporting increased use of smokable cocaine in three major cities as early as 1981 . in 1985 — when crack first became generally recognized as a specific form of smokable cocaine — crack use was reported to have spread to at least seven of the cewg coverage areas . just 1 year later , cewg reported that crack use had spread to 17 of the metropolitan areas covered . although nida was aware of the rapid spread of crack use from cewg reports starting in the mid - 1980s , the national prevalence of crack use in the general household population was not measured until the late 1980s . ( prevalence of use data are utilized , in part , by decisionmakers to establish drug control policy. ) the 1985 nhsda did not include questions specific to crack use . because the survey is conducted generally every 2 to 3 years , questions about crack were not included until the 1988 survey . as a result , survey data on the national prevalence of crack use were not available until 1989 — 3 years after reports of the spread of crack to 17 major metropolitan areas . results from nhsda showed that about 1 percent of household populations had used crack in the past year . in two congressional hearings held in july 1986 , a number of concerns were raised about the data that had been collected through the nida - sponsored drug detection mechanisms . specifically , nhsda data showed a leveling off of cocaine use nationally , while other sources were indicating that local areas were experiencing epidemic use of the drug . there was also a lack of data on crack use in the general population .
