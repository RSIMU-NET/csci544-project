( see fig . 1 for a comparison of gasoline and propane prices , adjusted for inflation. ) finally , the infrastructure needed to keep afvs refueled is currently inadequate to support the wide - scale use of afvs that are not operated as centrally fueled fleet vehicles . industry officials told us that the consumption of alternative fuels for transportation is too small to justify any large - scale investment in this infrastructure . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . ( 2 ) to what extent will the use of propane as a motor fuel increase as a result of epact ? ( 3 ) what impact will the use of propane as a motor fuel under epact have on the supply and price of propane ? ( 4 ) what impact will the use of propane as a motor fuel under epact have on existing users of propane ? to help meet its goal of replacing a portion of the conventional fuel used by light - duty vehicles in the united states with replacement fuels , epact established mandates , to be implemented by the secretary of energy , that require certain fleet operators to include alternative - fueled vehicles ( afv ) in their fleets . specifically , epact required that federal fleets acquire afvs beginning in fiscal year 1993 and that state fleets and alternative fuel providers acquire afvs beginning in model - year 1996 . the federal afv fleet program went into effect in 1993 , but the mandates for state and alternative fuel provider fleets were delayed until 1997 because , according to a doe official , the department did not issue the rulemaking , as required by epact , early enough for the mandates to take effect in 1996 . also , under epact , the secretary of energy may require municipal and private ( business ) fleets to purchase an increasing percentage of afvs to help meet the fuel - replacement goal . under epact , doe published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in april 1998 and held public hearings in may and june 1998 to determine whether the establishment of the municipal and private fleet mandate is necessary and whether such a mandate will help attain epact's fuel - replacement goal . epact does not require that the goal be achieved and authorizes the secretary of energy to modify the goal or the target years if he or she determines that they are not achievable . table 1 presents a summary of epact's afv acquisition mandates for the fleets covered by the act . the goal of epact to replace 10 percent of the conventional fuel consumed by light - duty vehicles by 2000 and 30 percent by 2010 with replacement fuels is unlikely to be achieved .
