( see fig . the number of units of blood collected annually increased from 12.4 million in 1997 to an estimated 15 million in 2001 . ( nbdrc estimated that 2001 collections would have reached 14.5 million units , 17 percent higher than in 1997 , without the post - september 11 surge. ) the increase in the blood supply has been echoed by a corresponding increase in the amount of blood transfused . ( see fig . for example , nbdrc data indicate that the number of red blood cell units transfused rose 17 percent from 1997 to 2001 , from 11.5 million to 13.5 million units . the annual number of units that were available but not transfused remained at about 1 million units . blood inventories were generally adequate just prior to the september 11 attacks . the red cross reported that its total red blood cell inventory was 33 percent higher in august 2001 than it was in august 2000 and that its type o inventory was 83 percent higher than it was in august 2000 . the new york blood center ( nybc ) reported that it had a 4- to 5-day supply of blood on hand in early september 2001 . on september 10 , 2001 , the median inventory for the hospitals in hhs's blood sentinel surveillance system for all blood types stood at approximately 7 days , and for type o rh - negative blood , at 6 days . the limited information available to us indicates that blood collections to date in 2002 have been roughly comparable to the levels immediately prior to september 11 . according to nbdrc data , collections for the first half of 2002 have been similar to the same period in 2001 . the hospital inventories measured by hhs's blood sentinel surveillance system in mid - august 2002 were similar to those levels measured just prior to september 11 , 2001 . the high volume of blood donations by volunteers immediately after september 11 stressed the collection system and resulted in a national surplus . monthly blood collections increased nearly 40 percent over collections earlier in 2001 in the weeks immediately following september 11 , but there was little additional need of blood for transfusions . the nationwide blood supply was substantially greater than needed for transfusions . consequently , the proportion of units that expired and were discarded in october and november 2001 was five times higher than the proportion that expired in an average 2-month period earlier in 2001 . america's blood banks collected an unprecedented amount of blood in a short period after the september 11 attacks . in response to the perception that blood would be needed to treat victims , americans formed lines to give blood at hospitals and blood banks even before a call for blood went out . hhs , abc , and the red cross all issued requests for blood donations , although hhs and abc quickly stopped issuing requests when it became clear that there were few survivors of the attacks and therefore little need for additional blood for transfusions .
