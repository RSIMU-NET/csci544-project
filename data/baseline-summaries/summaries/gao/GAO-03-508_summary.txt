no majority . a student who has no distinct majority source of aid is 2.33 times more likely to receive aid greater than federally defined need than a student who the majority of aid from federal grants . number of aid components in aid packages . having more aid sources in a student's aid package results in a higher probability of receiving aid greater than the federally defined need . having an additional aid component increases the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need by a factor of 1.33 . this means that having five sources of aid , rather than one source of aid , can cause a three - fold increase in the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need ( 2.994 = 1.314 ) . gpa . gpa is usually calculated on a 4-point scale . in the npsas data set , gpa is multiplied by 100 or reported on a 400-point scale . in our analysis , we have gpa ranging from 0 to 40 , such that a unit increase in our gpa variable ( say from 37 to 38 ) represents a 0.1 change in grade point average as it is usually calculated ( 3.7 to 3.8 ) . an odds ratio of 1.03 should thus be interpreted as follows: on a 4-point gpa scale , increasing gpa by one - tenth of one point ( 2.53 to 2.63 ) increases the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need by 3 percent . thus , a change of one grade point ( 2.5 to 3.5 ) increases the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need by 35 percent ( 1.0310 = 1.35 ) . income . for every $5,000 change in income , the probability of receiving aid greater than federally defined need increases by 24 percent . a person earning $50,000 more than another , all else equal , is 8.6 ( 1.2410 = 8.59 ) times more likely to receive aid greater than federally defined need . private not - for - profit university . attending a private university decreases the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need . someone who attends a public university increases his / her chances of receiving aid greater than federally defined need by a factor of 2.86 ( 1 / 0.35 ) . four - year school . all else equal , attending a 4-year institution increases the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need by a factor of 1.5 . urban . all else equal , attending a rural ( rather than urban ) institution increases the likelihood of receiving aid greater than federally defined need by a factor of 1.5 ( 1 / 0.68 ) . plains - southwest . a student attending school in the plains states or the southwest is 1.7 times more likely to receive aid greater than federally defined need than a similar student attending school in other regions of the country . the aid package variables represent the source of the “majority” of the student's aid , if there was a majority source .
