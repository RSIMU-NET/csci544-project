market consolidation is another factor that can affect the price of gasoline . our testimony today will focus on our recent study that examined the effects of market consolidation and other factors on the u. s. petroleum industry . since the 1990s , the u.s. petroleum industry has experienced a wave of mergers , acquisitions , and joint ventures , several of them between large oil companies that had previously competed with each other for the sale of petroleum products . a few examples include the merger between british petroleum ( bp ) and amoco in 1998 to form bpamoco , which later merged with arco , and the merger in 1999 between exxon , the largest u.s. oil company , and mobil , the second largest . in general , mergers raise concerns about potential anticompetitive effects on the u.s. petroleum industry and ultimately on gasoline prices because mergers could result in greater market power for the merged companies , potentially allowing them to increase prices above competitive levels . on the other hand , mergers could also yield cost savings and efficiency gains , which may be passed on to consumers in lower prices . ultimately , the impact depends on whether market power or efficiency dominates . our report examined mergers in the u.s. petroleum industry from the 1990s through 2000 , the changes in market concentration ( the distribution of market shares among competing firms ) and other factors affecting competition in the u.s. petroleum industry , how u.s. gasoline marketing has changed since the 1990s , and how mergers and market concentration in the u.s. petroleum industry have affected u.s. gasoline prices at the wholesale level . to address these issues , we purchased and analyzed a large body of data on mergers and wholesale gasoline prices , as well as data on other relevant economic factors . we have addressed many of these issues in several studies on energy markets .
