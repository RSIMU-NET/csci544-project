data limitations . a majority of the stakeholders we interviewed said that wireless plans' data caps — a limitation on the amount of data the subscriber can download and upload per month — could make it difficult for school - age children to do homework , because , for example , once the data cap is reached , the provider may decrease connection speeds or impose additional costs for further data use , which could hinder completion of homework . a 2016 survey found that an estimated 39 percent of lower - income households with school - age children — in this case those with incomes less than the federal poverty guidelines — had reached a data cap , compared to 25 percent of higher - income households . varying service quality . mobile wireless may be less reliable and slower than in - home fixed service , which can make doing homework more challenging . in 2018 , fcc concluded that mobile wireless services are not full substitutes for in - home fixed service , because mobile wireless quality can be affected by user location , indoor obstructions , outdoor foliage , and weather , among other factors . in addition , we reported in 2015 that the availability and quality of mobile wireless service connections vary based on location and terrain . for example , according to officials with albemarle county public schools in virginia , while most students who participated in a recent survey indicate that they have mobile wireless internet access at home , that access may only offer poor quality connections and slow speeds due to mountainous terrain . as a result , mobile wireless access may have limited usefulness for homework purposes . a 2018 survey by the pew research center found that about 20 percent of teens from lower - income households say that they sometimes have to use public wi - fi for homework given a lack of access at home . as shown in figure 5 , stakeholders we interviewed and literature we reviewed identified a number of potential challenges students may encounter in using methods to access the internet outside the home to do their homework . the six selected school district projects we reviewed have taken various approaches to address the homework gap by providing wireless internet service to students who may lack access at home . most of these projects provide wireless internet access to students who lack in - home fixed internet and do not necessarily limit it to students in lower - income households . in addition , all but one of these projects provide filtered access , meaning that students using these services are subject to the same usage restrictions as if they were on - site in school . approaches included: provide wireless hot - spot devices . the green bay area public school district in wisconsin loans out mobile wireless hot - spot devices to students throughout the district who do not have access at home , providing them filtered internet access in their homes or elsewhere in the community . the hot - spot devices are available on loan from school libraries to any student who claims a need for one regardless of household income .
