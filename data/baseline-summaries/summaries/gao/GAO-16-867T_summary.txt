this can contribute to confusion . several of the contracting officials we spoke with stated that they were , at times , uncertain about which contracting office handled what requirements . va issued a memorandum in 2013 to clarify areas of responsibility for the national contracting organizations , but confusion remains . va's acting chief acquisition officer stated that he is aware of overlap in the functions of some contracting organizations , especially the nac and the sac . at one visn we visited , an official reported procuring one type of high - tech medical equipment through the sac even though this area is specifically designated as nac's responsibility because she expected that the sac could execute the purchase more quickly . without clearly delineated organizational roles and customer relationships — beyond what was provided in the 2013 memorandum — the possibility of duplication in these roles and relationships is increased , and customers lack clear guidance on which organization to approach for certain types of procurements . in our september 2016 report , we recommended that oalc assess whether additional policy or guidance is needed to clarify the roles of va's national contracting organizations . the acting chief acquisition officer , oalc said that the department agreed with this recommendation . key va procurement policies are outdated and difficult for contracting officers to use . standards for internal control in the federal government state that it is important for an organization's management to update its policies over time to reflect changing statutes or conditions , and that those policies should be communicated to those who need to implement them . however , many of va's regulations and policies are outdated , most notably the va acquisition regulation ( vaar ) , which has not been updated since 2008 . the department has issued a patchwork of policy documents in the interim to fill this gap . va asks contracting officers to refer to two different versions of the vaar , one from 1997 and the other from 2008 . this causes confusion among contracting officers . in addition , va communicates interim procurement policies in a number of different forms , some of which can be duplicative . figure 3 illustrates the numerous sources that contracting officers must turn to for guidance . the sheer volume and number of different forms of communications — many of which are outdated — are confusing and present challenges for contracting officials seeking appropriate guidance . while va recently fully rescinded the 1997 vaar after our inquiries , the 2008 version remains out of date . a new revision of the vaar is also in development , but has faced delays . va began the process in 2011 but does not plan to finalize the new vaar until december 2018 , including the required rulemaking process . the lengthy delay in updating this fundamental source of policy impedes contracting officers' abilities to effectively carry out their duties . in our september 2016 report , we recommended that va identify measures to expedite the revision of the vaar , and take interim steps to clarify its policy framework ; the acting chief acquisition officer , oalc stated that the department agreed with both of these recommendations .
