implement accountability at all levels . create a culture of engagement . improve supervisor assessment , selection , development , and training . opm officials told us that the practices in the gear report are well known and credible but not universally applied in federal agencies . the gear recommendations and framework were presented to and accepted by the lmr council in november 2011 . by december 2011 , five agencies had volunteered to implement the gear framework . of these , three agencies – doe , hud , and opm – implemented gear agency - wide with few exceptions . two agencies – coast guard and nca – implemented gear in single units . the agencies all created gear implementation plans and periodically met as a group to discuss strategies and challenges , and to share successes and additional training opportunities throughout implementation . the pilot agencies also periodically reported their progress to both the lmr and chco councils . according to an opm senior official , the gear recommendations are “common sense but not common practice.” the same official noted that the gear recommendations align with current regulations addressing federal performance management , but that gear adds specific strategic and agency officials said technical guidance and communication strategies.that combining the recommendations into one framework can aid officials in maintaining focus and attention on improving performance management in the context of competing priorities . according to internal control standards , performance measures should be established to evaluate the success or failure of their activities and programs . performance measurement involves identifying performance goals and measures , establishing performance baselines by tracking performance over time , identifying targets for improving performance , and measuring progress against those targets . without additional information on performance measures , the coast guard is missing opportunities to gauge progress and measure the success of their implementation efforts and , as a result , the agency may not have all available data for decision - making . specifically , agency officials told us that the success of gear's implementation at base boston is one of the factors that will determine whether or not the coast guard exports the gear framework to its remaining bases and employees . the gear framework presents an opportunity for federal agencies to increase employee engagement and improve performance management . indeed , even though the gear pilot has only been in place a short period of time , agency officials have already described such benefits as improved engagement and communication between employees and supervisors . although the recommendations outlined in the gear report do not represent new concepts , implementing them in practice may present challenges unique to each agency , as demonstrated by the experience of the five pilot agencies . opm has facilitated conversations among participating gear agencies to identify lessons learned and the chco council is developing a gear toolkit to help agencies improve performance management and increase employee engagement . however , going forward , the roles and responsibilities of opm , the chco council , and participating federal agencies have not been fully defined , including how to identify future promising practices , and how to update and disseminate information on the government - wide implementation of gear .
