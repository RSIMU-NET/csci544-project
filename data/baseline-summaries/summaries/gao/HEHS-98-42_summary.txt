for more details about our methodology , see appendix i . social security is a retirement income program whose benefits are based , in part , on an individual's earnings . social security is also gender - neutral â€” that is , a man and a woman whose labor force participation and earnings are identical , in terms of both extent and timing , will receive the exact same social security benefit . when calculating actual benefits , social security employs a progressive benefit formula that replaces a relatively larger portion of lifetime earnings for people with low earnings than for people with high earnings . because women tend to have lower lifetime taxable earnings than men , they generally benefit from this provision . however , they could also lose some portion of their savings for retirement if , for example , stock prices fell . while the data indicate that the u.s. stock market has historically outperformed the implicit return expected from social security for today's and future retirees , there is always a risk of loss . the uncertainty of market gains or losses would be borne by the individual , and the individual's retirement income would not be guaranteed by the government as it currently is under social security . retirees could use the payout from individual accounts to buy an annuity , or they could receive a lump - sum distribution of the accumulated savings to manage or spend as they saw fit . in most cases , an annuity lasts for the life of the recipient , removing the risk that retirees will outlive their savings . with a lump sum , retirees may make other choices about the distribution of their assets , including , at their death , bequeathing any remaining funds to their heirs . women's social security benefits are currently lower , on average , than men's because their labor force participation rates and earnings are lower . these gaps are narrower than in past years yet still large enough to affect retirement income benefits . the gaps are not expected to disappear entirely , even in the long term . women's labor force participation rates continue to be lower than men's at every age , despite substantial increases in women's rates in the past 35 years . on average , the labor force participation rate for women aged 16 and older in 1996 was 59 percent , compared with 75 percent for men . as seen in figure 1 , this represents a significant increase for women from 35 years ago , when their labor force participation rate was only 38 percent , compared with 83 percent for men . figure 2 shows the change in labor force participation rates for women born in different 5-year intervals as they move through their prime - age years ( 25 to 54 ) . women born more recently have higher labor force participation rates than older women had at the same age . the labor force participation rates of the younger women do not drop off during their child - bearing years as the older women's did , but the rate of increase in labor force participation for the younger women has slowed .
