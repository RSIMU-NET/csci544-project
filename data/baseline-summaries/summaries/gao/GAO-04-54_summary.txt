( app . ii lists the members of the committee. ) the committee examined the existing literature on this issue and made recommendations for potential approaches for improving cabin air quality . we also independently reviewed other studies on issues related to cabin air quality , paying particular attention to those issued after the publication of the national research council report . what is the contribution of low relative humidity to the perception of dryness , and do other factors cause or contribute to the irritation associated with the dry cabin environment during flight ? to investigate possible association between specific air quality characteristics and health effects or complaints . to evaluate the physical and chemical factors affecting specific air quality characteristics in aircraft cabins . to determine whether fars for air quality are adequate to protect health and ensure the comfort of passengers and crew . to determine exposure to selected contaminants ( eg , constituents of engine oils and hydraulic fluids , their degradation products , and pesticides ) and establish their potential toxicity more fully . research program approach use continuous monitoring data from surveillance program when possible . monitor additional air quality characteristics on selected flights as necessary ( eg , integrated particulate - matter sampling to assess exposure to selected contaminants ) . identify and monitor “problem” aircraft and review maintenance and repair records to evaluate issues associated with air quality incidents . collect selected health data ( eg , pulse - oximetry data to assess arterial oxygen saturation of passengers and crew ) . conduct laboratory and other ground - based studies to characterize air distribution and circulation and contaminant generation , transport , and degradation in the cabin and the ecs . in addition to the individuals named above , kevin bailey , jim geibel , david ireland , bert japikse , stanley kostyla , edward laughlin , donna leiss , and maria romero made key contributions to this report . american society of heating , refrigerating and air - conditioning engineers . standard 62-2001 , ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality . atlanta , ga: 2001 . barnas , gary p. altitude sickness: preventing acute mountain sickness . milwaukee , wi: medical college of wisconsin , june 4 , 1997. http: / / healthlink.mcw.edu / article / 907195877.html ( accessed june 19 , 2003 ) . what are the magnitudes of exposures to pesticides in aircraft cabins , and what is the relationship between the exposures and reported symptoms ? california department of health services , occupational illness among flight attendants due to aircraft disinsection , california department of health services , http: / / www.dhs.ca.gov / ohb / ohsep / disinsection.pdf ( accessed nov. 10 , 2003 ) . centers for disease control . updated interim domestic infection control guidance in the health - care and community setting for patients with suspected sars , centers for disease control , http: / / www.cdc.gov / ncidod / sars / infectioncontrol.htm ( accessed may 13 , 2003 ) . air pollution technology fact sheet on high efficiency particulate and ultra low penetration air filters . research triangle park , nc: july 15 , 2003 . environmental protection agency . indoor air facts number 4 ( revised ) : sick building syndrome .
