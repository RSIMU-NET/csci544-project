senate report no . 110-77 , which accompanied the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , directed gao to review the department's ada procedures for preventing , identifying , investigating , and reporting ada violations and the disciplinary actions taken when violations occur . more specifically , the senate report identified seven areas of congressional interest , which we have grouped into three objectives , as outlined in table 1 . this report presents more details regarding the preliminary observations we provided on july 28 , 2008 , in response to the senate report . to address the first objective , we reviewed prior gao and dod inspector general audit reports and omb and gao guidance to obtain an understanding of the deficiencies in dod's funds control systems , processes , and internal controls that impede its ability to prevent or identify ada violations . dod has acknowledged the financial management weaknesses reported by gao and dod auditors and the impact these weaknesses have on the reliability of the department's financial information . as a result , we did not perform additional work to substantiate the adequacy of dod's financial management environment and internal controls . we interviewed dod and military service personnel and reviewed documentation , such as the dod financial management regulation ( fmr ) and military service training curricula , to ascertain whether the military services had processes in place to identify and ensure that key funds control personnel are trained . to address the second objective , we reviewed the dod fmr and interviewed appropriate officials within the dod comptroller and military services' financial management and comptroller offices responsible for the ada programs at dod or the military services to identify dod criteria pertaining to the qualifications , training , and independence requirements of investigating officers and the reporting of ada cases . our comparison and subsequent follow - up with the dod comptroller's office , found that 34 of the 54 ada cases investigated by dod concluded that an ada violation had occurred and were reported as required by law . for the remaining 20 ada cases , dod concluded that no ada violation had occurred , and therefore these cases were not reported externally . we reviewed each case file to ensure that it contained the information set forth in the omb circular and the dod fmr . we conducted our work at the office of the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) , the financial management and comptroller offices of the army , the navy , and the air force , and 12 military service major commands . we conducted this performance audit from july 2007 through september 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we received written comments from the acting deputy chief financial officer , which are reprinted in appendix ii .
