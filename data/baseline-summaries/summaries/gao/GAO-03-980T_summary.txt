( see app . these comments should provide useful context in the subcommittee's oversight of post - conflict assistance to iraq . humanitarian assistance following armed conflict in bosnia , kosovo , and afghanistan , as well as in iraq , is part of a broader , long - term assistance effort comprising humanitarian , military , economic , governance , and democracy - building measures . the post - conflict situations in these locations have varied , but they have certain conditions in commonï£§most notably the volatile and highly politicized environment in which assistance operations take place . we found that a secure environment , a strategic vision , and strong leadership are the key components needed for effective implementation of assistance efforts . in addition , we observed a number of challenges to these efforts , including the need for sustained political commitment , adequate human and financial resources to carry out operations , coordinated assistance , and the support of the host government and civil society . our work also showed that the international community and the united states provide a number of mechanisms for accountability and oversight with regard to assistance operations . in bosnia , conflict raged from 1992 through 1995 and involved the federal republic of yugoslavia , croatia , and bosnia's three major ethnic groups . all were fighting for control of specific territories tied to each group's definition of its own state . during this time an estimated 2.3 million people became refugees or were internally displaced . nato forces intervened in the conflict to support international humanitarian and peacekeeping operations beginning in 1993 , culminating in a month - long bombing campaign against bosnian - serb forces in july 1995 . this pressure and u.s. - led negotiating efforts resulted in a cease - fire and negotiation of the dayton peace agreement in december 1995 .
