( see fig . in addition to the 1,455 long - term leases set to expire that experienced extensions and holdovers described previously , 1,603 leases were already in holdover or extension at the beginning of fiscal year 2012 . of these , most — 1,382 leases ( 86 percent ) — were in extension at the beginning of the time period , with the remaining 221 leases ( 14 percent ) in holdover . moreover , similar to the long - term lease expirations described previously , many of these leases experienced both holdovers and extensions during the course of the 3-year period . specifically , of the 1,382 leases that were in extension at the beginning of fiscal year 2012 , 309 leases — or approximately 22 percent — also experienced a holdover . similarly , of the 221 leases that were in holdover at the beginning of fiscal year 2012 , 92 leases — or approximately 42 percent — would also experience an extension over the following three years . according to our analysis of gsa's data , holdovers and extensions in gsa's portfolio vary in duration . since gsa's monthly lease inventory snapshots do not capture the specific date a holdover or extension begins , these data provide limited information about the duration of holdovers and extensions . however , we determined the data were sufficiently reliable in estimating some information about duration , including the number of months gsa leases spent in holdover status from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and the planned duration of leases that entered into extension from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 . during the course of the 3-year period from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 , we estimated that the median duration for holdovers was 3 months . about half of all holdovers remained in this status for 3 months or less , as shown in figure 4 . however , since some holdovers may have begun prior to fiscal year 2012 and lasted beyond fiscal year 2014 , the durations of these holdovers may be longer . the median planned duration of an extension was 1.4 years , with about 60 percent of all extensions expected to last for 2 years or less , as shown in figure 5 . during the 3 fiscal years in our review period , incidences of holdovers and extensions in gsa's portfolio occurred in all 11 gsa regions . specifically , 4 of gsa's 11 regions — the southeast sunbelt , national capital region , greater southwest , and northeast and caribbean — together accounted for approximately 70 percent of all holdovers that occurred from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 , while correspondingly accounting for 46 percent of all leases in gsa's portfolio during this same time period . ( see table 1. ) similarly , 5 of gsa's 11 regions — the greater southwest , southeast sunbelt , pacific rim , great lakes , and national capital region — collectively accounted for approximately 70 percent of all extensions while accounting for 65 percent of all leases .
