the navy recommends changes to some requirements . the chief of naval operations directs fleet commanders to terminate the incineration of plastics at sea , citing beliefs that incineration presents safety and health hazards . the navy reports to congress on annex v compliance . proposed amendments to the marine plastic pollution research and control act would extend the navy's compliance date regarding the discharge of plastics from december 31 , 1993 , to december 31 , 1998 ; extend submarines' compliance with discharge requirements to 2008 ; and adopt a special area standard of “no floating waste , no plastic waste.” the naval sea systems command ship environmental technology task force report revises shipboard environmental issues identified in the task force report document of march 9 , 1992 . the report includes solid and plastics waste management . the navy issues its study addressing the incineration of plastics aboard ships . the study concludes that 100-percent plastics waste yields higher levels of dioxins and furans than lesser percentages , but does not address health exposure concerns . in the 1993 amendments to the act to prevent pollution from ships , the solid waste compliance date for surface ships is extended to december 31 , 1998 ; the special area compliance date for surface ships is extended to december 31 , 2000 ; and the solid waste compliance date and special area discharge requirements for submarines is extended to december 31 , 2008 . the 1993 amendments require the navy to ( 1 ) issue a request for proposals for the plastics processors by october 1 , 1994 ; ( 2 ) install the first production unit of the plastics processor in a navy ship by july 1 , 1996 , 25 percent of ships by march 1 , 1997 , 50 percent by july 1 , 1997 , 75 percent by july 1 , 1998 , and all ships requiring a processor by december 31 , 1998 ; and ( 3 ) develop a compliance plan by november 30 , 1996 . the navy notifies fleet operating units that a violation of the 3 / 20-day rule for storing plastic waste , except for discharges that are made because of ship safety , crew health , or saving a life at sea , is a felony offense under federal law . ( continued ) the navy establishes a steering committee to oversee development of the congressionally required compliance plan and to ensure the plan is coordinated with federal agencies and the public . the navy estimates that developing the plan will cost $7.5 million . the navy starts at - sea evaluations of preproduction prototype pulper , shredder , and plastics processor onboard the uss george washington . the navy suspends acquisition and installation of the pulper and shredder because they will not enable navy ships to meet requirements . the pulper and shredder were being developed based on anticipated congressional approval of the navy's proposal to ease requirements . fleet operating units continue to purchase commercial compactors and other commercial solid waste processing equipment . appendix i expands and updates this chronology .
