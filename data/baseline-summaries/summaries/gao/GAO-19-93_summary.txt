see figure 5 . two of our six selected advance contracts that were bridge contracts were awarded to support fema's public assistance program , which provides supplemental federal assistance to state , tribal , territorial , and local governments for debris removal , life - saving emergency protective measures , and the repair , replacement , or restoration of damaged facilities . the predecessor public assistance - technical assistance contract ( pa - tac ) used in 2017 , known as pa - tac iii , was awarded with an original period of performance from a base year in february 2012 with four 1-year options that ended in february 2017 . fema officials noted that changes to the pa - tac iii contract requirements and acquisition strategy were identified in 2015 . yet due to the time needed to incorporate these changes , fema was unable to complete required acquisition planning activities , such as finalizing the acquisition plan , prior to the expiration of pa - tac iii . following 11 months of extensions to complete these activities , fema competitively awarded new contracts in december 2017 . these awards were protested to the gao and the protests were denied and are currently under review at the court of federal claims . according to fema officials , these events required pa - tac iii to be extended until january 2019 , as shown in figure 6 . the remaining bridge contract in our sample is associated with the wireline services program , a telecommunication program that provides fema employees deployed to respond to a disaster with local and long - distance telephone , high - speed data , and cable television services . the 5 year wireline predecessor contract was awarded in 2003 and again in 2008 , but fema was unable to award a competed contract when the 2008 contract expired in december 2013 due to the time it took to update program requirements . fema contracting officials extended the contract for 6 months before letting it expire altogether . due to high staff turnover and inconsistent record keeping , at the time of our review fema officials were unable to determine the cause for this lapse of service , which occurred after the contract's expiration in june 2014 . starting in january 2015 , fema contracting officials used a series of bridge contracts over more than three years to address changing contract requirements and delays in completing acquisition planning documentation , as shown in figure 7 . fema contracting officials anticipated awarding a competitive contract by the end of fiscal year 2018 , but the award has been delayed and the existing contract extended through january 2019 . in one of the bridge contracts included in our review , fema improperly used far clause 52.217-8 . according to that clause , an agency may extend a contract's period of performance for up to 6 months and is generally used in the event of circumstances outside of the contracting officer's control that prevent the new contract award , such as a bid protest . this clause may be used multiple times to extend the contract so long as the total extension of performance does not exceed 6 months .
