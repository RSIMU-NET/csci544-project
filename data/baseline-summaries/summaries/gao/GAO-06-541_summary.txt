( fig . 54 in app . ii shows those offsetting trends. ) figure 13 below shows that the share of assets held by depository institutions in the united states and foreign countries has also increased over the past decade . a large part of this growth can be attributed to the increase in u.s. and foreign securities investments . loans made by puerto rico's depository institutions , which we assume to be primarily local , have also increased steadily . puerto rican government debt has increased steadily over the past decade . between 1995 and 2005 , puerto rico's real total public debt outstanding increased from $25.6 billion to $36.4 billion ( see fig . most of puerto rican public debt is sold in the u.s. market , but the amount sold within puerto rico has increased steadily since 1999 . in 2005 an estimated $31.6 billion was sold in the united states , and $4.8 billion was sold locally in puerto rico . in appendix ii we include both the breakdown of debt payable by the government and debt issued by the government but repaid by others ( such as the federal government or the private sector ) because there are differences of opinion about what should be termed “government debt” ( see figs . an example of this type of debt is the series of bond issues linked to the children's trust fund between 2001 and 2005 , all of which are backed by assets from the united states attorney general's 1999 master tobacco settlement agreement . between 1995 and 2005 , total debt issued by the puerto rican government , but payable by others , increased from an estimated $6.6 billion to an estimated $7.1 billion in 2005 . figure 15 shows the level and composition of gross investment spending in puerto rico from 1980 to 2005 . during the recession of the early 1980s , investment fell below 10 percent of gdp by 1983 . thereafter , investment recovered and remained around 15 percent of gdp for a number of years until a period of rapid growth in largely private - sector investment in the late 1990s pushed the share close to 20 percent of gdp by 2000 . investment rates have fallen back to about 15 percent of gdp most recently . if puerto rico's investment rate remains at recent levels , the gap between u.s. and puerto rican per capita incomes is unlikely to diminish . the u.s. investment rate , including both private investment and a measure of government investment , has been about 19 percent of gdp in recent years . continuation of these relative investment rates implies that the per capita income gap is unlikely to narrow significantly , unless capital formation is augmented by increases in employment , education , training , or other types of productivity improvements . figure 16 shows a breakdown of census data on capital spending in the manufacturing sector for 1987 , 1992 , 1997 , and 2002 . the data show that investment in manufacturing dipped significantly between 1992 and 1997 , before rebounding by 2002 . this slump in investment does not appear in the planning board investment data for private sector investment shown in figure 15 .
