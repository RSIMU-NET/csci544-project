faster . fda generally makes decisions on 510 ( k ) submissions faster than it makes decisions on pma submissions . fda's fiscal year 2009 goal is to review and decide on 90 percent of 510 ( k ) submissions within 90 days and 98 percent of them within 150 days . the comparable goal for pmas is to review and decide upon 60 percent of original pma submissions in 180 days and 90 percent of them within 295 days . less expensive . the estimated cost to fda for reviewing submissions is substantially lower for 510 ( k ) submissions than for pma submissions . for fiscal year 2005 , for example , according to fda the estimated average cost for the agency to review a 510 ( k ) submission was about $18,200 , while the estimate for a pma submission was about $870,000 . for the applicant , the standard fee provided to fda at the time of submission is also significantly lower for a 510 ( k ) submission than for a pma submission . in fiscal year 2009 , for example , the standard fee for 510 ( k ) submissions is $3,693 , while the standard fee for original pma submissions is $200,725 . consumer advocates have raised questions regarding the number of devices , particularly class iii devices , that are cleared through the 510 ( k ) process and regarding the use of the 510 ( k ) process to clear devices that may utilize new technologies that are different than those in the marketed devices to which they are compared . officials of associations representing medical device manufacturers , however , have asserted that the 510 ( k ) premarket review is an important tool for reviewing device submissions , saying that it is a rigorous process that gives fda the flexibility to identify and request the information it needs to assess the safety and effectiveness of medical devices . in fiscal years 2003 through 2007 , fda reviewed all submissions for class i and ii devices through the 510 ( k ) process , and reviewed submissions for some types of class iii devices through the 510 ( k ) process and others through the pma process . specifically , fda reviewed all 13,199 submissions for class i and class ii devices through the 510 ( k ) process , clearing 11,935 ( 90 percent ) of these submissions . fda also reviewed 342 submissions for class iii devices through the 510 ( k ) process , clearing 228 ( 67 percent ) of these submissions . in addition , the agency reviewed 217 original pma submissions and 784 supplemental pma submissions for class iii devices and approved 78 percent and 85 percent , respectively , of these submissions . although congress envisioned that class iii devices would be approved through the more stringent pma process , we found that fda has not published regulations requiring pma submissions for some types of preamendment class iii devices nor has it reclassified them . as a result , some types of class iii devices have been cleared for the u.s. market through the 510 ( k ) process .
