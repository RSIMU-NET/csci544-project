gao - 03-357 . washington , d.c.: march 31 , 2003 ; child welfare: most states are developing statewide information systems , but the reliability of child welfare data could be improved . gao - 03-809 . washington , d.c.: july 31 , 2003 ; and child welfare: enhanced federal oversight of title iv - b could provide states additional information to improve services . gao - 03-956 . washington , d.c.: september 12 , 2003 . those findings were based on multiple methodologies , including a survey of child welfare directors on states' use of title iv - b funds ; an analysis of 600 exit interview documents completed by staff who severed their employment from 17 state , 40 county , and 19 private child welfare agencies ; and a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia regarding their experiences in developing and using information systems and their ability to report data to hhs . in each case , we supplemented these surveys and analyses by conducting multiple site visits to selected states and by interviewing child welfare experts and hhs headquarters and regional officials . furthermore , one official reported that no specific efforts have been conducted to track the individual data elements and , therefore , hhs cannot report on how data quality has changed over time . although the states we visited appreciated some of hhs's efforts to assist with improving state data quality , they and most states responding to our survey agreed that the assistance is not always consistent or easily accessible . the primary concerns reported by the states we visited were delays in receiving clear written guidance on defining and reporting certain data elements and the lack of state input in suggesting changes to afcars . despite the written guidance available to states in the form of regulations and an online policy manual , states reported that the variation in state policies and practices makes it difficult to interpret how to apply the general guidance . as a result , states consult with hhs to ensure they are applying the regulations appropriately . however , in commenting on a draft of the july 2003 report , officials in oklahoma told us that a common concern among the states is the lack of timely response from hhs when seeking guidance on how to report data . in commenting on a draft of the same report , hhs explained that it first refers states to its web site for information and believes that the available guidance addresses states' concerns in most instances . in addition , the states that have had an afcars review experienced delays in obtaining guidance on how to proceed following the on - site review . an hhs official told us that since the review process is relatively new , the agency is still developing a process to respond to the states and recognizes that it has not been responsive to the states already reviewed . in addition , hhs is taking steps to gather feedback from states and other users of afcars data to determine how to improve the system to make the data more accurate and usable .
