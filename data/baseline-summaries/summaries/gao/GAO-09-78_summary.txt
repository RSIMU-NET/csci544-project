population size is increasing . nmfs officials said they have not established a take reduction team for one marine mammal stock that meets the statutory requirements – – the central north pacific stock of humpback whales – – because of insufficient funding ; however , this stock would be a low priority because the stock's population size is increasing . this stock is strategic because it is listed as an endangered species under the esa and it interacts with a category i fishery off the coast of hawaii and multiple category ii commercial fisheries in the waters off alaska's coast . however , because its population size is increasing , nmfs officials consider the stock to be a lower priority for establishing a team than stocks with declining populations . for the five take reduction teams subject to the mmpa's deadlines , nmfs has had limited success in meeting the deadlines for a variety of reasons . nmfs did not meet the statutory deadlines to establish take reduction teams for three of the five teams , in one case due to a lack of information about population size or mortality . in addition , two of the five teams did not submit their draft take reduction plans to nmfs within the statutory deadlines , in one case because the team could not reach consensus on a plan . nmfs did not publish proposed take reduction plans within the statutory deadlines for any of the five teams because of the time needed to complete the federal rulemaking process , among other things . however , nmfs has complied with the statutory deadlines for the public comment periods on the proposed plans for all five teams . finally , nmfs did not publish final take reduction plans within the statutory deadlines for four of the five teams because of the time associated with analyzing public comments , among other things . according to the mmpa , nmfs has 30 days to establish a take reduction team after a stock is listed as strategic in a final stock assessment report and is listed as interacting with a category i or ii fishery in the current list of fisheries . table 1 outlines these statutory requirements and deadlines . significant limitations in available information make it difficult for nmfs to accurately determine which marine mammal stocks meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams . the mmpa states that stocks are strategic – – one of two triggers for establishing a take reduction team – – if their human - caused mortality exceeds maximum removal levels . however , the information nmfs uses to calculate human - caused mortality or the maximum removal level for most stocks is incomplete , outdated , or imprecise , a fact that may lead nmfs to overlook some marine mammal stocks that meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams and inappropriately identify others as meeting them . nmfs officials said that funding constraints limit their ability to gather sufficient data , although the agency has taken steps to identify its data needs . our review of stock assessment reports from 2007 found that nmfs was missing key information to make well - informed strategic status determinations for a significant number of marine mammal stocks .
