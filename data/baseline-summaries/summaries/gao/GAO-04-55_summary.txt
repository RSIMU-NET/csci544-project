see figure 4 . as the estimates from state contacts indicate , no clear picture is emerging on when phase ii will be fully deployed nationwide , raising the prospect of piecemeal availability of this service across the country for an indefinite number of years to come . as of october 2003 , nena estimates that over the next 5 years the nationwide cost to deploy phase ii will be between $8 billion and $9 billion , including capital and incremental operating expenses . funding for psap equipment upgrades remains a major issue for many states and localities and continues to hamper nationwide deployment . not all states have implemented a funding mechanism for wireless e911 , and of those that have , some have redirected e911 funds to unrelated uses . in addition , poor coordination among the parties is a factor affecting wireless e911 deployment , although some states and localities have eased this problem with active and knowledgeable state 911 coordinators who help oversee the process and work with all the parties . technologically , the main hurdle of developing wireless location equipment for mobile phones has been solved , but the continuing emergence of new wireless devices and services has the potential to overburden the current 911 infrastructure . it is costly to implement wireless e911 services . psaps need money to upgrade their systems and equipment and to purchase new software to receive and display caller location information . wireless carriers incur costs associated with handset and network upgrades , engineering design , upgrading hardware and software , and maintaining the system . the lecs also incur costs , but generally these are paid for by the psaps as they purchase 911 services and upgrades from the lecs . currently , funding must come from sources other than the federal government , which has not provided funding to psaps or wireless carriers for wireless e911 or established guidelines on how wireless e911 should be funded . at present , it is up to state and local governments to determine how to pay for psap wireless e911 upgrades . to cover the costs associated with implementing wireless e911 , responses to our survey showed that the majority of states ( 39 states plus the district of columbia ) require wireless carriers to collect funds from their subscribers through a surcharge included on subscribers' monthly wireless phone bills . the amount of the surcharge is usually determined by the state ; responses to our survey showed the surcharges ranged from 5 cents to $1.50 per month . generally , the wireless carriers submit the funds to the states , and the states have the discretion to determine how the funds will be managed . for example , some states have established e911 boards that oversee the funds , while other states allow the funds to be managed at the county or psap level . methods of disbursement also varied . some states allocated wireless e911 funds to psaps based on their jurisdictional population , while some based it on the number of wireless subscribers in the jurisdiction . other states evenly divided the funds among counties or psaps . although the majority of states have established some type of funding mechanism , problems with funding psap equipment upgrades persist .
