cms did not have any general comments . the agency provided one technical comment , which we incorporated . as agreed with your offices , unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier , we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date . ( see fig . according to cms officials , the agency used the same methodology to determine the 2013 risk score adjustment as it used in 2011 and 2012 , resulting in a risk score adjustment of 3.4 percent for 2013 . cms conducted a data - based analysis of coding differences for 2013 and considered the results , along with other factors , in determining the adjustment provided for in the social security act . to conduct its data - based analysis , cms officials reported that they used the same methodology they used to calculate the 3.4 percent adjustment for 2010 , but incorporated more recent data . in addition to the results of their data - based analysis , cms officials told us that they took into account other factors when determining the 2013 risk score adjustment , such as payment changes made to the ma program under the patient protection and affordable care act , the stability of the ma program , and the maintenance of benefits for seniors . cms's risk score adjustment of 3.4 percent for 2013 is the same that it used in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 . this appendix describes the scope and methodology that we used to address our objective to determine the extent to which differences , if any , in diagnostic coding between medicare advantage ( ma ) plans and medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) affected risk scores and payments to ma plans in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 . this methodology includes enhancements from the methodology we used in our january 2012 report . to determine the extent to which differences , if any , in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs affected ma risk scores in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 , we compared actual risk score growth for beneficiaries in our ma study population with the estimated risk score growth these beneficiaries would have had if they had been enrolled in medicare ffs . for our estimates , we assumed ma plans and medicare ffs had equivalent coding patterns in 2006 — the year of coding upon which 2007 risk scores were based — and therefore calculated the cumulative effect of coding differences starting with risk score data from 2007 . because 2010 risk score data were the most current data available at the time of our analysis , we projected the extent of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 on the basis of trends from 2005 through 2010 . see appendix i for more details on our scope and methodology . to describe changes , if any , cms made to its coding adjustment methodology for 2013 and intends to make for future years , we reviewed cms documents and interviewed cms staff . in particular , we indentified the extent to which cms planned to update its methodology to incorporate recent data , additional beneficiary characteristics , and account for trends in practice pattern disparities .
