( see app . ii for the number of children in racial and ethnic groups included in clinical studies for drugs granted additional exclusive marketing rights from january 4 , 2002 , through march 6 , 2003. ) fda required that sponsors increase representation of children of ethnic and racial minority groups in clinical studies for drugs used to treat diseases that disproportionately affect children in such groups or where evidence from studies on adults suggests that for certain classes of drugs differences in metabolism or response for racial or ethnic groups exist . for example , because hypertension is more prevalent and more severe in african americans than in caucasians , and adult responses to some hypertension therapies appear to be different in african american and non - african american populations , fda's written requests for these drugs require that the patient recruitment protocol be designed to ensure a mixture of african american and non - african american patients . therefore , in pediatric clinical studies for three cardiovascular drugs used to treat hypertension , african american children represented 22 percent of study participants ( see table 2 ) . for some written requests issued since bpca took effect , fda required sponsors to increase the participation of minority children . specifically , 4 of the 22 written requests for such studies directed sponsors to increase the proportion of minority children participants or to analyze the effects of race and ethnicity . in 11 of the 22 requests , fda directed drug sponsors to report the representation of pediatric patients of ethnic and racial minority groups when submitting final study results , but did not request that sponsors include a particular proportion of minority children or analyze the effects of race and ethnicity . the remaining 7 written requests made no mention of race or ethnicity . fda's four study requests that directed sponsors to increase the proportion of minority children participants or to analyze the effects of race or ethnicity took varied approaches . one written request by fda required that the sponsor include a mixture of african american and non - african american patients for a study of a drug used to treat hypertension . two other requests , for diabetes drugs , required the study sponsors to ensure that 50 percent of the study populations were composed of african american , native american , and hispanic patients because of a greater prevalence of diabetes in these groups . in the fourth written request , for a drug used to prevent bone loss , fda required that the study sponsor examine potential demographic covariates , such as race . some drugs that may be used to treat diseases or conditions that disproportionately affect children of racial and ethnic minority groups are being studied under the pediatric exclusivity provision . in response to fda written requests , drug sponsors are conducting or have completed pediatric studies on drugs that might be used to treat hypertension , type ii diabetes , sickle cell anemia , and other conditions that disproportionately affect minorities .
