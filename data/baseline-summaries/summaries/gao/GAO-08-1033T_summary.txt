over time , the bay's ecosystem has deteriorated . the bay's “dead zones” — where too little oxygen is available to support fish and shellfish — have increased , and many species of fish and shellfish have experienced major declines in population . the decline in the bay's living resources has been cause for a great deal of public and political attention . responding to public outcry , on december 9 , 1983 , representatives of maryland , pennsylvania , and virginia ; the district of columbia ; epa ; and the chesapeake bay commission signed the first chesapeake bay agreement . these commitments are organized under the following five broad restoration goals: protecting and restoring living resources — 14 commitments to restore , enhance , and protect the finfish , shellfish and other living resources , their habitats and ecological relationships to sustain all fisheries and provide for a balanced ecosystem ; protecting and restoring vital habitats — 18 commitments to preserve , protect , and restore those habitats and natural areas that are vital to the survival and diversity of the living resources of the bay and its rivers ; protecting and restoring water quality — 19 commitments to achieve and maintain the water quality necessary to support the aquatic living resources of the bay and its tributaries and to protect human health ; sound land use — 28 commitments to develop , promote , and achieve sound land use practices that protect and restore watershed resources and water quality , maintain reduced pollutant inputs to the bay and its tributaries , and restore and preserve aquatic living resources ; and stewardship and community engagement — 23 commitments to promote individual stewardship and assist individuals , community - based organizations , businesses , local governments , and schools to undertake initiatives to achieve the goals and commitments of the agreement . as the only federal signatory to the chesapeake bay agreements , epa is responsible for spearheading the federal effort within the bay program through its chesapeake bay program office . among other things , the chesapeake bay program office is to develop and make available information about the environmental quality and living resources of the chesapeake bay ecosystem ; help the signatories to the chesapeake bay agreement develop and implement specific plans to carry out their responsibilities ; and coordinate epa's actions with those of other appropriate entities to develop strategies to improve the water quality and living resources in the chesapeake bay ecosystem . in october 2005 , we found that the bay program had established 101 measures to assess progress toward meeting some restoration commitments and provide information to guide management decisions . for example , the bay program had developed measures for determining trends in individual fish and shellfish populations , such as crabs , oysters , and rockfish . the bay program also had a measure to estimate vehicle emissions and compare them to vehicle miles traveled to help establish reduction goals for contaminants found in these emissions . while the bay program had established these 101 measures , we also found that it had not developed an approach that would allow it to translate these individual measures into an overall assessment of the progress made in achieving the five broad restoration goals .
