this is consistent with nationwide information . according to data collected by dhs as of 2011 , 63 of 72 fusion centers reported that the fusion center's mission included all crimes , and 54 of 72 fusion centers reported that the center's mission included counterterrorism . five fusion centers reported that their mission was exclusively related to counterterrorism . in addition , the overlap in counterterrorism , as well as the overlap between fusion centers and figs , can be explained by fusion centers' unique role as state and local entities . as previously mentioned , fusion centers and figs both , among other things , analyze and disseminate intelligence . however , fusion centers generally conduct these activities to serve as state and local intermediaries , while figs generally conduct these activities to serve as the fbi and u.s. intelligence community intermediaries . thus , while both types of entities may conduct similar analytical activities and services , they are doing so for different purposes . for example , officials from all 10 of the fusion centers that we interviewed explained that their analysts infuse state or local perspectives with information that they receive from federal partners to provide customers with relevant context . overlap in analytical activities and services can be beneficial , for example , by increasing entities' focus on sharing information , validating information , or allowing for competing or complementary analysis ; however , it can also lead to inefficiencies , such as burdening customers with redundant information . officials from six of the seven state and local law enforcement customer agencies we interviewed stated that when entities have information , they feel the need to share it through the production of analytical products and dissemination of information . for example , an official from one local law enforcement agency explained that the benefit of entities disseminating information is that they are ensuring that information gets to those that need it . additionally , officials from all seven of these agencies said that they expect to get all available information to make decisions to protect the citizens in their jurisdiction . the hidta program is focused on counternarcotics ; however , hidta program resources may be used to assist law enforcement agencies in investigations and activities related to terrorism and the prevention of terrorism . the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) established the first jttf in 1980 in its new york city field office after recognizing the value of the task force concept — which it began using in the prior year to jointly investigate bank robberies with the new york city police department — and subsequently applied the concept to counterterrorism . the fbi continued to expand the terrorism task force concept to field offices after september 2001 , increasing the number of jttfs from 35 to 103 . the fbi has 56 field offices ( also called divisions ) centrally located in major metropolitan areas across the united states and puerto rico . within field offices , there are a total of about 400 resident agencies located in smaller cities and towns . each jttf is housed in an fbi field office or resident agency .
