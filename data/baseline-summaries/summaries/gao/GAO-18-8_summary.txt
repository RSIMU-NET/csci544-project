marshals . usms uses a separate process for promoting non - operational employees ( i.e. , administrative ) which we did not include in our scope . we collectively refer to law enforcement employees in our discussion groups as usms employees . to what extent does the usms monitor its merit promotion processes ? what steps , if any , has the usms taken to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion policies and processes ? to address these objectives , we analyzed relevant usms documentation and data . in determining whether the usms merit promotion policies are aligned with federal guidelines , we reviewed relevant provisions in title 5 of the united states code and the code of federal regulations and compared these with certain provisions in the usms merit promotion plan . specifically , we examined the extent to which the usms merit promotion plan conformed to the five general requirements outlined in title 5 of the code of federal regulations that agencies must incorporate in merit promotion programs to ensure a systematic means of selection . in determining the extent to which usms monitors its merit promotion processes , we examined documentation on merit promotion procedures and practices , including documentation on the merit promotion rating process . to examine usms compliance with key aspects of this plan , such as candidate rating and selection , we analyzed merit promotion documentation , including all lists containing competitive candidate scores for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 . we examined the extent to which usms complied with federal regulations on temporary promotions by analyzing the records for all 844 noncompetitive , not - to - exceed 120-day temporary promotion selection records from october 2015 through february 2017 . we reviewed usms compliance with temporary promotion regulations because whistleblowers alleged that candidates who received temporary promotions may have received unfair advantages for permanent promotion . we assessed the reliability of the temporary promotions data we used by reviewing the data for missing elements , outliers , and obvious errors , and interviewing officials about data errors and applicable quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data . to what extent are the usms's merit promotion policies aligned with federal guidelines ? although we found some inconsistencies , such as incorrect documentation of legal citations and some missing data elements , we determined these data were sufficiently reliable for identifying the extent to which non - competitive temporary promotions exceeded the regulatory limit of 120 days . we evaluated usms internal control activities against standards for internal control in the federal government to determine the extent to which usms has developed internal control mechanisms to monitor the implementation of key steps in the merit promotion process . we reviewed all job vacancy announcements for fiscal years 2015 , 2016 , and part of fiscal year 2017 ( october 2016 through april 2017 ) to determine the extent to which usms has documented steps in accordance with office of personnel management ( opm ) requirements . to identify areas of concern raised by employees , we reviewed usms federal employee viewpoint survey data for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 .
