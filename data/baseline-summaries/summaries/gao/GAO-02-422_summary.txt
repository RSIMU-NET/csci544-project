reminders . these interventions include computer - generated or other approaches by which medical offices ( 1 ) reminded physicians to provide the preventive service as part of services performed during a medical visit or ( 2 ) generated notices to patients that it was time to make an appointment for the service . studies show that reminders to either patients or physicians can effectively improve rates for cancer screening . however , a computerized provider reminder is consistently more cost effective than notifying the patient directly when a computerized information system is already available in a physician's medical office . patient reminders that are personalized or signed by the patient's physician are more effective than generic reminders . what action has cms taken to increase use of preventive services among the medicare population ? to answer these questions , we estimated medicare beneficiaries' use of services from a nationwide , state - based survey conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . we obtained information about effective techniques to increase use of preventive services from published reports and discussions with program officials at the federal and state levels who are responsible for implementing projects intended to increase the use of preventive services . for both questions , we conducted interviews with officials from the department of health and human services , cdc , the national institutes of health , cms , and the agency for health care research and quality . we also spoke with representatives from the partnership for prevention , a nonprofit association involved in the research and promotion of preventive services . we conducted our work from august through february 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . when the medicare program was established in 1965 , it only covered health care services for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury . preventive services did not fall into either of these categories and , consequently , were not covered . since 1980 , the congress has amended medicare law several times to add coverage for certain preventive services for different age and risk groups within the medicare population . ( see table 1. ) for most of these services , medicare requires some degree of cost - sharing by beneficiaries , although most beneficiaries have additional insurance , which may cover most , if not all , of these cost - sharing requirements . some services , such as pneumonia and flu shots and the fecal - occult blood test for colorectal cancer , have no cost - sharing requirements . many other preventive services exist besides those specifically covered as preventive services under medicare , such as blood pressure screening and cholesterol screening . although medicare does not explicitly provide coverage for these other services , medicare beneficiaries may receive some of them during office visits for other medical problems . data from surveys of medicare beneficiaries indicate that the receipt of such services is common . for example , in 1999 , nearly 98 percent of seniors reported that they had had their blood pressure checked within the last 2 years , and more than 88 percent of seniors reported having their cholesterol checked within the prior 5 years .
