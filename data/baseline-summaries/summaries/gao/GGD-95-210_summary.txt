but there were no signs there . the only clue was a sign on the person's desk saying that he was a registered representative for a company . for the entire time we were in the bank until we met with him , we could not have known that they sold mutual funds . the mutual fund sales desk was co - located in an area offering traditional banking activities such as new accounts and customer service . the mutual fund sales desk did not contain any signs or displays to distinguish it from other banking activities . in fact , the mutual fund sales desk was located next to the main bank reception desk near the front door of the bank . ( all desks were separated by 3-foot partitions ) .” “the bank floor space was extremely limited . desks were fairly close together — all bank activities were in close proximity to one another . although the space was limited , there was a hanging sign clearly marked “investment services.” there was one sign on the desk approximately 10” x 12” displaying the proprietary fund which stated non - fdic insured and not guaranteed by the bank . this information was at the bottom of the sign and readable , the size of the print was fine . a kiosk next to the desk also identified the same information . overall , disclosure was fairly clear to a new customer.” “two desks were located at the far end of the lobby approximately 25 feet from the teller windows . they were the only 2 desks in that space — one desk belonged to the mutual fund sales representative and the other to his assistant . both desks faced the lobby with the representative's desk on the right if one were looking at the mutual fund area . to the right of the representative's desk was a very large ( 3'x 5' ) , lighted sign indicating the sale of mutual funds . a rack of mutual fund brochures was to the right of the sign . no other bank activities were near the mutual fund area. the banking regulators' guidance states that “in no case” should tellers and other employees , while located in the routine deposit - taking area , such as the teller window , make general or specific investment recommendations regarding nondeposit investment products , qualify a customer as eligible to purchase such products , or accept orders for such products , even if unsolicited . however , tellers and other employees who are not authorized to sell nondeposit investment products may refer customers to individuals who are specifically designated and trained to assist customers interested in the purchase of such products . most of the banks and thrifts that sold mutual funds indicated in their responses to our questionnaire that they limited their employees — tellers , other branch employees , and bank and branch managers — to referring customers to designated nondeposit investment sales personnel . the activities of bank tellers were the most restricted — only about 3 percent were permitted to do anything other than refer customers to designated investment sales personnel .
