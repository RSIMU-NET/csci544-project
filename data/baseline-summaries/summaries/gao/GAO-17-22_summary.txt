these analyses are described in more detail below . to assess the reliability of education's budget estimates , we interviewed agency officials , reviewed related documentation , and conducted extensive electronic testing . we believe the data are reliable to report in objective one as a representation of the funding education reports is necessary to operate the direct loan program , and in objective two , to illustrate the sensitivity of education's budget estimates to different assumptions about future loan repayment activity and to illustrate currently expected forgiveness amounts . to analyze education's current idr plan budget estimates and how they have changed over time , we reviewed education's annual submissions to the president's budget for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 , which include estimated idr plan loan volume and subsidy rates for direct loans to be issued in the year the of the budget and the two preceding fiscal years . for example , the budget submission for fiscal year 2011 included estimated idr plan costs for loans in fiscal years 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 . we used these budgets to identify the original idr plan cost estimates for the 2009 through 2016 cohorts . what are education's current idr plan budget estimates and how have they changed over time ? to what extent do education's approach to estimating idr plan costs and quality control practices help ensure reliable budget estimates ? we used a variety of methods to answer these questions . education's strategic plan emphasizes the importance of information transparency as a tool to encourage data - driven decision - making and improve the u.s. educational system . we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance regarding subsidy cost estimates and idr plans . we also interviewed officials from the congressional budget office and the u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) and staff from the office of management and budget ( omb ) , the office that oversees the formulation of the president's budget , as well as higher education policy experts to discuss issues related to federal budgeting practices and estimated idr plan costs . additionally , we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from education about the agency's approach to estimating costs and its quality control practices . we analyzed data underlying education's annual budget estimates for the direct loan program . to address our first objective , we analyzed data from two sources: ( 1 ) education's annual submissions to the president's budget for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 and ( 2 ) supplemental data provided by education that rely on the data and assumptions underlying its fiscal year 2016 and 2017 budget estimates . to address our second objective , we reviewed the computer programs and data education uses to estimate repayment patterns for loans in idr plans . we then used these programs to generate our own estimates of how changing selected assumptions would affect cost estimates . we also analyzed estimated cash flow data for loans in idr plans to estimate the proportion of loan dollars education expects to be forgiven through these plans .
