and libraries . .” based on this direction , and following the recommendations of a federal - state joint board on universal service , fcc established the schools and libraries universal service mechanism that is commonly referred to as the e - rate program . the program is funded through statutorily mandated payments by companies that provide interstate telecommunications services . as explained below , funds that are appropriated funds are subject , unless specifically exempted by law , to a variety of statutory provisions providing a scheme of funds controls . see b - 257525 , nov. 30 , 1994 ; 63 comp . gen. 31 ( 1983 ) ; 35 comp . gen. 436 ( 1956 ) ; b - 204078.2 , may 6 , 1988 . the antideficiency act has been termed “the cornerstone of congressional efforts to bind the executive branch of government to the limits on expenditure of appropriated funds.” primarily , the purpose of the antideficiency act is to prevent the obligation and expenditure of funds in excess of the amounts available in an appropriation or in advance of the appropriation of funds . fcc has determined that the antideficiency act applies to usf , and as explained below , we agree with fcc's conclusion . the antideficiency act applies to “officer or employee of the united states government . on the other hand , funds that are not appropriated funds are not subject to such controls unless the law specifically applies such controls . thus , we believe the initial question is whether usf funds are appropriated funds . as established above , usf is an “appropriation or fund.” the fact that usac , a private entity whose employees are not federal officers or employees , is the administrator of the e - rate program and obligates and disburses funds from usf is not dispositive of the application of the antideficiency act . this is because , as the fcc recognizes , it , not usac , is the entity that is legally responsible for the management and oversight of the e - rate program and fcc's employees are federal officers and employees of the united states subject to the antideficiency act . where entities operate with funds that are regarded as appropriated funds , such as some government corporations , they , too , are subject to the antideficiency act . see eg , b - 223857 , feb. 27 , 1987 ( funds available to commodity credit corporation pursuant to borrowing authority are subject to antideficiency act ) ; b - 135075-o.m. , feb. 14 , 1975 ( inter - american foundation ) . the antideficiency act applies to permanent appropriations such as revolving funds and special funds . 72 comp . gen. 59 ( 1992 ) ( corps of engineers civil works revolving fund subject to antideficiency act ) ; b - 120480 , sep. 6 , 1967 , b - 247348 , june 22 , 1992 , and b - 260606 , july 25 , 1997 ( gpo revolving funds subject to antideficiency act ) ; 71 comp . gen. 224 ( 1992 ) ( special fund that receives fees , reimbursements , and advances for services available to finance its operations is subject to antideficiency act ) .
