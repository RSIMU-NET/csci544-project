gao - 07-944t . washington , d.c.: june 7 , 2007 . rma data on premiums were complete for all years . company expense report data on both premiums and commissions were complete for 2006 and 2007 , but were only partially complete for the other years ( 85 percent complete for 2000 , 89 percent complete for 2001 , 70 percent complete for 2002 , 71 percent complete for 2003 , 85 percent complete for 2004 , and 89 percent complete for 2005 ) . data were missing largely because of changes in company structure , such as mergers , acquisitions , and companies' going out of business . we took the following steps to correct for the missing data to avoid overstating any change over time ( since data were more often missing in earlier years ) . figure 7 shows these comparisons . as figure 7 shows , with 2000 as a base year , if commissions had increased at the rate of increase in insurance agents' wages , the commission per policy in 2007 would have been $382 , but the actual commission per policy that insurance companies paid to agencies in 2007 was $985 â€” a difference of $603 per policy . according to our analysis , in 2007 , with about 1.14 million crop insurance policies , actual commission payments exceeded the adjusted commissions by about $687 million . for 2007 through 2009 , estimated commission payments exceed the adjusted commissions by about $2.87 billion . crop insurance industry officials with whom we spoke generally acknowledged that insurance agencies received higher profits as a result of increased commissions in 2007 and 2008 . while some officials said agencies' more profitable financial years are balanced by less profitable years , others said that the method for calculating a&o allowances needs to be modified to bring it more in - line with reasonable expenses for delivering the crop insurance program . finally , a number of insurance company officials supported limiting commissions , although they had differing views on the best way to implement such limits . according to rma and naic officials , higher commissions have increased the incentives for rebating . the rma officials indicated that as commissions have increased , the number of anecdotal reports of rebating has also increased . they also observed that rebating is more prevalent in states with higher commission rates . a number of insurance agency officials told us that they lost business to competitors that they believed engaged in rebating . according to rma officials , rebating disrupts the crop insurance market and discriminates against farmers who purchase smaller policies . state insurance regulators also consider rebating unfair to policyholders because it results in pricing based on the policyholder's relationship to an agent , rather than on risk . rma has determined that the incidence of illegal rebating of crop insurance premiums has grown in recent years . to combat rebating , rma and naic have sought to improve communication and coordination between rma and states on complaints , ongoing investigations , data analyses , and enforcement .
