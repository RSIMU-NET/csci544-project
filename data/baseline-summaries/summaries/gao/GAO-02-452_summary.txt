gao - 01-772 . washington , d.c.: july 31 , 2001 . defense inventory: management of repair parts common to more than one military service can be improved . gao / nsiad - 00-21 . washington , d.c.: october 20 , 1999 . annual purchases fluctuated in all classes . similarly to the navy , the air force purchased over 64 percent of spare parts in the 10 selected classes for engine parts . overall , the air force increased its purchases in eight classes and decreased purchases in the others . spare parts purchased for wheel and brake systems increased by over 703 percent from fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 2000 . spare parts for engines and fuel systems increased by about 95 percent . yearly purchases fluctuated in all classes . the marine corps purchased fewer than 1,600 spare parts a year from the 10 classes . this is clearly a contributing factor . however , at the same time as we recently reported , the defense logistics agency has a number of actions underway to control spare part prices . defense logistics agency data indicates that every year from 1996 to 2000 , the agency supplied the services with smaller quantities of spare parts , from a total of about 353 million in fiscal year 1996 to about 270 million in fiscal year 2000 , a decrease of about 24 percent ( see fig . the number of spare parts the services ordered also decreased about 19 percent during the period , from about 348 million to about 283 million . defense logistics agency officials cited three main reasons for the decline: increased credit card usage , increased contractor maintenance support , and — primarily — military downsizing . the downsizing , which began in the early 1990s , continued through 2000 . according to defense figures , the total number of active duty navy fighter and attack aircraft declined from 504 in fiscal year 1996 to 432 in fiscal year 2000 . similarly , the number of ships ( or ship battle forces ) declined from 355 to 318 . however , the number of air force fighter and attack aircraft remained steady at 936 during the period . as shown in figure 2 , the number of spare parts sold by the defense logistics agency to the air force dropped by about 23 million from about 137 million in fiscal year 1996 to about 114 million in fiscal year 2000 , a 17 percent decrease . during this time , the air force increased the percentage of depot maintenance repair workload performed by the private sector . the other services also increased private sector depot maintenance performance , but to a lesser extent than the air force . figure 3 shows that in fiscal year 1996 , the defense logistics agency sold the army about 96 million spare parts , but by fiscal year 2000 , that number had dropped to about 78 million , a decline of 18 million , or 19 percent .
