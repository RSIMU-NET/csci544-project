numbers of trained pilots . in addition , aircraft readiness challenges led the navy to pause flight training on the t - 45 training aircraft in april 2017 due to safety concerns regarding the oxygen supply systems aboard the training aircraft . navy officials reported that gaps in first tour operational positions designated for all fixed - wing aircraft pilot communities could grow from 86 pilots in fiscal year 2017 to about 100 in fiscal year 2019 . declining retention has also contributed to low fighter pilot numbers . our analysis of air force and navy bonus retention data shows that retention of experienced fighter pilots has declined in recent years . we found that the number of air force fighter pilots that have signed retention contracts decreased from 63 percent in fiscal year 2013 to 35 percent in fiscal year 2017 ( see fig . this decline has continued even as the air force increased its maximum aviation bonus contract from $125,000 in fiscal year 2012 to $225,000 beginning in fiscal year 2013 , the highest amount offered by any of the military services . according to navy retention data , the navy pool of fighter pilots eligible for the department head milestone ( i.e. , a mid - career operational leadership tour for different aspects of squadron management for pilots with between about 11 and 13 years of service ) has shrunk over time . navy officials told us that , as a result , the percentage of fighter pilots selected for the department head milestone has increased . for example , the department head selection rate for navy f / a - 18 pilots increased from 49 percent in fiscal year 2012 to 100 percent in fiscal year 2017 . further , the navy did not meet its goals for fighter pilots signing retention bonuses at the department head milestone in fiscal years 2013 through 2017 . for example , the navy fell short of its retention bonus target of 73 fighter pilots by 38 pilots ( 48 percent of the target ) for fiscal year 2017 . in comparison , the surveillance and transport pilot community met or exceeded its target of pilots who signed a bonus contract 2 out of 5 years during that same period , while the maritime patrol pilot community met or exceeded its target 4 out of 5 years . figure 7 shows the navy department head active component fixed - wing pilot retention bonus take rate for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 . we also compared air force and marine corps reserve component fighter pilot staffing levels with authorizations for fiscal years 2006 through 2017 . for the navy , we obtained and analyzed data on authorizations designated for active and reserve component pilots for fiscal years 2006 through 2017 , and staffing levels for all navy fixed - wing aircraft communities in the active component for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 . however , the navy's authorization data did not specify how many fighter pilots were assigned to non - flying assignments because the navy does not fully assign non - flying authorizations to specific communities , unlike the air force and the marine corps .
