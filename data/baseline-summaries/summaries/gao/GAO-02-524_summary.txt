( see fig . these decreases followed the general trend we previously reported on for the 1990 – 1996 period and , as before , tended to reflect railroad cost reductions brought about by continuing productivity gains in the railroad industry that have allowed railroads to reduce rates in order to be competitive . from 1997 through 2000 , the rates for coal decreased slightly but steadily from about 1.5 cents per ton - mile to about 1.4 cents per ton - mile . coal production fluctuated over this period but generally decreased from about 1.12 billion tons in 1998 to about 1.08 billion tons in 2000 . the production of coal shipped for export also generally decreased from about 83.5 million tons in 1997 to 58.5 million tons in 2000 . the energy information administration attributed these decreases to , among other things , a draw down in coal stocks by utilities and reluctance on the part of some coal producers to expand production . lower demand for rail transportation resulting from lower production generally results in lower rail rates . however , the demand for rail transportation ( and consequently rail rates ) can also be affected by changes in coal held as inventory and other supply - related factors . board officials suggested that the decrease in coal rates during this period could also be attributed in part to increasing competition between low - sulfur powder river basin coal from the west and higher - sulfur eastern coal , and to the expiration and resulting renegotiation of many long - term coal transportation contracts . the rates for wheat increased slightly from 1997 to 1998 — from about 2.46 cents per ton - mile in 1997 to about 2.47 cents per ton - mile — before falling back in 1999 and 2000 to just under 2.4 cents per ton - mile . rates for wheat may have decreased because overall production decreased , from 67.5 million tons for the 1997 – 1998 season to 60.5 million tons for the 2000 – 2001 season , despite a modest increase in demand for exports ( from 28.1 million tons to 30.0 million tons over the same period ) . preliminary information indicates that in 1998 , the most recent year for which data were available , railroads transported over half ( about 55 percent ) of all wheat shipments . corn rates generally decreased from about 2 cents per ton - mile in 1997 to about 1.8 cents per ton - mile in 2000 . from 1997 through 2000 , the average shipment size for wheat continued to be higher in the central plains than in the northern plains . for example , the average shipment size for wheat from the wichita economic area from 1997 through 2000 was about 88 railcars , as compared with about 43 railcars for wheat shipments from the great falls economic area .
