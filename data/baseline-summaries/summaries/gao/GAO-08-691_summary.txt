they then generally rose again until 2001 . from 2001 to april 2008 , the annual rig count in the gulf of mexico decreased from 148 to 58 . this decline has occurred despite the gulf of mexico being generally considered an attractive target for investment , both from the perspective of the government take and because of the potential for significant oil and gas resources . other analyses report the oil and gas industry appears to have performed favorably in recent years compared with other industries . the energy information administration reported in december 2007 that from 2000 through 2006 , the return on equity , which compares a company's profit with the value of the shares held by the company's owners , for the major energy producers , referred to as financial reporting system ( frs ) companies , averaged 7 percentage points higher than that of the u.s. census bureau's “all manufacturing companies.” according to the report , this reversed a trend where the return on equity for the major energy producers averaged 2 percentage points lower than all manufacturing companies from 1985 to 1999 . the american petroleum institute , in a 2007 study , showed that from 2000 to 2005 , the average return on investment for oil and gas production was about 61 percent higher than for the standard & poor's ( s&p ) industries . however , the average return on investment for the industry has matched or exceeded the returns for the s&p industrials only in recent years ; over the 25-year period from 1980 to 2005 , the average return on investment for oil and gas production was about 18 percent lower than for the s&p industries . a gao analysis found that the “upstream,” or exploration and production segments , of the domestic oil and gas production companies also received higher rates of return than companies operating in other u.s. manufacturing industries from 2002 through 2006 . we analyzed financial data from s&p's compustat and eia's frs . from 2002 through 2006 , the upstream segments of the domestic oil and gas production companies have averaged a 17.4 percent return on investment , compared with 15.2 percent for all other manufacturing companies . when both upstream and “downstream” the refining and marketing segments are included in the analysis , the oil and gas industry return on investment averaged over 20 percent during this period . this short term picture , however , contrasts with a longer - term analysis , which shows the oil and gas industry receiving a return on investment that is comparable , or slightly lower , than that received by other manufacturing industries over the past 30 years . our analysis found that during this period , upstream oil and gas production has averaged 11.2 percent return on investment with the entire oil and gas industry receiving an average 13.7 percent return on investment . all other manufacturing companies have averaged 12.3 percent return on investment during this period . this recent improvement in financial performance from 2000 through 2006 coincided with rising oil and gas prices .
