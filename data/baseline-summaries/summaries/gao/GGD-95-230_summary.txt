, 63 percent . using this benchmark , total deposits would have grown $695 billion during 1990 through 1994 . because deposits actually declined by $89 billion , this indicates a potential impact of $784 billion . the same view is propounded by sia . moreover , in a 1994 survey of 205 bank chief executives , nearly half said that their banks had started selling mutual funds in order to retain customers . we did not find any reliable quantification of the full impact of mutual funds on deposits , including both the direct withdrawals and customers' diversion of new receipts that otherwise might have been placed in deposits . we assessed two quantitative approaches: ( 1 ) the total net flows into mutual funds and ( 2 ) ici's estimate of the impact on deposits . because both approaches were incomplete , we examined a third alternative: the relationship between deposits and overall economic activity . this third approach also has limitations because there are a variety of factors that affect the relationship between deposits and gross domestic product ( gdp ) . nonetheless , it provided a more comprehensive look than the other approaches . using the ratio of deposits to gdp as a benchmark , we estimated that — for the period 1990 through 1994 — the total impact of mutual funds on deposits may have been sizable , but probably less than $700 billion . the total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990 through 1994 were $1,067 billion . ( see table 1. ) the impact on deposits had to be less than this amount because the evidence indicated there were also flows into mutual funds from nondeposit sources . for example , some of the money placed in mutual funds by the household sector probably derived from the sales of stocks and bonds since , in 1991 and 1993 , the household sector sold more individual securities than it bought . ( see table 2. ) another possible source of flows into mutual funds was the frequent occurrence of sizable lump - sum distributions to individuals from retirement plans and job - termination arrangements . according to both the federal reserve and sia , much of this money was placed in mutual funds by the recipients . sia's estimate of the impact of mutual funds on deposits was incomplete because it dealt only with the direct impact , i.e. , the withdrawal of existing deposits for the sake of investing in mutual funds . even this estimate of the direct impact was incomplete because it was primarily based on net withdrawals of banks' time deposits , rather than total deposits . using time deposits as a measure , sia stated that the flow from deposits into mutual funds could have been about $200 billion in 1992 and 1993 combined . in fact , during this period declines in time deposits were largely offset by increases in demand deposits . since there is no reporting of either the destinations of deposit withdrawals or of the origins of deposit placements , we cannot be certain whether time deposit withdrawals went into mutual funds or if part of them went into demand deposits .
