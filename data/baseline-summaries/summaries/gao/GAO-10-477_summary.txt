we also interviewed nonprofit association officials . first , we selected six federal grant programs — four from the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and two from the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) — of 26 grant - making federal agencies that offer over 1,000 grant programs annually . we selected hhs and hud as our two primary agencies of focus because of their familiarity and historical relationship with nonprofit organizations . hhs and hud grants address many of the national taxonomy of exempt entities ( ntee ) classifications related to social and housing services . the ntee classification system for nonprofits was devised by the urban institute's national center for charitable statistics ( nccs ) , which is a national clearinghouse of data on the nonprofit sector in the united states . ntee classifications are widely referenced by the internal revenue service and nonprofit researchers and practitioners . hud and hhs grants address ntee categories such as: human services housing and shelter agriculture , food , nutrition community improvement , capacity building youth development health care mental health / crisis intervention civil rights , social action , advocacy as shown in table 2 , the six grants selected are designed to fulfill missions consistent with most of the ntee categories listed above . we selected three states — louisiana , maryland , and wisconsin — and more than 20 local government and nonprofit organizations to which these states award federal funding under some or all of the six grants . doing so , they acknowledge , could help clarify and improve understanding of how indirect costs should be treated . classifying similar costs differently can make it difficult to determine how much money grantees receive for cost activities typically thought of as indirect , and at what rate . for example , the esg program provides states or local government grantees up to 5 percent for administrative costs . as the primary recipients of esg funds , states are required to share at least a portion of this funding with local government subgrantees ; however , there is no such requirement for cost sharing with nonprofits . thus , on its face it may appear as if esg provides no administrative cost reimbursement for nonprofits . federal grant funds flow to the nonprofit sector in various ways , as shown in figure 1 . some grant funds are awarded directly to nonprofits , while others are first awarded to states , local governments , or other entities and then awarded to nonprofit service providers . federal laws , policies , regulations , and guidance associated with federal grants apply regardless of how federal grant funding reaches the final recipients . some federal grant programs contain statutory limits on administrative cost reimbursement for state and local government grantees . additionally , some federal grant programs predetermine a limit for subgrantees ( see table 1 for the statutory limits on the six grants we reviewed ) . omb circulars a - 87 and a - 122 provide guidance to state and local governments and nonprofits on classifying costs as direct or indirect and direct state and local governments to employ the necessary management techniques in order to efficiently and effectively administer federal awards .
