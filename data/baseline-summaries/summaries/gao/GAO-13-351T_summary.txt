resources . my testimony today will describe ( 1 ) how the helium privatization act of 1996 addressed issues we raised in the 1990s and ( 2 ) three urgent issues facing the helium program in the near future . this testimony summarizes and updates the information presented in our may 2010 testimony . when blm first set its price after the 1996 act , its price was estimated to be significantly higher than the market price , but now the reverse is true â€” blm's price for crude helium is estimated to be at or below the market price for refined helium . the 1996 act , like the helium act amendments of 1960 before it , tied the price to the program's operating expenses and debt . if the debt is paid off in 2013 , as projected , the debt will no longer be a factor in setting helium prices . blm officials told us that the 1996 act sets a minimum selling price and that the secretary of the interior has the discretion to set a higher price . in response to a recommendation in the national research council's 2010 report , beginning in fiscal year 2011 , blm implemented a new two - tiered pricing system . under the new pricing system , in - kind sales involving federal agencies continued to be based on the minimum selling price set in the 1996 act , while other sales to nongovernmental entities are charged a higher price based on debt repayment and cost recovery factors . the new pricing system , however , is still not a market - based pricing system . in november 2012 , interior's office of inspector general recommended that blm implement a new helium pricing process by the end of 2013 to ensure a fair return on the sale of helium . how should the helium remaining in storage after 2015 be used ? the helium privatization act of 1996 required blm to offer for sale substantially all of the helium in storage by january 1 , 2015 . while the required amounts have been offered for sale , only 79 percent of the amounts offered for sale have actually been sold ( see table 2 ) . blm will likely still have significantly more crude helium in storage than the 600 million cubic feet required by the 1996 act . as of september 30 , 2012 , there were 11.44 billion cubic feet of conservation helium in storage . according to the 2010 report by the national academies' national research council , the united states could become a net importer of helium within the next 7 to 12 years , and the principal new sources of helium will be in the middle east and russia . given these circumstances , the national academies' report recommended that congress may want to reevaluate how the domestic crude helium reserve is used or conserved . it is uncertain at this point how the helium still remaining in storage after january 1 , 2015 , will be used . in conclusion , mr. chairman , there have been a number of changes in the market for helium since congress passed the helium privatization act of 1996 .
