( see fig . in 2005 , industry revenue generated by traffic traveling at rates over 180 percent r / vc dropped by roughly half a percent . tonnage traveling at rates over 180 percent r / vc dropped by a smaller percentage . while traffic traveling at rates over 180 percent r / vc has generally declined , traffic traveling at rates substantially over the threshold for rate relief has generally increased from 1985 to 2005 ( see fig . this traffic declined in 2003 and 2004 , but rose in 2005 . some areas with access to one class i railroad also have more than half of their traffic traveling at rates that exceed the statutory threshold for rate relief . for example , parts of new mexico and idaho with access to one class i railroad had more than half of all traffic originating in those same areas traveling at rates over 180 percent r / vc . however , we also found instances in which an economic area may have access to two or more class i railroads and still have more than 75 percent of its traffic traveling at rates over 180 percent r / vc , as well as other instances in which an economic area may have access to one class i railroad and have less than 25 percent of its traffic traveling at rates over 180 percent r / vc . stb has taken a number of actions to provide relief for captive shippers . while the staggers rail and icc termination acts encourage competition as the preferred way to protect shippers and to promote the financial health of the railroad industry , they also give stb the authority to adjudicate rate cases to resolve disputes between captive shippers and railroads upon receiving a complaint from a shipper ; approve rail transactions , such as mergers , consolidations , acquisitions , and trackage rights ; prescribe new regulations , such as rules for competitive access and merger approvals ; and inquire into and report on rail industry practices , including obtaining information from railroads on its own initiative and holding hearings to inquire into areas of concern , such as competition . under its adjudicatory authority , stb has developed standard rate case guidelines , under which captive shippers can challenge a rail rate and appeal to stb for rate relief . under the standard rate relief process , stb assesses whether the railroad dominates the shipper's transportation market and , if it finds market dominance , proceeds with further assessments to determine whether the actual rate the railroad charges the shipper is reasonable . stb requires that the shipper demonstrate how much an optimally efficient railroad would need to charge the shipper and construct a hypothetical , perfectly efficient railroad that would replace the shipper's current carrier . as part of the rate relief process , both the railroad and the shipper have the opportunity to present their facts and views to stb , as well as to present new evidence . stb also created alternatives to the standard rate relief process , developing simplified guidelines , as congress required , for cases in which the standard rate guidelines would be too costly or infeasible given the value of the cases .
