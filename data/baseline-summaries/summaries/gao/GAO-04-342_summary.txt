( see table 1. ) generally , the additional funding provided by congress was targeted for specific programs and purposes , enabling the services to acquire systems at a greater rate than originally planned . for example , in fiscal year 2003 the air force requested $23 million to acquire 7 predators , but congress provided over $131 million — an increase of approximately 470 percent — enough to acquire 29 predators to meet operational demands in the war against terrorism . the air force has obligated 71 percent of the predator 2003 funding during its first program year . about $1.8 billion ( 67 percent ) of the money appropriated during the fiscal year 1999-2003 period went for research , development , test and evaluation of the various models , as shown in table 2 . the programs were generally divided into efforts to develop tactical uavs and medium - to - high - altitude endurance uavs and , until 2002 when the predator was armed , were focused on meeting surveillance and reconnaissance needs . only three systems — the army's shadow and the air force's predator and global hawk — have matured to the point where they required procurement funding during fiscal years 1999 through 2003 . by fiscal year 2003 , appropriations totaled nearly $880 million , as shown in table 3 . dod estimates that an additional $938 million in procurement funding will be needed through fiscal year 2005 . dod's planning for developing and fielding uavs does not provide reasonable assurance that uavs will be integrated into the force structure efficiently , although the department has taken certain positive steps to improve its management of the uav program . specifically , dod created a joint uav planning task force and developed a key planning document , the uav roadmap 2002-2027 . in addition to the person named above , fred harrison , lawrence e. dixon , james mahaffey , james driggins , r.k. wild , and kenneth patton also made major contributions to this report . nonproliferation: improvements needed for controls on exports of cruise missile and unmanned aerial vehicles . defense acquisitions: matching resources with requirements is key to the unmanned combat air vehicle program's success . gao - 03-598 . washington , d.c.: june 30 , 2003 . unmanned aerial vehicles: questionable basis for revisions to shadow 200 acquisition strategy . gao / nsiad - 00-204 . washington , d.c.: september 26 , 2000 . unmanned aerial vehicles: progress of the global hawk advanced concept technology demonstration . gao / nsiad - 00-78 . washington , d.c.: april 25 , 2000 . unmanned aerial vehicles: dod's demonstration approach has improved project outcomes . gao / nsiad - 99-33 . washington , d.c.: august 30 , 1999 . unmanned aerial vehicles: progress toward meeting high altitude endurance aircraft price goals . gao / nsiad - 99-29 . washington , d.c.: december 15 , 1998 . unmanned aerial vehicles: outrider demonstrations will be inadequate to justify further production . gao / nsiad - 97-153 .
