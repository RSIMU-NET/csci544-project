these changes are identified in the report . while the results provide some confidence that apparent fluctuations in our results across years are likely attributable to sampling error , the inability to detect significant differences may also be related to the nature of our sample , which was relatively small and was designed only for cross - sectional analysis . our sample is based on a stratified random selection and it is only one of a large number of samples that we may have drawn . therefore no action was taken . this may occur when lobbying firms respond to the contact letters from the secretary of the senate and clerk of the house after usao received the referrals . about 48 percent ( 1,150 of 2,417 ) of referrals are pending further action because usao could not locate the lobbying firm , did not receive a response from the firm after an enforcement action , or plans to conduct additional research to determine if it can locate the lobbying firm . the remaining 11 referrals did not require action or were suspended because the lobbyist or client was no longer in business or the lobbyist was deceased . ld - 203 referrals consist of two types: ld - 203 ( r ) referrals represent lobbying firms that have failed to file ld - 203 reports for their lobbying firm and ld - 203 referrals represent the lobbyists at the lobbying firm who have failed to file their individual ld - 203 reports as required . usao received 1,672 ld - 203 ( r ) referrals ( cumulatively from 2009 through 2014 ) and 2,979 ld - 203 referrals ( cumulatively from 2009 through 2013 from the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house for lobbying firms and lobbyists for noncompliance with reporting requirements . ld - 203 referrals may be more complicated than ld - 2 referrals because both the lobbying firm and the individual lobbyists within the firm are each required to file a ld - 203 . this is consistent with prior reviews . figures 12 through 16 show what lobbyists reported as their ease of understanding the terms associated with ld - 2 reporting requirements from 2012 through 2015 . u.s. attorney's office ( usao ) officials stated that they continue to have sufficient personnel resources and authority under the lda to enforce reporting requirements . this includes imposing civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance . noncompliance refers to a lobbyist's or lobbying firm's failure to comply with the lda . according to usao officials , they have one contract paralegal specialist who primarily handles lda compliance work . additionally , there are five civil attorneys and one criminal attorney whose responsibilities include lda compliance work . about 53 percent ( 888 of 1,672 ) of the lobbying firms referred by the secretary of the senate and clerk of the house for noncompliance from the 2009 through 2014 reporting periods are now considered compliant because firms either filed their reports or terminated their registrations . about 47 percent ( 783 of 1,672 ) of the referrals are pending further action .
