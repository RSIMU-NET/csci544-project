in 1987 , bop and the u.s . sentencing commission jointly developed the federal sentencing simulation model ( fedsim ) to comply with a series of congressional initiatives that required an impact analysis of federal sentencing guidelines . in january 1995 , bop began using a revised model ( fedsim - 2 ) , which incorporates different data sets based upon experience under federal sentencing guidelines . according to a 1991 study by the u.s . sentencing commission , drug offenders constituted about 91 percent of all federal defendants sentenced under mandatory minimum provisions . according to bjs , in 1993 , which was the latest year that complete data were available , drug offenders constituted 26 percent of all federal and state inmates , whereas these offenders constituted 8 percent of all inmates in 1980 . also , bjs has reported that the increase in drug offenders accounts for nearly three - fourths of the total growth in federal prison inmates since 1980 . the state prison inmate populations have grown as a result of , among other things , the increased number of arrests , higher probabilities of incarceration , and more severe sanctions . specifically , according to bjs , the number of arrests increased by 41 percent between 1980 and 1993 , the latest year that complete data were available . the rate of sending offenders to prison also increased . for example , the likelihood of incarceration increased 5-fold for drug violations and 4-fold for weapons offenses . according to the california department of corrections , the prison population in that state has grown because of court decisions , voter initiatives , and legislation , all of which have resulted in stronger law enforcement and more severe criminal sanctions . for example , a california law prohibits the use of good - time allowances to reduce the sentences of repeat offenders convicted of certain violent felonies . state corrections officials expected that the law may result in inmates' serving additional time , which could lead to an increase in the state's prison population in future years . while sources differed somewhat in their projected growth for federal and state prison inmate populations , they all showed substantial anticipated increases for these populations in 2000 and beyond . in june 1996 , bop projected that the federal prison population could reach about 125,000 inmates by 2000 , which is a 25-percent increase over the 1995 level ( see table 1 ) . in july 1995 , nccd projected that , under sentencing policies in effect in 1994 , the total inmate population for federal and state prisons could reach 1.4 million by 2000 , which is an increase of 24 percent over the 1995 level . nccd also projected that , if all states were to adopt truth - in - sentencing statutes , which would require inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences , the states' prison population could grow by an additional 190,000 inmates and total about 1.6 million inmates by 2000 , which would be an increase of about 42 percent over the 1995 level .
