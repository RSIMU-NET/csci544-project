not available . percentage of tanf adults involved in work ( as defined by state ) 52 62 26 22 30 93 not available . four states were unable to provide us with information on the percent of adults participating in a state - defined work - activity . delaware was not able to provide us with data on families excluded from time limits . delaware was not able to provide data on their use of the federal 20 percent extension . the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) specifies that up to 20 percent of families receiving tanf assistance in each state can receive an extension to the 60 month federal time limit . based on our analysis of survey data , we estimated that the maximum percentage of adults who could receive extensions ranged from 24 to 77 percent among the states , depending on the size of each state's child - only caseload . for example , wyoming may extend time limits for up to 92 families , which represents 20 percent of the 458 tanf families in wyoming . however , because almost three - fourths of its tanf families are child - only , only 119 families with adults would have time limits in place . this means that the state could provide extensions to 92 of the 119 tanf families with adults ; this represents 77 percent rather than 20 percent of tanf families with adults . in contrast , in new mexico , with its much smaller percentage of child - only families ( 15 percent ) , the maximum percentage of time - limit extensions that may be provided to families with adults is 24 percent rather than 20 percent . in addition to those named above , the following individuals made important contributions to this report: elisabeth anderson , kara kramer , and kim reniero . patrick dibattista and beverly ross also provided key technical assistance . welfare reform: states provide tanf - funded work support services to many low - income families who do not receive cash assistance . gao - 02-615t . washington , d.c.: april 10 , 2002 . welfare reform: states provide tanf - funded services to many low - income families who do not receive cash assistance . gao - 02-564 . washington , d.c.: april 5 , 2002 . welfare reform: states are using tanf flexibility to adapt work requirements and time limits to meet state and local needs . gao - 02-501t . washington , d.c.: march 7 , 2002 . welfare reform: more coordinated federal efforts could help states and localities move tanf recipients with impairments toward employment . gao - 02-37 . washington , d.c.: october 31 , 2001 . welfare reform: challenges in maintaining a federal - state fiscal partnership . gao - 01-828 . washington , d.c.: august 10 , 2001 . welfare reform: moving hard - to - employ recipients into the workforce . gao - 01-368 . washington , d.c.: march 15 , 2001 . welfare reform: work - site - based activities can play an important role in tanf programs . gao / hehs - 00-122 . washington , d.c.: july 28 , 2000 . welfare reform: improving state automated systems requires coordinated federal effort .
