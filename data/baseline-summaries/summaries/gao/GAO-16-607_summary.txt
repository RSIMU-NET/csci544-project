, lease use ) . losses of gas ( i.e. , those from natural gas emissions ) are generally not subject to royalties provided that such losses meet blm requirements . however , blm field office supervisors apply criteria set in ntl - 4a to determine whether approved gas lost through venting or flaring is “unavoidably lost,” and therefore royalty - free , or “avoidably lost,” and therefore subject to royalties . for example , under ntl - 4a , venting or flaring gas vapors released from storage tanks or low pressure production vessels is generally considered to be unavoidably lost , and no royalties are due . however , blm supervisors may determine that vented or flared gas is avoidably lost if ( 1 ) the losses are due to negligence on the part of the lessee or operator ; ( 2 ) the losses are due to the failure of the lessee or operator to take all reasonable measures to prevent or to control the losses ; or ( 3 ) the losses are due to the failure of the lessee or operator to comply fully with the applicable lease terms and regulations , appropriate provisions of the approved operating plan , or the prior written orders of the supervisor . generally , operators are to submit venting or flaring requests to a supervisor at their local blm field office in advance to obtain an approval and determination of whether losses are unavoidable or avoidable . blm field office officials we spoke with told us , however , that because of backlogs in the venting or flaring requests submitted to blm , operators may sometimes seek and obtain verbal approval to vent or flare , and then later submit a written request once venting or flaring is under way . in addition , ntl - 4a provides that no royalty obligation shall accrue on any produced gas that is used on the same lease for beneficial purposes ( i.e. regarding these recommendations , interior said onrr would defer to blm to provide guidance on how the emissions discussed should be accounted for by interior . once these decisions are made , onrr would work with blm to develop requirements for reporting volumes on the ogor and collecting royalties , as appropriate . we recognize that these actions will require a collaborative effort between onrr and blm , as noted in interior's letter , and if implemented as described , would address the intent of our third and fourth recommendations . interior did not concur with two recommendations included in the draft report , which would have blm apply its existing guidance on venting and flaring and issue interim guidance on the circumstances under which long - term flaring would be subject to royalties , respectively . regarding these recommendations , interior noted that finalizing blm's proposed rule , the methane and waste prevention rule , will directly address many of the concerns pointed out in the findings and recommendations directed at blm . in its letter , interior stated that finalizing the proposed rule is an administration priority , and that it expects the rule to be finalized by the end of calendar year 2016 .
