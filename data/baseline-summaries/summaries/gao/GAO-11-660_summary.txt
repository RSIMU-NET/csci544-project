ntsb had no comments . wmata recognized the balance that we have striven for in the report between areas of concern in wmata's recent past and the progress the agency has recently made on those issues . however , wmata felt the report could be strengthened by additional information on wmata's recent actions . we revised the report to include additional wmata actions , such as launching a new strategic planning process that will take a multi - year perspective . gsa agreed , in part , with our recommendation and findings . gsa disagreed with our statement that it cannot assure that it is appointing qualified board members . we acknowledge the effort gsa has taken to identify and appoint board members ; however , past efforts do not assure that future replacements for existing board members will be qualified and appointed in a timely manner . we are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees , the secretary of the department of transportation , the administrator of the general services administration , the chairman of the national transportation safety board , and the chairman and gm / ceo of wmata . in addition , this report will be available at no charge on gao's web site at http: / / www.gao.gov . if you or your staff have any questions or would like to discuss this work , please contact me at ( 202 ) 512-2834 or wised@gao.gov . contact points for our offices of congressional relations and public affairs may be found on the last page of this report . individuals making key contributions to this report are listed in appendix vi . our objective was to assess the washington metropolitan area transit authority's ( wmata ) governance in terms of the board's roles and responsibilities , oversight , strategic planning , and governance structure , and identify changes , if any , that should be made . specifically , we addressed the following question: how do roles and responsibilities , oversight , and strategic planning elements of wmata's practices align with leading governance practices ? in addition , we provide information on the appointment of federal members to wmata's board . for the purpose of this work , we focused on wmata's governance in terms of the board's structure , communication , policies , practices , and documentation relating to its oversight of management and carrying out of its organizational mission . in addition , we analyzed management's role in certain areas , such as strategic planning ; however , we did not fully assess the adequacy of management's role in effectively operating the agency . we selected leading governance practices relevant to transit agencies from several sources , including those practices used in previous gao work on public and private sector governance challenges at several organizations and non - gao studies , reports , and recommendations concerning the governance of transit agencies , other similar organizations , and corporations . additionally , we selected strategic planning practices from the transit cooperative research program , previous gao work , and other sources as appropriate . we then consolidated and categorized governance practices and recommendations along similar themes , such as structure , oversight , and strategic planning ( see table 2 ) .
