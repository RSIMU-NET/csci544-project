figure 3 shows these statistics . we also found that , over this same 10-year period , the m939 occupant fatality rate averaged about 30 times higher than those for commercial trucks . the m939 occupant fatality rate ranged from a high of 59 to a low of 13 times higher than the commercial truck rate . in 1995 , the m939 occupant fatality rate was 0.165 and the commercial truck rate was 0.0028 — about 59 times higher ; and in 1989 , the m939 rate was 0.046 and the commercial truck rate was 0.0035 — about 13 times higher . figure 4 shows these statistics . the army safety center's analysis reviewed accident data from october 1990 through june 1998 . in this analysis , the accident rate of the m939 was compared with accident rates for another series of trucks — the m34 / m35 series 2-1 / 2 ton truck . army officials advised us that this truck was most comparable with the m939 . the analysis reviewed accidents categorized as class a mishaps . army regulation 385-40 defines a “class a” mishap as an accident where total property damage equals $1 million or more ; an army aircraft or missile is destroyed , missing or abandoned ; or an injury and / or occupational illness resulting in a fatality or permanent total disability . because an m939 costs significantly less than $1 million , almost all class a mishaps involving an m939 are so classified because they result in a death or permanent total disability . the army safety center's analysis found accident rates for m939s to be higher than the comparison vehicles . the analysis showed m939 class a mishap frequency rates per million miles driven to be 3 to 21 times higher than those of similar m34 / m35 series 2-1 / 2 ton trucks . for example , the 1995 class a mishap rate for the m939 was 0.21 and for the 2-1 / 2 ton m34 / 35s , it was 0.01 per million miles driven — about a 21-fold difference . figure 5 shows this comparison . the army has initiated a program to improve the m939's safety performance and , according to tacom estimates , plans to spend around $234 million for various modifications . most of the modifications are the direct result of corrective actions suggested in studies . these studies focused on identifying root causes of m939 accidents based on information contained in accident investigation reports . on the basis of the studies' findings , the army concluded that the overall truck design was sound but that some modifications were necessary to improve the truck's safety performance . on the basis of the project's findings , tacom concluded the overall truck design was sound and nothing was significantly different between the m939 and its commercial counterparts produced during the same time period . however , the studies found that improvements to some vehicle subsystems would enhance the truck's safety performance . the tire study completed in october 1996 , together with other information relating to m939 usage , confirmed that the m939s were being used on - road more than originally planned .
