this improved level of security performance appears to have been sustained through 2006 . between december 2006 — when livermore's protective force performed well in an exercise — and april 2008 , security performance at livermore declined . in response to the negative results of the 2008 office of independent oversight evaluation , livermore appears to be refocusing management attention on security performance . while our work is preliminary , we believe the actions taken by livermore , the livermore site office , and nnsa , if and when fully implemented , will address identified physical security issues . however , just as at lanl , sustaining attention on physical security performance will continue to be a challenge . lanl has implemented measures to enhance its cyber security , but weaknesses remain in protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of information on its unclassified network . in particular , lanl has implemented a network security system that is capable of detecting potential intrusions on the network . however , lanl has vulnerabilities in several critical areas , including ( 1 ) identifying and authenticating users of the network , ( 2 ) encrypting sensitive information , ( 3 ) monitoring and auditing compliance with security policies , ( 4 ) controlling and documenting changes to a computer system's hardware and software , and ( 5 ) restricting physical access to computing resources . for example , although lanl had implemented strong authentication measures for accessing the network , these measures were not always used . strong federal oversight will help ensure that these improvements are sustained . however , we reported that the los alamos site office suffers from a shortage of security personnel and lacks funding needed for training . specifically , as of october 2007 , the los alamos site office employed 13 security staff — enough for 1 person to oversee each of the topical areas the site office had to evaluate . this staffing level , officials said , was sufficient to cover only 15 percent of lanl's facilities . in april 2008 , a senior security official at the site office said security staffing levels had decreased since october 2007 . furthermore , while nnsa had identified the need to train and certify site office security personnel in specific subject matters , according to site office officials no specific training funds had been made available . we made three recommendations to the secretary of energy and the administrator of nnsa that , if effectively implemented , will improve physical security at lanl and help ensure that improvements lanl has achieved are sustained over the long term . specifically , we recommended that lanl be required to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for laboratory security that addresses all previously identified security weaknesses and focuses on improving security program effectiveness . furthermore , we recommended that nnsa provide meaningful financial incentives in future performance evaluation plans for implementation of this comprehensive strategic plan for laboratory security . in june 2008 , the committee requested that we review the security status at livermore .
