ii. ) the annual number of fatalities involving children increased from 1999 through 2004 , but declined in 2005 . commission staff counted 163 children under the age of 16 among documented fatalities in 2005 , compared with 90 in 1999 , an increase of 81 percent . preliminary data collected by commission staff for 2006 through 2008 reported 143 children among atv fatalities in 2006 , 124 in 2007 , and 74 in 2008 . commission staff data indicate that children who died were mainly riding adult - sized atvs . these data on atv fatalities involving children that occurred in 2005 include information on the engine size for 51 percent ( 84 of 165 ) of atvs involved in those crashes . this information can be used to determine whether the atvs were adult - sized or youth - sized models . our analysis of those fatalities for which vehicle the engine size was recorded indicated that about 94 percent of the children who died in 2005 ( 79 of 84 children for whom the engine size was recorded ) were riding adult - sized atvs . preliminary data collected by commission staff for 2006 through 2008 indicated that 93 percent of children who died ( 175 of 189 children for whom the atv engine size was recorded ) were riding adult - sized atvs . the estimated number of nonfatal atv - related injuries , including those involving children , also increased from 1999 through 2007 , but decreased in 2008 . ( see fig . commission staff estimated that a total of 413,339 nonfatal injuries occurred in 2008 , which was 10 percent less than the estimated number of injuries in 2007 ( 457,394 ) , but 70 percent higher than the estimated number of injuries in 1999 ( 243,664 ) . the total estimated number of nonfatal injuries in 2008 included 134,900 that were treated in emergency rooms , which commission staff said were the most serious ; 209,549 that were treated outside of emergency rooms , but were treated in other settings such as doctors' offices and clinics ; and 68,890 that were not treated . in 2008 , an estimated 134,900 nonfatal atv - related injuries were treated in emergency rooms , compared with 81,800 in 1999 , an increase of 65 percent . however , the estimated number of injuries treated in emergency rooms decreased from 150,800 in 2007 to 134,900 in 2008 , or 10 percent . commission staff said that although the decrease from 2007 to 2008 is statistically significant , there is insufficient information to examine what caused the decrease . according to the staff , the decrease could have been influenced by one or more of the following factors: ( 1 ) exposure , as evidenced by the number of people who rode atvs and the amount of time that was spent riding , considering that recreational activities often are reduced in times of recession ; ( 2 ) the state of the atv market in particular ( i.e.
