monitoring . internal control monitoring should assess the quality of performance over time and ensure that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved . to complement the standards , we developed a tool to help managers and evaluators determine how well an agency's internal controls are designed and functioning and what , where , and how improvements may be implemented . this tool is intended to be used concurrently with the standards described above and with omb circular a - 123 . specifically , apmo defined acceptance procedures , verified that deliverables satisfied their requirements , documented the results of the review , developed a plan for addressing deliverable deficiencies , and tracked those issues to closure . with respect to one program support task order , for example , a designated us - visit team reviewed a project plan delivered by the contractor and returned it with a “conditionally acceptable” letter ; this letter stated that the comments included were to be incorporated into the plan and assigned a date that the revised plan was due back . the contractor resubmitted the plan by the assigned date , and the contracting officer's technical representative ( cotr ) accepted it . throughout the process , apmo tracked the status of this deliverable by means of a database designed to track and update the status of deliverables owed to us - visit by its contractors . the database included such information as current document status and when the revised document was due back to the program office . apmo also implemented all critical subpractices associated with contractor technical and management review activities . for example , apmo required that the prime contactor provide monthly cost performance reports that compared actual with budgeted cost and addressed critical dependencies . for example , one report noted that schedule and costs were impacted by a change in resources . in the report , the contractor proposed a corrective action and resolution date . apmo staff analyzed these reports and , according to apmo officials , distributed the analysis results to program office management for informational purposes ( the results focused on the causes of and planned corrective actions for the most noteworthy cost and schedule variances ) . the information contained in the monthly reports was also discussed at quarterly programwide management reviews , which included contractor personnel . in addition to management issues , these reviews addressed technical issues such as deliverable status and requirements . the quarterly reviews were also used to evaluate the contractor's overall performance , as well as the contractor's performance on each task order active during that reporting period . the task orders that we examined were among those reviewed in this way . for each task order , the quarterly reviews included an assessment of schedule , cost and funding , technical performance , staffing , and risks . for example , the information presented on one task order that we reviewed reported that all of these categories were on track and were forecast to remain on track . during these reviews , technical requirements for each of the task orders were discussed among stakeholders , contractor personnel , and management to ensure a common understanding of those requirements and the status of their implementation .
