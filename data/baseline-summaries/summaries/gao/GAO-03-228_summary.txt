gao - 03-227 . ( see fig . in addition , a spanish language version of the census form has been available upon request since 1980 . for the 2000 census , hispanics could identify themselves as mexican , puerto rican , cuban , or “other spanish / hispanic / latino.” respondents who checked off this last category could write in a specific subgroup such as “salvadoran.” although this approach was similar to that used for the 1990 census , as shown in figure 1 , the “other” category in the 1990 census included examples of other hispanic subgroups . the bureau deleted these examples as one of several changes to the hispanic question for the 2000 census . other changes included ( 1 ) adding the word “latino” to the designation spanish / hispanic , ( 2 ) dropping the word “origin” from the question , and ( 3 ) moving the location of instructions on writing in an unlisted subgroup . according to bureau officials , these latter three changes were made to improve the hispanic count . as agreed with your office , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date . at that time , we will send copies of this report to the chairman of the house committee on government reform , the secretary of commerce , and the director of the u.s. census bureau . copies will be made available to others on request . this report will also be available at no charge on gao's home page at http: / / www.gao.gov . please contact me on ( 202 ) 512-6806 or by e - mail at daltonp@gao.gov if you have any questions . other key contributors to this report were robert goldenkoff , christopher miller , elizabeth powell , timothy wexler , ty mitchell , benjamin crawford , james whitcomb , robert parker , and michael volpe . decennial census: methods for reporting and collecting data on the homeless and others without conventional housing need refinement . washington , d.c.: january 17 , 2003 . 2000 census: refinements to full count review program could improve future data quality . gao - 02-562 . washington , d.c.: july 3 , 2002 . 2000 census: coverage evaluation matching implemented as planned , but census bureau should evaluate lessons learned . gao - 02-297 . washington , d.c.: march 14 , 2002 . 2000 census: best practices and lessons learned for a more cost - effective nonresponse follow - up . gao - 02-196 . washington , d.c.: february 11 , 2002 . 2000 census: coverage evaluation interviewing overcame challenges , but further research needed . gao - 02-26 . washington , d.c.: december 31 , 2001 . 2000 census: analysis of fiscal year 2000 budget and internal control weaknesses at the u.s. census bureau . gao - 02-30 . the comments are reprinted in appendix i . we address these comments at the end of this report . collecting accurate ethnic data has challenged the bureau for over 30 years .
