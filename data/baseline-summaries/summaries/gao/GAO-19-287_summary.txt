other revenue . according to cmp's fiscal years 2008 through 2017 internal financial documents , cmp also generated some additional revenue from a variety of other sources . for example , cmp's talladega marksmanship park has generated over $1.5 million in revenue from range rental and match fees , among other things . cmp reported an overall profit of $125.9 million on its irs filings for fiscal years 2008 through 2017 , but this amount includes all categories of revenue and expense for business operations , not only those categories specific to surplus rifle sales . we were therefore unable to use cmp's irs filings to determine cmp's profits from the sale of surplus rifles . the amount of profit specific to surplus rifle sales also could not be determined from cmp's internal financial documents . cmp's internal financial documents showed $84.7 million in expenses to sell surplus rifles in fiscal years 2008 through 2017 , including costs associated with labor , shipping , and other expenses to prepare the surplus firearms for sale . this is less than the $196.8 million cmp's internal financial documents show cmp generated in revenue from the sale of surplus army rifles during fiscal years 2008 through 2017 . however , in its internal financial documents , the methodology cmp used to calculate the expenses to sell surplus army rifles did not include all of cmp's expenses for these sales . specifically , the methodology cmp used did not account for depreciation and administrative expenses . cmp did not begin selling surplus m1911 handguns until november 2018 , and therefore had just begun generating revenue from these sales at the time of our report . cmp's internal financial documents reported some costs associated with the surplus m1911 handguns . for example , in fiscal year 2018 , in response to an army requirement , cmp spent approximately $0.7 million upgrading a facility used to house cmp's m1911 handgun operations . cmp also reported expenses specific to the m1911 handguns of just over $8,000 in fiscal year 2017 . according to cmp officials , cmp anticipates selling most , if not all , of the m1911 handguns because there has been a higher demand for the surplus m1911 handguns than the quantity available to cmp for sale . for example , cmp officials reported that they received more than 19,000 orders for the 8,000 surplus m1911 handguns transferred from the army in january 2018 . how much cmp will sell each surplus handgun for depends on the quality , or grade , of the handguns as determined by cmp . specifically , cmp officials told us cmp will sell service grade surplus m1911 handguns for $1,050 , field grade handguns for $950 , and rack grade handguns for $850 each . cmp officials reported that as of december 2018 , cmp had sold 632 service grade surplus m1911 handguns for $1,050 each , which generated $663,600 in revenue . further , cmp officials told us they had determined that 145 of the surplus m1911 handguns were in unsellable condition . as a result , as of december 2018 , 7,223 surplus m1911 handguns remained from the original 8,000 cmp received from the army .
