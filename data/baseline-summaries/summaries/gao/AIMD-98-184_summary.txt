( see figure 11. ) as shown in figure 12 , the general science , space , and technology function ( 250 ) , which includes national science foundation and nasa research , dropped sharply in constant dollar outlays from $10 billion in 1981 to $5 billion in 1983 . outlays then continued a fairly steady increase to $11 billion in 1995 . in 1996 outlays dropped to $10 billion before beginning a steady increase to $12 billion in estimated annual outlays from 2000 through 2003 . in contrast , estimated future outlays in the 1998 budget were $10 billion annually from 1998 through 2002 . we did not analyze data at either the agency or account level . also , as agreed with your offices , we reexamined the items to be included in the definition of investment , specifically related to defense r&d . we discussed different categories of defense r&d with office of management and budget ( omb ) and congressional research service staff . as a result , we changed the categories of defense r&d included as investment spending from what was included in last year's report to more accurately reflect what we believe to promote private sector economic growth . we now include the categories of basic and applied research rather than basic and developmental research as in last year's analysis . this adjustment lowers the amount attributed to total investment , defense investment , and r&d , but does not significantly alter the overall trend data . in order to make comparisons between the 1998 and 1999 budget estimates , we recast the 1998 data using our revised categories for defense r&d .
