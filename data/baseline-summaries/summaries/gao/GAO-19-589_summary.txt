data reporting . before 2018 , fhfa had not issued a standardized data reporting template for fhlbank data on use of diverse suppliers and broker - dealers ; therefore , data were not comparable across banks or years . as part of the requirements of fhfa's 2010 minority and women inclusion regulation , in 2012 the banks and the office of finance began reporting data on their business activities with diverse businesses ( minority - , women - , and disabled - owned ) in the preceding year . however , the data prior to 2018 were not comparable across years and banks because the banks did not use consistent methods or definitions in their data reporting . to develop a common understanding and make the data more consistent , fhfa and the banks began working together in 2017 to develop a data dictionary and data templates . fhlbanks used the new templates to report their 2018 data . minority - and women - owned suppliers . in 2018 , fhlbanks varied in their use of minority - and women - owned suppliers ( see fig . the 11 banks entered into more than 2,900 supplier contracts overall in 2018 ( ranging from 60 to 477 per bank ) . of the total number of contracts , about 10 percent ( 279 contracts ) were with minority - owned suppliers and about 12 percent ( 340 contracts ) were with women - owned suppliers . among the individual banks , the share of contracts entered into with minority - owned suppliers in 2018 ranged from about 1 percent to 38 percent and from about 4 percent to 25 percent for contracts with women - owned suppliers . in 2018 , fhlbanks' total supplier expenditure was about $453 million , of which about 8 percent and 13 percent , respectively , went to minority - and women - owned suppliers . among the individual banks , the percentage of the total annual 2018 expenditure that went to minority - owned businesses varied from about 3 percent to 15 percent , and to women - owned businesses from about 2 percent to 31 percent ( see fig . according to fhfa staff , annual expenditure paid to suppliers can vary from year to year . more specifically , an increase in a bank's annual supplier expenditure in any one year is usually related to long - term , large investments made during that year , such as construction costs or investment in technology products and services . fhfa staff noted that these one - time increases in expenditures can provide opportunities to increase the use of diverse suppliers . minority representation . the share of minority senior management across all 11 fhlbanks was approximately 14 percent ( 23 individuals ) in both 2011 and 2017 . five banks increased the share of minority senior management ( from about 1 to 23 percentage points ) ; three banks decreased ( from about 6 to 13 percentage points ) ; and three banks did not change . four banks did not have any minorities in senior management in 2017 ( see fig .
