( see fig . for example , 70 percent of nursing home expenditures were accounted for by va nursing homes in fiscal year 1998 as compared to 73 percent in 2003 . moreover , the percentage of community nursing home expenditures was 17 percent in 1998 as compared to 12 percent in 2003 . during the same years , va's overall nursing home expenditures increased by about a third , growing from about $1.7 billion to approximately $2.3 billion . the percentage of nursing home expenditures for care in each nursing home setting varied widely by network in fiscal year 2003 . ( see fig . all networks spent the largest percentage of their resources on va nursing homes . the percentage of expenditures for va nursing homes ranged from a low of 47 percent in network 19 ( denver ) to a high of 88 percent in network 6 ( durham ) . further , the percentage of overall nursing home expenditures accounted for by community and state veterans' nursing homes also varied widely across the networks . for example , the percentage of expenditures for community nursing homes ranged from a low of 2 percent in network 3 ( bronx ) to a high of 28 percent in network 20 ( portland ) . a comparison of how networks' percentage of expenditures on each nursing home setting changed in fiscal year 2003 as compared to fiscal year 1998 showed that networks' changes were consistent with the va - wide changes . in fiscal year 2003 , the percentage of expenditures for va nursing homes increased in 15 of the 21 health care networks as compared to fiscal year 1998 . similar to the overall trend , the percentage of expenditures for state veterans' nursing homes increased in 17 of 21 networks , whereas the percentage of expenditures for community nursing homes decreased in 17 of 21 networks . the largest shift in the percentage of expenditures for the three settings occurred in network 19 ( denver ) . in this network , the percentage of expenditures for va nursing homes declined from 75 to 47 percent because of a nursing home closure during this period . for more detailed information on the percent change in nursing home expenditures for each setting and network in fiscal years 1998 and 2003 , see appendix ii . state veterans' nursing homes accounted for half of va's overall nursing home workload — measured by average daily census — in fiscal year 2003 , even though they accounted for only 15 percent of expenditures . in large part this is because va pays a per - diem rate for care in state veterans' nursing homes that , on average , accounts for about one - third of the cost to provide veterans nursing home care in this setting . the remaining payments made to state veterans' nursing homes come from a number of other sources including medicaid , medicare , private health insurance , and patients self - financing their care . va nursing homes provided the next largest percentage of nursing home workload , 37 percent in fiscal year 2003 . community nursing homes provided 13 percent of overall nursing home workload .
