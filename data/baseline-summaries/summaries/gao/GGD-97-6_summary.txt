2 hr . 14 min . 2 hr . 51 min . 35 min . 6.7 hr . 2 hr . 53 min . 4 hr . 41 min . 4 min . 5 min . .2 hr . 1 hr . 20 min . 40 min . 2.9 hr . 53 min . 11.6 hr . 2 min . schedule eic is filed with forms 1040a and 1040 only . table ii.8 shows that the 51 million taxpayers eligible for a tax agency reconciliation filing system spent an estimated 316.3 million hours completing and filing returns . total time and numbers of taxpayers in million amount of time spent to prepare form ( per taxpayer ) 2.9 hr . 55.1 hr . 6.9 hr . 60.0 hr . 6.7 hr . 96.5 hr . 11.8 hr . 14.2 hr . 11.6 hr . 90.5 hr . 316.3 hr . on the basis of irs' 1992 soi data , we estimated that about 16.6 million of the 51 million taxpayers had their returns completed by paid preparers . the remaining 21 million taxpayers reported income that included either dividends or pensions or had dependents . taxpayers with these income characteristics , regardless of filing status , would have return preparation tasks associated with taxpayers who could file form 1040a . using these data , we estimated the time required for preparing tax returns under a tax agency reconciliation system . recordkeeping: we assumed the 30 million taxpayers who had form 1040ez characteristics and the 21 million taxpayers who had form 1040a characteristics would have the same recordkeeping time irs estimated for these forms , as shown in table ii.7 . we estimated that the 51 million taxpayers would spend 24.6 million hours on recordkeeping tasks . learning about the law or form: we made the same assumptions for this task as we did for the recordkeeping task . we estimated that the 51 million taxpayers would spend an estimated 71.4 million hours on this task . preparing the form: to estimate the average time that would be spent on preparing the taxpayer information form , we used irs' time estimates for completing schedule eic . schedule eic contains information on the identity of qualifying children for taxpayers claiming the earned income tax credit , which is similar to the information that would be contained on the taxpayer information form . irs estimated that it takes taxpayers 4 minutes to complete schedule eic . we assumed that taxpayers could take twice as long to complete the taxpayer information form because taxpayers may have to enter twice as much data on the taxpayer information form . therefore , we estimated that the 51 million taxpayers would spend an estimated 6.8 million hours preparing the form . copying , assembling , and sending the form to irs: for this task , we also used irs' average time estimates for schedule eic , which was 5 minutes . we assumed that since the taxpayer information form is a one - page form like the schedule eic that the amount of time would be the same . therefore , we estimated that the 51 million taxpayers would spend about 4.3 million hours on this task . these types of costs are difficult to quantify .
