( see table ii.3. ) during fiscal years 1995-97 , fhwa's office of the administrator selected a declining percentage of the projects the program staff had categorized as “most promising” and “promising.” ( see table ii.4. ) during fiscal years 1995-97 , the office of the administrator allocated about $126 million to projects the staff had categorized as either “most promising” or “promising.” ( see table ii.5. ) interstate discretionary program . originally created by section 115 ( a ) of the surface transportation assistance act of 1978 in order to accelerate construction of the interstate highway system . the surface transportation assistance act of 1982 and the surface transportation and uniform relocation and assistance act of 1987 both continued and modified the interstate discretionary program . interstate discretionary funds may be used for the same purpose as interstate construction funds — initial construction of remaining portions of the interstate system .
