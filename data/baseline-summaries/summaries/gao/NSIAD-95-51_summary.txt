this reduced the army support requirement . this is traditional air force practice . where usafe did not have the necessary assets ( such as the e - 3 awacs ) or had shortfalls ( such as in c - 130s ) , it sought augmentation from outside europe . to the extent other usafe assets could have been augmented with active - duty units from the united states , such as in the case of the f - 15e aircraft , some of the adverse impact of participation in these peace operations might have been mitigated . in commenting on a draft of this report , dod noted that the air force has recognized these challenges and is addressing them by relying more on active , reserve , and guard units based in the continental united states , which have deployed to operations provide comfort and deny flight to relieve some of the operational burden . more senior personnel will train longer . while there has been no shortage of volunteers for the current deployment , army officials are concerned that they will not be able to recruit enough volunteers to continue this on an annual basis . therefore , the army is considering the use of volunteers for every third rotation . the army's experience in somalia illustrates the challenges that could lie ahead if the united states chooses to deploy forces to bosnia or to other peace operations throughout the world . the army will likely send at least a division - size force to bosnia if a peace plan is signed . this could have almost three times the impact on the army as the somalia operation , which generally required one - third the number of forces designated for bosnia . military police units , in particular , have been kept extremely busy as a result of peace operations . in september 1994 , 40 percent of the military police combat support companies stationed in the united states were deployed to guantanamo bay supporting the cuban and haitian refugee operation . three other companies were deployed to suriname , honduras , and panama , leaving just 13 companies to patrol nine installations in the united states . according to an army official , this is a problem because many installations require more than one military police combat support company for patrol duties . because the increase in military police deployments , mostly due to the refugee crisis , has exceeded the number available in the army's force structure , army infantry units have been used to help meet military police deployment requirements . for example , upon completion of their rotation to guantanamo bay , military police companies will return home while rifle companies rotate to cuba . according to an army official , while rifle companies will undergo 2 weeks of training to perform the military police function , the training will not provide them with the full breadth of skills that military police possess . the army will continue to face challenges in responding to sizable peace operations if reserve forces are not activated . the need for reserve activation depends on a variety of factors , such as the size of a peace operation and the number of such operations ongoing at one time .
