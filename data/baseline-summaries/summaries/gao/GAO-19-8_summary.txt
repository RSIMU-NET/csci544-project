( see fig . our analysis of education data for school year 2015-16 , however , found that the percentage of schools offering these recommended math and science courses decreased as poverty level increased . for example , georgia's dual enrollment program allows high school students to earn college credit for free while working on their high school diploma . the program covers tuition , mandatory fees , and books . with respect to math courses , 7 percent of low - poverty schools did not offer the recommended math courses ( at least algebra i , geometry , and algebra ii ) , compared to 17 percent of high - poverty schools that did not offer these courses . further , while 12 percent of low - poverty schools did not offer the recommended science courses ( at least biology , chemistry , and physics ) , 41 percent of high - poverty schools did not . ( see fig . odds of offering at least algebra i , geometry , and algebra ii generally , no statistically significant association . odds of offering at least biology , chemistry , and physics higher poverty schools were associated with lower odds of offering these courses compared to lower poverty schools . odds of offering any ap courses higher poverty schools were generally associated with lower odds of offering any ap courses , compared to lower poverty schools . higher levels of hispanic or asian students were associated with lower odds of offering these courses . higher levels of black , hispanic , or american indian / alaskan native students were associated with lower odds of offering these courses . generally , no statistically significant association . smaller schools were associated with lower odds of offering these courses , compared to larger schools . smaller schools are associated with lower odds of offering these courses , compared to larger schools . smaller schools were associated with lower odds of offering ap courses , compared to larger schools . alternative schools were associated with lower odds of offering these courses compared to traditional schools ; however , the results were not statistically significant for other school types . charter schools and alternative schools were associated with lower odds of offering these courses compared to traditional schools . charter schools were associated with lower odds of offering any ap courses and magnet schools were associated with higher odds of offering any ap courses , compared to traditional schools . across the three selected states , officials representing the 12 high - poverty schools we visited consistently reported that students confront multiple challenges to being prepared to attend college . they cited a range of academic roadblocks to college , including that students are behind academically before they get to high school ; that the schools they attend lack rigorous courses , such as ap courses ; and that students struggle to attain grade point averages ( gpa ) high enough for admission to some 4-year colleges . officials explained that family challenges and obligations can compound the academic challenges and make navigating the college admissions and enrollment process difficult for their students .
