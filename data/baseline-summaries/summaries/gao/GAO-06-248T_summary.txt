we have not evaluated this initiative . despite the progress that has been made , we still believe that current structures and processes may not be adequate to fully address the federal real property problems . the breadth and complexity of the issues involved and the long - standing nature of the problems and their underlying causes will likely continue to hamper agencies' efforts to realign their real property assets to their missions . this is of particular concern for civilian agencies that do not have an independent decision - making apparatus like brac . given this , we concluded in our high - risk report and in our update in january 2005 , and still believe , that a comprehensive and integrated transformation strategy for federal real property is needed . such a strategy could build upon the executive order by providing decisionmakers with a road map of actions for addressing the underlying obstacles , assessing progress governmentwide , and enhancing accountability for related actions . using input from agencies , the private sector , and other interested groups , the strategy could comprehensively address these long - standing problems with specific proposals on how best to realign the federal infrastructure and dispose of unneeded property , taking into account mission requirements , changes in technology , security needs , costs , and how the government conducts business in the 21st century ; address the significant repair and restoration needs of the federal ensure that reliable governmentwide and agency - specific real property data — both financial and program related — are available for informed decisionmaking ; resolve the problem of heavy reliance on costly leasing ; and consider the impact that the threat of terrorism will have on real property needs and challenges , including how to balance public access with safety . to be effective in addressing these problems , it would be important for the strategy to focus on the underlying obstacles by minimizing the negative effects associated with competing stakeholder interests in real property decisionmaking ; providing agencies with appropriate tools and incentives that will facilitate businesslike decisions — for example , consideration should be given to what financing options should be available ; how disposal proceeds should be handled ; what process would permit comparisons between rehabilitation / renovation and replacement and among construction , purchase , lease - purchase , and operating lease ; and how public - private partnerships should be evaluated ; addressing federal human capital issues related to real property by recognizing that real property conditions affect the productivity and morale of employees and the federal government's ability to attract and retain high - performing individuals ; improving real property capital planning in the federal government by helping agencies to better integrate agency mission considerations into the capital decision - making process , make businesslike decisions when evaluating and selecting capital assets , evaluate and select capital assets by using an investment approach , evaluate results on an ongoing basis , and develop long - term capital plans ; and ensuring credible , rational , long - term budget planning for facility sustainment , modernization , or recapitalization .
