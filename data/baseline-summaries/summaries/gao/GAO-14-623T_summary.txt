mist has some limitations . most notably , it does not assess consequence ( the level , duration , and nature of potential loss resulting from an undesirable event ) . three of the four risk assessment experts we spoke with generally agreed that a tool that does not estimate consequences does not allow an agency to fully assess risks . fps officials stated that it intends to eventually incorporate consequence into its risk assessment methodology and is exploring ways to do so . mist was also not designed to compare risks across federal facilities . consequently , fps does not have the ability to comprehensively manage risk across its portfolio of 9,600 facilities and recommend countermeasures to federal tenant agencies . as of april 2014 , according to an fps official , fps had used mist to complete vulnerability assessments of approximately 1,200 federal facilities in fiscal year 2014 and have presented approximately 985 of them to the facility security committees . the remaining 215 assessments were under review by fps . fps has begun several initiatives that , once fully implemented , should enhance its ability to protect the more than 1 million federal employees and members of the public who visit federal facilities each year . since fiscal year 2010 , we have made 31 recommendations to help fps address its challenges with risk management , oversight of its contract guard workforce , and its fee - based funding structure . dhs and fps have generally agreed with these recommendations . as of may 2014 , as shown in table 2 , fps had implemented 6 recommendations , and was in the process of addressing 10 others , although none of the 10 have been fully implemented . the remaining 15 have not been implemented . according to fps officials , the agency has faced difficulty in implementing many of our recommendations because of changes in its leadership , organization , funding , and staffing levels . for further information on this testimony , please contact mark goldstein at ( 202 ) 512-2834 or by email at goldsteinm@gao.gov . individuals making key contributions to this testimony include tammy conquest , assistant director ; geoff hamilton ; jennifer dubord ; and saraann moessbauer . federal facility security: additional actions needed to help agencies comply with risk assessment methodology standards . gao - 14-86 . washington , d.c.: march 5 , 2014 . homeland security: federal protective service continues to face challenges with contract guards and risk assessments at federal facilities . gao - 14-235t . washington , d.c.: december 17 , 2013 . homeland security: challenges associated with federal protective service's contract guards and risk assessments at federal facilities . gao - 14-128t . washington , d.c.: october 30 , 2013 . federal protective service: challenges with oversight of contract guard program still exist , and additional management controls are needed . gao - 13-694 . washington , d.c.: september 17 , 2013 . facility security: greater outreach by dhs on standards and management practices could benefit federal agencies . gao - 13-222 . washington , d.c.: january 24 , 2013 . federal protective service: actions needed to assess risk and better manage contract guards at federal facilities . gao - 12-739 . washington , d.c.: august 10 , 2012 .
