they are referred to as the departmental management chiefs . in addition to the department's management directorate , each of the seven dhs component agencies has its own component management chief for the procurement , financial , human capital , information technology , administrative , and security management areas . figure 1 shows the dhs management directorate's organizational structure . the 9 / 11 commission act requires dhs to develop a strategy for management integration as part of the department's integration and transformation to create a more efficient and orderly consolidation of functions and personnel in the department . in our 2005 report , we recommended that dhs develop an overarching management integration strategy for the department that would , at a minimum , contain such characteristics as identifying the linkages among management initiatives , trade - offs and priorities , and potential efficiencies . although dhs stated at that time that it was developing an integration strategy , it has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration that is consistent with statute and that contains all of the characteristics we identified in 2005 . according to dhs's usm , the department has not yet done so because , in part , the management directorate has focused on building the management operations capacity within the functional areas , such as financial management and information technology . the management directorate has not yet focused on integration across the functional areas and has not clearly or systematically identified trade - offs and linkages among initiatives in different functional areas . according to dhs's usm , chief of staff , and department and component management chiefs , in the absence of a comprehensive management integration strategy , various departmental documents collectively contribute to the department's strategy for implementing and achieving management integration . these documents are discussed in detail in our report . such elements as goals , objectives , milestones , performance targets , and priorities documented in these plans and strategies can help the department to manage , implement , and monitor the specific initiatives to which these elements apply . they can also help to guide efforts to consolidate policies , processes , and systems within each management functional area . however , among the documents cited by dhs officials as being part of the department's management integration strategy , dhs has not yet looked across the management initiatives within management functional areas to identify the critical links that must occur among these initiatives to integrate the department's management functions both within and across functional areas . furthermore , the documents generally do not identify the priorities , trade - offs , and potential efficiencies among management initiatives , nor do they set implementation goals and a time line for monitoring the progress of initiatives to ensure the critical links occur when needed . thus , when considered either individually or together , these documents do not constitute a management integration strategy containing all of the characteristics we have identified . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
