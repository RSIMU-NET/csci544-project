we solicited comments from each of the eleven organizations that we studied . additional supporting points and examples were incorporated as appropriate . we conducted our study from may 2001 through october 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . the agora is a seattle - based regional network of over 600 professionals representing a variety of fields , including information systems security ; law enforcement ; local , state , and federal governments ; engineering ; information technology ; academics ; and other specialties . the participants represent over 150 commercial firms and 140 government entities located in 20 u.s. states and 5 canadian provinces . founded in 1995 , the agora formed to address the enormous security challenges brought about by new computer , network , and internet technologies . the agora's objectives are to establish confidential ways for organizations to share sensitive information about common problems and best practices for dealing with security threats , develop and share knowledge about how to protect electronic establish shared services that enhance participants' ability to successfully perform their daily jobs , prompt more research specific to electronic information systems share educational opportunities , and enjoy the benefits of the fostered relationships . information sharing occurs primarily through quarterly meetings that typically include 175 agora members . in addition to the quarterly meetings , informal meetings and teleconferences are held among members on an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise , such as assisting entities under attack . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , which is an agency of the department of health and human services , is recognized as the lead federal agency for protecting the health and safety of people at home and abroad . cdc seeks to accomplish its mission by working with partners throughout the nation and world to monitor health , detect and investigate health problems , conduct research to enhance the prevention of disease , foster safe and healthful environments , and provide leadership and training . cdc uses several information - sharing computer systems to help accomplish its mission , three of which were covered by our review and are described below . in 1998 , cdc officially announced the establishment of pulsenet , a national network of public health laboratories that helps epidemiologists rapidly identify clusters of foodborne illness and alerts others in the surrounding geographic area and throughout the country regarding a possible outbreak . by sharing information on outbreaks quickly through computer systems connected to the internet , pulsenet allows cdc to very quickly notify public health officials and food regulators of the health threat and assist investigators in identifying and removing the food source of the outbreak from distribution channels , thus mitigating the health risks associated with such outbreaks . in november 2000 , the epidemic information exchange system was implemented as an interactive , secure , internet - based network that provides information on epidemic outbreaks , toxic exposures , and other health events as they occur .
