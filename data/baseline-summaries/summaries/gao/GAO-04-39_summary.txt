( see fig . 3 for information on nhgri's approach for determining critical skills and competencies needed to achieve its strategic goals. ) scenario planning is an approach that agencies have used to manage risks of planning for future human capital needs in a changing environment . as discussed in our april 2003 report on agencies' efforts to integrate human capital strategies with their mission - oriented efforts , scenarios can describe different future environments that agencies may face . for example , after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and during the creation and implementation of dhs , senior u.s. coast guard officials reexamined five long - term scenarios developed in 1999 to describe different environments that could exist in the year 2020 . in 1999 , these scenarios had been the basis for agency leaders and planners to create operational and human capital strategies that they thought would work well for the u.s. coast guard in each independent scenario . after september 11 , 2001 , agency officials reviewed the scenarios to determine whether additional scenarios were needed in light of the attacks and decided to ( 1 ) create new long - term scenarios to guide planning beyond 2005 and ( 2 ) generate two scenarios with an 18-month horizon to guide short - term operational and human capital planning . similarly , to prepare its 2002 strategic workforce plan , pbgc used scenario analysis to determine how the scope and volume of its activities might change in the next 5 years . the strategic workforce plans these organizations developed identify gaps in workforce skills or competencies that they need to fill to meet the likely scenarios rather than planning to meet the needs of a single view of the future . u.s. coast guard and pbgc managers believe that by using multiple scenarios they gain flexibility in determining future workforce requirements . our march 2002 strategic human capital model stressed the importance of agencies developing human capital strategies — the programs , policies , and processes that agencies use to build and manage their workforces — that are tailored to their unique needs .
