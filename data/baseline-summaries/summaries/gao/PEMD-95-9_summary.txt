( the main characteristics of the patient population examined here are age 70 or younger , node - negative , with tumors 4 cm or smaller. ) step 3 consisted of quantitative comparisons across study designs and a consideration of the strength of the evidence . breast - conservation therapy involves a number of physician decisions not required for mastectomy , including the selection of patients for breast conservation , the amount of tissue to be removed from the area surrounding the tumor , the details of administering radiation , and so forth . ( see sacks and baum , 1993 ; winchester and cox , 1992 ; harris et al. , 1990 ; nih , 1991. ) and since breast - conservation therapy involves radiation , its implementation would logically vary depending upon the availability of appropriate radiation equipment and expertise in operating that equipment .
