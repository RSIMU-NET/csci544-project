revocations , which are movements of funds out of a project . the corps did not notify the congress of their intention to reprogram the funds in excess of the thresholds on september 1 and 24 . reprogrammings beyond these thresholds must be coordinated with the appropriations committees . reprogrammings beyond this threshold require notification of the appropriations committees . reprogrammings beyond these thresholds must be coordinated with the appropriations committees . reprogrammings beyond this threshold require notification of the appropriations committees . must receive approval from the appropriations committees . reprogrammings beyond this threshold require notification of the appropriations committees . must receive approval from the appropriations committees . the cumulative threshold amount for notifying the congress was $25,000 for this investigations project . on april 22 , 2003 , $25,000 was reprogrammed into the project . on april 28 , 2003 , another $25,000 was reprogrammed into the project , exceeding the cumulative threshold . the corps did not notify the congress of its intention to reprogram the funds in excess of the threshold . corps officials explained that they made a mistake and did not initially realize that the threshold had been exceeded . when the error was realized , the corps revoked $25,000 on may 29 , 2003 , to undo the previous error . the single action threshold was $300,000 for this construction project . on september 20 , 2004 , the corps revoked $800,000 exceeding the single action threshold of $300,000 . the corps notified the congress of its intention to reprogram the $800,000 , on september 24 , 2004 , 4 days after the funds had been moved . the single action threshold for this construction project was $7,301,200 and the cumulative threshold was $4 million . ( in this case , because of the size of the project , the threshold calculations resulted in a higher single action threshold than a cumulative threshold. ) on august 6 , 2004 , the corps moved $5.3 million into the project using its accelerated contractor earnings authority . however , the accelerated contractor earnings authority only allows the corps to move up to $5 million and it must be used for settling a contractor's claim , increased contractor earnings due to accelerated rate of operations , or real estate deficiency judgment . in addition to exceeding their authority to move funds under this provision , corps officials told us that the funds were not moved for any of the authorized purposes . rather , the funds were used to continue funding a contract . the corps had awarded a contract for about $80 million for fiscal year 2004 , but received only about $27 million for the project . to avoid a work stoppage , possible contractor claims , and / or possible interest payments , the corps moved a large amount of funds into the project , including the $5.3 million . the single action threshold for this construction project was $311,800 and the cumulative threshold was $4 million . the spreadsheet was independently verified with the data collection instruments . we compared the corps' reprogramming activities for each selected project to the internal guidance and congressional direction that was in effect at the time the reprogramming was conducted .
