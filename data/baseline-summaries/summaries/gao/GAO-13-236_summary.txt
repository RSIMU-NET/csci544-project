this percentage is jsas's normal cost rate . if all the actuarial assumptions proved exactly correct , then a total contribution of 7.59 percent of the participating judges' salaries annually would make up the difference between jsas's future payments and its assets ( the $358,934,134 mentioned above ) . the jsas's actuary also estimated the present value of participating judges' future contributions to be $127,723,509 . thus , the federal government's share of the present value of future contributions is the difference between $358,934,134 and $127,723,509 , or $231,210,625 . under this method , for plan year 2010 , the federal government's actuarially recommended contribution rate is equal to the federal government's share of future financing ( $231,210,625 ) divided by the present value of the participating judges' future salaries ( $4,727,919,865 ) . for plan year 2010 , the rate was 4.89 percent ( $231,210,625 divided by $4,727,919,865 ) . thus , the actuarially recommended federal government contribution for a particular year is the product of the federal government's actuarially recommended contribution rate and the participating judges' salaries for that year . the actual federal government contribution is approved through annual appropriations , which could vary above and below the actuarially recommended amount . the new staff person was not as familiar with the required information to be provided to the actuary . in addition , afsd had not established procedures that required coordination with the office of human resources' judges compensation and retirement services office ( jcrso ) . see appendix ii for a discussion of the aggregate cost method . the total normal costs expressed as a percentage of the present value of participants' future salaries shown in table 1 increased from 5.41 percent in plan year 2008 to 7.59 percent in plan year 2010 . however , jcrso did not participate in preparing the information that was provided to the actuary , nor did it review the actuarial valuation reports before they were issued because aousc's procedures did not require such coordination . the judges' actual rate of normal cost increased marginally from 2.55 percent of salaries in plan year 2008 , to 2.62 in plan year 2009 , and to 2.70 percent of salaries in plan year 2010 . during those same years , the recommended government's contribution rate increased from 2.86 percent of salaries in plan year 2008 to 4.09 percent of salaries in plan year 2009 , and to 4.89 percent in plan year 2010 . most of the increase in the recommended federal government's contribution rate over the 3 years under review was due to ( 1 ) less favorable actual economic and demographic outcomes over this period than predicted by the actuarial assumptions ( known as losses from economic and demographic “experience” ) and ( 2 ) changes in actuarial assumptions regarding future economic and demographic outcomes . key contributors to this report are listed in appendix iv . j. lawrence malenich director financial management and assurance frank todisco chief actuary applied research and methods the undersigned meets the qualification standards of the american academy of actuaries to render the actuarial opinions contained in this report . the administrative office of the united states courts ( aousc ) administers three retirement systems for judges in the federal judiciary .
