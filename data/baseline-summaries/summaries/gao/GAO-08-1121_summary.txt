( see fig . survey data from 2004 through 2005 showed that about 37 percent of children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 had visited the dentist in the previous year , compared with about 55 percent of children with private health insurance , and 26 percent of children without insurance . the percentage of children in medicaid who received any dental care — 37 percent — was far below the healthy people 2010 target of having 66 percent of low - income children under age 19 receive a preventive dental service . the nhanes data from 1999 through 2004 also provide some information related to the receipt of dental care . the presence of dental sealants , a form of preventive care , is considered to be an indicator that a person has received dental care . about 28 percent of children in medicaid had at least one dental sealant , according to 1999 through 2004 nhanes data . in contrast , about 40 percent of children with private insurance had a sealant . however , children in medicaid were more likely to have sealants than children without health insurance ( about 20 percent ) . while comparisons of past and more recent survey data suggest that a larger proportion of children in medicaid had received dental care in recent surveys , the extent that children in medicaid experience dental disease has not decreased . a comparison of nhanes results from 1988 through 1994 with results from 1999 through 2004 showed that the rates of untreated tooth decay were largely unchanged for children in medicaid aged 2 through 18: 31 percent of children had untreated tooth decay in 1988 through 1994 , compared with 33 percent in 1999 through 2004 ( see fig . the proportion of children in medicaid who experienced tooth decay increased from 56 percent in the earlier period to 62 percent in more recent years . this increase appears to be driven by younger children , as the 2 through 5 age group had substantially higher rates of dental disease in the more recent time period , 1999 through 2004 . this preschool age group experienced a 32 percent rate of tooth decay in the 1988 through 1994 time period , compared to almost 40 percent experiencing tooth decay in 1999 through 2004 ( a statistically significant change ) . data for adolescents , by contrast , suggest declining rates of tooth decay . almost 82 percent of adolescents aged 16 through 18 in medicaid had experienced tooth decay in the earlier time period , compared to 75 percent in the latter time period ( although this change was not statistically significant ) . these trends were similar for rates of untreated tooth decay , with the data suggesting rates going up for young children , and declining or remaining the same for older groups that are more likely to have permanent teeth . according to cdc , these trends are similar for the general population of children , for which tooth decay in permanent teeth has generally declined and untreated tooth decay has remained unchanged . cdc also found that tooth decay in preschool aged children in the general population had increased in primary teeth .
