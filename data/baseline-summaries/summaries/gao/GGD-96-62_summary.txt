what have the buyouts achieved ? to answer this , we examined whether statutorily - mandated downsizing goals were being achieved ; the management strategy used to implement the buyouts ; the demographic results ; how agencies viewed buyouts as a downsizing tool ; and what agencies said about the operational effects of downsizing . the national performance review ( npr ) — the administration's initiative to “reinvent” government — called on agencies in its september 1993 report to implement a variety of management reforms that would allow for the elimination of 252,000 federal positions over the following 5 years . included in this number were 100,000 positions the president had earlier ordered eliminated by the end of fiscal year 1995 . to achieve these reductions while avoiding rifs , npr called for legislation to allow non - dod agencies to offer buyouts to employees who voluntarily left federal service . dod agencies had been making buyouts since january 1993 under earlier legislation . according to npr , the original purpose of the dod buyout authority was to ease the reductions in the size of dod following the end of the cold war . according to office of personnel management ( opm ) data , agencies paid over 112,500 buyouts to employees from january 1993 through september 30 , 1995 . about 80,000 ( 71 percent ) of these buyouts were paid to dod employees . responding to npr's recommendation , on march 30 , 1994 , congress enacted the federal workforce restructuring act of 1994 ( p.l . 103-226 ) that permitted non - dod executive branch agencies to offer buyouts . the buyouts could be paid to eligible employees in any designated component , occupation , and / or geographic location who agreed to resign , retire , or take early retirement by march 31 , 1995 , unless the date was extended by the head of the agency , but no later than march 31 , 1997 . the buyout payment was the lesser of $25,000 or an employee's severance pay entitlement . to receive a buyout , an employee must have served under appointment without time limit , have had 12 months of continuous service , not be a reemployed annuitant , and not be eligible for disability retirement . under the law , buyout recipients who are rehired by the federal government or perform services under a personal services contract with the government within 5 years of their separation date are generally required to repay the full amount of the buyout . in addition to providing non - dod agencies with buyout authority , the workforce restructuring act raised the federal downsizing target for all agencies , including dod , from 252,000 to 272,900 full - time equivalent ( fte ) positions by fiscal year 1999 . additionally , as shown in table 1.1 , the act placed annual ceilings on civilian executive branch fte levels for fiscal years 1994 through 1999 . in march 1995 , we testified that data from the president's fiscal year 1996 budget showed that for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 , the administration anticipated that the workforce would be below the fte levels mandated by the act .
