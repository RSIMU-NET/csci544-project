dod agreed with our recommendation . in response , the air force established mandatory training for personnel responsible for entering this data in the system . according to agency officials , dod is in the process of updating guidance on entering data for one - offer awards . dod's competition rate for all contract obligations had been declining since 2009 ; however , the competition rate has remained flat for the past 2 years . among the dod components in our study , the army had the highest competition rate in fiscal year 2013 , while mda had the lowest . see figure 2 . last year , we found that the one - offer requirements will likely have a limited impact on unnecessarily restrictive solicitation requirements because many solicitations provide initial response times of more than 30 days , so many awards are not subject to the program office consultation rule . we also found that the impact of recent guidance on the number and dollar value of one - offer awards is not quantifiable because of unreliable data . as a result , dod is not in a position to accurately measure the impact of the one - offer requirements since it was implemented . however , the competition rate did not change from fiscal years 2012 to 2013 , remaining at 57 percent . dod's total dollars obligated decreased by almost $53 billion , from $360.4 billion in fiscal year 2012 to $307.5 billion in fiscal year 2013 . competed obligations decreased by over $31 billion , from $205.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 to $174.2 billion in fiscal year 2013 . we also found that the competition rate for all contract obligations varied by dod component . of the 4 organizations we reviewed — air force , army , navy , and mda — in fiscal year 2013 , the army had the highest competition rate , 66 percent , whereas mda had the lowest rate of competition , 29 percent , representing a significant decrease from the prior year . figure 4 outlines competition rates by component for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 . we recommended that dod develop an action plan for dod components to collect reliable data on competitive procurements for which only one offer is received , so that the department can determine the effect of its requirements on one - offer awards . based on fpds - ng data , we found that noncompetitive awards cited several exceptions from competitive procedures . we continue to observe , as we previously found in 2012 and 2013 , that there are a number of factors that affect dod's competition rate . for example , the government has historically relied on the original equipment manufacturers of weapon systems for future procurements of the system , including sustainment . between fiscal years 2009 and 2013 , dod's competition rate — based on all contract obligations — declined by 5 percent , from 62 percent to 57 percent , with an average competition rate of 59 percent for the 5 year period ( see figure 3 ) . in fiscal year 2013 , the air force's competition rate improved to 41 percent .
