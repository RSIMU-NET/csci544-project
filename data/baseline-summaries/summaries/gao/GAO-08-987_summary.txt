form no . 1 filings for 2006 made by the rtos to ferc provide better visibility of transmission and market expenses than prior years' reports did . in 2006 , about 17 percent of all rto expenses were for transmission services , 13 percent were for market expenses , 39 percent were for administrative and general expenses , and 31 percent consisted of other expenses . rtos also made major investments in property , plant , and equipment — $1.6 billion when adjusted for inflation as of december 2006 . from 2002 to 2006 , total inflation - adjusted expenses reported in rto financial statements totaled $4.8 billion , ranging from $227 million for southwest power pool , a smaller rto in terms of 2006 transmission volume and the number of functions it performs , to $1.4 billion for pjm , an rto with many diverse functions and the largest 2006 transmission volume . as shown in figure 3 , the largest category of expenses for rtos over this time period was salaries and benefits , accounting for about $1.6 billion , or 33 percent of rtos' expenses from 2002 to 2006 . according to rto officials , due to the highly technical and sophisticated nature of the functions rtos must carry out , rtos require highly trained staff , such as power system engineers , economists , and software engineers . in 2006 , all rtos combined employed 2,737 full - time equivalents ( fte ) with an average salary and related benefits of approximately $134,000 . appendix iii shows the inflation - adjusted expenses , number of full - time equivalents , and average salary and expenses per full - time equivalent for each rto from 2002 to 2006 . our analysis reflects total annual expenses as reported in the rtos' audited financial statements . we did not retroactively apply financial statement reclassifications to data from prior years . because pjm made retroactive reclassifications that affected its 2002 and 2003 financial statements , in 2002 and 2003 , the expenses we calculated for pjm are significantly higher than the amounts it billed its market participants . in general , rtos with greater electricity transmission volume benefit from economies of scale – – spreading their expenses over more units of electricity volume , thus lowering the amount of rto - related expenses per mwh . for example , pjm had the highest total inflation - adjusted expenses among rtos in 2006 — $282 million — but had the second lowest expense per mwh — $0.39 per mwh — because it transmitted a greater amount of electricity than the other rtos . in contrast , iso new england had the second lowest expenses in 2006 — $118 million — but had the highest expense per mwh — $0.89 per mwh — because it transmitted less electricity . figure 4 illustrates total rto expenses in 2006 per unit of electricity transmitted by major category . appendix iv provides transmission data and expense per mwh data by rto from 2002 to 2006 . our analysis reflects total annual expenses as reported in the rtos' annual audited financial statements , divided by the amount of transmission volume within the rto .
