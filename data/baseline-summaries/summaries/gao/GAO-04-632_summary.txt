ii ) . disco and doha serve as central adjudication facilities for industry personnel , whereas dod uses eight other central adjudication facilities to approve , deny , or revoke eligibility for a security clearance for military members and federal employees . dod's security clearance backlog for industry personnel was roughly 188,000 cases , and the time needed to conduct an investigation and determine eligibility for a clearance had increased by 56 days during the last 3 fiscal years . a number of past conditions also serve as impediments to issuing timely eligibility determinations for industry personnel . as of march 31 , 2004 , dss identified more than 61,000 overdue but not submitted reinvestigations and about 127,000 investigations or adjudications that had been started but not completed within set time frames . from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2003 , the average time that it took to conduct an investigation and determine clearance eligibility for industry personnel increased from 319 days to 375 days . in such a hypothetical situation , dss would have only 15 days , rather than the full 75 days , to complete the investigation before having the case labeled as “backlog.” similarly , the adjudicative backlog might lead to a delay in reviewing new investigative reports , thereby increasing the likelihood that a new adjudication will be categorized as “backlog” before an eligibility determination is provided . dod's delays in conducting an investigation and determining clearance eligibility can , among other things , increase national security risks and the costs to the federal government of contractor performance on defense contracts . as of march 31 , 2004 , the industry personnel backlog was roughly 188,000 cases . dod identified more than 61,000 reinvestigations that were overdue but had not been submitted , over 101,000 backlogged investigations , and over 25,000 backlogged adjudications . for the 25,000 completed investigations awaiting adjudication , dss found that over 19,000 of the cases were at disco and more than 6,300 of the cases were at doha . however , as of march 31 , 2004 , doha independently reported that it had eliminated its adjudication backlog . a complicating factor in determining the size of the industrial personnel backlog is that the backlog may be underestimated , since dss had opened relatively few cases between october 1 , 2003 , and march 31 , 2004 , in anticipation of the authorized transfer of the investigative function from dss to opm . dss had received , but not opened , almost 69,200 new industry personnel requests received in the first half of fiscal year 2004 . cases received in fiscal year 2004 , which have already exceeded the set time frames for completing the investigation , are included in the 101,000 backlogged investigations identified above . to view the industry personnel backlog in its proper context , we compared this backlog to the dod - wide clearance backlog as of september 30 , 2003 , the date of the most recent dod - wide data . for the preinvestigation stage , dod did not know the total number of personnel dod - wide with overdue requests for reinvestigation that had not been submitted — even though their clearances exceeded the governmentwide time frames for submitting reinvestigations .
