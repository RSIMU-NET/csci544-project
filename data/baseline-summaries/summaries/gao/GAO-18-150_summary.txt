mtw reserves . the accumulation of relatively large reserves by mtw agencies also raises questions about funding uses . nontraditional activities . public housing occupancy and voucher unit utilization rates might be lower for mtw agencies in part because mtw agencies can use funds to implement policies that go beyond traditional forms of housing assistance . since october 2009 , the demonstration's “broader uses of funds” authorization under the standard agreement has permitted all mtw agencies to adopt local , nontraditional activities , which hud guidance organizes into four categories ( see table 3 ) . in july 2017 , hud provided us with data it had recently compiled on the number of households served through local , nontraditional activities , by mtw agency , during 2009 – 2016 ( see fig . according to these data , in 2009 four agencies implemented at least one type of local , nontraditional housing assistance activity and served 1,177 households ( that is , less than 1 household served through local , nontraditional housing assistance for every 100 mtw public housing and voucher units available ) . in 2016 , the number of agencies that implemented at least one local , nontraditional housing assistance activity grew to 25 agencies , which served 9,787 households ( about 2 households served through local , nontraditional housing assistance for every 100 mtw public housing and voucher unit available ) . some of these households could be served through a rental assistance program that offers a lower level of subsidy than is available to households served through traditional voucher and public housing programs . for example , a local , nontraditional activity could result in an mtw agency lowering its share of housing assistance , thereby increasing the tenant's share of rent . conversely , hud officials pointed out that because mtw agencies assist hard - to - serve households , the subsidies provided to these households could be higher than the subsidy provided under hud's traditional housing assistance programs . as such , a household served through local , nontraditional housing activity may not be equivalent to a household served under the traditional voucher or public housing program . other factors related to expenses . according to hud officials , factors that could explain the observed differences in the expenses for the public housing and voucher programs of mtw agencies and non - mtw agencies include that mtw agencies typically ( 1 ) need more time and resources to develop and implement “innovative” activities , ( 2 ) serve hard - to - serve households such as those experiencing homelessness , and ( 3 ) provide additional services to the households they serve as a result of the funding flexibilities . according to a university of north carolina at chapel hill study , nearly all mtw agencies have used program flexibility to provide supportive housing for various hard - to - serve populations , including the previously homeless , mentally disabled , developmentally disabled , formerly incarcerated , domestic abuse victims , youth aging out of foster care , and those with substance abuse issues . some of these programs were provided through sponsor - based voucher programs administered by partner agencies , which required coordination between the mtw agency and the partnering agencies .
