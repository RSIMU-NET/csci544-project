fms awards may provide a benefit to dod . for example , when an fms award is in addition to products or services that dod is already purchasing , it may help dod to obtain a lower price with a vendor which can result in a better value for the government . there are a number of factors that affect dod's competition rate . for example , reliance on an original equipment manufacturer throughout the life cycle of a program and budget uncertainty are long - standing challenges impacting dod's ability to compete . noncompetitive purchases that dod makes on behalf of foreign governments affect dod's competition rate as well . dod does not systematically identify , track , and consider the specific factors that are affecting competition when setting its annual competition goals . a long - standing factor impacting dod's competition rate is its reliance on an original equipment manufacturer throughout the life cycle of a program because of a previous decision not to purchase proprietary technical data . thorough explanations of the cost - benefit analysis conducted to determine that the time and money required for purchasing technical data rights and developing a new supplier could not be recouped through savings from competition , and in some instances would result in unacceptable delays . for example , the air force awarded a noncompetitive contract for $647.8 million for missile production . the class justification clearly described the cost - benefit analysis conducted to determine that the cost to purchase data rights and establish a second source — $750 million — did not justify the investment . some justifications in our sample provided limited insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards . six of the 10 awards were incorrectly coded as subject to competition in fpds - ng , when they were actually noncompetitive awards . the remaining 4 awards received multiple offers , but the contracting officer incorrectly coded them as receiving one offer . since our review focused on large dollar awards , which are typically subject to a more rigorous review process within dod , the results of our assessment suggest that more errors may exist in unselected awards . in 2010 we reported that similar coding errors existed in fpds - ng one - offer award data . in addition , the dod inspector general determined that 27 percent of the 107 one - offer awards it reviewed from fiscal year 2011 were miscoded in fpds - ng . dod relies on fpds - ng data to make important decisions regarding its new requirement on one - offer awards . for example , dod directed the services to increase their effective competition rates — the proportion of competitive obligations based on multiple offers — by 10 percent per year as part of the better buying power initiative . the one - offer requirement is intended to be a means to achieve this goal . however , dod's ability to calculate the quantitative impact of the requirement and improvements toward effective competition goals is limited by unreliable fpds - ng data . without reliable data , dod cannot accurately measure the impact of the new requirement .
