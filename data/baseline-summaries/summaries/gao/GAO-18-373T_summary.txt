i would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have at this time . the cnmi economy continues to experience growing demand for workers . in fiscal years 2012 through 2016 , the number of cw - 1 permits almost doubled , and since fiscal year 2016 , the number of permits has approached the numerical limits on permits for those years . our preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved cw - 1 permits grew from 7,127 in fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016 . on october 14 , 2016 — 2 weeks into fiscal year 2017 — uscis announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the cw - 1 cap for fiscal year 2017 and would not accept requests for new permits for that year during the remaining 11 months . in may 2017 , uscis announced that it had received a sufficient number of petitions to reach the cw - 1 cap for fiscal year 2018 . table 2 shows the cw - 1 permit caps and numbers of permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 . according to uscis officials , as of january 26 , 2018 , fiscal year 2018 petitions were still being adjudicated . our preliminary analysis of uscis cw - 1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in cw - 1 workers' country of birth , occupation , and duration of employment . uscis data showed a decline in the numbers of cw - 1 permits for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 for workers born in each of the five countries listed most frequently on the petitions — the philippines , china , south korea , bangladesh , and japan ( see table 3 ) . we determined that the data used in our analyses were sufficiently reliable for our purposes . to provide preliminary observations on the numbers of cw - 1 permits granted for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 and characteristics of foreign workers who held them , we analyzed record - level data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 provided by dhs's u.s . citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) , which administers the cnmi - only transitional worker program ( cw program ) . according to uscis officials , as of january 26 , 2018 , uscis was continuing to adjudicate cw - 1 petitions for fiscal year 2018 . to determine the reliability of the data , we interviewed cognizant uscis officials in washington , d.c. , and at the uscis california service center , where petitions for cw - 1 permits are adjudicated . we also discussed our methodologies and assumptions for data processing and the results of our preliminary analysis with officials in washington , d.c. , who used their own methodologies to conduct a technical review of our tables showing numbers of permits approved and permit holders' countries of birth and occupations ( see tables 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . we also conducted electronic testing of the data to identify and resolve inconsistencies in personally identifiable information for permit holders , to ensure accuracy in tracking these individuals over time . we determined that the uscis cw - 1 permit data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes .
