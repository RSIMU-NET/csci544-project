omb circular no . a - 11 states that the antideficiency act requires that the agency head prescribe , by regulation , a system of administrative control of funds , and omb provided a checklist in appendix h to the circular that agencies can use for drafting their fund control regulations . this requirement is consistent with those in the usda budget manual , which prescribes budgetary administration through a system of administrative controls for its component agencies , including the forest service . the usda budget manual states that to the extent necessary for effective administration , ( 1 ) the heads of usda component agencies may delegate to subordinate officials responsibilities in connection with the administrative distribution of funds within apportionments and allotments and the monitoring , control , and reporting of the occurrence of obligations and expenditures under apportionments and allotments and ( 2 ) the chain of such responsibility shall be clearly defined . in addition , usda requires its component agencies to promulgate and maintain administrative control of funds regulation and to send such regulation to usda's office of program and budget analysis for review and approval prior to issuance . because the forest service has not developed and issued a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds that considers all aspects of the budget execution processes , it cannot reasonably assure that ( 1 ) programs will achieve their intended results ; ( 2 ) the use of resources is consistent with the agency's mission ; ( 3 ) programs and resources are protected from waste , fraud , and mismanagement ; and ( 4 ) laws and regulations are followed . we also found that the forest service had not reviewed and updated most of its administrative control of funds guidance in the manuals and handbooks for over 5 years . the usda budget manual requires each component to periodically review its funds control system for overall effectiveness and to assure that it is consistent with its agency programs and organizational structures . further , forest service policy also requires routine review , every 5 years , of policies and procedures in its directive system . according to forest service officials , when directives are up for review and update , a staff from the office of regulatory and management services ( orms ) sends an e - mail reminder to notify responsible personnel that updates to applicable directives are needed . however , we found that the forest service does not have adequate controls in place to monitor the reviews and any updates of the manuals and handbooks in its directive system to reasonably assure that their efforts resulted in timely updates . as a result , the forest service is at risk that guidance for its system for administrative control of funds may lose relevance as processes change over time and control activities may become inadequate . the forest service did not have properly designed control activities over its process for fund transfers related to wildland fire suppression activities .
