vi ) . in all cases , the resulting distributions were severely skewed , making no single measure of central tendency adequate to describe the distribution . for an example , see table i.1 . total ( percent ) 12,943 ( 16 ) $1 to less than $100 22 ( 0 ) $100 to less than $1,000 879 ( 1 ) $1,000 to less than $100,000 13,955 ( 18 ) $100,000 to less than $1 million 25,311 ( 32 ) $1 million to less than $6 million 22,497 ( 28 ) $6 million to less than $15 million 2,865 ( 4 ) $15 million to less than $50 million 943 ( 1 ) $50 million to less than $100 million 16 ( 0 ) $100 million or more 23 ( 0 ) total ( percent ) 56,500 ( 71 ) 20,053 ( 25 ) 2,900 ( 4 ) 79,454 ( 100 ) slight discrepancies in row and column totals are due to rounding . it is necessarily a very complex sample . essentially , however , it is stratified by state and grade level ( elementary , secondary , and combined ) . it also has separate strata for schools with large native american populations and for bureau of indian affairs schools . tables ii.5 through ii.13 focus on individual building features , showing the estimated percentage of schools with selected inadequate building features . tables ii.3 and ii.4 include the results for both buildings and building features , showing the estimated percentage of schools with at least one inadequate building , at least one inadequate building feature , or both . with the exception of the state analyses , the tables on building features show the estimated number of students attending schools with inadequate conditions in addition to the estimated percentage of schools . we did not report these numbers for the state analyses due to particularly high sampling errors associated with these data . nationwide , about a third of the schools reported at least one entire building in need of extensive repair or replacement , and about 57 percent of schools , many in otherwise adequate condition , reported needing extensive repair , overhaul , or replacement of at least one major building feature . percent of schools reporting at least one inadequate on - site building ( continued ) percent of schools reporting at least one inadequate on - site building ( continued ) percent of schools reporting at least one inadequate on - site building sampling errors are equal to or greater than 16 percentage points but less than 20 percentage points . at least one inadequate building and building feature ( continued ) at least one inadequate building number of students ( 000s ) number of students ( 000s ) number of students ( 000s ) ( continued ) at least one inadequate building number of students ( 000s ) number of students ( 000s ) number of students ( 000s ) proportion of students approved for free or reduced - price lunch points unless otherwise noted . most of these schools needed multiple features repaired . we mailed our questionnaires to 9,956 sampled schools in 5,459 associated districts across the country in may 1994 .
