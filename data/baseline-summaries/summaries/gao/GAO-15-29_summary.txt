nnsa agreed with this recommendation . without a requirement for conducting program reviews , nnsa does not have the appropriate internal controls necessary for assessing program performance . according to the standards for internal control in the federal government , federal agencies are to employ internal control activities , such as functional reviews by management of projects and programs to compare actual performance to planned or expected results throughout the organization and analyze significant differences . such reviews are to help ensure that management's directives are carried out and to determine if agencies are effectively and efficiently using resources . doe and nnsa have taken action in recent years to improve cost - estimating practices , including the corrective actions that were implemented as part of the department's 2008 root - cause analysis , which doe later reported as having effectively mitigated most of the root causes of the most significant contract and project management challenges . nonetheless , nnsa continues to struggle with significant cost overruns on its major projects . because doe does not require the use of most of the 12 cost estimating best practices for its projects and programs , it is unlikely that nnsa and its contractors will consistently develop reliable cost estimates . in addition , while doe has developed a cost estimating guide , it does not fully describe all 12 cost estimating best practices . as a result , doe and nnsa have not provided its contractors with all the detailed guidance needed to consistently develop reliable cost estimates . also , because doe order 413.3b has not been updated since 2010 , it omits reference to the supplemental cost estimating guide ; users of the order may not be aware of the guide's availability and may not benefit from its usefulness . finally , without a requirement for conducting reviews of programs with project - like characteristics , including the life - cycle cost estimates of these programs , neither doe nor nnsa have appropriate internal controls to assess the quality of program performance over time . to enhance nnsa's ability to develop reliable cost estimates for its projects and for its programs that have project - like characteristics , we recommend the secretary of energy take the following five actions: revise doe's project management order to require that doe , nnsa , and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 cost estimating best practices . revise doe's cost estimating guide so that it fully reflects the 12 cost estimating best practices . revise doe's project management order to include references to the doe cost estimating guide , where applicable . revise doe directives that apply to programs to require that doe and nnsa and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 cost estimating best practices , including developing life - cycle cost estimates for programs . revise doe requirements and guidance that apply to programs to ensure that program reviews are conducted periodically , including reviews of the life - cycle cost estimates for programs . we provided doe with a draft of this report for its review and comment . in its written comments , reproduced in appendix iii , doe agreed with the report's recommendations .
