( app . ii contains a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. ) we performed our work from august 2000 through may 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . we did not independently assess the accuracy and reliability of the arms database and the program payments reporting system . as agreed with your office , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter . at that time , we will send copies of this report to the congressional committees with jurisdiction over farm programs ; the honorable ann m. veneman , secretary of agriculture ; the honorable mitchell e. daniels , jr. , director of the office of management and budget ; and other interested parties . we will also make copies available to others on request . the percentage then decreased to 6 in 1999 . ( see fig . it was also higher than in previous years . during the period of 1991 through 1999 , the percentage of young farmers receiving payments was in the 30s each year , except for 27 percent in 1994 , 29 percent in 1996 , 42 percent in 1993 , and the 46 percent in 1999 . the average payment made in 1999 to farms whose principal operator was less than 35 years old was about $16,544 , a little less than the average of $16,751 for all farms receiving payments . their average payment was also several thousand dollars less than the average of $20,898 for those that were age 35 to 54 but more than the average of $12,973 for those 55 or older . ( see fig . in 1999 , young farmers operated farms of all sizes , just like older farmers . the number of young principal operators declined to 120,612 , or about 6 percent , in 1999 . in which he / she holds substantial beneficial interest . ( see table 2. ) the large amount of marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments in 1999 had put many large and even mid - sized farms up against the $75,000 limit for the program's benefits . when farmers reach the payment limit , they can put the remaining crop under loan and forfeit the stored commodities to settle the loan . concerned about the federal government's expense associated with storing and disposing of forfeited commodities , the congress doubled the payment limit for the 1999 crop . in addition , in february 2000 , the secretary of agriculture implemented a statutorily authorized commodity certificate program that was also intended to discourage forfeitures , in this case by effectively eliminating payment limits . under the program , farmers may purchase certificates at the posted county price for up to the quantity of grain or cotton under loan , and then immediately trade the certificates to recover commodities under loan , which can then be sold on the market . the congress increased the payment limitation again for the 2000 crop , reducing the need for farmers to use certificates . usda also provides considerable other financial assistance to farmers in the form of loans and crop insurance .
