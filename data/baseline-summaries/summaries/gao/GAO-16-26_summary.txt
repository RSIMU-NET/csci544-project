sequestration . on march 1 , 2013 the president ordered a sequestration of $85.3 billion across federal government accounts . final appropriations enacted on march 26 , 2013 had the effect of reducing this amount to $80.5 billion . the reductions were to be split evenly between defense and nondefense functions . each template includes a graphic which shows the unobligated balance as a percentage of budgetary resources . federal agencies reported unexpended balances — the sum of obligated and unobligated balances — in 1,358 of 1,493 active budget accounts from fiscal year 2012 through 2014 . total unexpended balances fluctuated from $2.23 trillion in fiscal year 2012 to $2.27 trillion in fiscal year 2014 . this represents an overall increase of approximately $41 billion with a decrease in 2013 . about 91 percent of active accounts carried unobligated balances with total unobligated balances increasing from $788 billion to $872 billion during this period . as shown in figure 11 , unobligated balances were more than one - third of total unexpended balances from fiscal year 2012 through 2014 , which is generally consistent with data from fiscal years 2007 through 2011 . each budget account is assigned a category of spending — discretionary , mandatory , or split , which is a combination of both discretionary and mandatory . as shown in figure 12 , mandatory accounts represent about 50 percent of total unobligated balances in fiscal years 2012 through 2014 . from fiscal year 2009 through 2011 the share of unobligated balances in mandatory accounts was relatively stable at about 52 percent of total unobligated balances . this comes after a growth in the mandatory share of the balances from about 25 percent in fiscal year 2007 to about 47 percent in fiscal year 2008 . the percentage of unobligated balances in split accounts remained at about 32 percent in fiscal years 2012 through 2014 , which has been generally consistent since 2010 . from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 , unobligated balances in discretionary accounts were between approximately 16 and 19 percent of all unobligated balances . as shown in figure 12 , this has been the case since 2010 , before which discretionary balances represented higher proportions of unobligated balances , including nearly 26 percent in fiscal year 2007 . as shown in table 5 , the three mandatory accounts with the largest amount of unobligated balances in fiscal year 2014 were more than 12 times larger than the top three discretionary account balances . each budget account appears in 1 of the 19 budget functions that best reflects its major purpose or important national need . these functions include income security , national defense , and transportation . accounts under a particular budget function may support programs and activities at multiple agencies . for example , accounts that are categorized as within the “national defense” budget function may support activities at multiple agencies such as operations and maintenance at the department of defense , infrastructure protection at the department of homeland security , and defense environmental cleanup at the department of energy .
