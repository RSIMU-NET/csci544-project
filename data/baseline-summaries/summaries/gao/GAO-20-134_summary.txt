designations . of the 26 tps designations , three were for one country , liberia , and four were for two countries , el salvador and sierra leone , that were each designated twice . extensions . the majority of tps designations ( 17 of 26 designations ) were extended up to eight times . designations for five countries — el salvador , honduras , nicaragua , somalia , and sudan — were extended more than 10 times each . three of the 22 countries' designations were not extended before termination . terminations . the tps designations for all countries except somalia , south sudan , syria , and yemen had been terminated as of september 30 , 2019 . the termination of six countries' designations since fiscal year 2018 had been temporarily halted because of ongoing litigation . several lawsuits had been filed regarding the secretary of homeland security's decisions to terminate tps for el salvador , haiti , honduras , nepal , nicaragua , and sudan . in october 2018 , a u.s. district judge in california issued a preliminary injunction for one of the lawsuits , temporarily blocking dhs from enforcing the secretary's tps termination decisions for el salvador , haiti , nicaragua , and sudan . the u.s. government filed an appeal in response to the preliminary injunction . according to uscis officials , dhs has regularly published notices of its continued compliance with the court's injunction and has stated that it will continue to publish such notices pending resolution of the case in april 2019 , a district court judge in new york issued a second preliminary injunction covering haiti , which the u.s. government appealed in june 2019 . additionally , under an agreement to stay the proceedings in response to a lawsuit filed in california in february 2019 , the government stipulated that it would temporarily halt terminations for honduras and nepal until the appeal of the october 2018 injunction had been resolved . redesignations . of the 20 tps redesignations , six were for countries that were redesignated once , two were for one country that was redesignated twice , and twelve were for four countries that each were redesignated thrice — the largest number of tps redesignations . uscis data show that applications for tps were approved for a total of 431,848 foreign nationals in fiscal years 2000 through 2018 and that the number of tps beneficiaries each year grew from about 70,000 in fiscal year 2000 to about 420,000 in fiscal year 2018 . the number of tps beneficiaries increased most rapidly in fiscal years 2000 through 2005 , particularly after the designation of honduras in 1999 and el salvador in 2001 . according to uscis officials , because adjudicating all tps applications can take years , depending on the number of applicants from a country , the number of tps beneficiaries for a designated country may continue rising after the established registration period for the specific designation . for example , although honduras was initially designated for tps in 1999 , with an applicant registration period that ended on july 5 , 1999 , uscis data show that the number of beneficiaries from honduras who were granted tps peaked in 2007 at 85,759 foreign nationals .
