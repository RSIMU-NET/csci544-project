( app . i presents the survey we used. ) we also met with officials from epa's program and regional offices , as well as with officials from two states , to discuss the implementation of the enhanced i&m programs . epa determined that 23 states needed enhanced i&m programs in order to meet national air quality standards . title i also required epa to issue regulations for the enhanced i&m program by november 15 , 1991 , and the states to implement their enhanced i&m programs by november 15 , 1992 . title i divided all of the ozone nonattainment areas into five categories — marginal , moderate , serious , severe , and extreme — and set time frames for each category to reach attainment . the attainment dates ranged from 3 years ( marginal ) to 20 years ( extreme ) after the act was enacted . title i also required the states to demonstrate how they would reduce volatile organic compounds ( voc ) emissions — one of the major pollutants that contribute to the formation of ozone . the states with moderate to extreme ozone nonattainment areas were required to prepare implementation plans by november 1993 that showed how they would reduce voc emissions by 15 percent within 6 years after enactment . the states with serious to extreme nonattainment areas also had to prepare plans showing how they would achieve additional voc reductions . the plans to reduce voc emissions after 1996 were due by november 1994 and were to show how the states planned to achieve 3-percent voc reductions annually until the nonattainment areas reach attainment . epa issued its regulation for the enhanced i&m program on november 5 , 1992 . the regulation required the states with areas switching from test - and - repair to test - only requirements to implement programs that would begin testing 30 percent of all vehicles that were subject to enhanced i&m in the nonattainment areas in january 1 , 1995 , and all areas to begin testing all vehicles by january 1 , 1996 . the regulation also required the states to meet or exceed a performance standard that was based on a model program for an annual , centralized enhanced i&m program that included im - 240 test equipment , or an equivalent test protocol approved by epa , and covered all 1968 and later model cars and light - duty trucks . the states that elected to implement decentralized programs or a program consisting of centralized and decentralized inspection facilities were to have their emission reduction credits discounted by approximately 50 percent for the decentralized portion of their programs , unless they could demonstrate that their programs were as effective as a centralized program . the regulation also included the requirement under the clean air act amendments of 1990 that a minimum expenditure of $450 for emission - related repairs was required for vehicles to qualify for a waiver of further repairs .
