these weaknesses are highlighted below . on the basis of statistical sampling , we estimated that 72 percent of the over 68,000 premium - class airline tickets dod purchased for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 were not properly authorized and that 73 percent were not properly justified . during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 , dod spent almost $124 million on airline tickets that included at least one leg of the trip in premium - class — usually business class . because each premium - class ticket costs the government up to thousands of dollars more than a coach class ticket , unauthorized premium - class travel resulted in millions of dollars of unnecessary costs annually . because of control breakdowns , dod paid for airline tickets that were neither used nor processed for refund — amounting to about 58,000 tickets totaling more than $21 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 . dod was not aware of this problem before our audit and did not maintain any data on unused tickets . based on limited data provided by the airlines , it is possible that the unused value of the fully and partially unused tickets that dod purchased from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2003 with its cba could be at least $100 million . we found that dod sometimes paid twice for the same airline ticket — first to bank of america for the monthly dod credit card bill , and second to the traveler , who was reimbursed for the same ticket . based on our mining of limited data , the potential magnitude of the improper payments was 27,000 transactions for over $8 million . for example , dod paid a navy gs - 15 civilian employee approximately $10,000 for 13 airline tickets he had not purchased . dts development and implementation have been problematic , especially in the area of requirements and testing key functionality to ensure that the system would perform as intended . given the lack of adherence to such key practices , it is not surprising that critical flaws have been identified after deployment , resulting in significant schedule slippages . in july 2002 , a dod inspector general's report noted that in early 1999 , it was evident that the commercial - off - the - shelf software would require extensive modification in order to meet dod's needs . further , the report pointed out that operational problems continued to arise during the third phase of the system testing in the fall of 2000 . as originally envisioned , the initial deployment of dts was to commence 120 days after the effective date of the contract award in september 1998 , with complete deployment to approximately 11,000 locations by april 2002 . however , that date has been changed to september 2006 — a slippage of over 4 years . figure 2 shows the schedule slippage between the planned and actual implementation of dts . our recent analysis of selected requirements disclosed that the testing of dts is not always adequate prior to updated software being released for use by dod personnel .
