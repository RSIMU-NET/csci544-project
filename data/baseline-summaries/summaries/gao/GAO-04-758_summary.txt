this process has been streamlined . under the 2000 standards , an outlying county can be linked to a central county ( or counties ) if at least 25 percent of employed residents from the outlying county work in the central county ( or counties ) or at least 25 percent of the employment in the outlying county is accounted for by workers residing in the central county ( or counties ) . this differs from the 1990 standards in which there were six scenarios for linking outlying counties to central counties , each of which included differing requirements for measures of settlement structure , such as population density and the percentage of the population that was urban . two of the six scenarios also required a minimum amount of commuting of 15 percent . thus , because the 2000 standards raised that amount to 25 percent and eliminated the other requirements of the 1990 standards , counties that had qualified under one of these two scenarios and had a minimum amount of commuting from 15 to 25 percent would no longer qualify as outlying counties . when omb issued its june 6 , 2003 , newly configured statistical areas using the 2000 standards for the united states , five counties that had been part of metropolitan statistical areas , no longer qualified for this designation . an additional 41 counties that had been a part of metropolitan statistical areas are now components of micropolitan statistical areas . for a list of these counties see appendix iv . the 2000 standards also increased the number of counties , by over 900 , across the country that attained status in statistical areas . ( see figs . using the 1990 standards as of the june 1999 population update , there were 847 counties within metropolitan statistical areas . under the 2000 standards as of the february 2004 new area update , the number of counties within metropolitan statistical areas increased by 243 to 1,090 , and an additional 690 counties were classified as being within micropolitan statistical areas . appendix v provides the status — metropolitan , micropolitan , or not classified — of the counties listed in the february 2004 population update as of 1999 and 2003 . these increases mean that the vast majority of americans live in statistically recognized areas . approximately 83 percent of the nation's population live in metropolitan statistical areas and 10 percent live in micropolitan statistical areas . the 2000 standards resulted in statistical area changes in every state . of the three states we examined , the change was greatest in new mexico where the number of counties in statistical areas increased by approximately 250 percent . state maps highlighting changes in county status from 1999 to 2003 for new mexico , new york , and michigan are in appendix vi . see table 2 for the increase in the number of counties included in statistical areas from 1999 to 2003 for new mexico , new york , and michigan . some federal agencies are required by statute to use metropolitan statistical areas to allocate program funds and implement other aspects of their programs .
