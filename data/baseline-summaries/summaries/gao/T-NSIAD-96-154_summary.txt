some were not met . for example , a dod attempt to develop a less corrosive and labor - intensive decontaminate solution is now not expected to be completed until 2002 . chemical and biological defense training at all levels has been a constant problem for many years . for example , in 1986 , dod studies found that its forces were inadequately trained to conduct critical tasks . it took 6 months during the persian gulf conflict to prepare forces in theater to defend against chemical and biological agents . however , these skills declined again after this conflict . a 1993 army chemical school study found that a combined arms force of infantry , artillery , and support units would have extreme difficulty performing its mission and suffer needless casualties if forced to operate in a chemical or biological environment because the force was only marginally trained . army studies conducted from 1991 to 1995 showed serious weaknesses at all levels in chemical and biological defense skills . our analysis of army readiness evaluations , trend data , and lessons learned reports from this period also showed individuals , units , and commanders alike had problems performing basic tasks critical to surviving and operating in a chemical or biological environment . despite dod efforts — such as doctrinal changes and command directives — designed to improve training in defense against chemical and biological warfare since the persian gulf conflict , u.s. forces continue to experience serious weaknesses in ( 1 ) donning protective masks , ( 2 ) deploying detection equipment , ( 3 ) providing medical care , ( 4 ) planning for the evacuation of casualties , and ( 5 ) including chemical and biological issues in operational plans . the marine corps also continues to experience similar problems . in addition to individual service training problems , the ability of joint forces to operate in a contaminated environment is questionable . in 1995 , only 10 percent of the joint exercises conducted by four major cincs included training to defend against chemical and biological agents . none of this training included all 23 required chemical / biological training tasks , and the majority included less than half of these tasks . furthermore , these cincs plan to include chemical / biological training in only 15 percent of the joint exercises for 1996 . this clearly demonstrates the lack of chemical and biological warfare training at the joint service level . there are two fundamental reasons for this . first , cincs generally consider chemical and biological training and preparedness to be the responsibility of the individual services . second , cincs believe that chemical and biological defense training is a low priority relative to their other needs . we examined the ability of u.s. army medical units that support early - deploying army divisions to treat casualties in a chemically and biologically contaminated environment . we found that these units often lacked needed equipment and training . had iraq actually employed chemical and / or biological agents during the persian gulf conflict , the military's ability to deal with subsequent casualties would have been severely impaired at best .
