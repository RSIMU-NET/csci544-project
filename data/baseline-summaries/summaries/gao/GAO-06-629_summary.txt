transmission costs can be very large . in nevada , a blm official told us that transmission lines there cost over $500,000 per mile . the california energy commission said in a june 2005 report that new transmission lines with interconnections cost between $375,000 and $3.3 million per mile for single circuit lines , depending on their voltage . in the summer of 2005 , ferc denied a request from a utility to pass the costs for transmission lines on to ratepayers . according to utility officials , this reaffirms that developers must pay for the costs since utilities will not voluntarily absorb the costs directly . under current rules , when a developer requests new transmission capacity , the bulk of the costs are assigned to the project that first pushes the transmission system beyond its existing capacity . in addition , federal , state , and industry officials note that small geothermal plants are discouraged from connecting to these large transmission lines because utilities do not want to bother with the small amounts of electricity unless there are many of them in the same area . cumbersome planning and permitting processes have hindered the addition of necessary transmission capacity . in a july 2005 report , a consultant for the edison electric institute noted that nationally the task of getting a transmission project planned , approved , permitted , and financed remained daunting . the authors stated that the investment climate for transmission remained fragmented by different procedures , incentives , and constraints from one region of the country to another . the california energy commission noted in a november 2005 report that the state's inefficient transmission planning and permitting processes were contributing to worsening the state's transmission problems . addressing the same issue , an official of a large california utility told us that obtaining agreement on where to construct transmission lines , addressing environmental issues , obtaining approvals , and a “not in my backyard” philosophy , contributed to the uncertainty and long lead times in building additional transmission capacity . in addition , a geothermal developer complained about extensive hearings and an inability to determine jurisdictions between the state and the federal government and between agencies within california . geothermal developers state that the process for approving leases and issuing permits to drill wells and construct power plants has become excessively bureaucratic . blm and forest service officials often have to amend or rewrite resource or forest management plans , which can add up to 3 years to the approval process , depending upon the complexity of the proposal and when the last plan was written . delays in finalizing resource and forest management plans and in conducting environmental reviews have resulted in a backlog of 31 lease applications in california , with an average age of 7.4 years , and 136 lease applications in nevada , with an average age of about 2 years . despite the high backlog in nevada , blm officials noted that they processed 177 lease applications from january 2001 through june 2005 . in contrast , during the same period , blm did not process any lease applications in california .
