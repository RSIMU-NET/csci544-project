postal service . we selected 10 of the 12 agencies because they represented the five leading agencies and five lagging agencies identified in a june 2000 gsa transition progress report . we subsequently identified through program management documents two additional agencies that could provide us with greater insight into the billing issues that were impeding transition progress . we also interviewed officials from an fts 2000 service provider , at&t , and a local exchange carrier , verizon , to determine their roles in the transition process and to identify impediments they may have encountered while working with agencies and fts2001 contractors to transfer telecommunications services to fts2001 . to evaluate the potential effect of transition delay on program goals , we reviewed program strategy documentation , fts2001 contracts , and reports and documentation including weekly gsa transition status reports , minutes of monthly imc and imc transition task force meetings , presentations from monthly imc transition task force meetings , and minutes of gsa bi - weekly management sessions with the fts2001 contractors . further , we reviewed government fts 2000 and fts2001 billing reports current through the month of december 2000 ( the last month for which billing information was available ) and revised fts2001 contractor transition completion estimates . we also reviewed a september 2000 revenue analysis prepared for gsa by mitretek systems that considered the potential effect of transition delays and changes in revenue projections — positive and negative — on minimum revenue guarantees based on transition progress up to that date . we obtained documentation and reviewed the terms and conditions of fts 2000 extension contract modifications that were made in december 2000 and interviewed gsa fts2001 contracting staff to understand the implications of those modifications on fts2001 minimum revenue guarantees . we performed our audit work from july 2000 through february 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . the first copy of each gao report is free . additional copies of reports are $2 each . a check or money order should be made out to the superintendent of documents . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . orders by mail: u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 orders by visiting: room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders by phone: ( 202 ) 512-6000 fax: ( 202 ) 512-6061 tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . a few examples illustrate these losses . the internal revenue service , in order to minimize risk , has delayed transitioning its toll - free 800 number services until it completes its systems modernization . nasa decided that it would be more efficient to acquire its data communications services through the agency's information technology support contract . ( the agency is , however , transitioning its switched voice service to fts2001. ) postal service , believing it could obtain better prices outside fts2001 , has awarded its own contract to meet most of its service needs .
