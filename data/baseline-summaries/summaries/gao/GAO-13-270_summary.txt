submitted when due . in fact , the corrosion office has not adopted methods to enhance tracking , such as recording the reasons for missed reporting deadlines , new reporting deadlines , and the submission dates for follow - on reports . further , although the corrosion office encourages project managers to complete outstanding reports , it has not exercised its existing oversight and coordination authorities to identify and implement possible options or incentives for addressing the various funding , personnel , or other reasons cited by project management offices for not meeting reporting milestones . also , dod's strategic plan and other guidance do not clearly define a role for the military departments' corrosion control and prevention executives ( corrosion executives ) , who could assist the corrosion office , in holding the military departments' project management offices accountable for submitting infrastructure - related reports in accordance with dod's strategic plan . without effective actions to ensure timely submission of reports , decision makers may be unaware of potentially useful technologies to address corrosion . moreover , the corrosion office is not always updating its records to ensure accurate information is maintained on reassessed return - on - investment estimates for infrastructure - related corrosion projects . without accurate return - on - investment estimates for corrosion projects , congress and dod corrosion - control managers may not have sufficient information about returns on investment for their oversight of completed projects . finally , slightly more than half of the installation officials ( 16 of 31 officials ) whom we interviewed were unaware of dod's corrosion office , their respective corrosion executive , or the training , information , and other resources available through the related offices . without a targeted communication strategy and accompanying action plan , the military departments' corrosion executives cannot ensure that managers of facilities and other infrastructure will have access to all information and resources available for dealing with corrosion and are aware of the most effective and efficient methods for corrosion control . we are making five recommendations to improve dod's corrosion prevention and control program: to improve accountability for reporting the results of corrosion - control demonstration projects affecting dod infrastructure , we recommend that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics direct the director of the office of corrosion policy and oversight to take steps to enhance reporting and project tracking , such as noting the reasons why project management offices missed a reporting deadline and including any revised reporting deadlines for final and follow - on reports . to improve the military departments' submission of completed reports for infrastructure - related corrosion - control demonstration projects at prescribed milestones , we recommend that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics direct the director of the office of corrosion policy and oversight to use the office's existing authority to identify and implement possible options or incentives for addressing the various funding , personnel , and other reasons cited by project management offices for not meeting reporting milestones .
