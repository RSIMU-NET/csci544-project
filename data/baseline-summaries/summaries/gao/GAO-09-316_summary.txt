raba . established in the transportation equity act for the 21st century ( tea - 21 ) in 1998 and modified in safetea - lu , raba was designed to align highway account program levels with actual revenues and help assure that the account is used to fund highway programs instead of accumulating large balances . raba provisions require dot , as part of the annual budget submission process , to compare current revenue estimates with revenue estimates in the multiyear authorization act , most recently safetea - lu . based on these comparisons , dot is required to adjust both contract authority and obligation limitations either upward , when the account has greater revenues than projected , or downward , when revenues do not meet projected levels . however , under safetea - lu , no downward adjustments will be made in a fiscal year if , as of october 1 of that fiscal year , the balance in the highway account is more that $6 billion . safetea - lu also modified how the raba adjustments were calculated in order to smooth out the effects of the adjustment over 2 fiscal years . despite these mechanisms , highway account revenues were insufficient to cover outlays , and the balance of the highway account has declined from fiscal year 2000 to 2008 . as shown in figure 4 , the account approached a zero balance near the end of fiscal year 2008 ; legislation on september 15 , 2008 — to provide $8 billion to replenish the account — and the final receipts deposit of about $2 billion for fiscal year 2008 on october 8 , 2008 resulted in a final fiscal year 2008 balance of about $10 billion . safetea - lu authorization levels , combined with lower than anticipated receipts , caused the highway account balance to decline over the authorization period . although dot has reported since february 2006 that the highway account balance would be depleted in fiscal year 2009 and recommended several actions to offset the decline , dot officials acknowledge that communication with stakeholders on the status of the highway account could be improved and are developing a plan to improve communication . estimated outlays from highway account programs under safetea - lu exceeded estimated receipts throughout the authorization period by about $10.4 billion . while estimated outlays for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 totaled $182 billion ( ranging from $31.3 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $40.7 billion in fiscal year 2009 ) , estimated receipts totaled $171.6 billion ( ranging from $31.6 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $36.2 billion in fiscal year 2009 ) . based on the estimated outlays and receipts included in safetea - lu , the highway account balance would be drawn down from $10.8 billion to about $0.4 billion over the authorization period , providing more federal funding for highway projects . this left little room for error . assuming all outlays were spent , a revenue shortfall of even 1 percent below what safetea - lu had predicted over the 5-year period would result in a cash shortfall in the account balance . given the inherent uncertainty associated with estimating receipts and outlays over multiple years , a cash shortfall was always a real possibility .
