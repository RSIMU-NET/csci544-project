( app . iii illustrates the major results and key assumptions of the three estimates. ) cbo's cost estimate is significantly higher than dod's for the following reasons: dod assumed reinforcements of 4 divisions and 6 wings , whereas cbo assumed a force of 11-2 / 3 divisions and 11-1 / 2 wings and a much larger infrastructure for this force in the new member states . cbo's modernization costs are much higher than dod's and include the purchase of 350 new aircraft and 1,150 new tanks for the new member states . new members' force goals set . nato decides whether or how much to increase the common budgets , which would then be shared among current and new members . target date for new member accession into nato . $27-$35 in constant 1997 dollars $61-$125 in constant 1997 dollars ( $109 for a defense strategy similar to dod's ) $10-$110 in constant 1996 dollars ( $42 for a defense strategy similar to dod's ) a small group ( details classified ) the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . each option built on the pervious one in scope and cost . cbo estimated that the cost of the five options over the 15-year period would range from $61 billion to $125 billion . of that total , cbo estimated that the united states might be expected to pay between $5 billion and $19 billion . cbo included in its range of options a $109-billion estimate that was predicated on a resurgent russian threat , although it was based on a self - defense and reinforcement strategy similar to that used by dod . of this $109 billion , cbo estimated that the united states would pay $13 billion . similarly , rand developed estimates for four options to defend an enlarged nato that build upon one another , from only self - defense support at a cost of $10 billion to $20 billion to the forward deployment of forces in new member states at a cost of $55 billion to $110 billion . these options include a middle option that would cost about $42 billion that was also based on a self - defense and reinforcement strategy . each nation typically has over 100 force goals . nato and national officials frequently consult one another while developing force goals and national defense plans . nato commanders are unlikely to demand that member nations establish units or acquire equipment they do not have .
