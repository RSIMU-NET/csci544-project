there are two primary reasons . first , supply support to the warfighter affects readiness and military operations . in fact , the supply chain can be the critical link in determining whether our front - line military forces win or lose on the battlefield . why is effective supply chain management important for dod ? second , given the high demand for goods and services to support ongoing u.s. military operations , the investment of resources in the supply chain is substantial . for example , dod estimated that the annual costs of supplies and associated operations were expected to be about $50 billion for fiscal year 2005 . in addition , dod's inventory was valued at approximately $80 billion at the end of that fiscal year . over the next 6 years , dod also plans to invest about $54 billion in aircraft , trucks , ships , and other mobility assets to deploy and supply its forces . in addition , the secretary of defense recently stated that one of his top priorities between 2006 and 2008 is improving effectiveness and efficiency across the department , including creating a culture of efficiency and eliminating waste . these are issues that we have identified as critical to improving supply chain management . because of weaknesses we have identified through our work , dod's supply chain management is on our list of 26 high - risk government programs that need urgent attention and transformation to ensure that our national government functions in the most economical , efficient , and effective manner possible . last year , with the encouragement of the office of management and budget ( omb ) , dod developed a supply chain management improvement plan aimed at putting dod on a path toward resolving long - term supply chain problems and , eventually , removal from our list of high - risk programs . more specifically , with the plan's inception in july 2005 , dod hoped to produce significant improvements over the next 2 years . this month marks approximately the midpoint of that 2-year period , which ends in july 2007 . the plan encompasses 10 initiatives to address three key areas of the supply chain management process: requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution . ( attachment 1 provides a description of the initiatives and shows the focus area or areas that they are intended to address ) . the requirements forecasting initiatives in the plan aim to improve inventory management by reducing low - usage inventory , increasing the availability of high - usage and critical inventory , more accurately identifying war reserve stocks , forecasting wartime demand , and identifying items with long procurement lead times . the plan's initiatives that affect asset visibility seek to improve dod's ability to provide timely and accurate information regarding the location , quantity , condition , movement , and status of materiel assets across the department . finally , the materiel distribution initiatives were included to improve the timely and seamless flow of materiel in support of deployed forces . we have frequently identified systemic weaknesses in these three areas as impeding effective supply chain management .
