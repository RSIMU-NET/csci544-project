divest the federal hydropower assets . the federal power program uses low - cost hydropower generated at major federal water projects to help meet the needs of the preference customers , many of which are located in rural areas . the power plants at these water projects are generally operated by the bureau and the corps — the operating agencies — and the power that exceeded the project's operational requirements is marketed by the pmas , as described in chapter 1 . power is generated and marketed in a way that balances how the water is being used for the other purposes of the projects . funding for the activities of the operating agencies and the three pmas is subject to the annual congressional appropriation process under which the agencies obtain their funding for capital investments as well as for operations and maintenance expenses . pma and operating agency officials and representatives of the pmas' customer associations have indicated a need to change how the federal hydropower program is being operated . they stated that the agencies' planning and budgeting processes do not provide sufficient , predictable , and timely funding to facilitate the repair of the federal power plants . in addition , they pointed to various administrative and legal requirements that they believe cause the pmas and operating agencies to generate and market power in an unbusinesslike manner . in this connection , they have advocated ways to manage the federal hydropower assets , discussed in the next section , that will address these concerns . some representatives of the pmas' preference customers have advocated defederalizing the pmas and the federal generating assets as a way of improving their operating efficiency and availability . for example , according to an official of an association of western's municipal power customers , the preference customers should purchase the federal generating and transmission assets of the colorado river storage project in order to avoid the sharp rate increases that characterized western's rates from the project since the late 1980s . it is important to note , however , that other preference customers continue to support continued federal ownership of the dams , reservoirs , and hydropower assets . these customers believe that , although some changes in the pmas' current practices could lower operating costs and improve efficiencies , as a whole the pmas have offered high - quality , low - cost services while balancing the diverse needs of the beneficiaries of the federal multi - use projects . moreover , representatives of investor - owned utilities or proponents of divestiture have questioned why the federal government continues to provide power in restructuring markets . first , electrifying rural areas was an important goal of the federal power program ; however , this goal has been largely satisfied . therefore , the need for the federal government's involvement is questionable . second , competition likely would enable wholesale and retail customers to choose from among competing power suppliers . this possibility again questions the need for the federal government to sell power . third , the issue of providing low - cost pma power to portions of 34 states in the south and west where the preference customers of the pmas are located , but not to other areas , is debatable .
