this concludes our testimony . we are pleased to answer any questions you might have . for further information on this testimony , please contact mark goldstein at 202-512-2834 or by email at goldsteinm@gao.gov . individuals making key contributions to this testimony include daniel cain , tammy conquest , colin fallon , katie hamer , daniel hoy , and susan michal - smith . this is a work of the u.s. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states . the measures have been eliminated in fiscal year 2008 . in addition , according to fps , these measures will not be necessary in fiscal year 2009 because the basic security fee was increased and staffing has decreased . fps's primary means of funding its operations is the fee it charges tenant agencies for basic security services , as shown in figure 4 . some of the basic security services covered by this fee include law enforcement activities at gsa facilities , preliminary investigations , the capture and detention of suspects , and bsas , among other services . the basic security fee does not include contract guard services . however , this fee does not fully account for the risk faced by particular buildings or the varying levels of basic security services provided , and does not reflect the actual cost of providing services . the fbi did not realize it was missing until three days later . only after the fbi started making inquiries did the guards report the theft to fps and the fbi . during another incident , fps officials reported contract guards — who were armed — taking no action as a shirtless suspect wearing handcuffs on one arm ran through the lobby of a major federal building while being chased by an fps inspector . in addition , one official reported that during an off - hours alarm call to a federal building , the official arrived to find the front guard post empty while the guard's loaded firearm was left unattended in the unlocked post . we also personally witnessed an incident in which an individual attempted to enter a level iv facility with illegal weapons . according to fps policies , contract guards are required to confiscate illegal weapons , detain and question the individual , and to notify fps . in this instance , the weapons were not confiscated , the individual was not detained or questioned , fps was not notified , and the individual was allowed to leave with the weapons . we will shortly begin a comprehensive review of fps's contract guard program for this subcommittee and other congressional committees . building security assessments , which are completed by both inspectors and physical security specialists , are the core component of fps's physical security mission . however , ensuring the quality and timeliness of them is an area in which fps continues to face challenges . the majority of inspectors in the seven regions we visited stated that they are not provided sufficient time to complete bsas .
