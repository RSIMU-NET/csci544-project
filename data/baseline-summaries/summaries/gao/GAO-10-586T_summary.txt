therefore , ssa will need to do more to compensate for such declines . the table also shows the changes in recent staffing . according to ssa officials , ssa plans to maintain field office staffing levels in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 by providing for a 1:1 replacement rate for staff who leave the agency . ssa is planning to use its fiscal year 2010 and 2011 funding to increase staffing in state dds offices and ssa hearing offices to reduce disability backlogs ; the commissioner has identified reducing the appeals hearing backlog for disability cases as the agency's top priority . the demand for field office service and claims workloads has grown to record levels . comparing fiscal years 2006 and 2009 , visitor volume increased by about 3.2 million customers , from 41.9 million to 45.1 million . if the visitor volume during the second half of fiscal year 2010 is the same as the volume during the first half , the volume will again be 45.1 million by the end of the fiscal year . also , from fiscal year 2005 through 2009 , ssa processed a growing number of oasi , disability , and ssi claims ( nonmedical determinations only ) , which ssa attributes to the onset of the baby boom generation's retirements and the economic downturn ( see fig . even with the increases in field office staffing in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 , and some increases in average productivity by employees , many field office managers , responding to a survey conducted in february 2010 by the national council of social security management association , inc. ( ncssma ) , stated that staffing levels are inadequate to deal with the growing public service challenges they face daily in field offices . in this survey , over 95 percent of the managers said that they need to hire at least one more employee to provide adequate public service , 89.2 percent said they need at least two more employees , and 71.2 percent said that they need at least three more employees . ssa continues to use various strategies to manage work in field offices , such as shifting work among field offices , based on their workloads , encouraging customers to make greater use of automated services , and deferring certain field office work . for example , if an office has work demands that it cannot immediately cover , that office can request that some work be transferred to another office . ssa is also encouraging customers to use automated services . ssa reported that in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 , respectively , the public performed 4.0 million and 6.1 million electronic transactions . ssa reported that electronic filings for retirement benefits grew from approximately 407,000 to 833,000 from fiscal year 2008 to 2009 , respectively ; this represented 18.9 percent and 32.2 percent of the total retirement applications filed in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 . as result , ssa is making progress toward achieving the goal it set in its fiscal year 2008 agency strategic plan to achieve an online filing rate of 50 percent of retirement applications by 2012 .
