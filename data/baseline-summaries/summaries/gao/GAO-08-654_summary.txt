an amount paid out from an ira . ( see app . i for further discussion of our scope and methodology. ) we conducted this performance audit from march 2008 through august 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . according to irs's statistics of income ( soi ) research , of about 51 million taxpayers who owned iras as of 2004 , nearly 41 million owned traditional iras compared to more than 13 million taxpayers who owned roth iras , as shown in figure 1 . of the $3.3 trillion held in iras as of 2004 , traditional iras accounted for almost $3 trillion . traditional iras have grown not only from contributions but also from rollovers from employer pension plans . first introduced in 1998 , roth iras totaled $140 billion as of 2004 . while roth iras and employer - based simple and sep iras constitute a small share of ira assets , the number of taxpayers who own roth iras surpasses the number of those owning employer - based iras , as shown in figure 1 . ira assets surpass assets held in either employer - sponsored defined benefit or defined contribution plans . according to irs's soi analysis , about 5.3 million taxpayers contributed about $12.6 billion to traditional iras for tax year 2004 , and deductible contributions accounted for over three - quarters of that amount . also , about 6.7 million taxpayers contributed more than $14.7 billion to roth iras for tax year 2004 . traditional ira contributions averaged $2,381 and roth ira contributions averaged $2,211 for tax year 2004 . in addition to contributions , more than 3.6 million taxpayers rolled over about $215 billion into traditional iras from employer plans in 2004 , according to irs's soi analysis . taxpayers contributing to roth iras are younger on average than traditional ira owners , as illustrated in figure 2 . on the basis of irs's soi analysis for tax year 2004 , more taxpayers under age 55 contributed to a roth ira than to a traditional ira , while the reverse is true for taxpayers ages 55 and over . taxpayers over age 70 may contribute to roth iras , but contributions to traditional iras are not allowed after age 70½ . even with the sheer numbers of taxpayers owning iras , most taxpayers eligible for iras do not take advantage of the opportunity to save for retirement on a tax - preferred basis . according to irs soi estimates , only 10 percent of those eligible contributed in 2004 . according to irs's soi analysis , about 12.3 million taxpayers withdrew $140 billion — traditional ira withdrawals accounted for more than 95 percent — during tax year 2004 . based on soi estimates for tax year 2004 , about 54 percent of taxpayers with ira withdrawals were age 70 and older , withdrawing about $55 billion during 2004 .
