security plans ) . ● multiple igs indicated in the scope and methodology sections of their reports that their reviews were focused on selected components , whereas others did not make any reference to the breadth of their review . ● several reports were solely comprised of a summary of relevant information security audits conducted during the fiscal year , while others included additional evaluation that addressed specific fisma - required elements , such as risk assessments and remedial actions . ● the percentage of systems reviewed varied ; 22 of 24 igs tested the information security program effectiveness on a subset of systems ; two igs did not review any systems . ● one ig noted that the agency's inventory was missing certain web applications and concluded that the agency's inventory was only 0-50 percent complete , although it also noted that , due to time constraints , it was unable to determine whether other items were missing . ● two igs indicated basing a portion of their template submission solely on information provided to them by the agency , without conducting further investigation . ● some reviews were limited due to difficulties in verifying information provided to them by agencies . specifically , certain igs stated that they were unable to conduct evaluations of their respective agency's inventory because the information provided to them by the agency at that time was insufficient ( i.e . incomplete or unavailable ) . the lack of a common methodology , or framework , has culminated in disparities in audit scope , methodology , and content . however , igs sometimes disagreed with the agency's reported information and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these and other security program activities . further , opportunities exist to enhance reporting under fisma and the independent evaluations completed by igs . mr. chairman , this concludes my statement . i am happy to answer any questions at this time . if you have any questions regarding this report , please contact me at ( 202 ) 512-6244 or wilshuseng@gao.gov . other key contributors to this report include jeffrey knott ( assistant director ) , larry crosland , nancy glover , min hyun , and jayne wilson . this is a work of the u.s. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states . it may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao . however , because this work may contain copyrighted images or other material , permission from the copyright holder may be necessary if you wish to reproduce this material separately . we also found that some deficiencies had not been corrected in a timely manner . as a result , agencies do not have reasonable assurance that controls are implemented correctly , operating as intended , or producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements of the agency , and responsibilities may be unclear , misunderstood , and improperly implemented . furthermore , agencies may not be fully aware of the security control weaknesses in their systems , thereby leaving their information and systems vulnerable to attack or compromise .
