gao - 08-1010r . washington , d.c.: august 13 , 2008 . dod disagrees with our position . ( see app . ii for a listing of those brac recommendations dod expects to cost the most. ) while estimated implementation costs have risen , overall estimated net annual recurring savings have decreased slightly by about $13 million to about $4 billion based on dod's approach to include savings from military personnel who transferred or shifted from one location to another but remained on the payroll . in september 2005 , the brac commission originally estimated annual recurring savings to be about $4.2 billion . this amount included the savings associated with military personnel eliminations . some recommendation savings estimates have decreased while others have increased , but the cumulative effect is an overall decrease in estimated annual recurring savings . for example , the largest decrease in net annual recurring savings was about $84 million for the recommendation to establish joint bases , which decreased from about $116 million in savings in the fiscal year 2008 budget submission to $32 million in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission . discussions with agency officials involved with implementing this recommendation indicate that the savings could decrease further in the future . in contrast , the largest increase in net annual recurring savings was about $58 million for the recommendation to establish the san antonio regional medical center and realigning enlisted medical training to fort sam houston , texas , which increased from about $91 million in savings in the fiscal year 2008 budget submission to $149 million in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission . osd brac officials told us they expect 2012 to be the first year to accrue the full amount of net annual recurring savings because some recommendations are not expected to be completed until around the september 15 , 2011 , deadline and significant savings generally do not begin to accrue until implementation is complete . given the cumulative increase in estimated one - time costs and decrease in estimated net annual recurring savings , the estimated savings over a 20-year period ending in 2025 , based on dod's fiscal year 2009 budget submission , has also decreased . our calculations show that the 20-year savings declined almost 9 percent by $1.3 billion to about $13.7 billion , compared to $15 billion that we estimated based on the fiscal year 2008 budget . in september 2005 , the brac commission estimated that dod would save about $36 billion over this 20-year period â€” the current estimate is a reduction of about 62 percent from the brac commission's reported estimates . further , we determined that 30 recommendations ( about 16 percent of all 2005 brac recommendations ) account for about 85 percent of the expected savings over a 20-year period . ( see app . iv for a listing of those brac recommendations dod expects to save the most over a 20-year period. ) the decrease in 20-year savings is directly related to the growth in estimated one - time cost and to the reduction in estimated annual recurring savings . as with annual recurring savings , the 20-year savings estimate of about $13.7 billion includes the savings associated with the elimination of military personnel .
