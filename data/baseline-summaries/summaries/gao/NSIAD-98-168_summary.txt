table ii . 1: central training funding by training and appropriation category for 1998 ( constant 1998 dollars in millions ) . in 1998 , the army programmed approximately $7.3 billion for central training programs and activities . most of these programs and activities are managed by the u.s. army training and doctrine command and are conducted at army schools . the following provides a detailed description of the army's funding trends for the training categories . funding for the professional and skill training category was projected to fluctuate between 1992 and 1999 , with declines from 1992-94 and 1997-2001 but increases from 1994-97 ( see fig . from 1999 through 2003 , funds are projected to stabilize at about $2.6 billion . funds follow workload closely except for the 1994-96 period when workload continued to decline and funding increased . during this period , the army transferred fort ord , california , from u.s. army forces command to the army's training and doctrine command . figure iii.1: funding and workload for the army's professional and skill training programs for 1992-2003 ( constant 1998 dollars in billions ) funds for the training of new personnel category fluctuated between 1992 and 1999 , with declines from 1992-95 and 1997-99 but increases from 1995-97 . from 1999 through 2003 , funds are projected to stabilize at about $1.4 billion . funds appear to follow workload closely , as shown in figure iii.2 . figure iii.2: funding and workload for the army's training of new personnel programs for 1992-2003 ( constant 1998 dollars in billions ) according to army training officials , the jump in funding for these two categories after 1995 and 1996 was the result of increased accessions to fill a void left from 1992 to 1995 when the army held accession rates below what was required to maintain a level end strength . the lower accession rate allowed the army's end strength to decline to 495,000 . the army later increased accession rates to maintain a level end strength , which raised the workload for training of new personnel and professional and skill training . from 1992 to 2003 , installation support funding was projected to decline by about $634.9 million ( 31.2 percent ) , as shown in figure iii.3 . funding for this category declined $432.8 million ( 21.3 percent ) between 1992 and 1993 . for the 1994-2003 period , annual funding was planned to fluctuate slightly between $1.6 and $1.4 billion . army training officials stated that the reduction was due to savings resulting from efficiency efforts such as outsourcing / privatizing installation support functions and upgrading installation utilities such as central heating plants . figure iii.3: funding for the army's installation support for training for 1992-2003 ( constant 1998 dollars in billions ) annual funding for the aviation and flight training category decreased from $620.1 million in 1992 to $461.5 million in 1998 , but then increases by about $163 million ( 35 percent ) through 2002 , as shown in figure iii.4 . the projected increase is in the procurement accounts .
