gao - 05-429 . washington d.c.: august 5 , 2005 . ( see fig . in fiscal year 2005 , 77 percent of nursing home care expenditures were accounted for by va - operated nursing homes , compared to 73 percent in 2003 . from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2005 , the percentage of overall expenditures for state veterans' nursing homes and community nursing homes declined . the percentage of overall expenditures for state veterans' nursing homes declined during this period because expenditures in va - operated nursing homes increased more rapidly than expenditures for state veterans' nursing homes . then va can begin to generate the information it needs for planning . this may include , for example , how many nursing homes are needed in each setting and where they should be located . va is working on these challenges and has developed a draft long - term care strategic plan . completing the long - term care strategic plan could help va determine how to maximize the use of resources for meeting nursing home needs of veterans across the country in each of the three nursing home settings . va has not given a timeline for completion of the long - term care strategic plan . in may 2004 , the secretary of veterans affairs acknowledged that a strategic plan would be necessary to help achieve va's goals , including ensuring that veterans have access to an appropriate range of services . mr. chairman , this concludes my prepared remarks . i will be pleased to answer any questions you or other members of the committee may have . for further information , please contact laurie e. ekstrand at ( 202 ) 512- 7101 or ekstrandl@gao.gov . individuals making key contributions to this testimony include james c. musselwhite , assistant director , roseanne price , and thomas a. walke . va health care: key challenges to aligning capital assets and enhancing veterans' care . va long - term care: oversight of nursing home program impeded by data gaps . gao - 05-65 . washington , d.c.: november 10 , 2004 . va long - term care: more accurate measure of home - based primary care workload is needed . gao - 04-913 . washington , d.c.: september 8 , 2004 . va long - term care: changes in service delivery raise important questions . gao - 04-425t . washington , d.c.: january 28 , 2004 . va long - term care: veterans' access to noninstitutional care is limited by service gaps and facility restrictions . gao - 03-815t . washington , d.c.: may 22 , 2003 . va long - term care: service gaps and facility restrictions limit veterans' access to noninstitutional care . gao - 03-487 . washington , d.c.: may 9 , 2003 . department of veterans affairs: key management challenges in health and disability programs . gao - 03-756t . washington , d.c.: may 8 , 2003 . va long - term care: the availability of noninstitutional services is uneven . gao - 02-652t . washington , d.c.: april 25 , 2002 . va long - term care: implementation of certain millennium act provisions is incomplete , and availability of noninstitutional services is uneven . gao - 02-510r .
