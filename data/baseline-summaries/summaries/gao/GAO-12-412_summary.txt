we disagree . the current memorandum of understanding does not expressly call for tracking recommendations , which we believe is an important coordination activity . as we note in our report , the memorandum of understanding does refer to dod guidelines for tracking recommendations , but these have not been updated in 17 years . moreover , these guidelines are not being followed , as our report shows and dod officials acknowledged . these guidelines called for regular updates and an annual report on the status of recommendations and public health actions at each site . on the other hand , the agency for toxic substances and disease registry officials told us that updating the memorandum of understanding with dod , to address tracking recommendations would be useful . given that dod is not following the tracking procedures in its existing guidelines and overlooking the status of 80 percent of the recommendations , we believe that the memorandum of understanding should be revised to expressly address tracking responsibilities to help ensure that identified public health risks are addressed . dod did not concur with our second recommendation – – to establish a policy that identifies when installations should consider requesting public health assessments in addition to the initial assessments at national priorities list sites . dod stated that its agrees that there should be policies in place to guide decisions on soliciting public health assessments , but believes the appropriate policies and responsibilities are already in place . we disagree with dod for several reasons: first , dod states that additional public health assessments conducted by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry would duplicate the risk assessments conducted by dod and others , which it believes are more comprehensive . we believe dod's comments overlook the important distinctions between the two assessments . risk assessments are intended to enable the selection of cleanup remedies to reduce or eliminate current and future exposures , but these risk assessments generally do not include epidemiology or assessments of health risk to populations from current , future , and past exposures , as the public health assessments do – – a fact which dod officials acknowledged . thus , these assessments have distinct purposes and scopes . second , dod states that supplementary policy for additional public health assessments for dod cleanup sites is not needed , but did not elaborate on the reasons why . in the course of conducting a dod cleanup program , installations may become aware of past exposures – – such as at tyndall air force base or camp lejeune – – years after an initial health assessment was developed . in fact , site characterization and restoration activities may take many years , and new health risks may be discovered during this process . however , without this guidance , it is unclear when it is appropriate to request a new health assessment . third , dod states that its current policies require the assessment of health risks to servicemembers and their dependents living on its installations ; however , until dod's february 2012 revised directive , it was unclear when and if health surveillance data were collected for servicemembers' dependents .
