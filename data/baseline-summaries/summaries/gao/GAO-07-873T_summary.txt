( see fig . the premium growth rates for the 10 largest fehbp plans by enrollment — accounting for about three - quarters of total fehbp enrollment — ranged from 0 percent to 15.5 percent for 2007 . premium growth rates across the smaller fehbp plans varied more widely . regarding enrollee premiums — the share of total premiums paid by enrollees — the growth in average enrollee premiums generally paralleled total premium growth from 1994 through 2007 . in 2006 , average monthly fehbp premiums were $415 for individual plans and $942 for family plans in total . the enrollee premium contributions were $123 for individual plans and $278 for family plans . projected increases in the cost and utilization of services and in the cost of prescription drugs accounted for most of the average annual premium growth across fehbp plans for the period from 2000 through 2007 , although projected withdrawals from reserves offset much of this growth for 2006 and 2007 . absent projected changes associated with other factors , projected increases in the cost and utilization of services and the cost of prescription drugs would have accounted for a 9 percent increase in average premiums for 2007 . projected increases in the cost of and utilization of services alone would have accounted for about a 6 percent increase premiums for 2007 , down from a peak of about 10 percent for 2002 . projected increases in the cost of prescription drugs alone would have accounted for about a 3 percent increase in premiums for 2007 , down from a peak of about 5 percent for 2002 . enrollee demographics — particularly the aging of the enrollee population — were projected to have less of an effect on premium growth . projected decreases in the costs associated with certain other factors , including benefit changes that resulted in less generous coverage and enrollee choice of plans — typically the migration to lower - cost plans — generally helped offset average premium growth for 2000 through 2007 to a small extent . projected withdrawals from reserves offset average premium growth for 2006 and 2007 . officials we interviewed from most of the plans stated that opm monitored their plans' reserve levels and worked closely with them to build up or draw down reserve funds gradually to avoid wide fluctuations in premium growth from year to year . projected additions to reserves nominally contributed to average premium growth — by less than 1 percentage point — for 2000 through 2005 . however , projected withdrawals from reserves offset average premium growth by about 2 percentage points for 2006 and 5 percentage points for 2007 . ( see fig . we also reviewed detailed data available for five large fehbp plans on claims actually incurred from 2003 through 2005 . these data showed that most of the increase in total expenditures per enrollee was explained by expenditures on prescription drugs ( 34 percent ) and on hospital outpatient services ( 26 percent ) . officials we interviewed from several fehbp plans stated that the retiree drug subsidy would have had a small effect on premium growth had opm applied for the subsidy and used it to offset premiums .
