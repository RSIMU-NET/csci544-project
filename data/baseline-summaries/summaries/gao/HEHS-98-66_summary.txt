ii ) . the prudential insurance company of america , which underwrote the policies sold through the american association of retired persons ( aarp ) , was the largest supplier of medigap insurance with 23 percent of the market . the average medigap loss ratio for all policies was about the same in 1995 ( 86 percent ) as it was in 1988 ( 84 percent ) , but average loss ratios exhibited considerable variation , increasing in some years and decreasing in others . for example , average loss ratios increased in 1990 and 1991 followed by 2 years of declining ratios and then 2 years of increases . most of the policies with earned premiums of $1 million or more did not have to pay refunds because , although their loss ratios in 1994 or 1995 were below standards , their cumulative loss ratio since inception was greater than the benchmark ratio for the year in question . the benchmark ratios were designed with certain assumptions about policy lapse rates and other factors to ensure that the cumulative loss ratio over 15 years was at least equal to the federal loss ratio standards . because benefit payments are generally low in the first years when policyholders are younger and healthier and increase as they age , benchmark ratios are significantly below the loss ratio standards at first and gradually increase over the years . because all of the policies subject to the refund provision in 1994 and 1995 were issued within the last 3 or 4 years , they had benchmark ratios below loss ratio standards . in fact , in 1994 and 1995 , the highest benchmark ratio for any policy was 58 percent ; about 9 out of 10 policies had benchmark ratios under 50 percent . millions of medicare beneficiaries purchased medigap policies , spending over $12 billion in 1995 . federal loss ratio standards and refund requirements are the main means of ensuring that medigap policyholders receive value for their premium dollars . medigap policies representing most of the premium dollars had loss ratios in 1994 and 1995 that were higher than federal law requires . most policies with loss ratios below standards in 1994 and 1995 were not considered credible and , thus , were not subject to the refund provision . the amount of premiums paid for policies with loss ratios below standards has declined substantially from 1993 , the last year before the refund provision became effective . the primary reason for requiring refunds and credits is to give insurers incentives to meet loss ratio standards and thereby avoid possibly unfavorable public relations consequences . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . the relatively low amount of premiums for policies with loss ratios below the standards indicates that the incentive is working . in commenting on a draft of this report , naic officials offered some technical suggestions , which we incorporated where appropriate . we are sending copies of this report to the governor of each state , naic , and interested congressional committees . we will make copies available to others on request .
