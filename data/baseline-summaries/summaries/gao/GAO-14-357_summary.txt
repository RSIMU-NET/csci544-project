checkpoint drills . in accordance with tsa's ied checkpoint drill operational directive , tsa requires personnel at airports to conduct drills to assess tso compliance with tsa's screening sops and to train tsos to better resolve anomalies identified by ait - atr systems . tsa conducts those drills at airports using test kits that contain inert bombs , bomb parts , and other threat items . according to tsa officials , ied checkpoint drills assess so adherence to tsa's sops and are not intended to test ait - atr system capabilities . tsa uses a multilayered security strategy aimed to enhance aviation security . to what extent does tsa collect and analyze available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of the ait - atr system ? to what extent has tsa made progress toward enhancing ait capabilities to detect concealed explosives and other threat items , and what challenges , if any , remain ? to determine the extent to which tsa collects and analyzes available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of the entire ait - atr system , we analyzed improvised explosive device ( ied ) checkpoint drills conducted by tsa personnel at airports that submitted data to tsa from march 1 , 2011 , through february 28 , 2013 , under tsa's ied checkpoint drill operational directive . tsa's ied checkpoint drill operational directive requires personnel at airports to conduct drills to assess tso compliance with tsa's screening standard operating procedures ( sop ) and to train tsos to better resolve anomalies identified by ait - atr systems . among other things , we evaluated airport compliance with tsa's operational directive and standards for internal control in the federal government to determine the extent to which tsa is monitoring compliance with its directive . further , we analyzed laboratory test results of the ait - atr system and the ait - io system from calendar years 2009 through 2012 conducted by the transportation security laboratory ( tsl ) to compare both systems' false alarm rates and conducted statistical analysis of those data . we visited the tsl in atlantic city , new jersey , to interview laboratory scientists responsible for testing and evaluating ait - atr systems and reviewed tsl documentation related to laboratory test plans , records , and final reports . further , we assessed the extent to which laboratory test results demonstrated that the ait - atr system met requirements outlined in key acquisition practices established by gao , because the ait system is considered a large - scale acquisition program . we analyzed the adequacy of laboratory tests by comparing the testing design with generally accepted statistical methods used for data collection and analysis . we assessed the reliability of the laboratory and ied checkpoint drill data we used by interviewing officials responsible for capturing and monitoring the data about , among other things , applicable quality control procedures to maintain the integrity of the data , performing statistical tests on the data , and reviewing testing reports and related documentation . we determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report . we also interviewed tsa officials involved in ait - atr system deployment , training , and covert testing .
