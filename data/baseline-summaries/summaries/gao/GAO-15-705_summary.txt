project report . regression analysis using 1990-1991 data for 50 states , district of columbia , and 10 canadian provinces . unable to establish a statistically significant effect of vehicle inspection program on fatalities or injury rates . keall , m. d. , & newstead , s. ( 2013 ) . an evaluation of costs and benefits of a vehicle periodic inspection scheme with six - monthly inspections compared to annual inspections . accident analysis & prevention , 58 , 81-87 . regression analysis using merged new zealand crash data ( 2004-2009 ) , licensing data ( 2003-2008 ) , and inspection data ( 2003-2009 ) . going from annual to biannual inspections may reduce likelihood of crashes ( 8% ) and the prevalence of vehicle defects ( 13.5% ) , but the wide confidence interval for the drop in crash rate ( 0.4 â€“ 15% ) indicated considerable statistical uncertainty . christensen , peter and elvik , rune ( 2007 ) . effects on accidents of periodic motor vehicle inspection in norway . accident analysis and prevention 39 , 47-52 . observational study using insurance data and 1998-2002 inspection data in norway . inspections improved the technical condition of inspected cars , but did not have a statistically significant effect on crash rates . the study's findings suggested that following inspections , the accident rate of inspected cars did not decline , but rather showed a weak tendency to increase . fosser , stein ( 1992 ) . an experimental evaluation of the effects of periodic motor vehicle inspection on accident rates . accident analysis and prevention 24 ( 6 ) , 599-612 . experimental design over 4 years ( 1986- 1990 ) in norway . inspection improved the technical condition of inspected cars , but the differences found in technical condition had no influence on accident rates . appendix iv: estimated number of crashes listed with vehicle component failure 2009- 2013 with lower and upper bound 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) . in addition to the contact named above , sara vermillion ( assistant director ) , carl barden , namita bhatia sabharwal , timothy bober , melissa bodeau , jennifer clayborne , leia dickerson , amanda miller , sara ann moessbauer , josh ormond , cheryl peterson , oliver richard , stephen sanford , amy suntoke , friendly vang - johnson , michelle weathers , and jade winfree made key contributions to this report . see figure 2 below . these states develop the specific rules that govern their programs . for example , 11 of the 16 states with inspection programs require an annual vehicle safety inspection , three states require a biennial inspection , and two states require time frames other than annual or biennial . further , some states allow certain vehicles to be exempted from the safety inspections , such as newer model vehicles ( up to 5 years from the model year ) or vehicles at least 25 years old and registered as historical vehicles . some states couple the safety inspection with emissions inspections .
