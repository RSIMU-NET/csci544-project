performance risk . the risk that an intervention fails to achieve defined outcomes . a government does not make payments if defined outcomes are not achieved . however , if outcomes are not achieved , then the government has lost time developing the program and failed to meet mission - related goals and objectives . members include the deputy secretary for civil rights ; the deputy secretary for public safety ; the commissioner of department of labor ( dol ) ; the commissioner of the department of corrections and community supervision ( doccs ) ; ceo of the intermediary ; and the executive director of the service provider . a management committee: the committee meets monthly to monitor reports and program implementation and provides updates to the executive steering committee . members include the associate commissioner of doccs ; two deputy commissioners of doccs ; the deputy commissioner of dol ; the executive director of the service provider's regional office ; the director of doccs research ; a representative from the harvard kennedy school social impact bond technical assistance lab ; and a director from the intermediary . working groups: working groups meet to discuss operational and research issues that arise over the course of the project . they are composed of staff and subject - matter experts from doccs ; doccs research ; dol ; the service provider ; the harvard kennedy school social impact bond technical assistance lab ; and the intermediary . contract governance rules . complex contracting practices suggest that including provisions for how decisions will be made when changes are needed during service delivery can help address implementation challenges . to manage various risks and inherent uncertainties , pfs contracts included governance rules to define how decisions would be made over the course of the project . pfs contracts included rules to define decision making after the contract was in place as well as provisions to address how parties to the contract could be replaced in the case of underperformance . for example , the new york contract included governance rules that defined when and how the service provider could be replaced . an investor in the project further explained that although the service provider had a track record of success , its risk of failure in the nyc rikers island project was higher because it would be implementing a new curriculum in a difficult environment . the combination of the performance risk and its status as the first pfs project in the united states were the primary reasons for the loan guarantee . governance rules that define interactions and the authority to make decisions after the contract has been signed can encourage cooperation and manage the risk of unexpected termination by any party . for the projects in our study , the contracts also defined how parties will interact during the implementation of the project . pfs contracts in our study included outcome payment structures , oversight structures , governance rules , and project evaluation mechanisms to manage risk . oversight structures . pfs contracts included oversight structures to manage performance risk during contract implementation .
