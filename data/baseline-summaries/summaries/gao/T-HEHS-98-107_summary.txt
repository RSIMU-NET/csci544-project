( see fig . 2 for the distribution of the elderly in 1997 , 2030 , and 2050. ) nearly a quarter of the nation's elderly population — an estimated 7.3 million in 1994 — require some assistance with either activities of daily living ( adl ) or instrumental activities of daily living ( iadl ) , or both . almost 80 percent of these 7.3 million elderly live at home or in other community - based settings , and about 30 percent of them are severely disabled , requiring assistance with at least three adls or needing substantial supervision because of cognitive impairment or other behavioral problems . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . i would be happy to answer any questions you or members of the committee might have at this time . long - term care: consumer protection and quality - of - care issues in assisted living ( gao / hehs - 97-93 , may 15 , 1997 ) . medicare post - acute care: home health and skilled nursing facility cost growth and proposals for prospective payment ( gao / t - hehs - 97-90 , mar . medicare: home health utilization expands while program controls deteriorate ( gao / hehs - 96-16 , mar . long - term care: current issues and future directions ( gao / hehs - 95-109 , apr . long - term care: diverse , growing population includes millions of americans of all ages ( gao / hehs - 95-26 , nov. 7 , 1994 ) . my comments are based on our previous work and on other published and ongoing research . ( see the list of related gao products at the end of this statement. ) in summary , spending for long - term care for the elderly totaled almost $91 billion in 1995 , the most recent year for which expenditures from all sources were available . almost 40 percent of these dollars were paid for by the elderly and their families and almost 60 percent by medicaid and medicare . these amounts , however , do not include many hidden costs of long - term care , since an estimated two - thirds of the disabled elderly living in the community rely exclusively on their families and other unpaid sources for their care . according to current estimates by the congressional research service ( crs ) , nearly a quarter of the nation's elderly population — over 7 million elderly people — have some form of disability for which they require assistance , such as help with bathing , dressing , eating , preparing meals , or taking medicine . as the 76-million - strong baby boom generation ages , so too will its demand for long - term care increase .
