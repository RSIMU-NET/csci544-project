gao - 07-736 . washington , d.c.: june 14 , 2007 . we have highlighted some of these risks today . first , the bureau's planning and reporting of milestones and estimated costs could be made more useful . second , the performance of key contractors needs more oversight . third , the bureau can build on lessons learned early in the dress rehearsal by further testing new software that will help localities participating in the luca program . the functionality and usability of the handheld computing device — a key piece of hardware in the reengineered census — also bears watching . if , after the 2008 dress rehearsal , the handheld computers are found to not be reliable , the bureau could be faced with the remote but daunting possibility of having to revert , in whole or in part , to the costly , paper - based census used in 2000 . finally , the bureau must complete plans for ensuring an accurate population count in areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita . all told , these areas continue to call for risk mitigation plans by the bureau and careful monitoring and oversight by the commerce department , office of management and budget , the congress , gao , and other key stakeholders . as in the past , we look forward to supporting this subcommittee's oversight efforts to promote a timely , complete , accurate , and cost - effective census . mr. chairman that concludes our statement . we would be glad to answer any questions you and the committee members may have . 2010 census: census bureau is making progress on the local update of census addresses program , but improvements are needed . gao - 07- 1063t . washington , d.c.: june 26 , 2007 . 2010 census: census bureau has improved the local update of census addresses program , but challenges remain . 2010 census: census bureau should refine recruiting and hiring efforts and enhance training of temporary field staff . gao - 07-361 . washington , d.c.: april 27 , 2007 . 2010 census: design shows progress , but managing technology acquisitions , temporary field staff , and gulf region enumeration require attention . gao - 07-779t . washington , d.c.: april 24 , 2007 . 2010 census: redesigned approach holds promise , but census bureau needs to annually develop and provide a comprehensive project plan to monitor costs . gao - 06-1009t . washington , d.c.: july 27 , 2006 . 2010 census: census bureau needs to take prompt actions to resolve long - standing and emerging address and mapping challenges . gao - 06- 272 . washington , d.c.: june 15 , 2006 . 2010 census: costs and risks must be closely monitored and evaluated with mitigation plans in place . gao - 06-822t . washington , d.c.: june 6 , 2006 . 2010 census: census bureau generally follows selected leading acquisition planning practices , but continued management attentions is needed to help ensure success . gao - 06-277 . washington , d.c.: may 18 , 2006 . census bureau: important activities for improving management of key 2010 decennial acquisitions remain to be done . gao - 06-444t . washington , d.c.: march 1 , 2006 .
