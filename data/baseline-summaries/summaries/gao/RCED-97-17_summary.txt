we have footnoted the latter . ( see app . i , ii , and iii. ) we provided a draft of this report to doe for its review and comment . doe's comments and our response are included as appendix iv and are discussed in the chapters where appropriate . we conducted our work from august 1995 through october 1996 . our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . since 1980 , doe has conducted 80 projects that it designated as msas . as of june 1996 , 34 were ongoing . our analysis of doe's success in completing its msas shows that during the period 1980 through 1996: doe completed 15 of 80 msas , while more than twice as many projects ( 31 ) were terminated prior to completion . cost overruns occurred on most completed projects and at least half of the ongoing projects , in some cases more than doubling the original estimates . most of the completed projects were not finished on schedule , and many of the ongoing msas were behind schedule . three of the completed projects either have not achieved their expected results or have not yet been used for their intended purposes . since 1980 , 31 msas were terminated prior to completion . these projects had incurred substantial expenditures when they were terminated , totaling more than $10 billion . these terminated projects include: the new production reactor program to produce tritium , a key ingredient in nuclear weapons , was canceled in 1992 after the expenditure of over $1.2 billion , primarily for design work and close - out costs . no final technology or site was selected . the clinch river breeder reactor project in tennessee was intended to demonstrate a reactor that could create more fuel than it used . authorized in 1970 at an estimated total cost of $700 million , the project was terminated in 1983 after an expenditure of about $1.6 billion . the gas centrifuge enrichment plant in ohio , shown in figure 2.1 , authorized in 1975 at an estimated total cost of $5.1 billion , was terminated in 1985 after an expenditure of $2.8 billion . the superconducting super collider in texas , shown in figure 2.2 , was designed to conduct high - energy physics experiments . the collider would have required an oval tunnel 54 miles in circumference at an average depth of 150 feet below ground level . originally funded as a construction project in fiscal year 1990 at an estimated total cost of $5.9 billion , the project was terminated in 1993 after an expenditure of over $2 billion . the fuel processing restoration project in idaho ( to increase naval nuclear propulsion fuel processing capacity ) was begun in 1985 . about $306 million had been spent for construction when the project was terminated in 1992 . the uranium solidification facility in south carolina ( to recycle enriched uranium and provide material for reactor fuel ) , begun in the late 1980s , had an original construction cost estimate of $85 million . when the project was terminated in 1994 , about $116 million had been spent for construction .
