equipment . va provided estimates of the equipment costs for the three modes . the initial costs were $736,674 for caskets , $443,003 for in - ground cremains sites , and $91,664 for columbaria — all purchased in year 3 of the first phase . subsequent equipment purchases were assumed to be equal and to occur in year 3 of phases 2 and 3 . we estimated their cost at $150,000 for caskets , $90,000 for in - ground cremains sites , and $18,000 for columbaria . labor associated with administration and interments . we assumed that it would require 7.3 full - time - equivalent ( fte ) general schedule ( gs ) employees , at an annual rate ( pay and benefits ) of $45,216 each , plus 6.7 fte wage grade ( wg ) employees at a rate of $35,085 each , to conduct the 1,667 interments that are projected for each year under all three burial modes . va said that the gs administrative and interment requirements would be the same for all three modes but that the wg labor associated with each mode would vary . according to ncs assumptions , the wg labor required for casket burials was 6.7 ftes . we had to develop our own estimate — 3 ftes for in - ground cremains sites and .56 fte for columbarium niches — because va had no specified ratio for wg labor for the noncasket modes . we assumed subsequent interments would require a prorated amount of labor . that is , if subsequent interments in a given year are estimated to be 20 percent of first interments , we assumed that labor costs associated with subsequent interments would be equal to 20 percent of the labor costs associated with first interments . put differently , we assumed that each subsequent interment would require as much labor as each first interment . nonlabor costs . these costs include the costs of irrigating and purchasing fertilizer , seed , and other supplies . we used va estimates to derive amounts for this category of costs . the amounts are small and proportional to the acreage developed . for the casket model , the nonlabor costs would be $389,000 in phase 1 , increasing by $95,500 in phases 2 and 3 to a total of $580,000 by the 24th year . for in - ground cremains sites , we adjusted the cost in phase 1 by the ratio of acreage to arrive at a cost of $117,000 , rising by $28,500 in phases 2 and 3 to a total of $174,000 in the 24th year ( with rounding ) . for columbaria , the initial nonlabor cost was $57,000 , rising $14,000 in phases 1 and 2 to a total of $85,000 in years 24 through 33 . outlays for headstones and markers are proportional to the number of first interments in a given year . these costs vary depending on the area of the country in which the headstones and markers are purchased . for this analysis , we used the middle price in the range of prices va said they pay .
