i for a description of our methodology. ) in 1997 , medicare's fee - for - service program covered about 87 percent , or 33 million , of medicare's beneficiaries . physicians , hospitals , and other providers submit claims to medicare to receive payment for services they have provided to beneficiaries . hcfa administers medicare's fee - for - service program through a network of more than 60 claims processing contractors , that is , insurance companies — like blue cross and blue shield plans , mutual of omaha , and cigna — that process and pay medicare claims . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . in fact , while the number of medicare claims grew by 70 percent between 1989 and 1996 , funding for claims review grew less than 11 percent . in 1994 , hhs proposed a program safeguard funding arrangement similar to that in hipaa , saying that it would improve program safeguards by creating “a stable level of funding from year to year so that hcfa and its contractors could plan and manage the function on a multi - year basis.” hhs went on to say that “ast fluctuations in funding have made it difficult to retain experienced staff who understand the complexities of the program.” appendix ii summarizes program safeguard funding for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 , by type of program safeguard activity . although hipaa provides significant new resources and authorities , the timing of the act — the passage of which occurred only 6 weeks before the start of fiscal year 1997 — limited the opportunity for change in the first year . then , hcfa failed to take advantage of the advance knowledge of fiscal year 1998 program safeguard funding by providing safeguard budgets to its contractors at the beginning of fiscal year 1998 . that delay has hindered contractors' ability to expand their program safeguard activities . we also visited hcfa headquarters and regional offices and two medicare contractors to discuss how medicare integrity program funding was being used . we reviewed documentation obtained from hcfa and the two contractors , including hcfa's fiscal year budget and performance requirements ; the contractors' budget requests ; and documentation addressing contractor program safeguard staffing , efforts , and results . medicare secondary payer review focuses on identifying other primary sources of payment , such as employer - sponsored health insurance or third - party liability settlements , for claims submitted to medicare .
