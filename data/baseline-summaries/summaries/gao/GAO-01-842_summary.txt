( app . i , table 3 , provides additional information on border patrol agent enhancements along the southwest border. ) as a result of the increased number of agents along the southwest border , the amount of time spent on border enforcement activities in these sectors increased by 27 percent , from about 8.5 million hours in fiscal year 1998 to almost 11 million hours in fiscal year 2000 . the proportion of time border patrol agents spent on border enforcement increased from 66 percent to 69 percent during this time . ins has continued to erect barriers as called for in its strategy . since fiscal year 1999 , ins has completed about 12 miles of fencing and other types of barriers , bringing the total to about 76 miles along the southwest border as of may 2001 . ins had plans to erect an additional 32 miles , some of which was under construction as of may 2001 . in addition , in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 , ins installed 107 remote video surveillance systems along the southwest border bringing the total to 130 . according to ins' year - end review of its fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan , ins estimated it may need between 11,700 and 14,000 agents to fully implement the southwest border strategy . this is between 3,200 and 5,500 more agents than the roughly 8,500 agents ins had on board along the southwest border at the end of fiscal year 2000 . the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 mandated that the attorney general increase the number of agents on board by no less than 1,000 agents per year during each of fiscal years 1997 through 2001 . ins was able to meet this goal in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 , but not in the following 3 years . we reported that in fiscal year 1999 , ins was only able to achieve a net increase of 369 agents out of the goal of 1,000 because ins was unable to recruit enough qualified applicants and retain them through the hiring process . in fiscal year 2000 , ins stated that it requested no additional agents because of its concern that the ratio of inexperienced - to - experienced agents was getting too high and law enforcement experts said this was risky . congress , however , funded 430 additional agents . in fiscal year 2001 , ins requested 430 agents . in her march 2000 testimony , the former ins commissioner stated that the 430 agents represented the level that was achievable in the existing tight labor market . it also allowed ins to have sufficient funds to increase the journeyman level from a gs - 9 to a gs - 11 and for signing bonuses for those who successfully completed the border patrol academy training program . it would take between 5 and 9 years and congressional approval for ins to obtain the additional border patrol agents it believes it needs to control the southwest border . as noted above , ins estimates it needs between 3,200 and 5,500 more agents than the roughly 8,500 agents it had on board along the southwest border at the end of fiscal year 2000 .
