see figure 2 . further , private companies and states are developing commercial spaceports — sites used for commercial space launches to support the expected growth in the launch industry . see figure 3 . faa's primary means of authorizing space launch activities is through its licensing process which includes: licensing launch and reentry vehicle operations , reviewing applications for experimental permits , reviewing safety approvals , and conducting safety inspections and oversight of licensed and permitted activities , among other activities . for fiscal year 2016 for the office of commercial space transportation , faa's budget request was $18.1 million and 92 full - time equivalent positions . congress provided $17.8 million for commercial space activities for fiscal year 2016 . the federal government is authorized to provide catastrophic loss protection in the event of a launch accident for all faa - licensed commercial launches through the commercial space launch amendments act as amended . thus , subject to congressional appropriations , the u.s. government may pay third - party liability claims for injury , damage , or loss that result from a commercial launch - related accident in excess of the required “maximum probable loss,” an amount which is calculated by faa and is capped at $500 million per launch . the federal government , subject to the availability of appropriations , is then liable for claims over the maximum probable loss up to $1.5 billion which when adjusted for post - 1988 inflation is about $3.06 billion in 2015 dollars . launch companies are responsible for third - party liability claims up to the maximum probable loss and over $3.06 billion . figure 4 illustrates this regime . faa's risk methodology to calculate the maximum probable loss uses an “overlay” method that entails reviewing the specific circumstances of the launch including the planned launch vehicle , launch site , payload , flight path , and the potential casualties and fatalities that could result from varying types of launch failures at different points along that path . there has not been a commercial launch - related accident that has invoked indemnification and thus the federal government has not paid any third - party liability claims to date . as we reported in our 2015 report , during the last decade , u.s. companies conducted fewer orbital commercial launches in total than companies in russia or europe , which are among the main foreign competitors . however , in recent years such as 2014 and 2015 , u.s. companies have conducted an increasing number of orbital commercial launches . as shown in figure 4 , the number of orbital launches conducted by u.s. companies varied over the last 11 years . for example , recently the number of launches increased from zero in 2011 to eight in 2015 . in 2015 , u.s. companies conducted more orbital launches than companies in russia , which conducted five , or europe , which conducted six . in 2015 we found that a number of factors are responsible for the recent expansion of the u.s. commercial space launch industry . first , increase in demand through federal government contracts , such as nasa's commercial cargo program , have supported the industry and have resulted in an increase in the number of u.s. commercial launches .
