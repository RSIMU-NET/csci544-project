we excluded those cases from our review . see table 1 for information on 20 of the 25 leases of high - security space that we identified as foreign - owned . when we found that the lessors were incorporated in the united states but their parent companies were based in foreign countries , we included them as foreign owned . in one case , because of the complexity of the transaction involving the purchase of a building containing high - security gsa - leased space , we were unable to determine in which country the immediate owner of the building was based . that property is noted in the table . we found that 26 different agencies and departmental components occupy high - security leased space in buildings that we identified as foreign owned , 22 of which occupy space that we identified as owned by companies based in non - nato countries ( china , israel , south korea , and japan ) . for example , we identified eight leases of high - security space from chinese companies entered into prior to november 1 , 2014 . these leases are for space occupied by the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , secret service , social security administration , and gao . gsa indicated that sam did not contain information on lessors that listed physical or mailing addresses in china . the leases of space that we identified as being in foreign - owned buildings are occupied by agencies such as six fbi field offices , three dea field offices , and two social security administration offices . the threshold for submitting a prospectus was $2.85 million for fiscal year 2014 , the most recent threshold established . the total amount of space leased was about 3.3 million square feet at an annual cost of about $97 million . nine of the 14 tenant agencies that we contacted indicated they were not aware that the space they were occupying was in buildings that we identified as being owned by foreign companies . for example , the executive office for united states attorneys indicated that it has no records showing that gsa notified the office that a building it was occupying was foreign owned . the other five agencies that knew about occupying foreign - owned space had taken actions to mitigate the risk or were not concerned . besides gsa , other agencies use their own statutory authority to lease space from foreign companies . for example , the state department is leasing space for the u.s. ambassador to the united nations in the waldorf - astoria hotel in new york city , which was acquired by a chinese company in 2014 . we also found that the u.s. mint , using its own authority , is leasing its headquarters building in washington , d.c. , from a japanese parent company that is the ultimate owner . several federal officials who assess foreign investments in the united states and selected real estate company representatives we spoke to told us that leasing space in foreign - owned buildings could present security risks such as espionage , unauthorized cyber and physical access to the facilities , and sabotage .
