we provided a copy of this report to hud for its review . applications that did not pass the technical review were rejected . hud provided a written notice to rejected applicants , which included the rationale for rejection and an opportunity for appeal . according to hud headquarters officials , common reasons for rejection were noncompliance with environmental requirements and site control . rejected applicants could file an appeal with hud . applications that passed the technical review proceeded to the rating process . during the rating process , the regional office evaluated each application in several categories using a point system . these categories were ( 1 ) capacity of the applicant and relevant organizational staff ; ( 2 ) need , or the extent of the problem ; ( 3 ) soundness of approach ; ( 4 ) leveraging resources ; and ( 5 ) achieving results and program evaluation . each application was scored on a number of criteria within each of these categories , and applications were required to meet a minimum point threshold in order to be considered for funding . according to hud , once scores were compiled , hud awarded capital advances through a competitive process to applicants selected in each region with the greatest number of points in each regional office . because the regional offices received separate funding allocations for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas for section 202 , they were required to first split the applications into metropolitan and nonmetropolitan developments and then rank each application within these areas . the funding levels provided did not allow them to fund all eligible applicants . each regional office selected eligible applications from highest to lowest scores until no more funding from the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan allocations remained . if an applicant were next in rank order but needed more funds than remained , regional offices were not permitted to skip over that applicant in order to select another lower scoring applicant whose project required less funds . instead , according to hud headquarters officials , once each regional office had awarded all the funds it could based on the stated criteria in the notice of funding availability ( nofa ) , hud headquarters combined any remaining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan funds to select the next highest ranked application from either a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area . once each regional office finished selecting applicants , any remaining funds were returned to hud headquarters , where the remaining eligible applicants were entered into a nationwide competitive pool . we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes . we also interviewed officials at hud to better understand funding trends and funding decisions . we conducted this performance audit from april 2015 to may 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
