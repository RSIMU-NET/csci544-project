however , we also found that it is not easy . for example , in december 2016 , opm finalized revisions to its strategic human capital management regulation that include the new human capital framework . this framework is to be used in 2017 by agencies to plan , implement , evaluate , and improve human capital policies and programs . our recent work on federal hiring , classification , addressing poor performance , and the capacity of federal human resource functions are illustrative of some of the areas in need of attention . to help ensure agencies have the talent they need to meet their missions , we have found that federal agencies should have a hiring process that is simultaneously applicant friendly , sufficiently flexible to enable agencies to meet their needs , and consistent with statutory requirements , such as hiring on the basis of merit . key to achieving this is the hiring authority used to bring applicants onboard . congress and the president have created a number of hiring authorities to expedite the hiring process or to achieve certain public policy goals , such as facilitating the entrance of certain groups into the civil service . as we reported in 2016 , we found that of the 105 hiring authorities used in fiscal year 2014 , agencies relied on 20 of those authorities for 91 percent of the 196,226 new appointments made that year . opm officials said at the time they did not know if agencies relied on a small number of authorities because agencies are unfamiliar with other authorities , or if they have found other authorities to be less effective . while changes are usually inevitable , listening to employee views and using metrics helps identify and correct problems over time . our prior work has found that across a range of human capital functions , while in some cases statutory changes may be needed to advance reforms , in many instances improvements are within the control of federal agencies . these improvements include such actions as improving the coordination of hiring specialists and hiring managers on developing recruitment strategies and up - to - date position descriptions in vacancy announcements . indeed , congress has already provided agencies with a number of tools and flexibilities to help them build and maintain a high - performing workforce . going forward , it will be important for agencies to make effective use of those tools and for congress to hold agencies accountable for doing so . among other things , our work has shown that the tone starts at the top . agency leaders and managers should set an example that human capital is important and is directly linked to performance — it is not a transactional function . as a result , agencies should promote people into supervisory positions because of their supervisory skills ( in addition to their technical skills ) and ensure that new supervisors receive sufficient training in performance management . likewise , a cultural shift might be needed among agencies and employees to acknowledge that a rating of “fully successful” is already a high bar and should be valued and rewarded and that “outstanding” is a difficult level to achieve .
