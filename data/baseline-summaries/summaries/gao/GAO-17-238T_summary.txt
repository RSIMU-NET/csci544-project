these observations are not generalizable . on september 16 , 2016 , we shared the information included in this statement with the census bureau for its review . on september 21 , 2016 , we met with bureau officials and they provided technical comments which we included , as appropriate . my testimony is also based on our prior work on the bureau's preparations for 2020 , as well as our work on lessons learned from the conduct of the 2010 census . for those studies , we reviewed bureau planning documents and test plans , interviewed bureau officials , and made site visits to observe how census operations were being implemented in the field . the work on which this statement is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . with a cost of about $12.3 billion , the 2010 census was the most expensive population count in u.s. history , costing about 31 percent more than the $9.4 billion 2000 census ( in constant 2020 dollars ) . some cost growth is to be expected because the population is growing and becoming more complex and difficult to count , which increases the bureau's workload . however , the cost of counting each housing unit has escalated from about $16 in 1970 to $92 in 2010 ( in constant 2020 dollars ) , according to the bureau . for the 2020 census , the bureau intends to limit its per - household cost to not more than that of the 2010 census , adjusted for inflation . to achieve this goal , the bureau is significantly changing how it conducts the census , in part by re - engineering key census - taking methods and infrastructure . the bureau's innovations include ( 1 ) using the internet as a self - response option ; ( 2 ) verifying most addresses using “in - office” procedures rather than costly field canvassing ; ( 3 ) re - engineering data collection methods ; and ( 4 ) in certain instances , replacing enumerator - collected data with administrative records ( information already provided to federal and state governments as they administer other programs ) . the bureau's various initiatives have the potential to reduce costs . in october 2015 , the bureau estimated that with its new approach it can conduct the 2020 census for a life - cycle cost of $12.5 billion , $5.2 billion less than if it were to repeat the design and methods of the 2010 census ( both in constant 2020 dollars ) . however , in june 2016 , we reported that this $12.5 billion cost estimate was not reliable and did not adequately account for risk . table 1 below shows the bureau's estimated cost savings it hopes to achieve in the following four innovation areas . the 2016 test was the latest major test of nrfu in the bureau's testing program .
