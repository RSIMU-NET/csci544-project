repayment . neither report allowed for situations in which the debtor's income decreases or expenses increase during the 5-year period . past experience suggest that not all future chapter 13 debtors will successfully complete their repayment plans . to the extent this occurs , it would reduce the amount of debt that future debtors repay under required chapter 13 repayment plans . a 1994 report by the administrative office of the u.s. courts found that only about 36 percent of the 953,180 chapter 13 cases terminated during a 10-year period ending september 30 , 1993 , had been successfully completed . the remaining 64 percent were either dismissed or converted to chapter 7 liquidation , in which all eligible debts were discharged . the reasons for this low completion rate are unknown , but this illustrates the high level of discrepancy between the amount that debtors could potentially repay , based on the data and assumptions used in the two reports , and what has occurred over a 10-year period . another assumption made in both reports is that 100 percent of debtors' income available for debt repayment will be used to repay debt for a 5-year period . this assumption does not reflect actual bankruptcy practice . chapter 13 repayment plans require greater administrative oversight , and thus cost more than chapter 7 cases , including periodic review of the debtors progress in implementing the plan and review of debtors' or creditors' requests to alter the plan . in fiscal year 1996 , for example , creditors received about 86 percent of chapter 13 debtor payments . the remaining 14 percent of chapter 13 debtor payments were used to pay administrative costs , such as statutory trustee fees and debtor attorneys' fees . neither study addressed the additional costs for judges and administrative support requirements that would be borne by the government should more debtors file under chapter 13. nation as a whole or of each location for the year from which the samples were drawn . therefore , the data on which the reports were based may not reflect all bankruptcy filings nationally or in each of the 15 locations for the years from which the petitions were drawn . one difference between the two reports involves the calculation of debtor expenses . the center's estimates of debtor repayment capacity are based on the data reported in debtors' initial schedules of estimated income , estimated expenses , and debts . the center report calculated debtor expenses using the data reported on debtors' estimated income and estimated expense schedules . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 .
