( see app . i for pictures and descriptions of the section 202 and home projects that we visited. ) in general , federal housing assistance is available only to people or households that have low incomes . consequently , income , not age , is the single biggest factor in deciding on an elderly person's need and eligibility for federal housing assistance . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 37050 washington , dc 20013 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 202 ) 512-6061 , or tdd ( 202 ) 512-2537 . according to the sponsor , hud reduced the project's section 202 capital advance because the sponsor was using other federal funds to meet expenses for which hud had granted the section 202 funding . the home program is not meant be a participating jurisdiction's sole source of funds for the development of affordable housing . by statute , the local or state government must contribute funds to match at least 25 percent of the home funds the jurisdiction uses to provide affordable housing each year . additionally , one of the purposes of the home program is to encourage public - private partnerships by providing incentives for state and local governments to work with private and nonprofit developers to produce affordable housing . as a result , home projects typically attract significant levels of additional public and private funding from sources such as other federal programs , state or local housing initiatives , low - income housing tax credit proceeds , and donations or equity contributions from nonprofit groups . while a participating jurisdiction could conceivably develop new multifamily rental housing using only its allocation of home funds , hud officials questioned why any jurisdiction might choose to do so . multifamily rental housing is costly to build , and one such project could easily consume a community's entire allocation of home funds in a given year if no other funding were used . from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1996 , over 1,400 section 202 and home program multifamily rental housing projects for the elderly opened nationwide . these projects included 1,400 section 202 projects with 51,838 rental units , providing homes for at least 47,823 elderly individuals , and 30 comparable home projects with 681 rental units , providing homes for at least 675 elderly individuals . on average , the section 202 projects had 37 units , while the home projects had 23 units . figure 2 illustrates the proportion of the total number of projects attributable to each program . although only a small portion of the home projects were comparable to section 202 projects , participating jurisdictions used home funds to assist low - income elderly people in other ways . most of the elderly households that obtained assistance from the home program — over 70 percent — used that assistance to rehabilitate the homes they already owned and in which they still lived .
