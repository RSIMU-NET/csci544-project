” checkbox . differences in sector apprehensions at checkpoints could depend in part on the number of checkpoints within a sector , the amount of time checkpoints are operational , and the extent to which sectors consistently apply guidance on how to enter data for apprehensions that are related to checkpoint operations . this appendix contains additional detail about trends in southwest border seizures from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 , including trends in the: number of seizures by type of contraband seized , number of seizures by sector , distribution of seizures by sector and by distance from the border , seizures related to border patrol checkpoints each available year by sector , and marijuana seizures at checkpoints by quantity seized . border patrol seized almost 90,000 prohibited items in southwest border sectors from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016 . most of these seizures ( 92 percent ) were narcotics , and 87 percent of narcotics seizures were marijuana . the remaining seizures were of firearms , ammunition , currency , or other property . as shown in table 8 , the number of seizures on the southwest border generally decreased from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016 , with the exceptions of slight rises in the amount of methamphetamines and heroin seized during this period . the greatest number of seizures during the 5 fiscal years occurred in the tucson , big bend , and rio grande valley sectors ( 34 , 19 , and 16 percent respectively ) . collectively , these three sectors accounted for 69 percent of southwest border seizures from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 . for all southwest border sectors except the big bend sector , the numbers of seizures decreased during this 5-year period . for example , the number of seizures in the tucson sector decreased 12 percent , and the number of seizures in the rio grande valley sector decreased 36 percent during this period . the number of seizures in the big bend sector increased 39 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 . figure 15 shows the number of seizures from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 by sector . as noted in this report , the location where seizures occurred remained relatively stable from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016 , with the majority of seizures occurring 10 miles or more from the southwest border . table 9 shows the distribution of seizures for each sector by distance from the border during fiscal years 2012 through 2016 . for fiscal years 2013 through 2016 , the percent of seizures occurring at checkpoints varied by sector . we assigned each seizure into one of four location categories based on whether the gps coordinates for the event occurred close enough to the gps coordinates for a checkpoint to be considered “at a checkpoint” and whether the event's landmark corresponds to the nearest checkpoint landmark . table 10 shows the distribution of seizures for each sector by checkpoint location category during fiscal years 2013 through 2016 .
