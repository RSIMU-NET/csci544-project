( see fig . according to program documents , the f414-ge - 400 engine generates about 22,000 pounds of uninstalled thrust , a 37.5-percent increase over the f404-ge - 400 engine used in the f / a - 18a / b and some early f / a - 18c / d aircraft . however , technical manuals show that the f / a - 18e / f's f414-ge - 400 engine develops only 20,727 pounds of uninstalled thrust . furthermore , the latest f / a - 18c / ds are equipped with an enhanced version of the f404 engine , known as the f404-ge - 402 enhanced performance engine . this new engine that was developed to meet foreign buyers' requirements for better combat performance has been adopted for navy use . the enhanced engine increased the uninstalled thrust from 16,000 to 17,754 pounds . consequently , as shown in table 2.1 , the f / a - 18e / f has about a 17-percent improvement in uninstalled thrust over the c / ds fitted with the f404-ge - 402 enhanced performance engine , rather than 37.5-percent reported in program documents . this limited improvement in uninstalled thrust , coupled with a much heavier operationally loaded f / a - 18e / f , means that the e / f will have less air - to - air combat capability in its sustained turn rate , maneuvering , and acceleration than f / a - 18c / ds with the enhanced performance engines . sustained turn rate , maneuvering , and acceleration contribute to an aircraft's combat performance and survivability by increasing its ability to maneuver in either offensive or defensive modes . navy data comparing the f / a - 18c to the f / a - 18e shows the following: at sea level , the f / a - 18c's sustained turn rate is 19.2 degrees per second , while the f / a - 18e's sustained rate is 18 degrees per second . the instantaneous bleed rate of the f / a - 18c is 54 knots per second , whereas the f / a - 18e will lose 65 knots per second in a turn . at 15,000 feet , the f / a - 18c's sustained turn rate is 12.3 degrees per second , while the f / a - 18e's sustained rate is 11.6 degrees per second . the instantaneous bleed rate of the f / a - 18c is 62 knots per second , whereas the f / a - 18e will lose 76 knots per second in a turn . aircraft acceleration affects an aircraft's combat performance in a number of ways , ranging from how quickly the aircraft can reach its area of operation to its ability to close the gap in air - to - air engagements or to evade air - to - ground missiles . navy data shows the following: at 5,000 feet at maximum thrust , the f / a - 18c accelerates from 0.8 mach to 1.08 mach in 21 seconds , whereas the f / a - 18e will take 52.8 seconds .
