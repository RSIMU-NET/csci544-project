v ) . millions of taxpayers claim the hope and lifetime learning tax credits to offset qualified education expenses . however , these tax provisions are complicated and may lead taxpayers to under claim benefits or unknowingly claim more benefits than they are entitled to claim . irs faces challenges ensuring compliance with the eligibility requirements of the higher education credits . irs relies on audits and limited mea to ensure compliance . irs is in the process of addressing those recommendations . despite the heavy call volume , the accuracy of the telephone assistors' responses to tax law and account questions was higher by a statistically significant amount compared to the same period last year and exceeded irs's fiscal year 2009 goals ( see table 5 ) . since 2005 , irs has maintained a level of accuracy of about 90 percent or more . according to irs officials , the high accuracy is due to training and the introduction of new tools , particularly the interactive tax law assistant ( itla ) , which is a web - based probe and response guide to help assistors provide more accurate and consistent responses to specific tax law questions . irs has limited information on why taxpayers call to speak irs assistors . to help obtain better information on why taxpayers call , irs recently implemented a major data collection effort called contact analytics at all its 26 call sites . data limitations are discussed where appropriate . finally , we conducted our work primarily at irs headquarters including at the small business / self - employed division in washington , d.c. , and the wage and investment division headquarters in atlanta , ga. as well as the other sites mentioned earlier . we conducted this performance audit from january 2009 through december 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we received technical and written comments on a draft of this report , which we addressed . a letter from the irs deputy commissioner for services and enforcement providing those comments is reprinted in appendix i . in that letter , the deputy commissioner explicitly agreed with five of our recommendations and described the steps irs is taking with respect to our two other recommendations . most taxpayers file their individual income tax returns electronically , although millions still mail paper returns . compared to paper , electronic filing allows taxpayers to receive refunds faster , is less prone to transcription and other errors , and provides irs with significant cost savings . last year we reported that irs estimated it used 39 percent fewer staff years for processing tax returns in 2007 than in 1999 for a savings of $85 million . the free file program provides taxpayers below an income ceiling with access to a consortium of tax preparation companies that offer free on - line tax preparation and filing services for qualifying taxpayers .
