gao - 03-1161t . washington , d.c.: september 17 , 2003 . several of the provisions in h.r . 3283 address many of the quality of service issues we have identified through our prior work and if the provisions are properly implemented these services should improve . while the fee demonstration program provides funds to increase the quality of the visitor experience and enhance the protection of resources by , among other things , addressing a backlog of needs for repair and maintenance , and to manage and protect resources , the program's short and long - term success lies in the flexibility it provides agencies to spend revenues and the removal of any undesirable inequities that occur to ensure that the agencies' highest priority needs are met . however , any changes to the program's requirements should be balanced in such a way that fee - collecting sites would continue to have an incentive to collect fees and visitors who pay them will continue to support the program . mr. chairman , this concludes my prepared statement . i would be happy to respond to any questions that you or members of the subcommittee may have . for further information about this testimony , please contact me at ( 202 ) 512-3841 . doreen feldman , roy judy , jonathan mcmurray , patrick sigl , paul staley , amy webbink , and arvin wu made key contributions to this statement . the following is a listing of related gao products on recreation fees , deferred maintenance , and other related issues . recreation fees: information on forest service management of revenue from the fee demonstration program . recreation fees: information on forest service management of revenue from the fee demonstration program . gao - 03-470 . washington , d.c.: april 25 , 2003 . recreation fees: management improvements can help the demonstration program enhance visitor services . gao - 02-10 . washington , d.c.: november 26 , 2001 . recreational fee demonstration program survey . gao - 02-88sp . washington , d.c.: november 1 , 2001 . national park service: recreational fee demonstration program spending priorities . gao / rced - 00-37r . washington , d.c.: november 18 , 1999 . recreation fees: demonstration has increased revenues , but impact on park service backlog is uncertain . gao / t - rced - 99-101 . washington , d.c.: march 3 , 1999 . recreation fees: demonstration program successful in raising revenues but could be improved . gao / t - rced - 99-77 . washington , d.c.: february 4 , 1999 . recreation fees: demonstration fee program successful in raising revenues but could be improved . gao / rced - 99-7 . washington , d.c.: november 20 , 1998 . national park service: efforts underway to address its maintenance backlog . gao - 03-1177t . washington , d.c.: september 27 , 2003 . national park service: status of agency efforts to address its maintenance backlog . gao - 03-992t . washington , d.c.: july 8 , 2003 . national park service: status of efforts to develop better deferred maintenance data . gao - 02-568r . washington , d.c.: april 12 , 2002 . national park service: efforts to identify and manage the maintenance backlog . gao / rced - 98-143 .
