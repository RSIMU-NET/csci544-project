the panel findings were not appealed . mexico revised its antidumping determination following the panel report . however , in a subsequent proceeding , mexico again concluded that the imports of hfcs constituted a threat of material injury to the domestic sugar industry . as a result , the united states requested a compliance review under article 21.5 of the dsu . in the article 21.5 proceeding , the appellate body upheld panel findings that mexico's revised determination was inconsistent with various provisions of the ada . according to u.s. officials , mexico revoked the antidumping measure in may 2002 . japan and the eu separately challenged section 801 of the revenue act of 1916 ( 1916 act ) as being inconsistent with article vi of gatt 1994 and various provisions of the ada . section 801 of the 1916 act allows for private claims against , and criminal prosecutions of , parties that import or assist in importing goods into the united states at a price substantially less than actual market value or wholesale price . the japan and eu challenges were to the law itself rather than to its implementation . the appellate body affirmed the panel conclusions that antidumping legislation , including the 1916 act , can be directly challenged , absent any particular application . it also upheld the panel findings that the 1916 act itself was inconsistent with article vi of gatt 1994 and various provisions of the ada . accordingly , the appellate body recommended that the united states bring the 1916 act into conformity with its obligations under these agreements . the united states continues to work to enact legislation to implement the wto ruling . although a number of bills have been introduced in the congress calling for repeal of section 801 of the 1916 act , to date no legislation has been passed . as of july 15 , 2003 , the latest bills were h.r . 1073 , introduced in the house of representatives on march 4 , 2003 ; s. 1080 , introduced in the senate on may 19 , 2003 ; and s. 1155 , introduced in the senate on may 23 , 2003 . the bills are somewhat different in that the repeals under h.r . 1073 and s. 1155 would not affect pending cases , whereas the s. 1080 repeal would apply to them . european union ( eu ) . ( ds 138 ) the united states imposed cvds on imports of certain hot - rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel products originating in the united kingdom , as a result of alleged subsidies the british government granted to british steel corporation , a state - owned company , between 1977 and 1986 . the british government began the privatization of british steel in 1986 and completed it in 1988 . the commerce department found the sale to be at arm's length for fair market value and consistent with commercial considerations . notwithstanding these factors , the commerce department imposed cvds on these united kingdom imports , initially in 1993 and in subsequent annual reviews , on the grounds that a certain proportion of the subsidies granted to british steel had passed through to the new entities .
