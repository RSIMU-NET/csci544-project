against the national interest . however , the british government has never used the authority provided under this act . the enterprise act of 2002 provides the government the authority to intervene to block or place conditions on the approval of mergers and acquisitions involving british companies if the transaction is considered to be against the public interest . the authority under the act has been designated to the secretary of state for the department of business , enterprise , and regulatory reform ( dberr – - previously the department of trade and industry ) . the enterprise act overhauled the framework for regulating mergers in the uk , updating the fair trading act of 1973 . according to british government officials , the enterprise act is primarily intended as a review of competition or anti - trust concerns associated with mergers . however , the law allows for a “special intervention” when the secretary of state determines that a transaction may harm the public interest . this allows the government to intervene if a foreign investment poses a threat to public security . the act , as amended , specifies that foreign investment involving national security , the media , or water is subject to a public interest intervention by the secretary of state . the enterprise act provides specified considerations that are relevant to the united kingdom's national security . however , the secretary of state has broad authority to intervene due to considerations that , while not specified by the law , “in the opinion of the secretary of state , ought to be so specified.” similarly , the secretary of state has the authority to issue an order that effectively modifies the relevant section of the enterprise act so that considerations that have not been specified are effectively added to the law . the enterprise act also specifies that the secretary of state has the authority to intervene in mergers involving a uk government contractor that possesses information “relating to defense and of a confidential nature.” transactions in which ( 1 ) sales exceed £17 million annually or ( 2 ) the relevant market share exceeds 25 percent may require a review by the british office of fair trading . additionally , the uk may intervene in a foreign investment of any size in the areas of national security or the media if the government deems it is in the public interest to do so and the secretary of state issues a special intervention . since the enterprise act merger provisions came into effect in 2003 , the secretary of state has issued an intervention notice six times on national security grounds ; only one of these notices was issued when there was not also an accompanying anti - monopoly review . all six of these cases involve the protection of sensitive information associated with military programs . the secretary of state approved each proposed transaction under the condition that the acquiring company accepts a series of undertakings to mitigate the security risk associated with the investment . according to business representatives familiar with the intervention and review process , one of the companies eventually did not complete the proposed approved deal . a seventh public interest intervention was initiated because of a merger in the media field .
