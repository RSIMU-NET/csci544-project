as such , it is one indicator of the results of dea investigations . for example , according to dea , tracking the milestones for the development , implementation , and maintenance of the program's rapid targeting online reports tool ( raptor ) was chosen as the program's outcome measure so that managers could monitor the development and implementation of the system to ensure it was done in a timely and cost - efficient manner . while we agree that project schedule and cost should be closely monitored , this measure does not articulate to outsiders what the program is accomplishing as called for by doj's guidance for performance measures . these registrants are regularly investigated by the states in which they conduct business . how does dea manage its investigation efforts to address the growing and evolving nature of prescription drug diversion ? how does dea help ensure that policies and procedures are followed for diversion investigations and to what extent does it determine the results of its efforts on the diversion problem ? to address the first objective , we reviewed dea policies and procedures on how dea carries out its investigative responsibilities , including program documents such as dea's current strategic plan and budget justification submissions for fiscal years 2008 to 2012 . we also analyzed dea data for fiscal years 2007 to 2010 on case volumes for investigations and data on number of personnel working on dea's tactical diversion squads ( squads ) . we reviewed information from agency officials regarding the data and the systems and procedures used to maintain it . from this review we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report . we also interviewed dea program officials involved in overseeing and managing diversion control investigations and program officials involved in diversion investigations at 5 of dea's 21 field divisions . these included seattle , washington ; houston , texas ; miami , florida ; washington , d.c. ; and atlanta , georgia . as part of these interviews , we obtained dea program officials' perspectives on how they carry out diversion investigations and how they work with other federal , state , and local agencies , as well as registrants in carrying out investigatory activities . these field divisions were selected on the basis of a mix of criteria such as the range of the highest volumes of regulatory and criminal cases and civil penalties ; geographic diversity ; and other considerations . within each field division , we also contacted and interviewed officials of state boards of pharmacy and medicine to obtain information on how dea coordinates with their agencies . in order to better understand how dea is using its squads to respond to criminal diversion , we interviewed dea officials and officials from state and local agencies participating in the squads to obtain information on how criminal diversion investigations are carried out and how dea coordinates those investigations .
