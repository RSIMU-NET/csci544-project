we disagree . we believe we have given credit to unaids for progress in a number of areas , several of which were of specific concern in our 1998 report . for example , the report highlights increased u.n. and international commitment and funding to hiv / aids efforts , as well as a broadened approach to addressing hiv / aids from one that was exclusively health oriented to one that is now multisectoral . further , the report notes the progress made on technical support and best practices , tracking the epidemic , and increasing u.n. coordination . however , our report also focused on those areas most needing improvement — namely , unaids' country - level efforts and monitoring and evaluation of unaids' progress and results . these are areas that the department of state , usaid , and unaids agree need improvement . where appropriate , we have modified our report and included some additional information . second , unaids commented that the report will be out of date by the time it is issued . we disagree . the changing political climate surrounding hiv / aids issues does not negate the report's conclusions and recommendations . for example , unaids' comments stated that not only did they agree that hiv / aids - related efforts at the country level need strengthening but that these efforts will certainly remain the central theme for “at least the next decade.” furthermore , the current debate to establish a $7 billion to $10 billion global trust fund to address the hiv / aids crisis in developing countries makes the issues cited in our report even more timely and critical . the challenges unaids faced in mobilizing international support for hiv / aids efforts , marshalling donors' financial commitments , and establishing a system to evaluate program results are important lessons learned that should inform the current debate on a new global aids trust fund . unaids' comments also noted that documentation used to support the report was largely constructed with data compiled from the previous year . we used the most current data supplied by unaids and other information to conduct our analysis , including several of unaids' and its governing board's commissioned evaluations . in addition , we conducted our own survey of usaid missions to obtain perspective on unaids' country - level efforts in december 2000 . third , unaids noted that the report contained selective quotations from several of unaids' evaluations and surveys of specific functions , at the same time pointing out that unaids' monitoring and evaluation efforts are insufficient . we believe our use of available data and information contained in unaids' evaluations was appropriate for depicting the steps taken in and weaknesses of unaids' efforts . however , while this information was useful , it does not provide the results of unaids' overall efforts or progress made toward its objectives . with bilateral and other donors responding to unaids' call for increased resources to combat hiv / aids , a quality monitoring and evaluation effort , which includes a clearly defined mission , long - term strategic and short - term goals , measurement of performance against defined goals , and public reporting of results , is even more important .
