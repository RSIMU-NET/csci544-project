the challenges are significant . our subsequent work will focus on the progress agencies are making toward overcoming these challenges to better manage for results . the first theme focuses on the budget process and asserts that performance should inform agency resource decisions during budget formulation and implementation . infusing performance information into budgetary deliberations may improve the agency's ability to manage for results by increasing the likelihood that resource allocation decisions will reflect performance concerns . for example , performance information should be used to support claims for resources , to evaluate those claims , and to make decisions on tradeoffs between competing needs . for both budget formulation and implementation , theme 1 practices emphasize communication and feedback between agency management and its program and other offices about the resources needed to achieve agency performance goals and objectives . during budget formulation , agency management should provide context in the form of general guidance to program managers on proposed agency goals , existing performance issues , and resource constraints . theme 1: performance informs budget formulation and implementation for budget formulation , agency management: provides general guidance to program officials on agency goals , performance issues , and resource requests input from program officials on the relative priority of new and existing programs and proposed changes to funding levels based on a review of changes in costs , performance issues , and other relevant factors ; uses the input on relative priorities , changes in costs , performance issues , and other factors to weigh competing needs and decide funding levels for existing and new programs ; communicates management's decisions to program officials ; and provides an opportunity to appeal the decisions ; coordinates with other entities to achieve common goals and avoid duplication ; justifies its budget request both within the agency and externally ( eg , with the department , the congress , omb ) in terms of how requested funds will contribute to the accomplishment of agency informs its staff of departmental , omb , and congressional actions on the budget request and obtains feedback from program officials on the implications of those actions for agency goals . for budget implementation , agency management: provides guidance to program officials on changes in agency goals , performance issues , and requests updated information from program officials on the relative priority of new and existing programs and proposed changes to funding levels based on a review of changes in costs , performance issues , and other relevant factors ; uses the input on relative priorities , changes in costs , performance issues , and other factors to weigh competing needs and decide existing and new program funding levels ; communicates its decisions about funding allocations ; and provides an opportunity to appeal the decisions ; allocates funding in a timely manner ; routinely monitors performance , spending , and budgetary resources and adjusts allocations as necessary to maximize performance against goals ; uses input from program officials on how changes in funding allocations will affect performance ; coordinates program requests for postappropriations budget changes , requests input from program officials on the implications of those changes for agency goals , and communicates the results .
