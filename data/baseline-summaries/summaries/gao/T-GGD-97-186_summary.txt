withstand a taxpayer challenge . while we recognize the complexity of the internal revenue code and the difficulties faced by both irs and the taxpayer in determining the “correct tax,” the fact remains that audit recommendations that do not withstand such a challenge may have imposed an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer . for this reason , in our previous work , we supported the need to measure taxes recommended but advocated balancing that indicator with others such as taxes ultimately collected . our work also pointed out that developing an indicator of taxes ultimately collected from audits would be challenging . for example , the time lag between an audit and the ultimate tax collected makes linking the two problematic . irs is working on developing a way of determining the ultimate taxes collected . in addition to indicators of audit performance , irs also has nine audit standards to provide guidance to auditors on minimizing the time spent on an audit , checking large and unusual claims on tax returns , probing for unreported income , and preparing adequate audit workpapers ( see app . iii for all nine standards ) . it differs from the regular cash - t in that the auditor does it before meeting with taxpayers , relying on information reported on tax returns . 2 ) bank deposit analysis , in which the auditor verifies that the taxpayer's bank deposits are consistent with the income reported on the tax return . to do our work , we randomly sampled from the universe of audits closed in irs districts in which irs scheduled meetings with taxpayers to review their records . these samples covered 1992-93 and 1995-96 and were both projectable to universes of about a half million audits . results will not be available until 1998 . recognizing the difficulties in collecting data about treatment and burden , we believe that this survey may begin to provide better information about taxpayer treatment and burden but its usefulness will need to be evaluated . irs has established some indicators for measuring its audit performance . however , existing indicators primarily focus on interim results without also considering final results from the audits . similarly , irs has established nine audit standards to guide its auditors . however , the standards do not provide objective criteria on when to use particular audit techniques . these nine standards do not address the proper treatment of taxpayers . further , although the standards provide guidance on the proper depth and breadth of audits given the time available , they provide little objective guidance to auditors on when to use particular audit techniques such as those related to an analysis of a taxpayer's financial status . to ensure adherence to the standards , irs relies on managers' oversight of auditors . however , according to irs officials , these managers cannot review all audits because their workloads limit the time available for review . as audits close throughout the year , separate groups of irs staff supplement the managerial review process by reviewing a small sample of audits to measure adherence to the nine standards ( see appendix iii for measurement results in fiscal years 1992 through 1996 ) .
