ii ) . this estimate increased from 1997 to 2005 because it is annually updated with the previous years' flooding activity . to date , fema has not determined how it will use the 2005 catastrophic losses from hurricanes katrina , rita , and wilma in its 2006 or subsequent average historical loss year calculations . fema's estimates ( in ranges ) for probable maximum loss in the event of a catastrophic loss year gradually increased from $6 – 9 billion in 1998 ( the first year the estimate was made ) to $8 – 11 billion in 2000 , $9 – 12 billion in 2002 , and to $11 – 15 billion in 2005 . a cotr is assigned to each contract . the cotr is authorized to act on behalf of the contracting officer to monitor the contract . however , the cotr is not authorized to make any contractual commitments or contractual changes on behalf of fema ; any changes that the contractor deems may affect the contract , price , terms , or conditions are referred to the contracting officer in the acquisition operations branch for action . each cotr is assisted by monitors , who review and report on technical aspects of the contractor's performance such as compliance with specific contract terms . overall , data relating to the number of nfip policies and amount of insurance coverage indicated upward trends for the period we reviewed and most losses were paid for hurricane - related claims , primarily due to losses from the 2005 hurricane season . the number of policies in force increased 36 percent and the average amount of coverage increased 78 percent from 1997 through 2006 , consistent with average rising home values . the average premium per flood - insurance policy decreased 3 percent , but when analyzed by flood risk zone , average premiums increased in the high - risk coastal flood zone , from about $1,039 in 1997 to more than $1,400 in 2006 . over this period , total losses fluctuated from a low of $302 million in 2000 to a high of $2 billion in 2004 before reaching more than $17.7 billion in 2005 . in 5 of the 10 years reviewed , less than 10 percent of losses paid out were linked to hurricane - related damage , and over the 10-year period cumulative losses for repetitive loss properties increased from $3.7 billion to $7.9 billion . fema's estimates for average historical loss and catastrophic loss increased over this 10-year period . finally , analysis by occupancy type shows more than 90 percent of policyholders owned residential properties ( single and two - four family homes ) or condominiums , and the majority of these properties were found in zones that fema designated as high risk . for additional statistical and trend data , see appendixes ii - vi . the number of federal flood insurance policies in force increased from 3.96 million in 1997 to 5.40 million at the end of 2006 , an increase of 36 percent . the number of policies increased from 1 to 6 percent each year from 1997 through 2005 , but increased 12 percent the year after the gulf coast hurricanes ( see fig .
