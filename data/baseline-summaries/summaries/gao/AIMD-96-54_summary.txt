however , this is not the case . the navy comptroller treasury amount contains disbursement and collection information from various financial registers that are not made available to the nadeps . as a result , the cerps and navy comptroller treasury amounts do not agree . when the nadeps perform cash reconciliations between their activity records and departmental records , they can usually reconcile the differences between the activity and cerps amounts being reported , for example , differences that occur in the timing of when transactions are recorded in the activities records versus when the transactions are reported to the treasury . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . we provided a draft of this report to dod for comment . on march 20 , 1996 , we discussed the facts , conclusions , and recommendations in our draft report with cognizant dod officials and have incorporated their comments where appropriate . the fund's financial reports are untimely , incomplete , and inaccurate and , therefore , do not provide fund managers with the information they need to manage cash . specifically , we found that ( 1 ) the monthly financial reports do not contain cash balances for each individual fund business area , ( 2 ) collection and disbursement data are not timely since the data are reported approximately 3 to 4 weeks after the month in which the transaction took place , and ( 3 ) monthly financial reports do not fully disclose billions of dollars of adjustments made to accounts receivable and payable balances , which could mask the actual amount of future collections and disbursements . in may 1995 , the naval audit service reported that the navy fund supply management business area inappropriately reported estimated collections resulting from sales rather than actual collections . while estimating collections based on sales has been a long - standing navy practice since ships and other activities are sometimes late in reporting actual collections , current dod and dfas guidance states that collections from sales are to be based on actual collection transactions and not estimates . because this guidance was not followed , the navy's ( aviation supply office ) cash was overstated by $670 million on dod's and the treasury's accounting records . dod agreed with the naval audit service's finding that the navy / dfas should not be estimating collections for the navy aviation supply office . the overstatement of cash occurred when the navy and dfas implemented an accounting system change . because of the change , duplicate collections were reported when dfas paying offices estimated collections for the naval aviation supply office in one financial transaction register while actual collections were being reported in another register .
