we acknowledge this in our report . however , we believe that it is equally important to point out that , although dsic's report contained many examples of the problems it found with the authority's procurement practices , the report did not explain the basis for the statement that the authority generally followed its streamlined procurement for all the contracts reviewed . the report was unclear as to whether this conclusion applied to all of the 109 contracts or some portion of the contracts . in addition , dsic officials were not able to provide any documentation to support this statement . dsic made several recommendations to the authority to address the problems it identified and said in its january 1999 report that the authority had begun to act on them . in a january 13 , 1999 , letter to dsic , the authority stated that it would begin developing cost estimates of the hours needed to perform had assigned a procurement specialist to maintain its contractor files and use a standardized contract file folder and checklist to maintain accountability , had established an informal 3 week minimum response time for all its solicitations to encourage competition resulting in lower costs , and would continue to make resources available to incorporate education and training for all staff involved in its contracting activities . we believe that , if effectively implemented , the actions the authority says it has taken and plans to take should help correct some of the problems that both dsic and we identified . in addition , we believe other factors that were not addressed by dsic's recommendations may have contributed to the failure of authority staff to follow the procurement regulations . first , while the authority's executive director delegated contracting responsibilities to various members of the authority's staff , he had not fully defined areas of responsibility and accountability among the contracting staff . for example , while the authority's former executive director signed the contracts as the contracting officer , it was not always apparent who was responsible for ensuring that key contract award and administration decisions were documented and maintained in the contract files . in its comments on a draft of our report , the authority disagreed with our statement that its executive director had not fully defined the areas of responsibility and accountability among the contracting staff and that it was not always apparent who was responsible for ensuring that key contract award and administration decisions were documented and maintained in the contract files . we do not agree with the authority's position . the authority suggests , without actually stating so , that the authority and managing total performance had an oral agreement to extend the contract beyond its stated term . we did , as previously pointed out , find instances of invoices stamped paid without annotation of approval or written certification of satisfactory contractor performance . finally , in reference to our statement that there was no evidence in the contract files that the authority received the required deliverables for three of the nine contracts we assessed , the authority commented that it has never been the authority's practice to require that copies of deliverables and invoices be kept in the contract files .
