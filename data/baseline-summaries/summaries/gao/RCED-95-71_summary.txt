fig . 1.1 shows amtrak's route network . amtrak's first full year of operation was 1972 . although the route system today is not much larger than the one operated in 1973 , it now carries about 30 percent more passengers , serves 22 percent more stations , and operates about 29 percent more train miles . ( see table 1.1. ) in 1971 , amtrak took over routes from all but three of the railroads that were providing passenger service at the time . in return for relief from their obligation as common carriers to provide passenger service , the railroads turned over their passenger cars and locomotives to amtrak . the original fleet of over 1,500 cars averaged more than 22 years in age . in 1994 , amtrak's fleet of 1,900 cars still included about 435 of the original passenger cars . amtrak eventually took over control of yards , stations , train service employees , and reservation offices . by 1976 , most of amtrak's services , other than those provided by train and engine crews , were provided by amtrak's own employees . using $120 million provided by the congress , amtrak purchased 103 miles of track between philadelphia and harrisburg , pennsylvania ; 83 miles joining kalamazoo with michigan city ; 62 miles linking new haven , connecticut , and springfield , massachusetts ; and 12 miles near albany , new york . in addition , amtrak acquired about 400 miles of the northeast corridor — between washington , d.c. , and boston — from the estate of the bankrupt penn central railroad . the freight railroads , however , own the rest of the track over which amtrak operates . the rail passenger service act grants amtrak the right to use freight railroads' tracks , and amtrak is expected to pay the incremental costs that the freight railroads incur to maintain the tracks for passenger service.the freight railroads also provide dispatching and emergency services for amtrak trains operating on their systems . in recent years , amtrak has paid about $90 million annually for these services . amtrak compensates the freight railroads according to individual agreements established in 1971.these agreements expire april 30 , 1996 . amtrak's primary function is operating the 25,000-mile intercity passenger rail route system that serves 44 states . amtrak operates about 350 trains to serve 6 routes in the northeast corridor , 17 short - distance routes ( under 500 miles ) , and 20 long - distance routes . thirteen of these routes are partially funded by eight states under section 403 ( b ) of the rail passenger service act ; three of these routes are fully funded by two states under section 403 ( d ) of the act . amtrak generated $1.4 billion in revenues in fiscal year 1994 and had $2.4 billion in expenses . its federal subsidy was $909 million . passenger - related services generated 65 percent of amtrak's revenues in fiscal year 1994 ( see fig . 1.2 ) but covered only about 38 percent of the expenses . another 19 percent of amtrak's revenues came from commuter rail service , which amtrak operates in seven metropolitan areas under contract to state or local transportation authorities .
