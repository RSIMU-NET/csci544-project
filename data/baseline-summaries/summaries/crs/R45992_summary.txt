the ineligibility clause . article i , section 6 , clause 2 provides ( among other things ) that no member of congress shall "be appointed" during his or her term "to any civil office under the authority of the united states , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time[.] the first two of these clauses are the focus of this report . for most of their history , the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses ( collectively , the emoluments clauses or the clauses ) were little discussed and largely unexamined by the courts . recent litigation involving the president , however , has led to multiple federal court decisions more fully addressing the clauses' scope and application . but like the other issues raised in recent litigation involving the emoluments clauses , further review of the application of these doctrines is possible . ultimate resolution of the issues is thus uncertain and will likely depend on the nature of the plaintiff involved . if the courts lack jurisdiction to enforce the emoluments clauses , the political process would be the remaining avenue for enforcement . in this vein , congress could seek to enforce the emoluments clauses through legislation , political pressure , or potentially impeachment and removal . for instance , given that the foreign emoluments clause explicitly provides a role for congress in evaluating the propriety of the receipt of foreign emoluments by federal officers , congress may be empowered to create civil or criminal remedies for violations or establish prophylactic reporting requirements through legislation . indeed , one bill from the 115th congress would have required certain reports and divestiture of personal financial interests of the president posing a potential conflict of interest , among other things . resolutions have also been introduced in the 115th and 116th congresses objecting to perceived violations of the foreign emoluments clause , as well as calling on the president to take certain actions based on alleged potential violations . that said , it is unclear whether legislative actions would provide an effective means to enforce the emoluments clauses against the president , given the possibility of veto and potential separation - of - powers objections . as noted above , the adequacy of these legislative options has been a central issue in the congressional litigation as it relates to members' standing , and the issue is subject to further review at the appellate level . black's law dictionary defines an "emolument" as an "advantage , profit , or gain received as a result of one's employment or one's holding of office. some scholars argue that this employment - or office - centric definition of the term is the definition encompassed by the emoluments clauses , meaning that the clauses prohibit covered officials from receiving compensation "for the personal performance of services" as an officer or employee but do not bar "ordinary business transactions" between a covered official and government . any "profit , gain , advantage , or benefit . others argue that the term "emolument" is broader in scope , applying to any profit , gain , advantage , or benefit .
