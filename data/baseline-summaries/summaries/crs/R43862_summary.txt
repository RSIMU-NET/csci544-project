( s. rept . 90-1137 , p. 19 ) the ability for annual authorizations to influence subsequent funding decisions is affected by the extent to which they are enacted ahead of appropriations . after the nsf's requirement for an annual authorization was enacted ( p.l . 90-407 ) , the 15 subsequent annual reauthorizations became law an average of almost one month after the beginning of the fiscal year , and only three times were they enacted before the beginning of the fiscal year ( fy1978 , fy1980 , and fy1986 ) . the enactment of appropriations , however , usually waited until the annual authorization was completed with only three of the 15 being enacted ahead of it ( fy1972 , fy1977 , and fy1979 ) . in general , these annual authorizations were followed by appropriations that were at somewhat lower levels than the amount authorized . of the 12 annual authorizations that were enacted prior to appropriations , all but one ( fy1986 ; p.l . 99-383 ) subsequently received lower level of appropriations . in those 11 instances , the amount appropriated was an average of almost 7% lower than the amount authorized , ranging from about 1% lower in fy1980 , to almost 24% lower in fy1969 . starting in 1977 , congress began to actively debate transitioning the nsf to a multiyear authorization of appropriations . this change was advocated by the carter administration and some senators on the committee on human resources because it was believed that a multiyear authorization would promote continuity for planning basic research and more time to assess the effectiveness of programs . many members of the house science committee argued , however , that an annual authorization would promote better congressional control and oversight of the foundation . although the conference report for the fy1978 reauthorization addressed the possibility of a two - year authorization of appropriation , it concluded that it was not suitable at that time . the following fiscal year , while the senate committee proposed authorizations of appropriations for both fy1979 and fy1980 ( s. 2549 ) , authorization levels for only a single fiscal year were ultimately enacted into law ( p.l . over the next ten years , most legislative proposals covered only a single fiscal year , and all that were enacted were annual in nature . in fy1989 , both the house and senate proposed multiyear authorizations , and the enacted law authorized appropriations through fy1993 ( p.l . one of the primary purposes of this reauthorization was to promote the "doubling" of the nsf budget over the next five fiscal years and to establish a program directed at academic facility modernization . the next reauthorization , for fy1998-fy2000 , authorized modest increases for the agency — about 10% in fy1999 and growth slightly above projected inflation in fy2000 ( p.l . the next reauthorization advocated more substantial increases in the agency budget — from about $5 billion in fy2003 , to almost $10 billion in fy2007 ( p.l . late in this period , there was some dispute between congress and the president with regard to both issues .
