appendix a . history of the part b premium statutory policy and legislative authority the basis for determining the part b premium amount has changed several times since the inception of the medicare program , reflecting different legislative views of what share beneficiaries should bear as expenditures have increased . when the medicare program first went into effect in july 1966 , the part b monthly premium was set at a level to cover 50% of part b program costs . legislation enacted in 1972 limited the annual percentage increase in the premium to the same percentage by which social security benefits were adjusted for changes in the cost - of - living adjustments ( i.e. , colas ) . under this formula , revenues from premiums soon dropped from 50% to below 25% of program costs because part b program costs increased much faster than inflation as measured by the consumer price index on which the social security cola is based ( see table a - 1 ) . from the early 1980s , congress regularly voted to set part b premiums at a level to cover 25% of program costs , in effect overriding the cola limitation . the 25% provisions first became effective january 1 , 1984 , with general revenues covering the remaining 75% of part b program costs . premiums increased in 1989 as a result of the medicare catastrophic coverage act of 1988 ( p.l . 100-360 ) , which added a catastrophic coverage premium to the part b premium . the act was repealed in november 1989 , and the part b premium for 1990 fell as a result . congress returned to the general approach of having premiums cover 25% of program costs in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 ( obra 90 ; p.l . however , obra 90 set specific dollar figures , rather than a percentage , in law for part b premiums for the years 1991-1995 . these dollar figures reflected congressional budget office estimates of what 25% of program costs would be over the five - year period . however , program costs grew more slowly than anticipated , in part due to subsequent legislative changes . as a result , the 1995 premium of $46.10 actually represented 31.5% of medicare part b program costs . the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 ( obra 93 ; p.l . 103-66 ) extended the policy of setting the part b premium at a level to cover 25% of program costs for the years 1996-1998 . as was the case prior to 1991 , a percentage rather than a fixed dollar figure was used , which meant that the 1996 premium ( $42.50 ) and the 1997 premium ( $43.80 ) were lower than the 1995 premium ( $46.10 ) . the balanced budget act of 1997 ( bba 97 ; p.l . 105-33 ) permanently set the premium at 25% of program costs so that , generally speaking , premiums rise or fall with part b program costs . the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ; p.l . 108-173 ) , as modified by the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ; p.l .
