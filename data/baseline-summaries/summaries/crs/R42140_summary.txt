it was also known as the national road . in 1816 , president james madison proposed federal funding for a system of internal improvements ( including roads ) in the states , asking that the constitution be amended to let the federal government finance and construct the projects . a bill to finance internal improvements with funds from a bonus payment from the bank of the united states passed congress in 1817 . the stp program allowed spending on roads that many in the transportation community previously considered to be below the federal level of responsibility . these changes were magnified by a broadening of the states' abilities to transfer other highway program funds to stp . on june 9 , 1998 , the transportation equity act for the 21 st century ( tea - 21 ) ( p.l . 838 ) provided for the designation of a national system of interstate highways by federal and state officials , not to exceed 40,000 miles , unless additional mileage was necessary . no funds , however , were authorized or appropriated for the interstate highway system . instead , the act appropriated $225 million for primary roads in each of the first three post - war years , $150 million for secondary and feeder road projects , and $125 million for urban federal - aid highway construction . the act established apportionment formulas for each state . although an interstate highway system had been proposed in 1913 by the national highway association , the federal - aid highway act of 1952 ( p.l . 82-413 , 66 stat . 158 ) , which authorized $25 million for the interstate system on a 50% federal - 50% state matching basis , was the first law to allot funds specifically for interstate construction . president dwight d. eisenhower was instrumental in implementing the interstate highway system , adding a specific national defense dimension to the concept , among other things . the federal - aid highway act of 1954 ( p.l . 83-350 , 68 stat . 97-134 , 95 stat . 70 ) authorized $175 million for the interstate system for fy1956 , and $175 million for fy1957 , both to be used in a 60-40 federal - state matching ratio . in 1956 , federal aid for highways increased dramatically with the passage of the federal aid highway and highway revenue acts of 1956 ( p.l . 84-627 , 70 stat 374 ) . the act authorized an additional $1 billion for fy1957 , $1.7 billion for fy1958 , and $2 billion for fy1959 . the act created the highway trust fund to ensure a source of financing for the national system of interstate and defense highways . since that time , tax revenues have been directed to the highway trust fund derived from excise taxes on highway motor fuel and truck - related taxes on the sale of truck tires , trailers , and heavy vehicles . ( for an overview of the trust fund activities , see table 1 . ) prior to the creation of the trust fund , federal financial assistance to highways came from the general fund of the u.s. treasury .
