data are for 1955 to 2013 . the beginning year of 1955 is used because that is the first year that the ces survey provides data on the number of employees by level of government ( i.e. , federal , state , and local governments ) . in the ces , federal employment includes civilian employees only ; the military is not included . the number of people employed in both the private and public sectors has increased steadily as the u.s. economy has grown . from 1955 to 2013 , employment in the private sector increased by 70.8 million jobs ( from 43.7 million to 114.5 million ) , while employment in the public sector grew by 14.8 million jobs ( from 7.0 million to 21.9 million after rounding ) . ( see figure 1 . ) from 2007 to 2010 — during and after the 2007-2009 recession — private sector employment fell by an estimated 7.9 million jobs , while public sector employment increased by almost 272,000 jobs . federal workers are older than employees of state and local governments . in 2013 , 56.7% of federal workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 49.7% of state employees and 52.1% of employees of local governments . the age gap between private and public sector workers increased from 1976 to 2001 , but has fallen since . in 1976 , 35.5% of public sector workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 33.8% of private sector workers ( a gap of 1.6 percentage points after rounding ) . by 2001 , the gap had increased to 14.3 points . in 2013 , the gap had fallen to 9.3 points . older workers typically have more years of work experience than younger workers . employees with more work experience generally earn more than workers with less experience . thus , the age difference between private and public sector workers may indicate that public sector workers have more years of experience than private sector workers . in turn , a difference in work experience may be reflected in differences in earnings between private and public sector workers . reflecting the increased participation of women in the labor force , the share of jobs held by women has increased in both the private and public sectors . however , women hold a higher share of jobs in the public sector than in the private sector , and this difference has increased over time . ( see figure 7 . ) the higher share of jobs held by women in the public sector is due mainly to the higher share of jobs held by women in state and local governments . in 2013 , women held almost three - fifths of full - time jobs in state and local governments ( 57.7% for both state and local governments ) . by contrast , women held approximately two - fifths of full - time jobs in the federal government and in the private sector ( 42.2% and 41.7% , respectively ) . the largest increase in the share of jobs held by women has been in state governments .
