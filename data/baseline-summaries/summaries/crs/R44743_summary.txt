knauff v. shaughnessy . there , the court rejected a challenge to the exclusion of a german "war bride" under regulations promulgated pursuant to presidential proclamation 2523 , which was itself issued under the authority of a predecessor of section 215 ( a ) . it also briefly notes other provisions . the provisions currently in section 212 ( f ) — which have been part of the ina since its enactment in 1952 — state , in relevant part , that whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states , he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate . legislative history materials from the time of the ina's enactment suggest that these provisions were seen to grant the president broad authority to bar or impose conditions upon the entry of aliens , and presidents over the years have relied upon section 212 ( f ) to suspend or restrict the entry of various groups of aliens , often ( although not always ) in conjunction with the imposition of financial sanctions upon them . among those so excluded have been aliens whose actions "threaten the peace , security , or stability of libya" ; officials of the north korean government or the workers' party of north korea ; aliens who have participated in "serious human rights violations" ; and others noted in table 1 below . neither the text of section 212 ( f ) nor the case law to date suggests any firm legal constraints upon the president's exercise of his authority under section 212 ( f ) , as is explained below . however , future executive actions under ina § 212 ( f ) could potentially be seen to raise legal issues that have not been prompted by the executive's prior exercise of this authority . beyond section 212 ( f ) , other provisions of the ina can also be seen to authorize the executive to restrict aliens' entry to the united states . most notably , section 214 ( a ) ( 1 ) prescribes that the "admission of any alien to the united states as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as [the executive] may by regulations prescribe. ( nonimmigrants are aliens admitted to the united states for a specific period of time and purpose pursuant to one of the "lettered" visas set forth in section 101 ( a ) ( 15 ) of the ina. ) section 215 ( a ) ( 1 ) similarly provides that "it shall be unlawful for any alien" to enter or depart the united states "except under such reasonable rules , regulations , and orders , and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the president may prescribe. in the past , the executive has relied upon section 215 ( a ) ( 1 ) , in particular , to exclude certain aliens .
