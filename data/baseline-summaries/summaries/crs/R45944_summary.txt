appendix a . review of the backstop and the rejected withdrawal deal under former united kingdom ( uk ) prime minister theresa may , the approach of the uk government to leaving the european union ( eu ) was to pursue a relatively hard brexit , meaning a full departure from the eu single market and customs union , and a full restoration of british sovereignty over lawmaking , including with regard to controlling immigration . the approach called for the uk to subsequently negotiate a free trade agreement with the eu to secure as much access to the eu market as possible . in november 2018 , eu and uk negotiators finalized a 585-page draft withdrawal agreement and a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship . the withdrawal agreement contained four main elements to guide the uk's orderly departure from the eu: guarantees pertaining to the rights of the approximately 3 million eu citizens residing in the uk and the approximately 1 million uk citizens residing in the eu . a commitment by the uk to pay the eu â£39 billion ( approximately $50 billion ) to settle outstanding budgetary and financial pledges . a transition period , lasting through 2020 , in which the uk would be bound to follow all rules governing the eu single market while the two sides negotiate their future relationship and implement steps needed to effect an orderly separation . a backstop provision , which would keep the uk in the eu customs union until the two sides agreed on their future trade relationship . the backstop was made necessary by the lack of an apparent solution to the irish border question , with both sides intent on avoiding a hard border with customs checks and physical infrastructure between northern ireland and the republic of ireland . the provision was intended to protect cross - border trade and preserve the peace process between parties to northern ireland's long sectarian conflict . the eu also viewed the backstop as necessary to ensure that brexit would not violate the rules and structure of the eu single market . the nonbinding political declaration on the future uk - eu relationship called for an economic partnership with the eu that features an ambitious free trade area and deep cooperation , but also "separate markets and distinct legal orders," and the development of an independent uk trade policy . the backstop provision became one of the main obstacles to securing parliament's approval of the withdrawal agreement . although the former may government contended that it would never be necessary to implement the backstop , critics noted that the uk would be unable to conduct an independent national trade policy , one of the main selling points for brexit's supporters , as long as the uk remained a member of the eu customs union . ( the backstop would have taken effect at the conclusion of the transition periodâthat is , at the end of 2020âif the two sides had not reached a new trade agreement with more preferable arrangements for resolving the border issue. )
