various issues are discussed in the following sections . given that the balance of the abandoned mine reclamation fund is less than 20% of the estimated unfunded reclamation needs , congress may consider whether and how to fund the remaining coal reclamation needs . abandoned coal mining sites that remain unreclaimed are expected to continue to pose hazards to public health , safety , and the environment . if the coal reclamation fees are not reauthorized beyond fy2021 , section 401 of smcra directs the unappropriated balance of the abandoned mine reclamation fund to be distributed among eligible states over a series of fiscal years beginning in fy2023 based on what the state received in fy2022 as its share of fee collections from the prior year . those payments would continue in that same amount each fiscal year thereafter until the balance of the fund is expended . in fy2020 , osmre reported that the unappropriated balance of the abandoned mine reclamation fund was approximately $2.2 billion . reclamation grants to eligible states therefore would likely continue for some years , even if coal reclamation fees were not reauthorized after fy2021 . these federal payments augment employer contributions to these plans . interest transfers from the abandoned mine reclamation fund have supported the umwa health benefit plans since fy1996 , supplemented by payments from the general fund of the u.s. treasury since fy2008 . if the coal reclamation fees are not reauthorized , one potential option for congress would be to appropriate from the general fund to meet remaining needs after the balance of the abandoned mine reclamation fund is expended . congress was faced with a similar issue in the debate over the reauthorization of superfund excise taxes for the superfund trust fund under cercla ( p.l . from the enactment of cercla in 1980 through fy1995 , the balance of the superfund trust fund was provided by revenues from the collection of a superfund excise tax on petroleum , chemical feedstocks , corporate income , transfers from the general fund , and other receipts . the authority to collect those superfund excise taxes expired in fy1995 , leaving revenues from the general fund as the primary source of money to the superfund trust fund . the abandoned mine land reclamation fee extension act ( s. 1193 ) , introduced in the 116 th congress , would amend section 402 ( b ) of smcra , extending the fee collection authorization date until september 30 , 2036 . as introduced , s. 1193 would authorize osmre to collect coal reclamation fees under section 402 , and osmre would begin fixed payments from the unappropriated balance on the abandoned mine reclamation fund to uncertified states beginning in fy2023 based upon their fy2022 grants , according to section 401 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( b ) . the surface mining control and reclamation act amendments of 2019 ( h.r . 4248 ) would amend section 402 ( b ) of smcra and section 401 ( f ) of smcra . this bill would extend the fee collection authorization date until september 30 , 2036 , and grants to eligible states and tribes would continue to be paid out annually according to the statutory formula until after fy2037 .
