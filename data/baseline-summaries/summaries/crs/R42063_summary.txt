both have changed over time . between 1950 and 2000 , the civilian labor force grew at an average annual rate of 1.6% . the growth rate has slowed since then and is expected to continue doing so partly as a result of the aging of the baby - boom generation . between 2000 and 2010 , the annual rate of labor force growth fell to 0.8% . it is projected to fall further , to 0.7% per year on average , between 2010 andÂ 2020 . predicting productivity growth is more difficult than predicting labor force growth . economists had , until recently , identified three time periods that correspond with three different trend rates of growth in productivity . between 1947 and 1973 , output per hour of labor in the private nonfarm business sector grew at an annual rate of 2.8% . between 1973 and 1995 , productivity slowed to an annual average rate of 1.4% . between 1995 and 2005 , it accelerated to 2.9% per year . since then ( 2005-2011 ) , the rate of productivity growth has slowed to 1.6% annually . if recent trends in labor force and productivity growth continue , real gdp growth above about 2.5% will be needed to push down the unemployment rate from its currently elevated level . "more specifically , according to currently accepted versions of okun's law , to achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the course of a year , real gdp must grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than the rate of growth of potential gdp over that period. as previously discussed , it is not unusual for some time to elapse between the start of an economic recovery and the start of a declining unemployment rate . suppose that two successive monthly declines are taken as the beginning of a meaningful downward trend in the unemployment rate . table 1 shows how long it has taken following the end of each of the 11 economic contractions for that trend to begin . at one extreme , it was well over a year following the start of the economy's rebound from the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions before the unemployment rate began to steadily decline . this contributed to the two periods being labeled jobless recoveries . at the other extreme , the unemployment rate began trending downward at five or fewer months after the end of five earlier recessions . the current recovery lies within but closer to the high - end of this range . as the unemployment rate experienced two successive monthly declines 12 months after the start of the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession , it too was dubbed a jobless recovery . not only has the length of time for the unemployment rate to begin falling varied by recovery , but its pace of decline also has varied . after eight of the eleven postwar recessions , it took at least eight months for the unemployment rate to fall by one full percentage point . the slowest decline occurred after the recession that ended in november 2001 when the unemployment rate stood at 5.5% , the lowest unemployment rate recorded at the start of an expansion .
