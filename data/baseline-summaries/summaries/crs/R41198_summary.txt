however , p.l . 111-173 , signed into law on may 27 , 2010 , clarifies that champva , sbhcp , and cwvv meet the minimum essential coverage requirement . subsequent to the passage of the aca , however , the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( p.l . 111-383 ) authorized a new tricare option now known as the tricare young adult program , that allows children up to age 26 who lose coverage under a parent's tricare policy , and who are not otherwise eligible to enroll in an employer - sponsored plan , to purchase tricare coverage for themselves . in general , eligibility for tricare under a parent's policy is lost when either a dependent child turns 23 ( if enrolled in an accredited school as a full - time student ) or 21 if not enrolled . section 1001 of aca amends part a of title xxvii of the public health service act ( phsa ) to add a new section 2714 specifying that a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that provides dependent coverage of children shall continue to make such coverage available until the dependent child turns 26 years of age . however , the provisions of title xxvii of the phsa do not appear to apply to tricare . coverage under the tricare program is governed by chapter 55 of title 10 , united states code . ยง1072 ( 2 ) ( d ) , the term "dependent" only includes a child who has not attained the age of 21 or has not attained the age of 23 and is enrolled in a full - time course of study at an institution of higher learning . section 702 of the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( p.l . 111-383 ) amended title 10 , to add a new section 1110b extending coverage to children up to age 26 who are not otherwise eligible to enroll in an employer - sponsored plan to purchase tricare coverage . the premium would be equal to the cost of the coverage as determined by the secretary of defense on an appropriate actuarial basis . the program is effective retroactively , not later than january 1 , 2011 . the program is known as the "tricare young adult program . for calendar year 2014 the monthly premium for a tricare young adult ( tya ) prime enrollee is $180 , and $156 for a tya standard enrollee . as of june 2012 , there were approximately 11,171 beneficiaries enrolled in tya standard and 6,407 in tya prime . the premium feature does make the tricare program dissimilar from the coverage mandated by aca . the aca provision amended the public health service act to include a section 2714 that provides: a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that provides dependent coverage of children shall continue to make such coverage available for an adult child ( who is not married ) until the child turns 26 years of age .
