this section describes the relationship between federal deficits and debt . this section provides a primer of how government deficits and debt are integrated into the larger economy in both the short and long run , and provides some ways to measure such interactions . 112-25 ) , as amended , and that certain tax policy changes enacted in the 2017 tax revision ( p.l . 115-97 ) and in other laws will expire as scheduled under current law . cbo projects increases in both interest rates and publicly held federal debt over the next 10 years , leading to a significant rise in u.s. net interest payments . cbo also provides alternative projections where such assumptions are revised . if discretionary spending increases with inflation after fy2019 , instead of proceeding in accordance with the limits instituted by the bca , and if tax reductions in the 2017 tax revision are extended , cbo projects that federal debt held by the public would increase to 97% of gdp by fy2029 . cbo also produces a long - term baseline that uses a number of additional assumptions to extend its standard baseline an additional 20 years ( thus the 2018 long - term baseline runs through fy2049 ) . the current long - term forecast projects that publicly held federal debt will equal 147% of gdp in fy2049 , which would exceed the highest stock of federal debt experienced in the fy1940-fy2018 period ( 106% of gdp in fy1946 ) . as noted above , cbo projects that publicly held federal debt will rise from 77.8% of gdp in fy2018 to 92.7% of gdp in fy2029 , and projects that the average interest rate on three - month treasury bills will rise from 1.66% in fy2017 to 2.81% in fy2029 . those factors combine to generate federal net interest payments of 3.0% of gdp in fy2029 under the cbo projections , which would be just under the highest amount paid from fy1940 through fy2017 ( 3.2% of gdp in fy1991 ) . it may be useful to compare the recent u.s. federal borrowing trajectory with the practices of international governments , because future interest rate and fiscal space considerations will both be affected by the behavior of other major actors . table 3 includes the general government debt history and projections for g - 7 countries and the european area from fy2000 to fy2023 . the worldwide impact of the great recession led to increased general gross debt levels for all g - 7 countries in 2013 relative to their 2000-2009 average . as shown in table 3 , u.s. debt levels rose by 40% of gdp over that time period , which was larger than increases in canada and the european area but smaller than rises in the united kingdom and japan . general debt levels largely stabilized from 2013 to 2018 , with decreases in germany and the european area and small increases in other countries . future projections of debt included in table 3 are characterized by a divergence between u.s. general gross debt levels and those in other g - 7 countries . both real deficits and real debt are projected to increase over the course of the 10-year budget window , which runs through fy2029 .
