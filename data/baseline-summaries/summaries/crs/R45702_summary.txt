this is discussed in more detail below . increased funding for cjs also coincides with increases to the discretionary budget caps under the budget control act of 2011 ( bca , p.l . the bca put into effect statutory limits on discretionary spending for fy2012-fy2021 . under the act , discretionary spending limits were scheduled to be adjusted downward each fiscal year until fy2021 . however , legislation was enacted that increased discretionary spending caps for fy2014 to fy2019 . a sequestration of discretionary funding , ordered pursuant to the bca , cut $2.973 billion out of the total amount congress and the president provided for cjs for fy2013 . since then , funding for cjs has increased as more discretionary funding has been allowed under the bca . figure 2 shows total cjs funding for fy2010-fy2019 by major component ( i.e. , the department of commerce , the department of justice , nasa , and the nsf ) . although decreased appropriations for the department of commerce ( a 47.4% reduction ) mostly explain the overall decrease in cjs appropriations from fy2010 to fy2013 , cuts in funding for doj ( - 8.7% ) and nasa ( - 9.8% ) also contributed . funding for nsf held relatively steady from fy2010 to fy2013 . overall cjs funding has increased since fy2014 , and this is partially explained by more funding for the department of commerce to help the census bureau prepare for the 2020 decennial census . while funding for the department of commerce decreased from fy2018 to fy2019 , it is partly the result of the department receiving $1.000 billion in emergency supplemental funding for fy2018 . if supplemental funding is excluded , appropriations for the department of commerce increased 2.5% from fy2018 to fy2019 . while increased funding for the department of commerce partially explains the overall increase in funding for cjs since fy2014 , there have also been steady increases in funding for doj ( +11.5% ) , nasa ( +21.8% ) , and nsf ( +12.6% ) , as higher discretionary spending caps have been used to provide additional funding to these agencies . also , increased funding for the department of commerce is not only the result of more funding for the census bureau . funding for noaa increased by 41.0% from fy2014 to fy2018 and funding for nist increased by 15.9% over the same time period . however , funding for both of these agencies decreased from fy2018 to fy2019 , meaning that the increase in the department of commerce's funding during this time period was almost solely attributable to increased funding for the census bureau . the proposal does not affect how much the administration requests for the atf for fy2020 . table 1 outlines the fy2019 funding and the administration's fy2020 request for the department of commerce , the department of justice , the science agencies , and the related agencies . figure 1 shows the total cjs funding for fy2010-fy2019 , in both nominal and inflation - adjusted dollars ( more - detailed historical appropriations data can be found in table 2 ) .
