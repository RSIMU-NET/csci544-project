appendix a . legislative history: path to the 2007Â reauthorization the improving head start for school readiness act of 2007 ( p.l . 110-134 ) marks the most recent reauthorization of the head start program since legislation in 1998 ( p.l . 105-285 ) authorized the program for fy1998-fy2003 . during the intervening years between fy2003 and fy2008 , head start continued to receive funding , even though attempts in the 108 th and 109 th congresses to reauthorize it were not successful . reauthorization efforts during the 108 th congress efforts to pass reauthorization legislation in the 108 th congress were not fully successful , as the house narrowly passed its bill ( h.r . 2210 , 108 th congress ) by one vote , and a markedly different bill emerged out of committee in the senate ( s. 1940 , 108 th congress ) , but was never brought to the floor . the house bill's passage followed a heated debate over proposals to allow state administration of head start in up to eight qualifying states , and to allow discrimination in employment of head start staff based on religion . the senate bill contained neither of those controversial provisions . both bills proposed to increase competition for head start grants and also to foster greater collaboration between head start and other entities providing early childhood services at the state and local level . likewise , both bills proposed to increase staff qualifications beyond the levels required by the legislation enacted in 1998 . the school readiness act of 2003 ( h.r . 2210 , as amended by the full committee on education and the workforce on june 19 , 2003 , included two titles ; the first would have amended sections of the 1998 head start law , and the second would have introduced a new option for eight qualifying states to administer their own federal head start funds . ( the bill as originally introduced would have provided this option to all qualifying states but as amended would have limited the option to eight qualifying states over the five - year period of the legislation. ) 2210 was reported from the full committee on education and the workforce with a vote of 27 ( republicans ) to 20 ( democrats ) , and subsequently was passed by the house by a one - vote margin of 217-216 . prior to passage , representative george miller offered a substitute bill on the floor that proposed to retain the changes to title i as included in h.r . 2210 , with the exception of the bill language allowing discrimination in employment based on religion . the substitute bill would have struck title ii ( the section proposing state demonstration projects ) . the miller amendment failed by a vote of 200-229 .
