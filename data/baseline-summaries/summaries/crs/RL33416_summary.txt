the poor in china lack not only economic but also political resources . workers are not allowed to form unions independent of the state - controlled all china federation of trade unions ( acftu ) . most reported protests , triggered by official unresponsiveness , corruption , violation of citizens' rights and laws , or repressive tactics by authorities , began peacefully . popular protests also have been further fueled by a growing awareness and understanding of legal rights . the prc government's efforts to address social unrest have been hampered by tensions between the central and local governments , institutional weaknesses , inconsistent policies , and the inability or unwillingness to undertake fundamental political reforms . urban development has displaced homes and farmland and created environmental degradation in the countryside . growing numbers of laid - off soe workers , workers in the sezs , peasants and urban residents who have lost their farmland or homes , and others have engaged in mass protests , some of them violent , often after having exhausted legal channels for resolving grievances . the central government has acknowledged that the grievances of many citizens have been legitimate , and occasionally has corrected local policies that have violated the law or punished local officials for employing excessively violent tactics against protesters . however , the state has reserved the authority to arbitrarily determine which protest activities are acceptable . it has not developed adequate institutions that protect human rights , cede political power to social groups , ensure judicial independence , and resolve social conflict . many small demonstrations have been tolerated , but marching , organizing , and talking to reporters have brought harassment and repression by government authorities . at the end of 2005 , the central government pledged a number of additional reforms aimed at rural unrest , including better management of land use , strengthening the legal system , protecting farmers' land , raising rural incomes , increasing social spending on health care and education , and abolishing the national tax on farmers . however , these policies will likely be resisted by local officials whose power remains unchecked and who are desperate to attract investment and prone to corruption . the prc government , at the national and local levels , has applied a carrot and stick approach , or a combination of appeasement and scare tactics , toward controlling restive social groups . experts have noted a pattern whereby government authorities allow demonstrations to grow , and even publicly sympathize with protesters , while taking time to identify group leaders . arrests of activists often take place only after some efforts have been made to mollify aggrieved individuals by meeting some of their demands . according to reports , public security agents typically use both torture and rewards to extract expressions of wrongdoing or guilt and to pit activists and neighbors against each other . scare tactics — the use of arbitrary detention and the employ of untrained security agents ( "hired thugs" ) to beat up protest leaders — help to quell further protest activity . when demonstrations get out of hand , the government strictly controls reporting of them , although in many cases , news leaks through the internet .
