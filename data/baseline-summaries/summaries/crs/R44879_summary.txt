t he federal government has no juvenile justice system of its own . rather , juvenile justice is administered by the states . the federal government , though , seeks to influence states' juvenile justice systems through the administration of grant programs and the provision of funds . this report provides a brief overview of funding for the juvenile justice - related grant programs administered by the department of justice's ( doj's ) office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) . from fy2010 to fy2017 , total funding for juvenile justice programs decreased by nearly 42% , from $424 million to $247 million . contributing to this drop , congress eliminated funding for the challenge grants in fy2011 and for the jabg program in fy2014 . during this time period , however , congress also started appropriating funding for programs that had not previously been funded under the juvenile justice programs account ( including funding for missing and exploited children programs , child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and practitioners , and grants and technical assistance in support of a national forum on youth violence prevention ) . after appropriating a low of $247 million for juvenile justice programs in fy2017 , congress increased funding in both fy2018 and fy2019 . congress increased funding for juvenile justice programs to nearly $283 million for fy2018 , and it included funds for a new opioid affected youth initiative . congress most recently appropriated $287 million for juvenile justice programs for fy2019 â€” the largest appropriation since the $424 million in fy2010 . historically , congress has set aside funding from the title v grant for gang prevention activities ; however , for fy2019 congress did not delineate funding for this purpose . it also did not include funding for community - based violence prevention , an administratively established initiative that had received appropriations since fy2010 . overall funding for juvenile justice programs , which had typically been above $500 million , peaked at $565 million in fy2002 . from fy2002 to fy2007 , however , overall funding fell by 38% to $348 million . appropriations for specific programs in the juvenile justice programs account can vary from year to year . the majority of this reduction came from cuts to the jabg program . appropriations for jabg fell from a high of $250 million in fy2002 to $49 million in fy2007 . from fy2007 to fy2010 , total funding for juvenile justice programs increased by almost 22% to $424 million , with funding for jjdpa programs increasing by 27% to $331 million over this same period . this was the largest juvenile justice appropriation since fy2003 . funding for juvenile justice programs again began to decline in fy2011 , and that decline generally continued through fy2017 . policymakers did , though , set aside money for an initiative serving children exposed to violence . table 1 provides a breakdown of funding for the juvenile justice programs account by program for the 10-year period from fy2010 to fy2019 . for example , starting in fy2012 , congress moved funding for missing and exploited children programs from the justice assistance account to the juvenile justice programs account .
