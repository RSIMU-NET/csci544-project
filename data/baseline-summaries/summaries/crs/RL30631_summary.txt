prior to p.l . 112-96 , all members of congress also became eligible for retirement annuities at an earlier age and with fewer years of service than most other federal employees . however , all members of congress and congressional staff also paid a higher percentage of salary for their retirement benefits than do most other federal employees before p.l . 112-96 was enacted . 112-96 decreased the fers benefit accrual rate ( used in the fers pension calculation ) for members first covered by fers ( or reelected with less than five years of fers service ) after december 31 , 2012 , to be the same as regular fers employees . therefore , the larger benefit per year of service is no longer available to members ( or congressional employees ) first covered by fers after december 31 , 2012 . second , p.l . 112-96 also increased the fers employee contributions by 1.8 percentage points for members of congress first covered by fers ( or reelected with less than five years of fers service ) after december 31 , 2012 . therefore , members newly covered by fers in 2013 are required to contribute 3.1% of pay to fers . subsequent to p.l . 112-96 , the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-67 ) further increased the fers employee contributions by an additional 1.3 percentage points for all individuals , including members of congress , first covered by fers ( or rehired / reelected with less than five years of fers service ) after december 31 , 2013 . therefore , under p.l . 113-67 , members of congress and other federal employees first covered by fers beginning in 2014 are required to contribute 4.4% of pay to fers . thus , for individuals first covered by fers after december 31 , 2012 , there is no longer a larger employee contribution under fers required for members and congressional employees in comparison with regular fers employees ; all of these groups contribute 3.1% of pay toward their fers annuity if first covered in 2013 or 4.4% of pay if first covered by fers after 2013 . members of congress first elected after december 31 , 2012 , however , remain eligible for retirement annuities under fers at earlier ages and with fewer years of service than most other federal employees . there were 611 retired members of congress receiving federal pensions based fully or in part on their congressional service as of october 1 , 2016 . of this number , 335 had retired under csrs and 276 had retired under fers . members who had retired under csrs had completed , on average , 23.5 years of civilian federal service . their average annual csrs annuity in 2016 was $74,028 . those who had retired under fers had completed , on average , 15.8 years of civilian federal service . their average retirement annuity in 2016 ( not including social security ) was $41,076 . the average age of retired members of congress receiving retirement annuities in 2016 was 76 for those who had retired under csrs and 73 for those who had retired under fers .
