3392 , and others ) . the obama administration has promulgated rules on co 2 emissions from current and future fossil fuel - burning power plants and entered into a global agreement to limit co 2 emissions . congress remains divided over those executive branch decisions . the fy2016 appropriated amount for coal r&d is a 7.5% increase over the previous year's enacted amount . recovery act funding supported four main categories of activities: ( 1 ) futuregen ; ( 2 ) the clean coal power initiative ( ccpi ) ; ( 3 ) industrial carbon capture and storage ( iccs ) ; and ( 4 ) site characterization , training , and program direction . futuregen , ccpi , and iccs garnered the bulk of recovery act funds for ccs ( $3.32 billion , or 98% ) . funding was made available as a one - time appropriation , but doe had authority to spend recovery act funds through fy2015 . accordingly , table 1 shows the recovery act funding amounts in one column for 2009 , but those funds were available through fy2015 . building on available first generation technologies , next generation carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) technologies or carbon dioxide utilization technologies , expected to become commercially available in the mid - 2020s , will help put us on a path to a clean energy option for a world currently dependent on fossil fuels for 80% of its energy . the recovery act provided a de facto doubling of appropriations for ccs rd&d from enactment until the end of fy2015 . a preliminary assessment of recovery act - funded ccs projects might help to inform lawmakers about factors that affect the rate of progress of developing and demonstrating ccs technology . understanding these factors also might help to clarify the potential for ccs as a greenhouse - gas ( ghg ) mitigation strategy as congress debates whether and how to reduce co 2 emissions from large , stationary sources . table 1 shows the doe office of fossil energy spending from fy2010 through fy2016 , including the amounts provided by the recovery act . in the table , recovery act programs are organized under the ccs demonstrations category . ccs - related programs funded by annual appropriations apart from the recovery act are organized under the coal ccs and power systems category . the remainder of fossil energy spending is organized under other fossil energy r&d . doe changed the program structure for coal after fy2010 , renaming and consolidating program areas . in table 1 , the coal ccs and power systems bottom line total is provided for fy2010 , but the amounts for individual programs are not provided for that year because of the reorganization . zeroes in the columns for fy2010 through fy2015 indicate that no new recovery act funds were made available during those years . however , doe continued to fund other ccs programs and activities with regular appropriations in each of those years , as shown by the rows in the table below recovery act programs .
