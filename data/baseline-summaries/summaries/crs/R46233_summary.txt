what information should be included in such estimates ? if so , what will be the threshold for major ? past rules have used a measure equal to 0.25% of gdp . these effects are referred to subsequently as demand - side effects . supply - side effects occur if potential output is altered due to changes in investment or savings that increase the capital stock , labor supply , or productivity . the crowding - out ( or - in ) effect occurs when an increase ( or decrease ) in the deficit reduces ( or increases ) funds available for private investment and hence reduces ( or increases ) the capital stock . and if the rule applies to spending , will it apply to discretionary spending that varies from the baseline as well as direct / mandatory spending ? currently , no house or senate rules explicitly require the preparation or use of dynamic estimates , and congress may choose to examine what rules changes , if any , are needed in the area of dynamic estimates . while committees and members continue to have the ability to request that cbo or jct provide dynamic estimates for certain policies or legislative proposals , at some point congress may choose to reinstitute explicit rules related to such dynamic estimates . these requirements could be articulated as formal direction from the committees of jurisdiction or leadership to jct and cbo . alternatively , as was done previously , these requirements might be included in chamber rules or in budget resolutions , or might be included in a standing order or in statute . if congress were to reinstitute explicit rules related to dynamic estimates , it may choose to consider many facets of such potential rules: will there be a threshold for the creation of such estimates ? should the proposal also allow the legislation to be designated as "major" by either majority or minority committee and / or chamber leadership ? should cbo and jct provide dynamic estimates only for "major proposals," such as those that have a large estimated budgetary impact ? would the effect on gdp be measured by the entire legislation , or would it be triggered by an individual provision or group of provisions ( such as revenue raisers or revenue losers in a tax bill ) that met the threshold ? the latter approach would capture revenue - neutral legislation that nevertheless made significant changes that could affect gdp . should rules for dynamic estimates apply to spending as well as revenue proposals since both have the potential to cause notable macroeconomic effects ? practices prior to 2015 provided insight into how sensitive the results were to choice of model and parameters . the jct has also continued to present information on the parameters of its models that lead to behavioral responses . the justification for assigning model weights might also be addressed in more detail . should dynamic estimates be used only for informational purposes , or also for enforcement purposes ? dynamic estimates allow congress to weigh the merits of the legislationâshould they also be used to determine whether the legislation complies with the budgetary rules that congress has created for itself ?
