for comparability , and because p.l . 108-25 considers efforts to combat malaria as a critical part of pepfar , table 1 includes appropriations to malaria programs . dod's bilateral hiv / aids programs , referred to in line 15 , offer hiv / aids prevention education , primarily to african armed forces . in fy2006 and fy2007 , appropriators provided $102 million and $248 million for bilateral malaria efforts , respectively . 108-447 , fy2005 consolidated appropriations , directed that these withheld funds be transferred to the global fund in fy2005 , subject , like the remainder of the u.s. contribution , to the 33% proviso . an estimated 9% of pregnant women in low - and middle - income countries were offered services to prevent hiv transmission to their newborns . the world health organization ( who ) estimates that at the end of 2004 , more than 14 million people were infected with tb , of whom almost 9 million were newly infected . more than 80% of those living with tb in 2004 were in southeast asia and sub - saharan africa , with the greatest per capita rate found in africa . according to who , each year there are about 300 million acute malaria cases , which cause more than one million deaths annually ; in 2004 , the disease killed about 2 million people . health experts believe that between 85% and 90% of malaria deaths occur in africa , mostly among children , killing an african child every 30 seconds . appropriations for combating the global spread of hiv / aids have grown considerably since president bush entered office . u.s. contributions to the global fund and the launching of two initiatives — the prevention of mother and child transmission initiative and the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) — have contributed to this growth . in june 2005 , president bush launched the president's malaria initiative ( pmi ) , a plan to increase support for u.s. international malaria programs by more than $1.2 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 in 15 countries . since launching pmi , the administration has requested that all support for bilateral malaria efforts be provided to the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) as the coordinating agency for the initiative . when the administration shifted leadership for bilateral malaria programs to usaid in fy2005 , it determined that ogac would no longer include malaria spending in its annual reports to congress and that budgetary requests for the disease would be made separately from hiv / aids and tb requests . according to the pmi website , in fy2006 , $30 million of the $99 million that usaid spent on malaria programs was allocated to pmi , and an estimated $135 million was spent on the initiative in fy2007 . the administration requested $387.5 million for malaria initiatives in fy2008 , of which $300 million would be for pmi ; congress appropriated $347.2 million to usaid and $36.0 million to cdc for international malaria efforts .
