similar pledges have been made to india . numerous experts raise questions about the determination , sincerity , and effectiveness of pakistani government efforts to combat religious extremists . doubts are widely held by western experts , many of whom express concerns about the implications of maintaining present u.s. policies toward the region , and about the efficacy of islamabad's latest strategy , which appears to seek reconciliation with pro - taliban militants . islamabad is adamant in asserting that it serves its own self - interests through closer relations with the united states since 2001 , that there should be no doubts about the sincerity of its anti - terrorism policies ( with a corollary that any failings in this area are rooted in pakistan's capabilities rather than in its intentions ) , and that solely military efforts to combat religious militancy are bound to fail . instead , pakistani officials aver , the so - called "war on terrorism" must emphasize socioeconomic uplift and resolution of outstanding disputes in the muslim world , including in kashmir , palestine , and iraq . the outcomes of u.s. policies toward pakistan since 9 / 11 , while not devoid of meaningful successes , have neither neutralized anti - western militants and reduced religious extremism in that country , nor have they contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afghanistan . many observers thus urge a broad re - evaluation of such policies , including a questioning of a seeming u.s. reliance on the institution of the pakistani military and on the person of president musharraf , along with a shifting of considerable u.s. assistance funds toward programs that might better engender long - term stability in pakistan . in june 2003 , president bush hosted president musharraf at camp david , maryland , where he vowed to work with congress on establishing a five - year , $3 billion aid package for pakistan . annual installments of $600 million each , split evenly between military and economic aid , began in fy2005 . in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( p.l . 108-458 ) , the 108 th congress broadly endorsed the recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission report by calling for u.s. aid to pakistan to be sustained at a minimum of fy2005 levels and requiring the president to report to congress a description of long - term u.s. strategy to engage with and support pakistan . the premiere house resolution of the 110 th congress ( h.r . 1 , the implementing the 9 / 11 commission recommendations act of 2007 ) was passed in january 2007 . section 1442 of the act contains discussion of u.s. policy toward pakistan , including a requirement that the president report to congress a long - term u.s. strategy for engaging pakistan and making a statement of policy that further waivers of coup - related aid sanctions "should be informed by the pace of democratic reform , extension of the rule of law , and the conduct of the parliamentary elections" scheduled to take place in late 2007 .
