a federal disclosure requirement would likely survive a legal challenge . however , it appears likely that it would survive judicial scrutiny under the various applicable tests of constitutionality . pharmaceutical companies might challenge the provision on first amendment grounds . several states have already enacted legislation requiring companies to disclose gifts and payments to these professionals . federal legislation has also been introduced , which would require disclosure of gifts and other transfers of value from the pharmaceutical and other entities to health care provider recipients . they also argue that the ethical guidelines such as the american medical association ( ama ) code discussed below are insufficient deterrents because they "are not being followed. groups opposing a federal disclosure argue that it is unnecessary because existing guidelines within the medical and pharmaceutical - marketing professions discourage unethical behavior . they also argue that gifts and payments can benefit patients , as physicians receive product samples , attend educational seminars , and receive detailed information about particular medications . this report outlines the existing ama guidelines on disclosure and describes certain state disclosure laws and selected federal legislation , in particular , the physician payment sunshine act of 2009 ( s. 301 , h.r . this report also analyzes various legal and constitutional considerations that may pertain to a federal disclosure requirement . in enacting a federal disclosure requirement , congress may consider the following statutory and constitutional considerations . these considerations include the prohibition of certain payments under the anti - kickback statute , and the question of whether payments to physicians could be considered trade secrets , which require certain legal protections . another issue is whether requiring a pharmaceutical company or other entity to make a disclosure would violate the freedom of speech guaranteed under the first amendment . in sum , there have been recent efforts to crack down on perceived conflicts of interest between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical and other medical industries , in particular through disclosure of certain gifts or other payments . supporters of a federal disclosure provision emphasize concern about the effects of gifts and payments on both the cost of prescription medication and on health care quality . they may point to recent data showing that payments from pharmaceutical companies influence some physicians' decisions to prescribe certain medications , occasionally resulting in over - prescribing of the most expensive medications or even causing unnecessary health risks for patients . while companies are free to voluntarily disclose this information about gifts and other payments , there is no current federal requirement to do so . examples of gifts and payments mentioned in media reports include meals , honoraria for speaking engagements , and travel expenses for conferences . as congress addresses health reform , there has been interest in increasing transparency , preventing inappropriate relationships , and requiring disclosure of gifts and other payments made to physicians . in recent years , the issue of industry gifts and other payments to health care professionals such as physicians , and the possible conflicts of interest that could arise from these payments , has been controversial .
