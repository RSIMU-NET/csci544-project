, why the rules were considered "major" ) . the results vary depending on which time periods are chosen . in some cases , more than one category or subcategory applies to a single rule . for example , see the following: during the last full year of the bush administration ( from january 22 , 2008 , through january 21 , 2009 ) , federal agencies published 102 major rules . during the first full year of the obama administration ( from january 22 , 2009 , through january 21 , 2010 ) , federal agencies published 79 major rules . during the last two full years of the bush administration ( from january 22 , 2007 , through january 21 , 2009 ) , federal agencies published 168 major rules . during the first two full years of the obama administration ( from january 22 , 2009 , through january 21 , 2011 ) , federal agencies published 175 major rules . during the first full year of the bush administration ( from january 22 , 2001 , through january 21 , 2002 ) , federal agencies published 54 major rules . during the first full year of the obama administration ( from january 22 , 2009 , through january 21 , 2010 ) , federal agencies published 79 major rules . during the first two full years of the bush administration ( from january 22 , 2001 , through january 21 , 2003 ) , federal agencies published 103 major rules . during the first two full years of the obama administration ( from january 22 , 2009 , through january 21 , 2011 ) , federal agencies published 175 major rules . table 1 also indicates that the number of major rules issued in a particular year is not strongly correlated with the number of final rules that were issued during the year . for example , in 1999 , federal agencies published 4,373 final rules ( the second - largest number of rules during the 14 full calendar years since the enactment of the cra ) , but only 51 major rules ( the second - lowest number of major rules during this period ) . the years with the largest number of major rules ( 2008 and 2010 ) were also years in which the total number of final rules issued was relatively low . as noted earlier in this report , the cra generally defines a "major rule" as one that oira concludes "has resulted in or is likely to result in ( a ) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more ; ( b ) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers , individual industries , federal , state , or local government agencies , or geographic regions ; or ( c ) significant adverse effects on competition , employment , investment , productivity , innovation , or on the ability of united states - based enterprises to compete with foreign - based enterprises in domestic and export markets. within the first of these three definitional categories , omb reports , agency rules , and the current oira associate administrator indicate that a rule may have a $100 million annual "effect on the economy" in any of several ways .
