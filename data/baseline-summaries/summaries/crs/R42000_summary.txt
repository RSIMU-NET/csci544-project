other types of benefits are indexed as well . the lower the threshold , the greater the number of low - income taxpayers who become eligible for the refundable child tax credit . indexing the refundability threshold to a lower inflation index would expand the availability of the refundable child tax credit . additional considerations regarding use of the chained cpi to index federal programs for inflation are reflected in congressional testimony by cbo on april 18 , 2013 . cbo stated , for example , although many analysts consider the chained cpi to be a more accurate measure of the cost of living than the traditional cpi , using it for indexing could have disadvantages . the values of the chained cpi are revised over a period of several years , so affected programs and the tax code would have to be indexed to a preliminary estimate of the chained cpi that is subject to estimation error . also , the chained cpi may understate growth in the cost of living for some groups . for instance , some evidence indicates that the cost of living grows at a faster rate for the elderly than for younger people , in part because changes in health care prices play a disproportionate role in older people's cost of living . however , determining the impact of rising health care prices on the cost of someone's standard of living is problematic because it is difficult to measure the prices that individuals actually pay and to accurately account for changes in the quality of health care . for more information on the programs referenced in the table , see the following crs reports . social security : crs report r42035 , social security primer , by [author name scrubbed] medicare : crs report r40425 , medicare primer , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] medicaid : crs report r43357 , medicaid: an overview , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] supplemental security income : crs report 94-486 , supplemental security income ( ssi ) , by [author name scrubbed] earned income tax credit : crs report r43805 , the earned income tax credit ( eitc ) : an overview , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] child tax credit : crs report r41873 , the child tax credit: current law and legislative history , by [author name scrubbed] unemployment compensation : crs report rl33362 , unemployment insurance: programs and benefits , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] snap : crs report r42505 , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) : a primer on eligibility and benefits , by [author name scrubbed] child nutrition programs : crs report r42353 , domestic food assistance: summary of programs , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] civil service retirement system / federal employees retirement system : crs report 98-810 , federal employees' retirement system: benefits and financing , by [author name scrubbed] military retirement : crs report rl34751 , military retirement: background and recent developments , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] veterans disability compensation : crs report rl34626 , veterans' benefits: disabled veterans , by [author name scrubbed] et al .
