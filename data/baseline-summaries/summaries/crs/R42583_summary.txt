few evaluations of these programs have been conducted . similarly , legislation in the 104 th congress ( h.r . 1617 and s. 143 ) would have directed dol to close 25 underperforming centers based on an audit of centers and criteria related to center performance , incidents of violence or criminal activities , need for rehabilitation and repair , relative and absolute cost , and the level of state and local support for the center . the proposal also sought to transfer operation of job corps from the federal government to the states based on the belief that states "are in the best position to manage and operate job corps centers that are integrated with their workforce development systems" ; however , states would not be required to have job corps centers . some members objected to transferring operations from the federal government to the states because states could "significantly decrease the number of students attending a center or shift funds to nonresidential programs" and could "limit applicants' access to centers outside their states that might offer programs better suited to their needs. ( both the house and senate bills passed ; however , a conference committee was not convened to resolve differences between the bills. ) these same arguments in favor of and against changing job corps could be relevant to current efforts to scale back or alter the program . the workforce investment act of 2013 ( s. 1356 ) , which was passed by the senate help committee in july 2013 , would direct the secretary to determine when a center is to be closed and how to carry out such closure . it would also eliminate the existing indicators of performance and require the dol secretary to establish expected levels of performance based on the indicators of performance for the youth activities program . it would further require the dol secretary to develop and implement a performance improvement plan ( pip ) and to take other action as required under current law , except that such action would have to be taken within a one - year period . the common measures are a set of performance metrics developed by the department of labor's employment and training administration ( eta ) and used across multiple workforce programs , including youth activities , job corps , and youthbuild . the common measures include placement in employment or education , attainment of a degree or education , and literacy and numeracyÂ gains . in 2003 , eta first implemented a common measures policy for several workforce programs and revised the reporting requirements for wia title i programs in an effort to develop a "single , comprehensive system to collect , record , and report program performance for workforce programs. eta introduced three measures for youth ( described in more detail below ) in programs carried out by eta , including youth activities and job corps . since that time , eta has issued additional policy guidance on the common measures . eta specifically indicated that the common measures were not to supersede the existing statutory performance reporting requirements for wia and that states would continue to negotiate performance goals for the indicators required under the youth activities program .
