section 557 of p.l . 114-4 provided safer waiver authority for fy2015 . the administration's fy2016 budget would have maintained safer waiver authority for fy2016 . s. 1619 , the department of homeland security act , 2016 , would also have continued waiver authority . the accompanying bill report ( s.rept . 114-68 ) directed fema to work with stakeholders and present a recommendation to the senate appropriations committee on the feasibility of removing these waivers in future appropriations . however , neither the house bill ( h.r . 3128 ) , nor the final consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l . 114-113 ) contained the safer waiver provision for fy2016 . the administration's fy2017 , fy2018 , and fy2019 budgets did not request safer waiver authority , and neither the house nor senate appropriations committee bills contained safer waiver provisions . however , section 307 of the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) again contained the previous waiver authority provision , stating that fema "may" grant safer waiver authority to allow safer funds for retaining and rehiring firefighters . however , for the 2018 round of safer awards , fema chose not to exercise that authority , and thus will not provide safer hiring grants for retaining or rehiring firefighters . the house fy2019 homeland security appropriations bill would have continued the waiver authority in fy2019 , while the senate fy2019 homeland security appropriations bill did not include the safer waiver authority provision . ultimately , the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) included safer waiver authority for the fy2019 round of safer awards . the administration's fy2020 budget proposal does not request safer waiver authority . for the latest information and updates on the application for and awarding of safer grants , see the official safer grant program website at https: / / www.fema.gov / staffing - adequate - fire - emergency - response - grants . table 4 shows the state - by - state distribution of safer grant funds , from fy2005 through fy2017 . table 5 shows the percentage distribution of safer grant funds by type of department ( career , combination , volunteer ) for fy2009 through fy2014 , while table 6 shows the percentage distribution of safer grant funds by community service area ( urban , suburban , rural ) for fy2009 through fy2014 . of the fy2014 safer awards , grants for hiring accounted for 90% of the total federal share of dollars awarded , while recruitment and retention accounted for 10% . during 2014 and 2015 , the dhs office of the inspector general ( oig ) conducted an audit of safer grants for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 . on june 8 , 2016 , the dhs oig released its report finding that 63% of safer grant recipients over that period did not comply with grant guidance and requirements to prevent waste , fraud , and abuse of grant funds . the report recommended that fema's grant programs directorate develop and implement an organizational framework to manage the risk of fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement . according to the report , fema has concurred with the oig findings and has taken corrective actions to resolve the recommendations .
