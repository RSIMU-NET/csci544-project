appendix a . farm bill legislative action since 1965 presidential vetoes presidential vetoes of farm bills are not common . two complete farm bills have been vetoed as stand - alone measures ( 1956 and 2008 ) , the latter being vetoed twice . will some programs cease to operate ? what is "permanent law" and what does it affect ? do the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) and crop insurance benefits end ? this report answers these and other questions about the expiration of a farm bill . the farm commodity price and income support programs raise farm income by making payments and reducing financial risks from uncertain weather and market conditions . government - set target prices offer payments when market prices fall below support levels . originally , the last year for the 2008 farm bill's commodity programs was the 2012 crop year â€” that is , crops harvested during 2012 and marketed during the following year . dairy price supports and export incentives were to expire on december 31 , 2012 , and the milk income loss contract ( milc ) on september 30 , 2012 . the one - year extension in the american taxpayer relief act ( p.l . 112-240 ) covered the 2013 crop year for all covered commodities as they were available for the 2012 crop year . the extension continued the farm commodity programs that were in effect in 2012 , including the $5 billion per year "direct payment" payment program , which paid farmers a fixed amount regardless of price or yield conditions . it also extended the dairy price support program until december 31 , 2013 , and the milc program until september 30 , 2013 . the new effective deadlines for enacting the farm bill were january 1 , 2014 , for dairy , and when the first supported commodity would have been harvested in the 2014 crop year . in december 2013 , the house passed a one - month extension of the farm bill that would have extended program authorities until january 31 , 2014 ( h.r . the intent was to avoid the uncertainty of permanent law for dairy programs while conference negotiations were completed . the senate did not act on the extension . from january 1 , 2014 , until enactment of the 2014 farm bill on february 7 , 2014 , the dairy program technically had reverted to the outdated 1949-era permanent law , though usda did not implement it since conference negotiations were proceeding . usda had indicated that a short - term extension was not be necessary if a new farm bill was completed in january , since the rollout of procedures to implement permanent law would take a month or more . in 2013 , usda administered more than 20 agricultural conservation programs . these programs addressed natural resource concerns on private agricultural and forested lands through technical and financial assistance . many conservation programs had different expiration dates for program and funding authority ( table 2 ) . because of this and appropriations peculiarities , they were affected differently by the 2008 farm bill expiration and extension .
