peg advocates supported the bill . it is difficult to quantify the impact of the various public policy , budgetary , and technological changes on the peg environment because limited systematic data exist relating to peg channels . comprehensive data are not available on the portion of peg financial support for capital and operating costs that currently comes from fees on cable companies , in - kind contributions from cable companies , payments from the general revenues of local jurisdictions , private contributions , foundation grants , or other sources — though the cable companies have generally been the primary funders and local jurisdictions the second largest funders . in its rulemaking proceeding , the fcc made no attempt to measure the extent to which existing cable franchisees or franchise applicants were required to pay peg operating expenses or offer in - kind services ; it cited limited anecdotal evidence of a handful of local jurisdictions seeking to impose onerous requirements . neither the fcc nor stakeholders ( cable companies or peg advocates ) have attempted to construct estimates of the likely scale of cutbacks in funding from cable companies as state laws take effect and from local jurisdictions as tight budgetary conditions prevail . as a result , it is difficult to project the aggregate impact of the funding cuts that peg access centers are experiencing or are likely to experience , although it is possible to identify cases in which such cuts have resulted in closings . today , cable systems routinely are constructed as hybrid fiber / coaxial cable networks with sufficient capacity and two - way capabilities to accommodate i - net requirements in a single integrated system . in some recent franchise agreements , local governments have obtained a number of "dark" optical fibers in addition to , or in lieu of , channel capacity , and are furnishing the end - user electronic equipment necessary to "light" the fibers themselves — providing vast amounts of broadband capacity at low cost . these new generation i - nets can support a broad range of uses , including high - speed internet and intranet access ; large - file uploads and downloads ; program and data sharing within and among city departments and offices ; geographic information system mapping ( including graphic , tax , zoning , utility , right of way , legal , and other information in a single database that is searchable from any location ) ; video conferencing ; distance learning ; vocational training ; medical imaging ; traffic control ; environmental monitoring ; management of water , sewer , and electric utilities ; remote meter reading ; video arraignments and depositions ; video surveillance and security ; emergency services ; advanced library services and cataloguing ; computer assisted design and computer assisted manufacturing ; city - side or area - wide pbx - like 4-digit dialing ; and direct access to long distance providers , avoiding local access charges .
