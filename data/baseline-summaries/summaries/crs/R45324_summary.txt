in a typical year , few individuals are held harmless . however , in years in which there is no social security cola , many individuals may be affected by this provision . for example , there was a 2% social security cola in 2018 and 28% of medicare part b enrollees were held harmless . plans may also offer enhanced coverage for additional premiums . enrollees pay a monthly premium , an annual deductible ( set at a maximum of $405 in 2018 for standard coverage ) , and other cost - sharing requirements . social security benefits and medicare part b premium amounts are adjusted annually using different methods , which typically has resulted in a higher percentage increase in medicare part b premiums than in social security benefit increases . specifically , social security benefits are adjusted for inflation annually by colas . the social security cola is a measure of general inflation based on the cpi - w. by contrast , medicare part b premiums are adjusted annually to account for changes in medicare program expenditures for covered medical services . the medicare trustees project that medicare beneficiaries will use a larger portion of their social security benefits to pay medicare part b and part d premiums in the future . medicare part b premiums represent a percentage of the actual costs of the program , and thus premiums rise as health care costs rise . the annual percentage increase in social security benefits and medicare part b premiums for years 2000 to 2018 is shown in figure 1 . since 2000 , social security colas have ranged from 0.0% to 5.8% with an average social security cola of 2.2% . there was no social security cola increase in 2010 , 2011 , or 2016 and only a relatively small ( 0.3% ) social security cola in 2017 . although medicare part b premium changes also have varied from year to year , there is a general trend of increasing premiums paid by beneficiaries . standard medicare part b premium changes have ranged from - 13.4% to 17.4% since 2000 , with an average increase of 6.1% . the 13.4% decline in the standard medicare part b premium in 2012 occurred primarily as a result of a large number of individuals no longer being held harmless because of the 3.6% cola following two years of 0.0% colas . the 3.6% cola allowed for the full amount of the previous years' premium increases to be spread to most beneficiaries , rather than the minority of beneficiaries not held harmless during the 0.0% cola years ( see " hold - harmless provision for medicare part b premiums " ) . other than the years in which there was no medicare part b premium increase ( 2000 , 2009 , 2012 , 2014 , 2015 , and 2018 ) , increases in medicare part b premiums historically have been greater than the social security cola increases . since 2000 , the social security annual cola has resulted in a cumulative benefit increase of approximately 50% , considerably less than the medicare part b premium growth of close to 195% .
