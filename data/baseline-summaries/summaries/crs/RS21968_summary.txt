the other gulf countries maintain embassies in iraq . iraq's relationship with kuwait is always fraught with sensitivity because of the legacy of the 1990 iraqi invasion . iran has shelled purported camps of the group on several occasions . iran is also reportedly attempting to pressure the bases and offices in iraq of such iranian kurdish parties as the kurdistan democratic party of iran ( kdp - i ) and komaleh . the close iran - iraq relationship today contrasts sharply with the 1980-1988 iran - iraq war , in which an estimated 300,000 iraqi military personnel ( shiite and sunni ) died . still , iraq's shiite clerics resist iranian interference and take pride in najaf as a more prominent center of shiite theology than the iranian holy city of qom . under section 1314 of a fy2007 supplemental appropriation ( p.l . 110-28 ) , "progress" on 18 political and security benchmarks — as assessed in administration reports due by july 15 , 2007 , and september 15 , 2007 — was required for the united states to provide $1.5 billion in economic support funds ( esf ) to iraq . in early 2007 , the united states began a "surge" of about 30,000 additional u.s. forces — bringing u.s. troop levels from their 2004-2006 levels of 138,000 to a high of about 170,000 — intended to blunt insurgent momentum and take advantage of growing sunni arab rejection of islamist extremist groups . as 2008 progressed , citing the achievement of many of the agreed benchmarks and a dramatic drop in sectarian violence , the bush administration asserted that political reconciliation was advancing but that the extent and durability of the reconciliation would depend on further compromises among ethnic groups . numerous armed groups and the political contributing factors to the post - saddam insurgency and sectarian conflict remained after the u.s. withdrawal in 2011 . these factors undoubtedly contributed to the successes of the islamic state in iraq in 2014 and the difficulty iraqi forces have had in defeating the islamic state since then . a fragile power - sharing arrangement among all iraqi factions largely unraveled in 2011-2012 , casting doubt on president obama's assertion , stated at the time of the final u.s. withdrawal , that iraq is now "sovereign , stable , and self - reliant. on december 19 , 2011 , the day after the final u.s. withdrawal ( december 18 , 2011 ) — and one week after maliki met with president obama in washington , dc , on december 12 , 2011 — the government announced an arrest warrant against vice president tariq al - hashimi , a major sunni figure , for allegedly ordering his security staff to commit acts of assassination . he fled to the krg region and then to turkey , where he remains . maliki's opponents also cited his retaining the three main security portfolios for himself as an indication that he sought to concentrate power . in an effort to try to restore sunni trust in the maliki government , u.s. officials intervened with various political factions and obtained maliki's agreement to release some baathists prisoners and to give provinces more autonomy ( discussed above ) .
