spending on cash assistance declined correspondingly . figure 5 shows both the level and composition of spending in fy1995 under the pre - tanf programs and in fy2000 and fy2014 under tanf . while the overall funding levels in fy1995 and fy2014 were similar , the composition of spending was different . the figure shows that in fy1995 , afdc cash assistance accounted for 70% of all spending under tanf's predecessor programs . in fy2014 , cash assistance accounted for 26% of all tanf and moe dollars . child care expenditures represented 3% of total pre - tanf expenditures in fy1995 , a share that grew to 16% of all spending in fy2014 . on the other hand , work , education , and training expenditures grew only from 5% to 7% of total spending from fy1995 to fy2014 . "other work supports" represents spending for state refundable tax credits ( such as state versions of the earned income tax credit ) and transportation aid . other work supports represented $4.5 billion in fy2014 , or 14.3% of total tanf and moe dollars . the figure shows that the largest increase in expenditures ( particularly during the fy2000 to fy2014 period ) was in "other spending. under tanf , this category represents a wide range of benefits and social services related to families with children . it includes funding for services related to child abuse and neglect , pre - kindergarten and other early childhood programs , short - term emergency aid , state responsible - fatherhood and marriage programs , and programs for adolescents . the expenditure reporting system in place for fy2014 did not have enough information to categorize much of this spending properly . however , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) implemented a new reporting system for fy2015 and later years that will permit a better characterization of spending in the "other" category . the tanf funding level , both nationally and for each state , is rooted in what states spent in the early to mid - 1990s in the pre - tanf programs that were focused on cash assistance for needy families with children . the 1996 welfare reform law contemplated no adjustments for changes that have been made to those funding levels since the enactment of tanf . the law also authorized and provided tanf funding through fy2002 . however , extensions of tanf funding since fy2002 have maintained basic block grant funding at the $16.5 billion level with no change — neither increases or decreases — extending the "freeze" in funding for now close to 20 years . the bulk of tanf funding is based on what states spent in the pre - tanf programs in the early to mid - 1990s . a freeze in the bulk of tanf funding that was originally authorized for 5 years ( fy1997-fy2002 ) has now extended to close to 20 years . however , a number of considerations are raised by any potential changes in tanf funding , including the following: under current budget rules any increase in tanf funding would have to be offset by spending reductions or revenue increases elsewhere in the budget .
