appendix a . the baby boomers in the united states the first baby boomers were born in 1946 ; the last baby boomers were born in 1964 . , under age 20 ) . table 1 shows population growth rates for the 70-year period from 1945 to 2015 , the first and the most recent years , respectively , for which the trustees publish historical data . it also shows the trustees' projections for growth in the population , and its subgroups , for the ensuing 70-year period of 2015 through 2085 . from 1945 through 2015 , the social security population more than doubled . time period iii denotes the stage at which all baby boomers are at least 20 years of age , an age commonly associated with working age . in period iv , baby boomers are attaining full retirement age and beginning to exit the workforce . in period v , all baby boomers are eligible for retirement with full benefits . in 1945 , a year before the first baby boomer was born , 7.3% of the social security population was aged 65 or older . in 2035 , after all baby boomers are eligible for social security , 20.5% of the population will be aged 65 or older . the demographic forces that created an aging population evolved over decades . this is important to policymakers because demographic trends in the social security population are contributing to rising costs . these demographic trends result in an imbalance between costs and revenues and are projected to continue beyond the baby - boom generation . this imbalance can also be thought of as a persistent imbalance between those in covered employment and those collecting benefits . appendix b . birth rates , by age group appendix c. causes of deat . the next - largest age group was the under 20 age group , which accounted for about 33% of the population . in 1945 , the united states could be described as youth dependent because the working - age population was supporting the next - larger , under 20 population . the same could be said for the united states in 2015 , when the 20 to 64 age group was about 59% of the total population and those in the under 20 age group accounted for 26% of the total population ( table 1 ) . that is , from 1945 to 2015 , the united states became less youth dependent . over this time period , the percentage of the total population aged 65 and older increased from 7% to 15% , indicating that the united states was becoming more aged dependent . the united states is projected to age from a youth - dependent population to an aged - dependent population , where the working - age population will be supporting the next - larger , 65 and older population . the transition to a more aged - dependent population is important for social security purposes because the program's ability to continue to pay beneficiaries relies on taxes paid by current workers . as discussed , the dependency ratios have changed over time and are projected to continue to change .
