these data are shown in table 3 . data for 1800 through 1912 were derived by splicing price indexes collected in three separate , nongovernmental , studies . prior to 1978 , there was only one cpi available . the effect of the change was expected to be small . both cpis are based on retail market prices . these prices , for more than 80,000 separate items , are collected in 87 urban areas across the country from thousands of outlets , such as grocery and department stores , gasoline service stations , and hospitals , among others . bls selects these retail establishments based on a survey showing where people do their shopping . actual prices ( except those for food ) are not published because they are collected on a confidential basis . price indexes are available in considerable detail . examples of items for which cpi data are available include white bread , men's shirts , automobile tires , haircuts , funerals , automobile repair , and bedroom furniture . the "all - items" cpi is the index most often referred to and it is a composite index , a weighted average , based on the indexes for all of the goods and services whose prices are collected . the all - items cpi measures the price change of a fixed market basket of goods and services over time . that number can vary significantly from the year - over - year number depending on how the monthly changes are distributed over the period . in 2009 , for example , the year - over - year change was - 0.4% whereas the change from december 2008 to december 2009 was 2.7% . the cpi is an indicator of changes in the price level . at present , those changes are expressed relative to the average level of prices in the years 1982 , 1983 , and 1984 . thus , the average of all of the monthly cpi numbers for those three years is equal to 100 . determining the change in consumer prices between any two years is a simple percent change calculation using the formula: percentage change in the cpi = ( ( cpi 2 รท cpi 1 ) - 1 ) x 100 . for example , in 2009 , the cpi - u was 214.537 , and in 1989 the cpi - u was 124.0 . the total percentage change in the cpi - u between 1989 and 2009 was: ( ( 214.537 รท 124.0 ) - 1 ) x 100 = 73.0 percent . calculating the percentage change between any two years at an annual rate is slightly more complicated , and requires the formula: annual rate of change in the cpi = ( ( cpi 2 รท cpi 1 ) 1 / n - 1 ) x 100 , where n is the number of years covered in the interval . to calculate the average annual rate of change in the cpi - u between 1989 and 2009 , we use an n of 20 and the same cpi - u values as in the previous example .
