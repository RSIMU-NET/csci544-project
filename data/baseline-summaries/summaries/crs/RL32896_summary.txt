92-336 instead . 92-336 included procedures that increased the taxable earnings base automatically as a means of financing colas for social security recipients , though the adjustment to the taxable earnings base was tied to average wages . the social security amendments of 1977 ( p.l . 95-216 ) gradually increased the base beyond what resulted from the automatic - adjustment procedures from 1978 to 1981 , such that in 1981 , the taxable earnings base was $7,500 higher than the "old - law" base . this was done as a means of raising revenue to help shore up the program's ailing financial condition and was intended to achieve a base under which 90% of all covered payroll would be subject to tax ( to match the original 1935 act ) ; increases to the taxable earnings base after 1981 returned to automatic - adjustments procedures . medicare was enacted in 1965 , under the social security amendments of 1965 ( p.l . 89-97 ) , with the hi portion of the program financed by payroll taxes . the hi tax was first levied in 1966 at a rate of 0.35% ( on employee and employer , each ) and the maximum taxable amount was set at the same level as social security's . the hi rate was subsequently raised periodically ( reaching its current level of 1.45% in 1986 ) to meet the financing needs of the program . however , its base continued to be the same as social security's through 1990 . then , to reduce federal budget deficits , the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 ( p.l . 101-508 ) raised the hi base to $125,000 . the hi base then rose automatically to $135,000 over the next two years . in 1993 , as part of his plan to reduce budget deficits , president clinton proposed that the hi base be eliminated entirely ; with the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 ( p.l . 103-66 ) , the hi base was removed . as there is no maximum taxable earnings amount in medicare , medicare financing will not be discussed further in this report . the portion of social security covered earnings that is subject to the payroll tax has fluctuated over time ( figure 1 ) . when the program began in 1937 , taxable earnings represented 92% of covered earnings ( table a - 1 ) . by 1965 , this ratio had dropped to a low of 71% . prior to 1972 , the taxable earnings base was updated periodically by congress , which contributed to its dramatic fluctuations in the 1950s and 1960s . between 1972 and 1977 , and since 1982 , the base has been indexed to the increase in wages in the economy , which has reduced the volatility somewhat . since the 1980s , the share of covered workers below the taxable earnings base has remained relatively stable at roughly 94% . however , the share of covered earnings that is taxed has fallen from 90% of all earnings in 1982 to 83% in 2016 .
