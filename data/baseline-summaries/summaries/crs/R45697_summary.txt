the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied . it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables . total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $426.7 billion in 2019 ( +3.9% ) ( table a - 3 ) . farm equity — or net worth , defined as asset value minus debt — is projected to be up slightly ( +1.1% ) at $2.7 trillion in 2019 ( table a - 3 ) . the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.9% , the highest level since 2002 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 28 ) . a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt . thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy . average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $115,588 in 2019 ( table a - 2 ) , up 4.3% from 2018 and below the record of $134,164 in 2014 . about 18% ( $20,365 ) of total farm household income is from farm production activities , and the remaining 82% ( $95,223 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) . the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 29 ) . annual u.s. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period . when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy . in the first of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2019 , ers projects that u.s. net farm income will rise slightly in 2019 to $69.4 billion , up $6.3 billion ( +10% ) from last year . net cash income ( calculated on a cash - flow basis ) is also projected higher in 2019 ( +4.7% ) to $95.7 billion . however , the initial 2019 net farm income forecast is below ( - 18% ) the 10-year average of $84.8 billion and represents continued agriculture - sector economic weakness since 2013's record high of $123.8 billion . u.s. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income , especially since 2005 .
