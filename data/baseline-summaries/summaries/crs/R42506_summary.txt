emergency spending was not removed from spending totals . table 5 compares growth in discretionary spending ( adjusted to remove oco and disaster spending ) before and after the changes made by the bca , atra , and bba took effect . in real terms , discretionary spending subject to the caps grew at an average annual rate of 2.9% from fy2001 through fy2011 . growth in real defense discretionary spending ( 3.5% on average ) was stronger than that of non - defense discretionary spending ( 2.3% on average ) in that time period . this trend pre - dates the bca . in terms of budget authority , overall discretionary spending declined from $1.264 trillion in fy2010 to $1.221 trillion in fy2011 and to $1.198 trillion in fy2012 . these declines are in terms of nominal dollars ; the decline would be larger if the figures were adjusted for inflation . in 2011 , the decline was mostly the result of a reduction in non - defense discretionary spending , and in 2012 the decline was mostly caused by a reduction in spending on overseas contingency operations ( oco ) . table 4 shows the projected levels of discretionary budget authority and annual percentage changes , in real and nominal terms , subject to the bca caps under the automatic spending reduction process ( "trigger" ) . the levels in the table exclude funding for categories of spending ( such as oco , emergency , and disaster ) for which cap adjustments are permitted . because those categories of spending are effectively exempt from the caps , it is possible that the trend of growth in overall discretionary spending ( spending subject to the cap plus exempt spending ) could turn out to be higher than growth in discretionary spending subject to the bca caps in future years , even if there is strict compliance with the caps . alternatively , future congresses could decide to appropriate an overall level of discretionary spending below the bca caps , in which case the growth in actual spending would be lower than the growth in the caps . from fy2011 to fy2015 , discretionary budget authority subject to the caps fell in real terms each year . in both nominal and real terms , the largest year - over - year percentage declines in spending over the fy2011 to fy2021 period took place in fy2013 , largely as a result of the spending reductions instituted by the bca . that year , discretionary budget authority subject to the caps fell by 6.5% in nominal terms and 8.0% as a percentage of gdp compared with fy2012 levels . spending subject to the caps experienced smaller real declines in fy2014 and fy2015 , as bba 2013 increased the caps on discretionary budget authority in those years . the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l . as seen in table 3 , mandatory spending was cut by $11 billion in fy2013 , and is projected to be cut by $182 billion over the fy2013-fy2021 period under the automatic spending reduction process . as figure 2 shows , it rose relative to gdp from 1999 to 2011 , but remained below the levels prevalent from fy1962 to fy1987 .
