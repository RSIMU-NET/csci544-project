as first enacted in 1993 ( p.l . they include an additional $5 million in federal funds to expand the court appointed special advocates ( casa ) program ; adoption of standards of practice , preparation , education , and compensation for attorneys practicing child dependency law ; and funds for loan forgiveness or other demonstration programs intended to attract and retain dependency court attorneys . finally the commission urged law schools , bar associations and law firms to help build the pool of qualified attorneys available to practice in dependency courts . there are a number of proposals in congress that would fund a student loan forgiveness programâ for child welfare attorneys ( s. 1431 , senator dewine ; s. 1679 , senators dewine and rockefeller ; and h.r . 3758 , representative schiff ) , but none of these have been acted on . in addition congress recently reauthorized the casa program ( p.l . 109-162 ) but did not raise the program funding authorization ( nor its actual funding ) above the $12 million annually authorized in prior law . with regard to ensuring sound standards of practice and qualified attorneys acting on behalf of children in abuse and neglect courts , the national association for counsel of children ( using grant money provided by hhs , september 2002-september 2005 ) has developed a national certification for child welfare lawyers . the american bar association ( aba ) has granted approval of this certification process and of the national association for counsel of children as a certifying agency . a certification exam was piloted in 2005 and attorneys in a limited number of states may now apply for this certification . ( national dissemination of the certification is also planned. ) finally , s. 1679 , as introduced in july 2005 , would require states to "develop and encourage the implementation of practice standards for all attorneys representing the state or local agency administering the program under this part [title iv - e of the social security act] , including standards regarding the interaction of such attorneys with other attorneys who practice before an abuse and neglect court. the fourth and last set of recommendations are directed to chief justices and state court leadership and urge them to act as champions of children in their court systems and leaders ofâ reform . court improvement program funds recognize the integral role courts must play if states are to achieve the federal goals of keeping children safe and finding them permanent homes . state lawsârelated to determinations of safety and the need to remove a child from the home ( e.g . what is child abuse and neglect ) , termination of parental rights , and placement for adoptionâare key operating contexts for the state child welfare agency ; state courts implement ( or ratify agency decisions ) based on these state laws . federal child welfare policy both affects these state laws and assumes active involvement of the court with child welfare agencies in achieving the primary goals of safety , permanence and well - being for children .
