according to most observers , he failed to fulfill his pledge . the legislation's definition of prisoners of conscience is similar to that used by amnesty international . it would define political prisoners as any person: who is arrested , detained , or imprisoned for political reasons under political charges or wrongfully under criminal and civil charges because of his or her perceived or known active role in , perceived or known supporting role in , or perceived or known association with activities promoting freedom , justice , equality , human rights , or civil and political rights , including ethnic rights . some of the options that congress may consider to address issues of political imprisonment in burma include the following: providing technical and other forms of assistance to the union parliament and the ministry of justice in identifying and revising those laws that have been or could be used to arrest and prosecute people for political reasons ; pressuring the nld - led government to reevaluate and consider repealing laws or regulations that declare any of the ethnic armed organizations ( eaos ) illegal under the unlawful associations act of 1908 ; supporting the reestablishment of a political prisoners review committee or a similar body to identify alleged political prisoners and develop an official definition of political prisoners ; imposing suitable restrictions on relations with burma until all political prisoners have been unconditionally released ; conditioning the provision of certain types of assistance to the nld - led government and / or the tatmadaw contingent on the adoption of an official definition of political prisoner , and on the release of political prisoners ; imposing suitable restrictions on relations with burma until sufficient reforms of burma's security forces , including the myanmar police force , have been undertaken to preclude or reduce the likelihood people will be arrested or prosecuted as political prisoners ; and including the absence of political prisoners in burma as a criteria for determining that a democratic civilian government that respects human rights and civil liberties has been established in burma , and that certain restrictions on bilateral relations can be removed . the presence of political prisoners in burma is only one of several possible issues that congress may consider when examining u.s. policy toward burma . other key issues may be as follows: the low - g rade civil war : burma has endured a low - grade civil war between the tatmadaw and up to 20 ethnic armed organizations for over 50 years . the release of political prisoners was often listed as a necessary condition for the repeal of those sanctions . when announcing waivers of existing sanctions , the obama administration often cited progress on the release of political prisoners as evidence for why the waiver was warranted .
