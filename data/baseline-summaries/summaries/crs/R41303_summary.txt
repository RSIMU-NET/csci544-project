the change was not enacted . the fy1986 fs budget request included a proposal to change the payments to 25% of net receipts ( after deducting administrative costs ) . legislation to effect this change was not offered . in 1993 , president clinton proposed a 10-year payment program to offset the decline in fs and o&c timber sales , and thus payments , resulting from efforts to protect various resources and values including northern spotted owls in the pacific northwest . congress enacted this program in section 13982 of the 1993 omnibus budget reconciliation act ( p.l . these "owl" payments began in 1994 at 85% of the fy1986-fy1990 average payments , declining by 3 percentage points annually , to 58% in 2003 , but with payments after fy1999 at the higher of either this formula or the standard payment . in his fy1999 budget request , president clinton announced that he would propose legislation "to stabilize the payments" by extending the owl payments formula to all national forests . the proposal would have directed annual payments from "any funds in the treasury not otherwise appropriated," at the higher of ( 1 ) the fy1997 payment , or ( 2 ) 76% of the fy1986-fy1990 average payment . this approach would have increased payments in areas with large payment declines while decreasing payments in other areas , as well as eliminating annual fluctuations in payments and de - linking the payments from receipts . the administration's proposed legislation was not introduced in congress . the fy2000 and fy2001 fs budget requests contained similar programs , but no legislative proposals were offered . the national association of counties ( naco ) proposed an alternative in 1999 . the naco proposal would have provided the counties with the higher of ( 1 ) the standard payment , or ( 2 ) a replacement payment determined by the three highest consecutive annual payments for each county between fy1986 and fy1995 , indexed for inflation . naco also proposed "a long - term solution ... to allow for the appropriate , sustainable , and environmentally sensitive removal of timber from the national forests" by establishing local advisory councils . the naco approach would have maintained or increased the payments and might have reduced the annual fluctuations , and would likely have retained the linkage between receipts and payments in at least some areas . appendix c. fy2013 sequestration issues section 302 of the budget control act ( bca ) required the president to sequester , or cancel , budgetary resources for fy2013 , in the event that congress did not enact a specified deficit reduction by january 15 , 2012 . congress did not enact such deficit reduction by that date , and on march 1 , 2013 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) determined the amount of the total sequestration for fy2013 to be approximately $85 billion . under the bca , half of the total reduction for fy2013 was allocated to defense spending , and the other half to non - defense spending . within each half , the reductions were further allocated between discretionary appropriations and direct spending . discretionary appropriations are defined in the bca as budgetary resources provided in annual appropriations acts .
