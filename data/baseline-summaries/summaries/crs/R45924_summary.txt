the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied . it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables . for 2019 , usda forecasts that prices for most major commodities will decline from 2018âwheat , barley , soybeans , cotton , choice steers , broilers , and eggs lower ; sorghum , oats , rice , and pork products higher ( table a - 4 ) . in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities . total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $415.7 billion in 2019 ( +3.4% ) ( table a - 3 ) . farm equityâor net worth , defined as asset value minus debtâis projected to be up slightly ( +1.8% ) at $2.7 trillion in 2019 ( table a - 3 ) . the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.5% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 26 ) . a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt . thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy . average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $116,060 in 2019 ( table a - 2 ) , up 4.7% from 2018 but 13.5% below the record of $134,165 in 2014 . about 17% ( $20,075 ) of total farm household income is from farm production activities , and the remaining 83% ( $95,985 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) . the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 27 ) . since 2014 , over half of u.s. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations . since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 28 ) . in 2017 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $111,744 was about 30% higher than the average u.s. household income of $86,220 ( table a - 2 ) . figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 present usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commoditiesâcorn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens . the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons .
