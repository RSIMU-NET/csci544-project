maritime security . violent extremism . violent islamist extremist groups in northwest and east africa — including al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ( aqim ) , al shabaab ( somalia ) , boko haram ( the lake chad basin region ) , and several emergent groups active in mali — threaten state stability , regional security , and u.s. national security interests . while such groups have historically been most active in rural areas where there is little government presence , since 2013 there have been several mass casualty terrorist attacks targeting big city hotels , malls , and restaurants popular with westerners ( eg , in nairobi , kenya ; bamako , mali ; ouagadougou , burkina faso ; and grand bassam [near abidjan],cote d'ivoire ) . other transnational threats . in some parts of the continent , weak law enforcement and justice mechanisms — as well as collusion by state actors — have allowed transnational crime networks to operate with relative impunity . in some countries , these syndicates may threaten state stability . u.s. concern has grown over potential links between africa - based drug traffickers and terrorist groups — notably in connection with the transit through africa of latin american cocaine bound for europe and southwest asian heroin bound for various destinations . reported links between armed extremist or insurgent groups and wildlife trafficking networks are another growing security concern , as is a rise in illegal poaching and wildlife trafficking generally . africa's coastal waters , particularly along the gulf of guinea , the gulf of aden , and the western indian ocean , have been highly susceptible to illegal fishing , trafficking , and piracy in recent years . african governments have generally been unable to adequately police the region's waters . criminal elements exploiting the absence of state controls smuggle people , drugs , and weapons , and dump hazardous waste . maritime commerce and offshore oil production facilities in some regions have faced high rates of maritime piracy , involving both theft and kidnapping for ransom , and sabotage . waters off nigeria and in the broader gulf of guinea rank among the most dangerous in the world for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea . while the waters off the somali coast have seen a dramatic reduction in pirate attacks in the past five years as a result of international antipiracy efforts , analysts warn of the continued threat of piracy in the region . in march 2017 , pirates seized an oil tanker off the somali coast of the indian ocean , marking the first hijacking of a large commercial vessel in waters off the somali coast since 2012 . the 115 th congress has commenced consideration of current and prospective u.s. policies toward africa , as well as appropriations for u.s. foreign assistance , diplomacy , and military activities . these discussions are progressing in the context of the trump administration's release on march 16 , 2017 , of its fy2018 "budget blueprint," which suggests significant shifts in executive branch foreign policy priorities and foreign aid funding levels . the implications for u.s. africa policy , u.s. diplomatic relations with african governments , and aid programs on the continent remain to be seen .
