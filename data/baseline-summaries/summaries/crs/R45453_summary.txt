electricity is generated from a variety of sources in the united states . some sources — nuclear , hydropower , and some renewables — directly produce no co 2 emissions with their electricity generation . fossil fuels generate different amounts of co 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated ( often described as carbon intensity ) . figure 6 illustrates the relative comparison of co 2 emissions between electricity produced from coal , petroleum , and natural gas . as the figure indicates , petroleum - fired electricity yields approximately 80% of the co 2 emission of coal - fired electricity per kilowatt - hour of electricity . natural - gas - fired electricity from a steam generation unit yields approximately 60% of the co 2 emissions of coal - fired electricity per kilowatt - hour of electricity . the final section provides some concluding observations . therefore , a shift in the carbon intensity of the u.s. electricity generation portfolio would likely have ( all else being equal ) an impact on emissions from the electricity sector , which in turn , would have an impact on total u.s. ghg emissions . figure 7 illustrates the percentage of electricity generated by source between 2005 and 2017 . as the figure indicates , the u.s. electricity generation portfolio has changed considerably in recent years . highlights include the following: coal: between 2005 and 2017 , coal - fired generation decreased by 40% . figure 1 illustrates u.s. ghg between 1990 and 2016 . as the figure indicates , u.s. ghg emissions increased 20% between 1990 and 2007 and then decreased by 10% over the next two years . between 2010 and 2016 , emissions decreased by 7% . emissions in 2016 were roughly equivalent to 1994 emission levels . in addition , figure 1 compares recent u.s. ghg emission levels to the 2020 and 2025 emissions goals made pursuant to the 2009 copenhagen accord and 2015 paris agreement , respectively . as the figure indicates , 2016 u.s. ghg emission levels were 12% less than 2005 emissions levels . figure 5 compares u.s. electricity generation with co 2 emissions from the electricity sector between 1975 and 2017 . as the figure illustrates , u.s. electricity generation generally increased between 1975 and 2007 and then decreased in 2008 and 2009 . historically , co 2 emissions from electricity generation followed a similar course . however , in 2010 , these trends decoupled . while electricity generation remained flat after 2010 , co 2 emissions continued a general trend of reduction . thus in 2017 , electricity generation was essentially equivalent to generation in 2005 , while co 2 emissions were 27% below 2005 levels . the decrease in co 2 emissions in the electricity sector in recent years was likely a result of several factors , including overall economic conditions and electricity market developments . historically , annual u.s. gdp decreases are a relatively uncommon occurrence: the united states has seen an annual decrease in gdp seven times over the past 50 years . the 2.9% gdp decrease in 2009 was the largest gdp decrease during that time frame . the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a decrease of energy consumption ( including electricity ) across all economic sectors .
