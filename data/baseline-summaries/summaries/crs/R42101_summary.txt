, forests and other growing vegetation ) . this disagreement continues to impede negotiations . although some observers hope that the durban negotiations will overcome this hurdle by producing a mandate for quantitative , legally binding ghg obligations for all countries , others wonder whether the unfccc process will be able to maintain momentum even on narrower objectives , such as rules for new processes and mechanisms for finance , technology deployment , and adaptation . participants in the climate change negotiations hold a wide spectrum of expectations for the durban conference . for many low - income nations and environmental groups , the key ambitions for the durban meeting are to find agreement on 1. a second commitment period under the kyoto protocol with stronger ghg reduction commitments from the annex i parties ; 2. the legal form of any new agreements , including proposals for legally binding commitments to ghg reductions to take effect by 2020 ; 3. design of the new green climate fund , and materialization of funds during the "fast - start" period of 2010-2012 , provisions for the unreferenced period of 2013-2020 , and the pledged mobilization of $100 billion annually by 2020 ; 4. design of the new technology mechanism ; and 5. evolution of the adaptation committee . at the other end of the spectrum of views , there are a few delegations ( eg , saudi arabia , venezuela ) that may seem content with no resolutions of issues , or even collapse of the process . arguably , the u.s. delegation goes to the durban negotiations with compromised credibility: the united states' lack of consensus on domestic policy has impaired its ability to negotiate for unambiguous commitments or to assure others that any negotiated texts will be accepted by the senate . after signing the kyoto protocol , the united states never became a party to it . the u.s. congress has taken up , but never enacted , legislation specifically addressing mitigation of u.s. ghg emissions , and has not fully funded requests by presidents clinton , ( george w. ) bush , or obama to support their pledges of financial support for deployment of low - emitting technology and other assistance to low - income countries . congress remains divided over the stance the united states should take in the international climate change negotiations . the breadth of views may be characterized by contrasting two recent remarks by members: on the one hand , there is the call from representative bobby l. rush: "ambitious and urgent action to help poor countries and communities confront climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here in the [united states] is both a moral imperative and in our national interest. on the other hand , senator james m. inhofe recently wrote to secretary of state hilary clinton that "there is no chance of any climate treaty being ratified by the united states senate in the foreseeable future. many international stakeholders doubt the policy stasis of the united states can be overcome in the next few years ; instead of looking to u.s. leadership , some observers now counsel the u.s. delegation to "get out of the way.
