the 2017 tax revision ( p.l . 115-97 ) adds new context in considering further extension of expired temporary tax provisions . broadly , the revised tax system became effective in 2018 . thus , one perspective might be that extending expired provisions through 2017 allows these provisions to remain available up until the revised tax system took effect at the beginning of 2018 . the credit for indian coal production provides a tax credit for indian coal produced from reserves , which on june 14 , 2005 , were owned by an indian tribe or held in trust by the united states for a tribe . the amount of the credit is $2.00 per ton ( adjusted for inflation ; $2.387 per ton in 2016 ) . the credit is available for coal sold after december 31 , 2005 , and before january 1 , 2018 . the coal does not need to be sold for the production of electricity or any specific purpose . before 2015 , the credit was only available for indian coal produced at facilities that were placed in service before january 1 , 2009 . indian coal was added to the production tax credit ( ptc ) as a new qualifying resource by the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . when enacted , the credit was available for coal sold to an unrelated third party during the seven - year period beginning after december 31 , 2005 , and ending before january 1 , 2013 . the credit was $1.50 per ton of coal sold during the first four years of the period , and $2.00 per ton for coal sold during the last three years of the period . congress extended the credit for indian coal for one year in atra , reasoning such an extension would "encourage continued mining of coal resources on indian lands. the credit has subsequently been extended as part of "tax extenders. in addition to extending the credit through 2016 , the path act modified the provision , removing the january 1 , 2009 , placed - in - service requirement and modifying the third party sale requirement . the path act also exempts the credit from the alternative minimum tax ( amt ) . the credit for the production of indian coal was extended through 2017 in bba2018 . proponents of the indian coal production tax credit have argued the credit helps compensate indian coal producers for more restrictive regulatory requirements faced by coal producers on indian lands , and encourages investment and jobs on indian lands . there are several options for congress to consider regarding temporary provisions . whether the temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017 have a place in the new tax system is a question the 115 th congress may consider . ultimately , provisions that expired at the end of 2017 could be extended . the extension could be retroactive , such that provisions will be available for all of the 2018 tax year . the extensions also could be short term , long term , or permanent . another option would be to allow expired provisions to remain expired . the business solar itc is scheduled to return to 10% in 2022 .
