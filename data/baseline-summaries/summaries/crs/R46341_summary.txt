research . the administration seeks $6.21 billion for rra in fy2021 , a $524 million ( 7.8% ) decrease compared to the fy2020 enacted funding , and a $365 million ( 5.6% ) decrease compared to fy2019 actual funding . compared to the fy2019 actual levels , the fy2021 request includes decreases for 8 of the 10 rra subaccounts . the largest percentage decrease would go to the office of polar programs ( 14.1% , down $69 million ) . the computer and information science and engineering ( cise ) subaccount would receive the largest dollar increase ( 7.8% , up $77 million ) . the fy2021 request also includes $164 million for the rra established program to stimulate competitive research ( epscor ) program , a $12 million ( 6.8% ) decrease compared to fy2019 actual funding . within the rra account , the fy2021 request includes $5.61 billion for r&d , a decrease of $284 million ( 4.8% ) compared to the fy2019 actual amount . of this amount , the majority ( $5.32 billion , 95% ) is requested for the conduct of research , including $4.85 billion for basic research and $469 million for applied research . education . windows on the universe ( wou ) : the era of multi - messenger astrophysics: $30 million requested , equal to fy2019 . inclusion across the nation of communities of learners of underrepresented discoverers in engineering and science ( nsf includes ) : $18.9 million requested , down $1.3 million ( 6.3% ) from fy2019 . growing convergence research at nsf ( gcr ) : $15.2 million requested , down $0.6 million ( 3.8% ) from fy2019 . mid - scale research infrastructure: $97.7 million requested , up $37.6 million ( 62.7% ) from fy2019 . the convergence accelerator ( ca ) is an organizational framework that stands separately from the nsf research directorates , with its own budget , staff , and initiatives . each ca research track will be a time - limited entity focused on specific research topics and themes . therefore , ca research tracks will evolve over time and will be informed by external stakeholder input . the ca will reward high - risk , innovative thinking by multidisciplinary teams of researchers who want to accelerate discovery and innovation . the ca is a way of achieving rapid lab - to - market or research outcomes . the initial ca research tracks have focused on a subset of the big ideas , though the ca investments "are distinguished from the corresponding big ideas by the nature of the research , the time scale of the activities supported , and the more hands - on , agile approach to project management and support that is envisioned [by the ca program]. nsf has requested $70 million for the ca in fy2021 , which is $28.6 million more than the fy2019 actual amount . the budget request states that nsf anticipates financial contributions from external partners to begin in fy2021 ( amount unspecified ) . the budget request also includes three multi - agency initiatives . the national nanotechnology initiative would receive $454 million , $67.2 million ( 12.9% ) less than in fy2019 .
