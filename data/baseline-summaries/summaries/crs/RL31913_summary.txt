during consideration of h.res . 241 , representative butler c. derrick explained the limitation of a single joint resolution by stating the following: the committee on rules ... believes that it is unnecessary and confusing to have ... a single concurrent resolution on the budget trigger the engrossment and passage of two separate joint resolutions to increase or decrease the public debt [limit] . at the beginning of the 106 th congress ( 1999-2000 ) , the house recodified the rule as house rule xxiii . certain language was deleted and modified from the existing rule , but the revisions were intended to continue the automatic engrossment process "without substantive change. the house repealed the rule at the beginning of the 107 th congress ( 2001-2002 ) . on the opening day of the 108 th congress ( 2003-2004 ) , however , the house reinstated this automatic engrossing process as a new rule , rule xxvii . the reinstated rule contained the same language as rule xxiii of the 106 th congress . the rule was redesignated ( without change ) as rule xxviii during the 110 th congress upon the enactment of the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 ( s. 1 , p.l . 110-81 , september 14 , 2007 , see section 301 ( a ) ) . finally , as noted above , the house repealed the previous rule at the beginning of the 112 th congress ( 2011-2012 ) . more recently , the house restored and revised the rule at the beginning of the 116 th congress . table 1 provides information on the joint resolutions changing the public debt limit that were engrossed and deemed passed by the house pursuant to the gephardt rule during calendar years 1980-2010 . the rule , however , did not operate in all of these years . in 11 of the 31 years between 1980 and 2010 , the rule was either suspended ( 1988 , 1990-1991 , 1994-1997 , and 1999-2000 ) or repealed ( 2001-2002 ) by the house . in most cases , the house suspended the rule because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary . at the time , the existing public debt limit was expected to be sufficient . in three cases , the house passed or was expected to pass separate legislation to increase the statutory limit . as noted above , the rule was repealed at the beginning of the 107 th congress and therefore did not apply in 2001 and 2002 . during the remaining 20 years , when the rule was in effect , the house originated 20 joint resolutions under this procedure . the first seven of these 20 joint resolutions were generated under the gephardt rule in its original form . as mentioned above , the rule was modified in 1983 . it generally remained in this form through 2010 . the subsequent 13 joint resolutions were generated under this modified language .
