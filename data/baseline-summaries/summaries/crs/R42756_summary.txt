but the importance given to import dependence varies . for some , import dependence is the primary concern ; for others , particularly those focused on environmental issues , it is a symptom of a general crisis that arises from indiscriminate consumption of fossil fuels . energy policy historically has often been legislated in large , complex bills that deal with a wide variety of issues , with debate spanning several sessions . the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ; p.l . 109-58 ) was the most recent comprehensive general legislation , with provisions and authorizations in almost all areas of energy policy . epact 2005 also set up in doe the program of energy project loan guarantees which became a source of controversy and debate following the bankruptcy of the solyndra solar system manufacturing facility in 2011 . the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa , p.l . 110-140 ) set new target fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 , and expanded the renewable fuels standard ( rfs ) to require 9.0 billion gallons of biofuels in transportation in 2008 , rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022 . eisa also included new efficiency standards for appliances and for light bulbs , the latter being particularly controversial in the 112 th congress . in the 111 th congress the american recovery and reinvestment act ( the "stimulus" act , arra , p.l . 111-5 ) had major energy policy provisions , including expansion of the loan guarantee program and large increases in funding for renewable energy programs . the department of energy's office of energy efficiency and renewable energy , in addition to the $2 billion appropriated in the fy2009 regular appropriations bill , received $17 billion in arra , of which $11.5 billion was for grants to states for energy , efficiency , and weatherization programs . the office of electricity delivery and energy reliability , which had historically been funded at about $150 million per year , received $4.5 billion in arra , directed at establishing "smart grid" technology for the electric power industry . in the second session of the 114 th congress , both the house and senate are considering broad energy legislation , as well as specific topics of key interest . on april 20 , 2016 , the senate passed s. 2012 , the energy policy and modernization act . on december 3 , 2015 , the house passed h.r . 8 , the north american energy security and infrastructure act of 2015 . on may 25 , 2016 , the house passed an amended version of s. 2012 which contains the text of h.r . 8 , as well as the text of several other energy and natural resources - related bills . the conference committee met for the first time on september 8 . both bills would address a variety of energy topics , including energy efficiency in federal buildings , data centers , manufacturing , and schools ; water conservation / efficiency ; electric grid cybersecurity ; and review of the strategic petroleum reserve ( spr ) .
