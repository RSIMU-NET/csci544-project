â§â§801 et seq. ) under the csa , methadone may be used to treat opioid addiction within an inpatient setting , such as a hospital , or in a federally certified opioid treatment program ( otp ) . federally certified otpsâoften referred to as methadone clinicsâoffer opioid medications , counseling , and other services for individuals addicted to heroin or other opioids . with few exceptions , the use of methadone to treat opioid addiction is limited to otps . treatment within an otp may be in an inpatient or outpatient capacity , though typically it occurs on an outpatient basis . there are no federal limits on the number of patients that can be treated at an otp . however , in 2016 hhs determinedâthrough samhsa survey dataâthat an otp could manage , on average , 262 to 334 patients at any given time . for more information on federal regulations regarding opioid treatments , see crs in focus if10219 , opioid treatment programs and related federal regulations , by johnathan h. duff . buprenorphine may be used to treat opioid use disorder in two settings: ( 1 ) within an otp and ( 2 ) outside an otp pursuant to a waiver . the number of practitioners with a 275-patient limit totaled over 4,800 . this provides the capacity for at least 4 million patients to be treated with buprenorphine through data - waived providers . crs generated a series of maps to depict the distribution of data - waived providers and neighboring otps in 2018 . there are two maps at the national level in figure 1 and figure 2 , and two for the northeast and parts of the midwest in figure 3 . the latter maps shade in each county based on the number of data - waived providers in that county and demarcate each otp with a purple dot . the shading of each county was determined using jenks natural breaks optimization , a statistical method used to create "fair" categories . as a result , each level of shading does not follow a consistent range . the smallest shading category ( 1-32 data - waived practitioners in a county ) is much smaller in range than the largest ( 446-871 data - waived practitioners in a county ) on account of this method . the northeast region of the united states is displayed in a separate map for greater visibility of the high number of otps within a relatively small geographic area . of the over 1,200 counties with no oat providers , nearly half ( 45% ) are classified as rural according to the u.s. census . these counties are primarily located in the midwest and south ; texas ( 13% of counties with no otps or data - waived practitioners ) , georgia ( 6% ) , kansas ( 6% ) , nebraska ( 5% ) , iowa ( 5% ) , and missouri ( 5% ) have the highest percentages of counties with no otps or data - waived providers . twenty - five counties with no otps or data - waived practitioners had more than 50,000 residents . it is important to consider that county size and population are not necessarily indicators of substance abuse treatment need .
