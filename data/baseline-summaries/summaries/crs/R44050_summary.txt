what happened ? a combination of higher fuel cost and the economic recession led to a reduction in vehicle miles traveled and a smaller share of new vehicle sales in the suv and light truck categories . new emission control requirements for motor vehicles , power plants , and other sources also kicked in , substantially reducing emissions of ozone - forming compounds . air quality data from before and after the promulgation of epa's 2008 ozone naaqs show the effect of these factors ( see table 3 ) . in july 2007 , when epa proposed lowering the ozone naaqs from what was effectively 84 parts per billion ( ppb ) to 75 ppb , the agency identified 398 counties with monitoring data exceeding the proposed standard , based on the most recent three years of data ( 2003-2005 ) . the regulatory impact analysis that accompanied the final standard in march 2008 , using data for 2004-2006 , identified 345 counties exceeding the 75 ppb naaqs . by may 2012 , when the nonattainment areas were actually designated , the number of counties in nonattainment had fallen to 232 , based mostly on data for 2008-2010 . as epa stated in 2012 , in the materials accompanying the formal designations: air quality continues to improve across the nation as a result of successful federal , state and local pollution reduction efforts . epa designated 113 areas as not meeting the 1997 ozone standards set at 84 parts per billion . less than half that number are not meeting the 2008 standards . in addition , many of the areas designated today cover a smaller geographic area than the previous standards.... only three areas in two states ( california and wyoming ) have not been nonattainment for previous ozone standards . wyoming is the only state that has not previously had an area designated nonattainment for ozone . epa is currently considering a more stringent naaqs for ozone again: a revised naaqs was proposed in december 2014 , and epa is under court order to make a final decision by october 1 , 2015 . during the public comment period on the proposed rule , concerns regarding the extent of ozone nonattainment and thus the burden of demonstrating conformity have been raised , much as they were when epa proposed previous naaqs revisions . in the support documents that accompanied the december 2014 proposal , epa identified 358 counties currently exceeding a proposed 70 ppb standard , using data for 2011-2013 â€” or 558 counties if the naaqs is set at 65 ppb . because of continuing air quality improvements , the number of counties with monitors exceeding the standard is almost certain to decline before the nonattainment areas are formally designated . at the earliest , designation of nonattainment areas will occur in late 2017 . by that time , new ( tier 3 ) standards for motor vehicles and their fuels will have taken effect . in promulgating tier 3 last year , epa estimated that tier 3 alone would reduce ozone - forming emissions of nox from motor vehicles by 10% in 2018 .
