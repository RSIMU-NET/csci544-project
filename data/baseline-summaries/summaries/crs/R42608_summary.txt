an illustrative example follows . recall that the dollar libor panel is made up of 18 banks , with only the responses of the middle 10 being averaged . suppose that 4 banks report an interest rate of 3% , the next 10 banks report an interest rate of 8% , and 4 banks report an interest rate of 10% . the dollar libor would be calculated by throwing out all of the 3% and 10% responses because the calculation throws out the highest and lowest 4 responses . in this example , the remaining 10 responses are all 8% , so the average would be 80 / 10 = 8% . libor would be reported at 8% . however , if a bank that would have reported 10% wants to lower the libor , and the bank lowers its bid from 10% to below 8% ( for the sake of this example , assume the response is changed to 2% ) , the average will change , even though the bank's response is still thrown out . because one of the 8% responses is now among the highest 4 responses , and one of the 3% responses is in the middle 10 . the average is now 75 / 10=7.5% . in this example , a single bank could move the index from 8% to 7.5% . if the bank exaggerates its lie , perhaps by reporting 1% instead of 2% , the libor remains 7.5% in this example . thus , it is possible for a single bank to affect libor under some circumstances , but there is a limit on the magnitude of the effect . in some cases , the actions of a single bank will not move the index . in the above example , if the bank that would honestly report a 10% response wanted to increase the libor index instead of lowering it , a change in the bank's own response would not achieve the desired manipulation because it would not change the value of any of the middle responses , nor would it change the responses comprising the middle . because reporting 12% instead of 10% still leaves the same 10 responses in the middle to be averaged . in this example , libor remains 8% . barclays has admitted submitting false survey responses to manipulate libor . because libor is used in u.s. derivatives markets participated in by barclays , an attempt to manipulate libor is an attempt to manipulate u.s. derivatives markets , and thus a violation of u.s. law . barclays has settled separately with united kingdom officials for violating uk law . focusing on u.s. issues , the following describes barclays' admissions with the cftc and doj . the material in this section is drawn from the statement of facts in appendix a of the settlement documents . the settlement documents signed by barclays with the cftc and doj include employee emails that can be divided into three categories documenting manipulation: ( 1 ) changing the survey response for the benefit of barclays' derivatives trade positions , ( 2 ) changing the survey response to protect barclays' reputation , and ( 3 ) attempting to induce other banks to change their survey responses .
