manufacturing. the mep program executes this mission through "state and regional centers [that] facilitate and accelerate the transfer of manufacturing technology in partnership with industry , universities and educational institutions , state governments , and nist and other federal research laboratories and agencies. funding for the mep centers is provided on a cost - shared basis between the federal government and nonfederal sources , including state and local governments and fees charged to smms for center services . the mep program received $140.0 million for fy2018 , $10.0 million ( 7.7% ) more than in fy2016 and fy2017 . in his fy2019 budget , president trump has requested no funding for mep centers . in contrast , both the house and senate committee - reported appropriations bills ( h.r . 5952 and s. 3072 , respectively ) would provide $140.0 million for mep in fy2019 . the mep has a staff of 50 employees at nist in fy2018 , and the centers have just over 1,300 field staff with technical and business expertise . mep recently completed a system - wide competition that awarded one center to each state and puerto rico ; previously some states had more than one mep center . nist served more than 26,313 smms in fy2017 . in a survey performed by an independent third - party for nist mep , the companies served by mep centers reported $12.6 billion in new and retained sales , $1.7 billion in cost savings and investment savings , $3.5 billion in new client investment , and the creation and retention of more than 100,000 jobs in fy2017 . in the mid - 1980s , congressional debates on trade focused attention on the critical role of technological advance in the competitiveness of individual firms and long - term national economic growth and productivity . reflecting these ideas , the omnibus trade and competitiveness act ( p.l . 100-418 ) established a public - private program , now known as the hollings manufacturing extension partnership , to assist u.s. - based smms in identifying and adopting new technologies . the focus on smms derived from policymakers' perceptions of their contribution to job creation , innovation , and manufacturing . research at that time indicated that smms produce 2.5 times more innovations per employee than large firms . program advocates noted the efforts of other nations to provide technical and business assistance to their manufacturing communities through the establishment of manufacturing extension centers ( see text box , "mep - like programs of other countries" ) . in 2015 , there were 248,000 smms in the united states . these firms accounted for 98.5% of the nation's manufacturing enterprises and employed approximately 5.2 million people in 2015 , approximately 44.4% of total u.s. manufacturing employment . the improved use of technology by smms is seen by policymakers and business analysts as important to the competitiveness of american manufacturing firms . how a product is designed and produced often determines costs , quality , and reliability . lack of attention to process technologies and techniques may be the result of various factors , including company finances , insufficient information , equipment shortages , and undervaluation of the benefits of technology .
