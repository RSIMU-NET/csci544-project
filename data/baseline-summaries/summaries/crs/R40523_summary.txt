note that p.l . 110-246 , enacted in june of 2008 , created section 54a of the tax code . this section contains many parameters common to all tcbs . this revision of the tax code was intended to "standardize" some of the tcb parameters . as table 2 shows , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 , arra ) included several bond provisions that use a tax credit mechanism . specifically , arra created qscbs . it also allowed issuers the option of receiving a direct payment from the u.s. treasury instead of tax - exempt interest payments or tax credits for investors . these new bonds , babs and rzedbs , are also unlike other tax credit bonds in that the interest rate on the bonds is a rate agreed to by the issuer and bond investor . in short , with babs and rzedbs , the two parties in the transaction established the tax credit rate , not the treasury secretary . the resulting investor tax credit amount or issuer direct payment is equal to 35% of the interest payment for babs and 45% for rzedbs . legislation has been introduced in the 114 th congress that would modify the status of certain tcbs . this activity includes h.r . 2676 and s. 1515 , which would reauthorize and extend the issuance of babs . moreover , qzabs were extended for the 2015 and 2016 tax year with $400 million of capacity each year by the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l . other recent tcb legislative action was taken in the hiring incentives to restore employment act of 2010 ( hire act ; p.l . 111-147 ) , which expanded the direct payment option beyond babs to include issuers of new crebs , qecbs , qzabs , and qscbs . the aggregate limit for qzab debt was $400 million annually from 1998 through 2008 , $1.4 billion for each of 2009 and 2010 , and $400 million annually from 2011 through 2016 . the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l . 114-113 ) authorized an additional $400 million dollars in qzabs for both 2015 and 2016 . further limits are applied to each state , the district of columbia , and territory based upon their portion of the u.s. population below the poverty line . states are responsible for the allocation of the available credit to the local governments or qualified zone academies . unused credit capacity can be carried forward for up to two years . individual public schools use qzabs , through their participating state and local governments , for school renovation ( not including new construction ) , equipment , teacher training , and course materials . to qualify for the program , the school must also be a "qualified zone academy. a "qualified zone academy" is any public school ( or program within a public school ) that provides and develops educational programs below the postsecondary level if "such public school or program ( as the case may be ) is designed in cooperation with business to enhance the academic curriculum , increase graduation and employment rates , and prepare students for the rigors of college and the increasingly complex workforce.
