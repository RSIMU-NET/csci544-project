115-123 are reviewed . a discussion of policy options concludes . for federal income tax purposes , there are two types of income that may arise when an individual's mortgage is fully or partially canceled: cancellation of indebtedness income and gain from the disposition of property . on december 20 , 2007 , the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 ( p.l . 110-142 ) was signed into law . the act , among other things , excluded discharged qualified residential debt from gross income . qualified indebtedness is defined as debt , limited to $2 million ( $1 million if married filing separately ) , incurred in acquiring , constructing , or substantially improving the taxpayer's principal residence that is secured by such residence . it also includes refinancing of this debt , to the extent that the refinancing does not exceed the amount of refinanced indebtedness . the taxpayer was required to reduce the basis in their principal residence by the amount of the excluded income . the provision did not apply if the discharge was on account of services performed for the lender or any other factor not directly related to a decline in the residence's value or to the taxpayer's financial condition . the provision applied to debt discharges that are made on or after january 1 , 2007 , and before january 1 , 2010 . the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-343 ) extended the exclusion described above through the end of 2012 . subsequently , the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 ) extended the exclusion through the end of 2013 . the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l . 113-295 ) extended the exclusion through the end of 2014 . the exclusion was extended again through the end of 2016 by division q of p.l . 114-113 — the protecting americans from tax hikes act ( or "path" act ) . most recently , the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) retroactively extended the exclusion through the end of 2017 . the extension also allowed for debt discharged after 2017 to be excluded from income if the taxpayer had entered into a binding written agreement before january 1 , 2018 . in order to evaluate the policy of including discharged debt as income , it is helpful to understand why it exists . according to economic theory , one way of defining income is as the change ( over the period in question ) in a person's net worth — that is , the change in the value of the person's assets minus the change in their liabilities . by this definition , a forgiven loan is income: a canceled debt reduces a taxpayer's liabilities , and thus increases net worth . in the past , tax law has generally adhered to this concept by providing that if the obligation to repay the lender is forgiven , the amount of loan proceeds that is forgiven is reportable income subject to tax . this portion of the report provides analysis of the issues associated with the tax treatment of canceled mortgage debt income . the changes enacted by p.l . 110-142 and then extended by p.l .
