most governments in the region today are elected democracies . although free and fair elections have become the norm , recent elections in several countries have been controversial and contested . in 2019 , argentina , dominica , el salvador , panama , and uruguay held successful free and fair elections . guatemala held two presidential election rounds in june and august 2019 that international observers judged to be successful , but the elections suffered because several popular candidates were disqualified from the race on dubious grounds . in bolivia , severe irregularities in the conduct of the country's october 2019 presidential elections ignited protests and violence that led to the resignation of incumbent president evo morales , who was seeking a fourth term ; new elections under an interim president are now scheduled for may 2020 . most recently , guyana held elections on march 2 , 2020 , which were marred by allegations of fraud ; final results are on hold pending court action regarding the final verification of some votes . six other caribbean countries are scheduled to hold elections in 2020 ( see text box " 2020 elections " ) . despite significant improvements in political rights and civil liberties since the 1980s , many countries in the region still face considerable challenges . in a number of countries , weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services , ensure accountability and transparency , advance the rule of law , and ensure citizen safety and security . there are numerous examples of elected presidents who have left office early amid severe social turmoil and economic crises , the presidents' own autocratic actions contributing to their ouster , or high - profile corruption . in addition to morales's resignation in 2019 , corruption scandals either caused or contributed to several presidents' resignations or removals of several presidentâguatemala in 2015 , brazil in 2016 , and peru in 2018 . although the threat of direct military rule has dissipated , civilian governments in several countries have turned to their militaries or retired officers for support or during crises , raising concerns among some observers . most recently , in el salvador on february 9 , 2020 , president nayib bukele used the military in an effort to intimidate the country's legislature into approving an anti - crime bill ; the action elicited strong criticism in el salvador and abroad , with concerns centered on the politicization of the military and the separation of powers . the quality of democracy has eroded in several countries over the past several years . the economist intelligence unit's ( eiu's ) 2019 democracy index shows a steady regional decline in democratic practices in latin america since 2017 . several years ago only cuba was viewed as an authoritarian regime , but venezuela joined its ranks in 2017 as president nicolã¡s maduro's government violently repressed the political opposition . nicaragua turned to authoritarian practices in 2018 under long - time president daniel ortega , as the government violently repressed protests .
