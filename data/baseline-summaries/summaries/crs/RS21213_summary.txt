table 2 . u.s. aid to colombia fy1989-fy1999 ( obligations and authorizations , $ millions ) sources: data is drawn from a number of sources , not all of which are consistent . these include: various editions of the u.s. overseas loans and grants and assistance frominternational organizations "green book," prepared by the us aid budget office ; various editions of the foreignmilitary sales , foreign military construction sales , and militaryassistance facts book , prepared by the department of defense security cooperation agency ; information provideddirectly by the departments of state and defense that are notrecorded in these publications ; and by the general accounting office ( gao ) for 1996-1998 . ( see gao - 01-26 ) where contradictions existed , gao data was preferred . because of apossible lack of data or inaccuracies , some yearly totals may be understated or overstated , particularly prior tofy1997 . a in these years , there was assistance in this category of less than $50,000 . b although it is likely that section 1004 assistance was provided to colombia as far back asfy1992 , there is no public breakdown of such assistance until fy1997 . that is the first yearin which dod provided a publicly - available breakdown by country and authority for funding from its centralcounternarcotics account . c not included in totals . table 1 . u.s. assistance to colombia fy2000-fy2004 ( obligations andauthorizations , $ millions ) notes: na = not available . figures on state department inc ( international narcotics control ) , aci ( andean counterdrug initiative ) , usaid , fmf , and imetfunding from statedepartment congressional presentations , budget justification documents , and allocation information provided bythe department of state . figures on inc air wing ( fy2000-fy2004 ) provided by the state department: figures provided may 5 , 2003 . ( inc air wing funding supports the sprayeradication efforts . fy2000 figure includes $5.5 million in support of thecolombian army. ) figures on dod 1004 , 1004 / 124 , and 1033 funding provided april 11 , 2002 , for fy2000-2002 ; and april 18 , 2003 , for fy2003 and fy2004 . both inc air wingand dod funding are taken from regional accounts , therefore the fy2003 and fy2004 allocations are estimates,and can be shifted to respond to developing needs in other areas . a fy2000 and thereafter , non - dod plan colombia funds are all assigned to the state department inc ( fy2000 and fy2001 ) or aci ( fy2002 and thereafter ) account ; the statedepartment transfers them to the other agencies carrying out programs in colombia with those funds . these includethe department of justice and usaid . the usaid fy2000 andfy2001 figures are economic support funds ( esf ) . these usaid figures do not include funds provided to usaidfrom the inc account . no attempt was made to estimate suchfunds . also , there are inconsistencies among various sources . because of these and other constraints on gatheringdata , the amount of assistance provided to colombia may be largerthan the amounts cited in these tables . both bills condition aid on the observance of human rights and environmental and otherrestrictions .
