the provision was not included in the enacted bill . as enacted , the fy2020 ndaa authorizes more than 97% of the $682.4 million requested to develop a fleet of new icbms to replace the 400 minuteman missiles currently deployed in silos located in montana , north dakota , and wyoming . this total includes $552.4 million of the $570.4 million requested to continue development of the new missile , designated the ground based strategic defense ( gbsd ) . it also includes , in the energy department's national security budget , $112.0 million â the entire amount requested - - to develop a new warhead ( designated w87-1 ) to equip the new missile , in lieu of the w78 warhead carried by the minuteman . section 1672 of the enacted bill prohibits any reduction in the number of deployed u.s. icbms , currently 400 missiles . the senate version of the bill would have authorized $22 million more than was requested for gbsd . section 1664 of the senate bill would have prohibited any reduction in the number of icbms the house bill would have imposed a reduction of $140.0 million on the $682.4 million request for r&d related to a new icbmâa cut of about 20% . this included a net reduction of $81.0 million for gbsd and a reduction of $59.0 million for the warhead . the house rejected by a vote of 164-264 an amendment to the house version of the bill that would have delayed the gbsd program and required an independent study of options to extend the service life of the currently deployed minuteman missiles . the house - passed bill would have cut a total of $1.6 billion from the shipbuilding request , most of which the house armed services committee justified as reflecting "excess cost growth. ( see table 9 . ) critics refer to this offset as aâ  widows' tax . section 622 of the enacted version of the fy2020 ndaa phases out the dic offset requirement over a period of three years . section 630a of the initial house - passed version would have repealed the offset , outright . the initial senate - passed version was silent on the issue . a dod policy adopted on april 12 , 2019 , prohibits entry into military service of any person who identifies as transgender . the policy allows transgender individuals to apply for a waiver of that prohibition . the enacted version of the bill does not challenge the administration's policy . however , section 596 of the ndaa conference report requires dod to report on the number of requested waivers to the transgender ban that have been denied . section 596 of the house - passed version of the bill would have established a similar reporting requirement . section 530b of the house - passed version of the bill , which was not included in the conference report , would have nullified the transgender ban , extending to gender identity the same legal protection against discrimination that current law provides for race and sex . the senate version of the ndaa contained no provisions relevant to this issue .
