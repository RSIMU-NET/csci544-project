â§263a ) , to perform high complexity tests. cms regulates the quality of clinical laboratories and the clinical testing process . the diagnostic test developed by the cdc , called the 2019-novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) real - time reverse transcriptase ( rt ) - pcr diagnostic panel , is a complex molecular diagnostic test that relies on generally standard molecular biology laboratory techniques . specifically , the test uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , a standard in vitro technique for amplification of dna . because the sars - cov - 2 virusâthe virus that causes covid - 19âis an rna virus , the rna must be first reverse transcribed to generate copy dna , or cdna , which is then amplified ( multiple copies are generated ) using pcr . cms's authority to regulate ivds is through clia ( p.l . fda regulates the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests , as well as the quality of the design and manufacture of the diagnostic test . pcr relies on primersâvery short single stranded pieces of dna that are complementary to and bind with specific regions of the viral genome and thus define the specific genomic region to be amplified . the test then relies on a probe , or a single - stranded piece of dna that is chemically or radioactively labelled , that can bind to and thus detect the amplified target portion of the viral genetic material . cdc's original test used three sets of primers and probes: two to target specific regions of a designated gene within the sars - cov - 2 viral genome , and a third that was specific to all sars - like coronaviruses ( see " what quality problems did the cdc's test experience on rollout to the state and local public health laboratories ? the public health laboratories must verify the test themselves prior to using it , and are currently required to send presumptive positive cases back to the cdc in atlanta for confirmatory testing by the agency . the trump administration had estimated that approximately 1 million tests would be broadly available imminently , facilitated by leveraging manufacturing of the cdc test kit by a private company , integrated dna technologies ( idt ) , a manufacturer that has been working with cdc . according to hhs secretary azar on march 5 , 2020 , idt will send the cdc test kit to "hospitals , other labs around the country , commercial , public health â¦ labs" by the end of the week of march 2 . the test kit being manufactured by idt , identical to the cdc test kit and referred to as "idt 2019-novel coronavirus kit," is being qualified by cdc in lots , and fda reports that these cdc - qualified , idt - manufactured test kits are covered by the cdc's eua authorization of february 4 , 2020 . fda notes that if a lab purchases a test kit from idt , the laboratory does not need its own eua to carry it out , but that "[t]esting using cdc's eua - authorized protocol and cdc qualified lots of reagents is considered to be testing done under the cdc's eua .
