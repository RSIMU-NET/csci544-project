111-148 , aca ) . the aca permanently reauthorized the nhsc , creating , among other things , a mandatory funding stream for the program and implementing a part - time option , which allows part - time service in exchange for an extended service commitment . this report provides an overview of the nhsc , including the program's funding , the number and types of providers the program supports , and the locations where they serve . physicians and nurse practitioners are the next largest groups of providers . the nhsc consists of three programs: ( 1 ) a federal scholarships program , ( 2 ) a federal loan repayment program , and ( 3 ) a state - operated loan repayment program . the federal scholarship program provides scholarships in exchange for a service commitment at the end of a recipient's education , including any training required before licensure . the three program types are described below ; table 2 presents data on the number of awards made under each of these programs . the amount of total funds that the nhsc receives determines the number of awards that the program can make . historically , the nhsc had been exclusively funded as part of hrsa's discretionary appropriation . however , that is no longer the case , as the program is now funded by the mandatory community health center fund ( chcf ) . the aca created the chcf and provided mandatory funding for it over a five - year period ( fy2011-fy2015 ) . the fund was intended to supplement the nhsc budget ; however , from fy2012 to fy2017 , it made up the entirety of the program's funding . the chcf was initially set to expire at the end of fy2015 ; however , it was extended for two years ( fy2016 and fy2017 ) as part of the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra , p.l . 114-10 , chip is the state children's health insurance program ) . at the start of fy2018 , no mandatory funds had been appropriated for the nhsc ; however , a temporary extension ( p.l . 115-96 ) ultimately provided mandatory funding for the first two quarters of fy2018 , and the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 , p.l . 115-123 ) later provided full - year funding for fy2018 and fy2019 . amounts provided by the chcf have also been reduced in some years as part of the mandatory spending sequester ( pursuant to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 , as amended ) . although the program had not received discretionary appropriations from fy2012 through fy2017 , it received $105 million in fy2018 in p.l . 115-141 , with funds directed toward supporting health care providers who provide opioid and other substance use disorder treatment in hpsas . table 1 presents funding provided for the program between fy2011 and fy2019 â€” though amounts for fy2019 are subject to change . the table also shows the percentage of funding that comes from discretionary and mandatory sources .
