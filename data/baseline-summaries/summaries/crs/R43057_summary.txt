most households had small amounts in their dc plans or iras . a majority of single households in each age group had no retirement assets in 2010 . a pension plan is a voluntary benefit that some employers provide to their workers . employers who offer pension plans for their workers sponsor one or both types: defined benefit ( db ) pension plans or defined contribution ( dc ) pension plans . in db pensions , participants receive a monthly payment in retirement that is based on a formula that typically uses a combination of length of service , an accrual rate , and an average of final years' salary . in dc plans , of which 401 ( k ) plans are the most common , workers contribute a percentage of their wages to an individually established account . employers may also contribute a match to the dc plan , which is an additional contribution equal to some or all of the worker's contribution . the account accrues investment returns and is then used as a basis for income in retirement . individuals may be eligible to make contributions to iras if they have earnings from work or by making a rollover contribution from an employer - sponsored pension . households that expect to receive income from a defined benefit pension will face a retirement account balance less than $3.4 million because the receipt of a db pension will reduce the ira and dc account amounts needed to fund an annuity of $205,000 . among households in which the head or spouse was in the labor force in 2010 , 283,000 had account balances greater than $2.0 million and less than $3.0 million and 129,983 households had retirement account balances of $3.0 million or more . among households that have retirement assets , some households have only ira assets , some households have only dc assets , and some households have both . table 6 indicates that more households have dc assets than have ira assets even though iras were authorized in 1974 and dc plans became widespread in the early 1990's . approximately 33.0 million households ( 28.0% ) have ira assets whereas 41.0 million ( 34.9% ) have dc assets . less than 1.0% of u.s. households had ira or dc assets of $1.0 million or more . although workers may retire at any age , ages 62 to 67 might generally be thought of as retirement age . individuals are eligible to receive reduced social security benefits at age 62 , are eligible for medicare at age 65 , and full social security benefits at their normal retirement age ( age 67 for individuals born after january 1 , 1960 ) . in addition , age 65 is often the normal retirement age in private - sector and state and local pension plans . among households in which the head of the household was aged 62 to 67 in 2010 , 57.2% had retirement assets whereas 42.8% did not have retirement assets . table 7 shows median and average account balances in 2010 for households in which the head of the household was aged 62 to 67 . figure 3 shows the percentage of households that in 2010 had db plans , dc plans , and iras .
