id . in weinberger v. salfi , 422 u.s. 749 ( 1975 ) , we reaffirmed that view . we require this heightened showing in part to avoid the "serious constitutional question" that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim . see bowen v. michigan academy of family physicians , 476 u.s. 667 , 681 ( 1986 ) . ยง713 obtain review to challenge the constitutionality of that authority ? this question currently is before the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit because the former director of the phoenix va health care system appealed her removal from federal service . on april 27 , 2015 , the department of veterans affairs filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction . it acknowledged that the court generally has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an mspb final decision under 28 u.s.c . ยง7703 ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( d ) , but maintained that the finality provision in 38 u.s.c . ยง713 ( e ) ( 2 ) , quoted above , precludes an appeal of an mspb administrative judge's decision on an expedited removal . responding to this motion , helman cited three constitutional arguments . first , the expedited removal procedure in 38 u.s.c . ยง713 , on its face and as applied to her , violates her fifth amendment due process right by severely limiting the pre - removal and post - removal processes that she received . second , section 713 , facially and as applied , contravenes the appointments clause , article ii , section 2 , clause 2 of the constitution . it allows an mspb administrative judge , an employee who is not appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate , to render a final decision of the united states without any review by the presidentially appointed , senate - confirmed members of the board or any other executive officer . third , section 713 , facially and as applied , violates helman's fifth amendment right against self - incrimination and her due process rights . this section , she alleged , forced an immediate appeal of her removal to mspb and provided that her removal would be final within 21 days even though a criminal investigation into the same conduct was pending at that time and the administrative judge denied a motion to postpone the appeal . in a reply to helman's arguments , the department asserted that preclusion of judicial review is clear from the language , objectives , and legislative history of 38 u.s.c . it added that the court does not have jurisdiction because helman failed to present colorable constitutional claims and has no constitutionally protected interest in her continued employment . moreover , even if helman has a property right to continued employment , she would have no colorable due process claim to receive an opportunity for discovery and the right against self - incrimination and to assert that section 713 violates the appointments clause or article iii of the constitution . on july 15 , 2015 , the court issued an order directing helman to file a brief on jurisdiction .
