figure 1 . u.s. spot price of oil , 2003-2005 price increases began in the late fall of 2003 , and continued into 2004 , reaching a yearlypeak of over $53 per barrel in october 2004 . although prices fell by $10 per barrel by december2004 , they began to rise again in january 2005 , and peaked again at nearly $53 per barrel in april2005 . ( 2 ) some insight intofuture spot market prices might be gained by examining nymex futures market prices . ( 3 ) for example , in the five daysbefore it terminated trading on july 20 , 2004 , the august 2004 contract on wti at cushing,oklahoma was trading at over $40 per barrel . as of july 23 , 2004 the september and october wtifutures contracts continued to trade at over $41 per barrel on the nymex . ( 4 ) on august 10 , 2004 thenymex futures price for crude oil traded above $45 , a first in the history of the exchange . on thesame day , the spot market price for wti was at $44.48 . ( 5 ) these data accurately suggested that high crude oil prices werelikely to continue for the remainder of 2004 . by the end of may 2005 , futures prices for the august2005 contract were trading at nearly $50 per barrel and the september 2005 contract was trading at$50.41 per barrel . these prices suggest that , while the crude oil price might remain volatile , reactingto current market conditions , it is unlikely that prices will return to pre - 2003 price increase levelsfor the remainder of 2005 . figure 2 shows the behavior of spot market prices for reformulated regular gasoline at newyork harbor . the price of gasoline has shown a pattern of movement somewhat similar to that ofoil prices . figure 2 . u.s. spot market price for reformulated regular gasoline , new york harbor , 2003-2005 gasoline prices peaked in february and august of 2003 . they then lagged oil prices , notshowing price increases in the fall of 2003 . however , they did follow oil price increases throughoutthe spring of 2004 , also peaking in may of 2004 . gasoline prices were volatile for the remainder of2004 . after the may peak , the price remained approximately 12 cents per gallon lower for the nextfour months . although the price went above $1.37 per gallon in october 2004 , it finished the yearat $1.07 , about 24% off the may peak . gasoline spot prices increased in 2005 . by april 2005 , theprice peaked at over $1.52 per gallon . on june 3 , 2005 the nymex future prices for gasoline injuly , august , and september were above $1.50 per gallon . ( 6 ) as in the oil market , these futures prices suggest that there is likelyto be only modest , if any , moderation in gasoline prices for the rest of the year . conclusions concerning projected spot prices based on the trading value of current futurescontracts may or may not be accurate . futures prices process new information and market conditionsquickly and prices can change direction on a daily basis .
