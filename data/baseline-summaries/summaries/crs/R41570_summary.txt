there is little public information about the review . a june 2010 article in the los angeles times described it as "the first thorough review of refugee resettlement in 30 years," and reported that the nsc had consulted with federal agencies , including hhs and dos , and refugee advocates . it is not known when the results of the review will be made available . they have been widely anticipated , however , and may further energize reform efforts . to help inform possible future efforts to reform the refugee resettlement assistance system , this report discusses existing resettlement assistance programs , key issues and challenges in providing effective assistance , and policy options to reform the current system . while the refugee admissions process is briefly described and referenced in parts of this report , as relevant , the focus of this report is on resettlement assistance to refugees in the united states . the admission of refugees to the united states and their resettlement here are authorized by the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , as amended by the refugee act of 1980 . refugees are one of the main categories of foreign nationals admitted on humanitarian grounds to live permanently in the united states . humanitarian admissions represent one stream of permanent admissions under u.s. immigration law . the ina , as amended , sets forth procedures for determining refugee admissions levels and criteria for admitting refugees to the united states . it also requires refugees to apply to adjust to legal permanent resident ( lpr ) status after one year in refugee status in the united states . in addition to establishing admissions procedures , the ina , as amended by the refugee act of 1980 , authorizes federal assistance to resettle refugees and promote their self - sufficiency . it authorizes several refugee assistance programs , as discussed below . the refugee act of 1980 also amended the ina to establish orr at hhs to administer the refugee assistance programs . refugee assistance programs are not limited to individuals who are admitted to the united states as refugees . rather , as detailed below , refugee assistance and benefits are available to various categories of humanitarian admissions . the ina authorizes several refugee assistance programs , including an initial resettlement program cash and medical assistance , and a program to provide employment - related and other services . orr programs for refugee minors , non - refugee unaccompanied alien children , survivors of torture , and victims of trafficking are not covered in this report . in recent years , as noted above , the united states has admitted an increasingly diverse group of refugees . in its fy2011 budget request for orr , the obama administration highlighted some of the needs of today's refugees: changing demographics of the u.s. resettlement program present new challenges , as many populations require extended employment services to gain a toehold in the u.s. labor market and integrate into u.s. society . many recent arrivals have spent protracted amounts of time in refugee camps in countries of first asylum , have experienced intense trauma and have disabilities .
