 ) , also known as the "redux" cuts , should be repealed . eventually , the redux retirement reductions were almost completely repealed by the fy2000 national defense authorization act ( sections 641-44 , subtitle d - retired pay reform , title vi , - compensation and other personnel benefits , p.l . 106-65 , october 5 , 1999 ; 113 stat . the redux statute would have substantially cut the retired pay for those retirees who first entered military service on or after august 1 , 1986 . with very few exceptions , military personnel do not become eligible for retired pay until completing 20 years of service . 682 et . the redux formula , therefore , would not have been used to compute any significant number of retirees' pay until mid - 2006 ( it applied to a very small number of disability retirees starting upon its enactment ) . redux: changing the cola formula . for military personnel not affected by redux ( i.e. , who entered service before august 1 , 1986 ) , each december a cola equal to the percentage increase in the cpi between the third quarters of successive years is applied to military retired pay for the annuities paid beginning each january 1 . for example , assume that the cpi rises from an average of 500.0 in the third quarter of 2008 ( the average of the cpi for the months of july , august , and september 2008 ) to an average of 520.0 in the third quarter of 2009 , an increase of 20.0 points , or 4.0% of 500.0 . the military retired pay that accrues during december 2009 , and is actually paid to retirees on january 1 , 2010 , would be increased by 4.0% above the amount paid the previous month . for military personnel whose retired pay would have been computed in accordance with redux , the 1986 act modified the above formula by providing that annual colas would have been held to one percentage point below the actual inflation rate for retirees under age 62 . retirees covered by the redux formula would thus have received a 3.0% increase , rather than 4.0% , in the hypothetical example described in the paragraph immediately preceding this one . however , under redux , when the retiree reached age 62 , there would have been a one - time recomputation of his or her annuity to make up for lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to the inflation rate minus one percentage point . after this one - time recomputation , however , future redux colas would have continued to be computed on the basis of the cpi minus one percentage point . repeal of the 1986 redux legislation: beginnings and the administration proposal . most discussion about repealing redux in 1998 and early 1999 revolved around changing its non - cola aspects . however , the legislative process , including the administration's own proposal , which eventually led to the repeal , included variations in the original redux cola formula from the beginning .
