a widespread recession is not historically unusual . for example , between 1980 and 1982 , all of the g - 7 countries except france and japan experienced a contraction in gdp for at least one year ( and growth was close to zero in france in 1981 ) . it is unlikely that all of those indicators will begin declining or rising simultaneously . thus , when comparing historical episodes , some of the symptoms associated with a recession may occur before or after the recession has officially begun or ended . in the recent episode , gross domestic product ( gdp ) began to fall ( in the fourth quarter of 2007 ) before employment ( in january 2008 ) , and both deteriorated significantly in the third quarter of 2008 . the economy began to grow again in the third quarter of 2009 , but employment continued to fall through december 2009 . recessions are not uncommon — 2008 marked the 11 t h since world war ii . in recent years , recessions have been less frequent — from 1982 to 2001 , there were only two recessions — but the length between the recent one and the prior one , 73 months , was comparable to the frequency of recessions from 1945 to 1981 . as can be seen from table 1 , the recent recession was 18 months long , making it the longest of the post - war period . it was almost twice as long as the median length of post - war recessions ( 9.5 months ) . recessions end because of monetary and fiscal stimulus — both were employed in the recent episode — and because markets automatically adjust . recessions affect economic well - being by their length and depth . when considering depth , the recent recession can be separated into two distinct phases . during the first phase , which lasted for the first two quarters of 2008 , the recession was not deep as measured by the change in gdp or unemployment . it deepened in the third quarter of 2008 , however , and remained deep through the first quarter of 2009 . after a slight further decline in the second quarter , the economy returned to expansion in the third quarter of 2009 . the fall in gdp during the recent recession , a cumulative 4.1% , was the deepest of the post - war period . by contrast , output fell by 1.4% in the 1990-1991 recession and 0.3% in the 2001 recession . the decline in output after the second quarter of 2008 was even larger than over the entire recession . residential investment is driven by changes in housing demand and credit conditions . changes in credit conditions are heavily influenced by monetary policy . both business investment and residential investment fell in each of the post - war recessions . in eight out of 10 recessions , there was a larger percentage decline in residential investment than in business investment .
