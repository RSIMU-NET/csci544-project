2881 includes two unique provisions . the first ( § 509 ) would require faa , to the maximum extent possible , implement "sustainable practices" in the construction and major renovation of air traffic control facilities in order to reduce energy use and improve environmental performance at those facilities . finally , each proposal includes provisions seeking to modify the air tour management program , a program designed to regulate commercial air tours over national park units primarily in an effort to mitigate noise and other adverse impacts . these provisions seek to narrow the scope of this program to park service units where noise or other adverse impacts from air tours have been identified or could become a more substantial issue . the second ( § 512 ) specifies the sense of the congress with respect to the european union ( eu ) directive extending the eu's emission trading proposal to international civil aviation . the bill specifies that , by not working through the international civil aviation organization in a consensus - based fashion , the eu directive is inconsistent with the convention on international civil aviation , and that it is antithetical to building international cooperation to address greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft . federal aviation administration , workshop on the impacts of aviation on climate: a report of findings and recommendations , august 2006 , at http: / / www.faa.gov / regulations_policies / policy_guidance / envir_policy / . general accounting office ( now the government accountability office ) , aviation and the environment: airport operations and future growth present environmental challenges , gao / rced - 00-153 , august 2000 . general accounting office , report to the subcommittee on aviation , house committee on transportation and infrastructure , aviation infrastructure: challenges related to building runways and actions to address them , gao - 03-164 , january 2003 . minnesota pollution control agency , "minneapolis / st . paul international airport environmental activities and the mpca," at http: / / www.pca.state.mn.us / hot / airport.html .
