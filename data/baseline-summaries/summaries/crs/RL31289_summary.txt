ch . 119 ( wire and electronics interception and interception of oral communications ) ,18 u.s.c . ch . 121 ( stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records access ) ,and 18 u.s.c . ch . 206 ( pen registers and trap and trace devices ) in their provision of thoseservices . cable companies had sought , in particular , to clarify their obligations with regard to releaseof personally identifiable information about subscribers and whether they were required to notify thesubscriber that the information had been requested by a governmental entity as required under the1992 cable act . under this section , no notification is required , but disclosure specifically does notinclude a subscriber's video programming choices . section 212 allows isps to divulge records or other information ( but not thecontents of communications ) pertaining to a subscriber if they believe there is immediate danger ofdeath or serious physical injury or as otherwise authorized , and requires them to divulge suchrecords or information ( excluding contents of communications ) to a governmental entity undercertain conditions . it also allows an isp to divulge the contents of communications to a lawenforcement agency if it reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of deathor serious physical injury requires disclosure of the information without delay . ( 40 ) section 216 adds routing and addressing information ( used in internetcommunications ) to dialing information , expanding what information a government agency maycapture , as authorized by a court order , using pen registers and trap and trace devices . ( 41 ) the content of any wireor electronic communications is excluded . a court shall enter an ex parte order permittinginstallation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device if it finds that an attorney for thegovernment or a state law enforcement or investigative officer has certified that the informationlikely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation . law enforcement officials mustkeep certain records when they use their own pen registers or trap and trace devices and providethose records to the court that issued the order within 30 days of expiration of the order . to theextent that carnivore - like systems fall with the new definition of pen registers or trap and tracedevices provided in the act , that language would increase judicial oversight of the use of suchsystems . section 217 allows a person acting under color of law to intercept the wire orelectronic communications of a computer trespasser transmitted to , through , or from a protectedcomputer under certain circumstances . section 220 allows for nationwide search warrants for e - mail instead ofrequiring separate search warrants for each jurisdiction in which the e - mail may be located , such asat the isp's location rather than where a crime was committed . section 224 establishes a 4-year sunset period ( until december 31 , 2005 ) formany of the title ii provisions , but among the sections excluded from the sunset are sections 210,211 , and 216 . as noted , the challenge for policy makers is balancing the needs of law enforcement with thedesire by the public to maintain its privacy .
