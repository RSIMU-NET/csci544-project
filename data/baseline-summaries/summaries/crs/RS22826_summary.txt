both bills , h.r . 4275 and s. 2405 , are entitled the "keeping americans warm act. there are two main components of energy expenditures . over half ( 57% ) are for utilities and fuel to operate , heat , and cool homes ; the remaining 43% are for gasoline and motor oil . within the category of utilities and fuel , electricity comprises the largest share of spending , representing nearly two - thirds ( 62.8% ) of this category . second is natural gas ( 27.6% ) , and the remaining 9.6% are petroleum - based fuels like fuel oil and propane . however , the reliance on certain fuels varies widely by geographic region . natural gas is the most commonly used source in the northeast ( 55% ) , midwest ( 79% ) and west ( 66% ) , while electricity is the most commonly used source in the south ( 52% ) . in the northeast , heating oil is also a significant fuel source , where it is reported second to natural gas as a primary fuel source ( see table 1 ) . petroleum - based products like fuel oil , propane , and gasoline comprise about 50% of household energy expenditures . increases in costs in this category reflect the significant increases in the price of crude oil over the past five years . over the past five years , the price per barrel of crude oil has risen nearly 200% . over the same period , prices charged to consumers for petroleum - based energy costs ( energy commodities ) increased 117% , while prices charged for energy services increased 38% ( see table 2 ) . growth in overall energy spending is driven by two key factors: the price charged to the consumer and the quantity demanded . energy prices to consumers have increased 70% between 2000 and 2007 as compared to a 20% rise in overall prices over the same time period . yet , they are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs . although in actual dollar terms older households spend slightly less on energy - related consumption than households headed by a person under age 65 , they spend a higher share of their income on energy - related expenditures . as shown in table 3 , in 2006 , older households spent 9.5% of their income on energy - related services compared to 7.4% for younger households in 2006 . among older households , lower - income elderly spend significantly more as a share of income for energy - related services compared to those with higher incomes . older households with less than $15,000 in household income spent approximately 20% of their income for energy - related expenditures , as compared to 7.3% for elderly households with incomes over $15,000 in 2006 . for utilities and fuel , these same households spent 13% of their income to heat and operate their homes , compared to only 4.7% for older households with $15,000 or more in income ( see table 4 ) . the $15,000 threshold for household income in table 4 is a close approximation to older households that have incomes below or near 150% of poverty .
