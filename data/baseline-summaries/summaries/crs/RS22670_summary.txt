but that is not the case here . in lone dissent , associate justice john paul stevens explained that he would affirm the federal circuit's majority opinion in the case , because he deemed that judgment to be "more faithful to the intent of the congress that enacted â§â 271 ( f ) . in his view , abstract software code , whether embodied in a physical medium or detached from it , should be considered a "component" within the meaning of â§ 271 ( f ) because it has no other intended use except for installation onto a computer's hard drive ; therefore , it is a "component" used for assembly of an infringing machine , and microsoft would be liable for exporting it . he also objected to the court's comparison of abstract software to blueprints , because "unlike a blueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something , software actually causes infringing conduct to occur . it is more like a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound than sheet music that tells a pianist what to do. the outcome of the microsoft decision is not unlike that of the deepsouth packing co. v. laitram corp . opinion in 1972 . in deepsouth , the supreme court interpreted the patent act as it was then written to exclude from infringement liability the making in the united states of the unpatented parts of a patented shrimp deveining machine , and exporting such unassembled parts to foreign buyers for combination abroad . congress then enacted â§ 271 ( f ) as a specific response to deepsouth , to expand the scope of patent infringement activity to include the supply of a patented invention's component from the united states for combination abroad . now in microsoft , the supreme court has expressly invited congress to consider whether it is desirable to revise patent infringement liability under â§â 271 ( f ) to include exporting software with the intent that such product be copied abroad for use on foreign computers . we need not and do not reach that issue here . associate justice samuel alito , in a concurrence joined by justices thomas and breyer , would have decided that particular issue raised in footnote 14 in favor of microsoft's assessment of liability under â§ 271 ( f ) . justice alito asserted that a "component" of an infringing physical device under â§ 271 ( f ) "must be something physical" ; thus , "[b]ecause no physical object originating in the united states was combined with these computers , there was no violation of â§ 271 ( f ) . he further observed that "[n]o physical aspect of a windows cd - româoriginal disk or copyâis ever incorporated into the computer itself" because the cd - rom is removed from the computer after the installation process copies the windows code to the computer's hard drive . therefore: [i]t is irrelevant that the windows software was not copied onto the foreign - made computers directly from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the united states .
