two factors affect this observation . oil - producing nations seem to be displaying an ever more nationalistic attitude toward their natural resource endowments , and the national oil companies are viewed as custodians of that resource . if there is opposition to u.s. foreign policy objectives , or if there is a more general negative reaction to the spread of global markets and private industry , nationalization of oil resources and transference to the national oil company is likely one of the most direct ways to make a political statement . given the tight balance between global supply and demand , this statement can be made with little or no cost in lost revenues . table 3 shows the 10 leading producing companies in the world . a company's ability to produce crude oil depends on access to oil deposits , but it also depends on access to modern technology . the private international oil companies generally have access to state - of - the - art technologies , which are less easily available to some other firms . gaining access to the best technology for exploration , development , and production is one of the key motivations oil producing nations have for entering production - sharing agreements with the private international oil companies . in 2006 , seven of the top 10 producing companies were state owned , including the five largest producers . although the three largest international oil companies were among the top 10 producers , and two of them , bp and exxonmobil , even managed to increase their total output , their production was from relatively small reserve bases , shortening the time they can remain in the market as producers without major new discoveries . the effects of rising world demand and higher prices since 2003 can be seen in the increased output of most of the companies on the list . one final factor in the power of the national oil companies should be noted . the organization of petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) allows these companies to compete to a degree they deem compatible with their national goals as specified by their governments and still coordinate their actions through opec when it is in their interests to show a more unified front in the world market . this ability to compete or coordinate their activities and decisions when it is in their , and their nations' , interests is not available to the private international oil companies . the reserve and production positions of the national oil companies might be little cause for concern if the companies operated much like the private international oil companies , and state ownership was only a matter of how the stock shares of the company were held . however , it is likely that the objectives for many national oil companies , as well as the characteristics of their operations , differ from companies in the private sector of the oil industry . recognition of national oil companies' growing dominance of the world oil market has led some experts to view this as an energy security issue . the growing strength of the national oil companies implies , at least in a relative sense , the diminished importance of the private international oil companies .
