although h.r . 6893 , as enacted , authorizes significant expansions in federal support for state and tribal child welfare programs , cbo projects a combined change in federal spending and revenues from the overall bill that is roughly budget neutral over ten years ( fy2009-fy2018 ) . specifically , cbo projects that the bill will reduce the federal budget deficit by $15 million over those ten years . this positive effect ( i.e . reduction in federal budget deficit ) is projected to be much larger in the first five years of the bill's enactment ( $449 million ) , in part because a number of the bill's provisions that are expected to increase federal spending are made effective a year or two after enactment and because the full effect of other provisions is phased in over five or more years . the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( h.r . 6893 ) was introduced by representative jim mcdermott , with representative jerry weller , on september 15 , 2008 , and passed the house ( under suspension of the rules and by voice vote ) on september 17 , 2008 . the bill then went to the senate where it was passed ( by unanimous consent ) on september 22 , 2008 . enacted on october 7 , 2008 as p.l . 110-351 , the final legislation represented a compromise between bills that were earlier acted on by the house and by the senate finance committee . these bills are the improved adoption incentives and relative guardianship support act of 2008 ( s. 3038 ) and the fostering connections to success act ( h.r . s. 3038 was introduced by senator grassley in may 2008 , and the senate finance committee approved the "chairman's mark" version of that bill on september 10 , 2008 ( s.rept . 6307 was introduced by representative mcdermott with representative weller in june 2008 , and it passed the house on june 24 , 2008 . both representative mcdermott and representative weller described the final bill , h.r . 6893 , as the product of bipartisan and bicameral legislative work and they cited the importance of senator max baucus and senator grassley in this effort . the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-351 ) is divided into six titles , most with multiple sections , and makes the following changes .
