appendix a . total lwcf appropriations for other purposes appendix b . annual lwcf appropriations for other purpose . these measures were not enacted . they included proposals to specify an amount or percentage of funding for two programs that are currently funded by the lwcf — the forest legacy program and cooperative endangered species conservation grants — although the lwcf act does not specifically authorize this funding . other proposals sought to authorize programs or activities that have not been funded by lwcf in the past , or that have been rarely funded by lwcf in the past . for instance , one 115 th congress bill would have authorized lwcf funding for certain programs and activities of the major land management agencies , including deferred maintenance , critical infrastructure , visitor services , and clean - up efforts ; the payments in lieu of taxes program ; and certain offshore energy exploration , innovation , and education activities . as another example , one 115 th congress bill proposed to authorize lwcf funding for financial assistance from the secretary of housing and urban development for park and recreation infrastructure projects . the balance of this report discusses the other purposes for which lwcf appropriations have been provided throughout the fund's history . it identifies the amount of funding contained in annual appropriations laws for other purposes and the types of purposes for which funds have been appropriated . a total of $72.0 million was appropriated from the lwcf for other purposes in fy1998 , the first year in which lwcf was used to fund other purposes . the total included $60.0 million for maintenance needs of the four land management agencies and $12.0 million for rehabilitation and maintenance of the beartooth highway ( in wyoming and montana ) . in fy1998 , total lwcf appropriations had spiked to approximately $969 million from the fy1997 level of about $159 million . both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual lwcf appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since fy1998 . ( see appendix b . ) over the most recent 10 years , lwcf appropriations for other purposes fluctuated , declining overall from $132.5 million in fy2010 to $93.3 million in fy2019 ( in current dollars ) . however , the fy2019 level was the highest appropriation since fy2010 . beginning in fy2011 , appropriations for other purposes in each year have been less than $100 million , as was the case for fy1998-fy2000 . appropriations for other purposes were at their lowest dollar amount in fy1999 , when no funds for other purposes were appropriated . the next - lowest dollar value was provided for fy2000 , when a total of $20.0 million was appropriated for three purposes: elwha river ecosystem restoration ( in washington ) , deferred maintenance of the nps , and the fs forest legacy program . by contrast , from fy2001 to fy2010 , appropriations for other purposes exceeded $100 million in each year . in fact , during four of these years ( fy2004-fy2007 ) , the annual appropriation was between $200 million and $225 million . the appropriation surpassed $400 million in another year during the period .
