this distinction did not hold for district court nominees . during the more recent presidential election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) , a greater percentage of district court nominees were confirmed in the second half of the year ( 45.7% ) than were approved post - june during the 1980 to 1992 presidential election years ( 35.4% ) . after starting with low percentages ( i.e. , tending less to occur between january and june ) than was the case in the 1980 to 1992 election years . instead , the percentage of post - june confirmations for the 1996 to 2008 election years as a whole , while still less than 50% , was higher than the confirmation percentage for district court nominations approved during the second half of the year during the 1980 to 1996 election years . during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , september accounted for 11.4% of all confirmed district court nominees , compared with 5.3% of all confirmed circuit court nominees . the current election year of 2012 is not represented in figure 1 . in 2012 , two circuit court nominees have been confirmed in may and one circuit court nominee confirmed each in february , april , and june . the greatest numbers of district court nominees in 2012 , as of june 30 , have been confirmed in march ( nine nominees ) and may ( four ) . unlike any of the previous election years dating back to 1980 , 2012 has had at least one district court nominee confirmed each month from january through june . a question of recurring interest to congress is whether , or to what extent , senate confirmations of judicial nominations tend to drop off in the second half of presidential election years . crs research has found that , during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , the senate usually , but not always , confirmed fewer circuit and district court nominees in the second half of the year than in the first half . overall , during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , 70.2% of confirmed circuit court nominees and 60.7% of confirmed district court nominees were approved during the first six months of the year . however , within the 1980 to 2008 time frame , crs also found notable differences , between the first four election years ( 1980 to 1992 ) and the last four election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) , in the extent to which confirmations dropped off after june . these differences can be seen in figure 2 , below . specifically , figure 2 shows , first for the 1980 to 1992 presidential election years , and then again for the 1996 to 2008 election years , the percentages of confirmed circuit and district court nominees who were approved by the senate from january to june versus from july to december . the figure reveals that senate confirmation of circuit court nominees all but stopped after june 30 during the more recent presidential election years of 1996 to 2008 .
