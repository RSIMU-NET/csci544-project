110-137 ) on the same day . on december 19 , congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill ( h.r . 2764 ) that incorporated 10 remaining regular appropriations bills into the state - foreign operations appropriations bill . on the same day congress also passed a fourth continuing resolution ( h.j.res . 72 ) , which the president signed two days later ( p.l . 110-149 ) , that funded government operations through the end of the calendar year . the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of fy2008 ( p.l . 110-161 ) on december 26 , which provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority . the administration's budget proposed fy2008 outlays of $2,902 billion , about $84 billion above the cbo baseline . both the administration and cbo have issued projections of future federal outlays . in addition , the budget resolutions passed by house and senate budget committees , which reflect congress's priorities , specify future paths for spending and revenues . table 3 summarizes these projections . the future path of federal receipts , as projected by the administration and cbo , is summarized in table 4 . because economic conditions strongly affect federal revenue streams , forecasts of federal receipts beyond the immediate short term are necessarily imprecise . the last few fiscal years have seen unexpectedly rapid growth in receipts ( in current dollars ) from year to year that neither omb nor cbo expect to continue . receipts grew by 5.5% from fy2003 to fy2004 , by 14.5% from fy2004 to fy2005 , and by 11.8% from fy2005 to fy2006 . these increases followed three years of falling receipts , from fy2000 through fy2003 . receipts rose from 16.3% of gdp in fy2004 , the lowest level for receipts since fy1959 , to 18.4% of gdp in fy2006 . omb's msr showed little variation in receipts as a share of gdp over the five - year window fy2008-fy2012 , ranging between 18.4% of gdp ( fy2008 ) and 18.7% of gdp ( fy2012 ) . cbo's baseline showed receipts rising once the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire , reaching 19.8% of gdp in fy2012 . deficits occur when congress and the president enact policies that cause federal spending to exceed federal receipts . deficits increase government debt held by the public , generally increasing net interest payments . surpluses occur when federal receipts exceed outlays , which reduces federal debt held by the public . this can , in turn , reduce net interest payments . many economists believe that running surpluses when economic growth is strong has desirable macroeconomic effects . the federal government last ran a surplus in fy2001 , which amounted to $128 billion or 1.3% of gdp . table 5 summarizes administration and cbo projections of federal deficits and surpluses . the actual fy2007 total deficit , $163 billion , was slightly below cbo's january estimate , and well below the administration's estimate in the fy2008 budget . the fy2007 on - budget deficit , which excludes a large social security surplus and a small postal service surplus , was $344 billion .
