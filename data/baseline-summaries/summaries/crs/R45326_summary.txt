shift to administration work plans . accompanying appropriations reports ( i.e. in fy2012 and fy2019 , congress provided $0.5 billion and $2.2 billion , respectively , in additional funding to usace through the annual appropriations process . the administration follows congressional guidance to develop post - enactment agency work plans that specify which projects receive the additional funding . unlike the justification documents that accompany the president's budget request , the project - level details in the work plan are quite limited . the study and construction funding represents 87% of the $17.398 billion in supplemental appropriations provided by bba 2018 to usace . of the monies in the construction account , congress has provided that $15.000 billion was to be used for the following: $10.425 billion is designated for expedited construction of flood and storm damage reduction projects in states and territories affected by hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria . $4.575 billion is to be used for usace flood and storm damage reduction construction activities in any state or territory with more than one flood - related major disaster declaration in calendar year ( cy ) 2014 , cy2015 , cy2016 , or cy2017 . of this amount , $50 million is set aside for smaller projects that reduce the risk of flooding and storm damage being performed under the agency's programmatic authorities ( known as continuing authorities programs ) . bba 2018 establishes requirements for states and insular areas to be eligible for bba 2018 study and construction funds . the geographic constraints on bba 2018 funds mean that some states and territories are eligible for all the funding , some states and territories are eligible for some of the study and construction monies , and some states and territories do not meet the requirements for the bba 2018 study and construction funds . usace projects in five states ( florida , georgia , louisiana , south carolina , and texas ) and two territories ( u.s. virgin islands and puerto rico ) meet the eligibility requirements for funding from both the $10.425 billion and the $4.575 billion , as shown in figure a - 1 . a total of 33 states and 3 territories meet the criterion of one flood - related major disaster declaration in cy2014 , cy2015 , cy2016 , or cy2017 , as shown in figure a - 1 ; that is , $4.575 billion in bba 2018 funds are available for use on usace construction projects in these 33 states and 3 territories . seventeen states ( eg , north carolina , which was affected by hurricane matthew in 2016 and hurricane florence in 2018 ) do not qualify for usace supplemental construction appropriations provided by the bba 2018 . when using bba 2018 construction funds ( but not when using annual appropriations ) , projects in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands and ongoing construction projects are 100% federally funded ; all other construction activities using these funds follow normal cost - sharing arrangements ( eg , typically 65% federal and 35% nonfederal for construction of flood control projects , but these percentages vary by project due to project - specific conditions ) .
