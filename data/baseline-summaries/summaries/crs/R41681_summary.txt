however , not all government advertising is controversial . this statute directed the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) to produce media campaigns to discourage illicit drug use . and not all advertisements that tell people what to do are ill regarded . few have criticized government advertising campaigns that have encouraged citizens to buy war bonds or avoid inadvertently setting forest fires . generally speaking , there are few government - wide restrictions on government advertising . furthermore , no single agency is charged with tracking and overseeing the advertising expenditures of federal agencies . some restrictions on agencies' advertising expenditures may be found in annual appropriations acts , the u.s. code , and the code of federal regulations . for example , the department of defense has been prohibited from using appropriated funds to pay the costs of advertising by any defense contractor ( 10 u.s.c . 114 amendments ) ; and 7 c.f.r . 12 contains guidelines for government advertisements promoting blueberries , honey , and mohair , among other agricultural products . for many decades , annual treasury appropriations laws have contained prohibitions on the use of funds for the purpose of "publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized by the congress. a fuller statement of the limitations on government advertising may be found in gao's principles of federal appropriations law , volume i . though not an independent source of legal authority , principles does provide some guidance as to what may be viewed as improper and / or illegal agency use of appropriated funds for agency activities that might be construed as advertising . principles begins with the 1919 federal anti - lobbying law ( 18 u.s.c . 1913 ) that prohibits agencies from using government funds to pay for advertisements that are designed to sway members of congress . principles also describes the prohibitions against "publicity and propaganda" included in appropriations acts since 1949 , the limitations on informational activities by agencies , and the prohibition of government use of "publicity experts. principles notes , whether an agency's appropriations are available for advertising , like any other expenditure , depends on the agency's statutory authority . whether to advertise and , if so , how far to go with it are determined by the precise terms of the agency's program authority in conjunction with the necessary expense doctrine and general restrictions on the use of public funds such as the various anti - lobbying statutes . under the "necessary expense doctrine," an agency may use a general appropriation to pay any expense that is ( 1 ) necessary or incidental to the achievement of the underlying objectives of the appropriation , ( 2 ) not prohibited by law , and ( 3 ) not otherwise provided for by statute or appropriation . "thus," gao explains , "the navy could exercise its statutory authorization to promote safety and accident prevention by procuring book matches with safety slogans printed on the covers and distributing them without charge at naval installations. the department of justice is responsible for prosecutions under the aforementioned 1919 anti - lobbying law . otherwise , oversight , investigation , and enforcement of appropriate practices regarding government advertising falls to agencies' inspectors general , gao , and congress .
