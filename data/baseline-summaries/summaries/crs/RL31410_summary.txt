therefore , this category is listed at zero . the taxes that supported the trust fund expired at the end of 1995 . the republican leadership , notably the chairman of the house ways and means committee during the 104 th through 106 th congresses , opposed reinstating the taxes except as part of a comprehensive cercla reauthorization that would remove or modify superfund's liability provisions . epa collected $1 million in fy2007 , and omb forecasts $2 million in fines and penalties for both fy2008 and fy2009 . there are at least three factors contributing to rff's increased need projections . first , the fund's unobligated balance , which remained relatively high ( see figure 1 ) during the years of superfund taxes ( and the two fiscal years following the tax expiration ) , has decreased steadily since fy1997 , reaching zero at the end of fy2003 . as discussed earlier , the current sources of the balanceâcost recoveries , interest , and feesâprovided significantly less funding support than the superfund taxes . second , the amounts needed for cleanup were projected to increase beginning in fy2002 , as numerous "mega sites" moved beyond the analysis and design phases and into actual construction of remedies . the administration requested a $10 million increase in program funding for fy2009: $1.26 billion compared with the $1.25 billion appropriated in fy2008 . omb estimated that of the total fy2009 appropriation , $1.09 billion would come from general treasury revenues in fy2009 . if the appropriation language were enacted as proposed , the actual amount of general treasury revenues would depend on the fund's starting balance and the appropriation ceiling enacted by congress . regardless , the vast majority of the fy2009 appropriation would come from general treasury revenues . to estimate general revenue funding needs for superfund in 2008 and later years , it is first necessary to identify future program needs . in july 2001 , resources for the future ( rff ) , as directed by congress in the fy2000 va - hud - independent agencies appropriation ( p.l . 106-74 ) conference report , released a comprehensive study to congress identifying those needs and projecting future costs for fiscal years 2000-2009 . the study looked at all major elements of the superfund program , including the removal program ( for emergency and short - term cleanups ) ; the remedial program ( long - term cleanup ) ; site assessment activities ; program staff , management , and support costs ; program administration ; and superfund - related work of other programs and agencies . the authors developed alternative scenarios for estimating the number , type , and cost of sites likely to be added to the program in coming years . rff estimated the fy2009 program needs to be $1.6 billion . this was the report's "base case"âdescribed as "our best judgement of the future cost of the superfund program , given the full body of our research , analyses , and interviews. the report also estimated a high and low case , to reflect uncertainties about the factors used in their cost models . the low estimate for fy2009 was $1.4 billion ; the high estimate was $1.8 billion .
