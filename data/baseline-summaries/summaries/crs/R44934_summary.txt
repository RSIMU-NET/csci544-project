appropriations are complex . budget justifications for some agencies are large , often several hundred pages long and containing numerous funding , programmatic , and legislative changes for congressional consideration . further , appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts , activities , and subactivities , and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information . this report generally does not provide in - depth information at the account and subaccount levels , nor does it detail budgetary reorganizations or legislative changes enacted in law or proposed for fy2019 . for fy2019 , the enacted appropriation for interior , environment , and related agencies in p.l . 116-6 was $35.61 billion . however , whereas the senate would have provided level funding for many accounts , the house more often supported decreases ( eg , science and technology , and environmental programs and management ) or increases ( eg , water infrastructure finance and innovation program , and hazardous substance superfund ) . for fy2019 , epa received $8.06 billion in title ii of the regular appropriations law , and another $791.0 million in title iv of that law , for an fy2019 regular appropriation of $8.85 billion . this was a $25.0 million ( 0.3% ) increase over the fy2018 total appropriation . the $8.06 billion enacted for fy2019 in title ii was equal to the fy2018 appropriation for title ii ( and the senate - passed level for fy2019 ) . the fy2019 enacted appropriation included funding at the fy2018 level for each epa account except for stag , which increased by $42.9 million ( 1.2% ) over fy2018 . there was a corresponding change in rescissions , with $42.9 million more in ( account - specific ) rescissions enacted in fy2019 than in fy2018 . fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , differing amounts of reductions from the fy2018 level ( $1.59 billion ) were proposed for fy2019 by the administration ( 23.1% ) , house ( 0.9% ) , and senate ( 1.2% ) . the administration sought to reduce funding for the resource management account overall , with cuts in programs such as ecological services , habitat conservation , and fish and aquatic conservation , and to eliminate funding for programs including cooperative landscape conservation and science support . the house and senate versions of the bill would have increased funding for resource management , with little change for many programs relative to fy2018 , and would have retained funding for cooperative landscape conservation and science support . citing "higher priorities," the administration also proposed eliminating discretionary appropriations for two other fws accounts â€” the cooperative endangered species conservation fund and the national wildlife refuge fund . the house - and senate - passed bills retained discretionary funding for these accounts . further , the administration proposed relatively large reductions from the fy2018 level for the land acquisition ( 89.1% ) and construction ( 79.3% ) accounts . the house and senate supported smaller reductions for both accounts . the fy2019 enacted appropriation of $1.58 billion was $17.0 million ( 1.1% ) less than the fy2018 appropriation .
