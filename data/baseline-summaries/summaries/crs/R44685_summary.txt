in the data captured for this report , no jobholders fall into this category . the earliest date at which senate committee staff included in this report received pay was october 4 , 2000 . some of these lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level positions in some senate committees ; if so , senate committee employees in those roles appear to follow national trends for others in entry - level types of jobs , remaining in the role for a relatively short period of time . similarly , those in more senior positions , which often require a particular level of congressional or other professional experience , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . there is wide variation among the job titles used for various positions in congressional offices . between october 2000 and march 2016 , house and senate pay data provided 13,271 unique titles under which staff received pay . a number of staff who stay in a position for only a brief period may depress the average length of tenure . another common measure of central tendency , the median , represents the middle value when all the observations are arranged by order of magnitude . the median can be understood as a representation of a center point at which half of the observations fall below , and half above . extremely high or low observations may have less of an impact on the median . generalizations about staff tenure are limited in at least three potentially significant ways , including the following: the relatively brief period of time for which reliable , largely inclusive data are available in a readily analyzable form ; how the unique nature of congressional work settings might affect staff tenure ; and the lack of demographic information about staff for which tenure data are available . considering tenure in isolation from demographic characteristics of the congressional workforce might limit the extent to which tenure information can be assessed . additional data on congressional staff regarding age , education , and other elements would be needed for this type of analysis , and are not readily available at the position level . finally , since each senate committee serves as its own hiring authority , variations from committee to committee , which for each position may include differences in job duties , work schedules , office emphases , and other factors , may limit the extent to which data provided here might match tenure in a particular office . despite these caveats , a few broad observations can be made about staff in senate committees . between 2006 and 2016 , staff tenure , based on the trend of the median number of years in the position , appears to have increased by six months or more for staff in four position titles in senate committees . the median tenure was unchanged for seven positions , and decreased for four positions . this may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states .
