, indigence ) . the public charge ground does not apply to applicants under the special immigrant programs for iraqis and afghans ; thus , these applicants are not required to demonstrate economic self - sufficiency . the process of applying for an iraqi or afghan special immigrant visa has multiple steps . the application process described in this section is for iraqis and afghans who are abroad , who represent the vast majority of applicants . what they share is the extraordinary danger of their job . targeted for death by insurgents , they also face suspicion from their employers and often lie to relatives for fear that word of their job will get out . this excerpt from a january 2006 article in a michigan newspaper suggests the dangerous work that iraqi interpreters and translators performed in support of the u.s. war effort . other sources similarly document the work performed by afghan interpreters and translators and the danger they face . for example , a former afghan interpreter for the u.s. military , profiled in a january 2017 article , said that it was too dangerous for him to return from the afghan capital to his native province because of the taliban . according to the interpreter: [taliban] will stop the car and block the road , and say , 'come here , i need you , bro' â€¦ then hang me or shoot me . in january 2006 , the 109 th congress enacted the first in a series of legislative provisions to enable certain iraqi and afghan nationals to become u.s. lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) based on their service to the u.s. government . section 1059 of the fy2006 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) made certain iraqi and afghan nationals who had worked directly with u.s. armed forces as translators eligible for special immigrant visas ( sivs ) . special immigrants comprise a category of permanent employment - based admissions under the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) . upon admission to the united states , holders of sivs are granted lpr status . a house judiciary committee report on a related bill in the 109 th congress to provide special immigrant status for iraqi and afghan translators ( h.r . 2293 ) described the need for the legislation , as follows: a number of alien translators currently working in iraq and afghanistan embedded with units of the u.s. armed forces are providing extremely valuable services . their cooperation and close identification with the u.s. military have put these individuals and their families in danger . this danger will only escalate after u.s. forces leave or reduce their strength in iraq and afghanistan . congress subsequently broadened the special immigrant classification for translators and also authorized a second special immigrant classification for certain iraqi and afghan nationals who had worked for , or on behalf of , the u.s. government in iraq or afghanistan , respectively . this report analyzes the siv classifications for iraqis and afghans within the context of both the larger ina special immigrant category and selected other permanent admissions categories .
