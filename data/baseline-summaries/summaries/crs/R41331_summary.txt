appendix a . minimum essential coverage appendix b . penalty examples the following are illustrative penalty examples for single individuals and for families of four ( specifically , a married couple with two children under the age of 18 ) . in all of the examples , the individual or individuals are subject to the individual mandate penalty for an entire calendar year . the 2014 and 2015 examples use actual tax filing thresholds and penalty caps for the respective year . the 2014 filing thresholds are $10,150 for a single individual under the age of 65 with no dependents ( single filing status ) and $20,300 for a married couple filing jointly . the 2014 penalty cap is $204 per month per individual , up to a maximum of five individuals . the 2015 filing thresholds are $10,300 for a single individual under the age of 65 with no dependents ( single filing status ) and $20,600 for a married couple filing jointly . the 2015 penalty cap is $207 per month per individual , up to a maximum of five individuals . neither the tax filing thresholds nor the penalty caps for 2016 have been determined . because the filing thresholds are linked to an inflation adjustment based on the consumer price index for all urban consumers ( cpi - u ) , they likely will be higher when implemented in 2016 . the examples for 2016 use estimated filing thresholds . the congressional research service does not have the information needed to estimate the 2016 penalty caps ; therefore , estimated penalty caps are not used in the 2016 examples . because the 2016 filing thresholds are estimated and the penalty caps are not used , the numbers for 2016 are meant for illustrative purposes only . these examples are best used to show the relative scope of the penalties and the relationship between the various components of the formulas for calculating the penalty . penalty examples: single individual based on the information above , the following are illustrative individual - mandate penalties for a single individual with no dependents who is subject to the penalty for an entire calendar year . in 2014 , an individual with income above $10,150 ( the tax filing threshold ) but at or below $19,650 will pay the $95 flat amount ; an individual with income above $19,650 but below $254,950 will pay 1% of applicable income ( the difference between the individual's income and $10,150 ) ; the penalty cap will apply to an individual with income at or above $254,950 , so the individual will pay $2,448 . in 2015 , an individual with income above $10,300 ( the tax filing threshold ) but at or below $26,550 will pay the $325 flat amount ; an individual with income above $26,550 and below $134,500 will pay 2% of applicable income ( the difference between the individual's income and $10,300 ) ; the penalty cap will apply to an individual with income at or above $134,500 , so the individual will pay $2,484 .
