, controlled for ) . the data in table 2 show the different control variables in the compensation studies . table 2 indicates the differences , and thus a large part of the reason for discrepant findings , between the human capital studies and the jobs analysis study . the range of worker and job characteristics is sufficiently broad across sectors that claims about "average" workers generally conceal much of the variation driving differences in compensation . for purposes of policy , the most informative studies show variation in compensation differentials by some control variables , particularly by some measure of human capital ( eg , education ) or detailed occupation . benefit comparisons are more difficult to model than wage comparisons . while estimates of wages are relatively straightforward ( and available from the cps and other data sources ) , data on benefits are less available and require assumptions on the part of researchers . for example , placing an average value on employer - subsidized health insurance requires assumptions about the coverage of the insurance , which may not be readily available . likewise , placing a value on "job security" requires difficult - to - quantify assumptions about preferences of individual workers ( eg , risk aversion , job commitment ) . benefit differentials tend to be the largest component of compensation differentials that are identified across the reviewed studies , and they are more difficult to interpret because they are measured in less precise ways than wages . benchmark comparisons are useful but the assumption underlying these studies is that compensation in the federal sector is either too high or too low compared to this benchmark . an alternative assumption , which is generally not present in the studies , might be that private sector pay may need to be altered to be in line with federal compensation in some instances . in fields such as finance and law , where private sector compensation can vastly exceed public sector compensation , the private sector benchmark may not consistently be the "right" figure in those areas . additionally , there may be some types of work , involving specialized technical knowledge , where consistency of service and longer tenures are valued and perhaps worthy of a premium . some federal occupations have no clear private benchmark . this reality makes it unclear what the finding of a compensation premium or penalty for such occupations compared to the private sector means . similarly , in some occupational areas ( eg , intelligence , regulatory ) , the federal government is the major employer and must attract workers in a competitive environment ; in these occupational areas , a private benchmark may not be informative . across the board adjustments to compensation of federal employees may have unintended consequences . findings in the cbo study , in particular , demonstrate the wide compensation differentials that exist across human capital characteristics . adjustments that are made uniformly may narrow differences between some federal and private sector workers but widen differences for other workers . the existence of a wage gap does not necessarily indicate a premium or penalty that is attributable to an observed and measureable characteristic , such as sector of employment .
