nonimmigrant overstays have been an issue in the debate over immigration control for many years . the remaining 59% were assumed to have entered the united states illegally . recent estimates indicate that the unauthorized resident alien population ( commonly referred to as illegal aliens ) rose from 3.2 million in 1986 to 12.4 million in 2007 , before leveling off at 11.7 million in 2012 . statutorily , the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides the elements to control the entry and exit of foreign nationals . provisions of law requiring electronic immigration databases and the collection of biometrics were enacted before the close of the 20 th century . over the years , it became apparent that the data on nonimmigrant overstays were unreliable because these data were based upon the i - 94 arrival / departure form . the i - 94 forms are no longer collected from foreign nationals at air and sea ports , and the integrity of the i - 94 collection process at land ports is problematic , as discussed above . as congress debates comprehensive immigration reform and its component parts of immigration control ( i.e. estimates of nonimmigrant overstays residing in the united states are plagued by the broader difficulties in measuring all three components of unauthorized migration — aliens entering without inspection between ports of entry and aliens entering with fraudulent documents , as well as aliens overstaying or otherwise violating the terms of legal entry . the extent that some nonimmigrant overstays become "quasi - legal" aliens ( eg , those who have legal permanent resident petitions pending or have sought relief from removal from an immigration judge ) further complicate the estimates . reportedly , the failure of dhs to consistently update the alien's record — for example if the authorized period of admission is extended , if deferred departure is granted , or if the immigration status changes — is another major factor that prevents dhs from calculating reliable estimates of overstays . a way forward on the issue of nonimmigrant overstays seems out of reach , absent a reliable method to measure emigration or an effective exit - monitoring system . moreover , two major classes of nonimmigrants are exempt from filling out the i - 94 when visiting the united states for business or pleasure: canadian citizens admitted for up to six months and mexican citizens entering with a border crossing card ( laser visa ) along the southwestern border who intend to limit their stay to less than 30 days and intend not to travel beyond a set perimeter from the border . in 1981 , the select commission on immigration and refugee policy ( scirp ) cited nonimmigrant visa abuse and document control as concerns and included the establishment of a "fully automated system" to track nonimmigrant arrivals and departures from the united states among its recommendations to the president and the congress . this unanimous recommendation for an automated entry / exit system to monitor nonimmigrant overstays was part of a comprehensive set of proposals that scirp offered as part of its statutory mandate to evaluate the existing laws , policies and procedures governing the admission of immigrants and refugees to the united states .
