committees specialize not only in policies but in the politics of those policies . the result has been an explosion of citizen communications with congress . the amount of constituent mail ( postal and email ) reaching members has increased almost tenfold in the past 20 years , to almost half a billion messages per year . social media contacts by citizens to members are not aggregated , but presumably now comprise a non - trivial number of communications . with the marginal cost reduced to near zero , citizens have little incentive not to contact committees , even if previously such contact was unwelcomed or ignored . in effect , technological change may be opening the committee system up to greater public interaction . electronic communications are faster than traditional forms of member - citizen communications . this is obvious , but it has several important implications for how committees choose to use new platforms , including social media , and how those choices might shape their communications strategy . in the past , if committees wanted to send out time - sensitive communications on congressional action , the best outlet was probably a faxed press release to the media , perhaps to the local newspapers serving a committee member's district or state . there was no point in trying to send postal mail directly to citizens at that speed . now , however , members can update constituents on floor activity or other business instantly , using subscribed email lists or social media . likewise , constituents can use email and social media to contact members in real time . this advantage changes not only how quickly information can be shared but also the types of information members and citizens might provide each other . in the past , real - time information about an upcoming amendment in a committee markup might not have been possible to communicate ; the vote might have taken place before the member could alert the constituents about it , or before constituents could communicate preferences to the member . with the rise of electronic communications , constituents and members can easily share information about such an amendment in real time . some members have used social media to conduct "virtual town halls. these forums , similar to a regular town hall meeting or a tele - town hall , where constituents could call in to ask questions , allow participants to ask questions through a designated social media platform ( eg , twitter or facebook ) . virtual town halls leverage the interactivity of social media platforms and allow for instantaneous questions and answers on twitter , and longer conversations on facebook . while there was no evidence in the data set that committees are engaging in virtual town halls , it is possible that future field hearings could utilize a social media platform to allow for public comment or testimony . virtual town halls could also pose unique challenges for committees . unlike members who could utilize real - time constituent communication in their decision making , committees generally observe policy and executive branch operations over a longer time horizon . as political scientist douglas arnold described , the committee system is the principle vehicle for gathering and analyzing information .
