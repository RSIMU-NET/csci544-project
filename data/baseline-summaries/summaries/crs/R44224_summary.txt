for example , h.r . 3631 , the medicare premium fairness act , would have frozen the 2010 monthly medicare part b premium at the 2009 level for all part b enrollees . another bill , h.r . 1832 , the medicare prescription drug affordability act of 2009 , would have , among other things , expanded the hold - harmless provision to premiums paid for medicare part d. in addressing the potential application of the hold - harmless provision in 2016 , the 114 th congress may consider reducing the expected premium levels for some or all of those not be protected by the hold - harmless provision and / or reducing the deductible . no cola was implemented in 2010 or 2011 . for 2012 through 2015 , retirees received colas of 3.6% , 1.7% , 1.5% , and 1.7% , respectively . however , the average cpi - w for july and august of 2015 is lower than that for the third quarter average in 2014 . the social security administration therefore expects that there will be no cola in 2016 . the final numbers used to determine the social security cola for 2016 ( i.e. , the cpi - w for september 2015 ) are expected to be released on october 15 , 2015 . but , as previously noted , the trustees also expect that there will be no social security cola in 2016 and that the hold - harmless provision will apply to most beneficiaries . because most beneficiaries would be held harmless in this situation and their premiums would remain at the 2015 amount ( $104.90 per month ) , the premiums of the 30% of beneficiaries not held harmless would need to cover all of the expected increased costs so that 25% of part b costs would still be covered by beneficiary premiums . in other words , if the hold - harmless provision were not in effect in 2016 , everyone who pays the standard premium would pay about $120.70 per month ; however , if it goes into effect , those not held harmless are expected to pay standard premiums of close to $160 per month ( $159.30 ) , while those who are held harmless would continue to pay $104.90 per month . the medicare trustees estimate that , in 2017 , the hold - harmless provision will no longer be in effect and the standard premium will decrease to about $120.70 . ( see figure a - 1 . ) the ssa does not specify how medicare premiums are to be set in years in which there is an increase in medicare part b premiums but no social security cola . although the hold - harmless provision protects beneficiaries who receive social security benefits against increases in their medicare premiums , aside from those paying the high - income premiums , the law is silent with respect to those who would not be held harmless under these circumstances .
