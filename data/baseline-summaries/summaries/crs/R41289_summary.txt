, from the date the claim was received by the va ) . the number of claims pending has been of growing concern to veterans , vsos , and members of congress . congress appropriated additional resources toward reducing the accumulation of claims and appeals . total monthly receipts for vdc were just under $3.7 billion in fy2012 . although ssdi and vdc both serve the goal of providing income security for individuals with disabilities , these programs fundamentally differ in how they define "disability" and determine eligibility for benefits . for example , an individual must be unable to work to be eligible for ssdi benefits , yet employability is not a factor in vdc disability determinations . indeed , veterans that receive a disability rating from the va will not necessarily be eligible for ssdi benefits , unless their particular condition prevents them from entering the civilian workforce under specific ssa guidelines . this report seeks to clarify why one group of individuals with disabilities may be eligible for benefits under vdc , but ineligible for benefits under ssdi ( and vice versa ) , through a description and comparison of several distinguishing characteristics of the ssdi and vdc programs . this report concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing the administration of both programs , including processing delays for pending claims and appeals . these issues will be of particular interest to congress due to the high numbers of ssdi claims resulting from a combination of the recent economic decline , an increase in the number of baby - boomers approaching retirement age and their most disability - prone years . in addition , the extension of presumptive conditions has expanded the pool of veterans eligible for vdc . there are clear differences in the general goals of ssa and va disability compensation programs that have likely evolved from the ssdi focus on administering benefits primarily for a civilian work population , which contrasts with the vdc focus on compensating individuals for the adverse health conditions connected to military service . under current statute , the vasrd is used as the sole tool in determining compensation levels for veterans with service - connected disabilities . the vasrd ratings are presumed to reflect the "average" impact of the impairment on "average" earnings capacity or economic loss . however , because vdc is granted for any condition incurred or aggravated by military service , vdc is also provided for conditions that do not impact employment or earnings capacity ; thus , payments for those conditions then reflect noneconomic loss . a 2007 report by the veterans' disability benefits commission concluded that va disability compensation should additionally compensate veterans for "â€¦ their inability to participate in usual life activities and for the impact of their disabilities on quality of life," also called noneconomic loss . the institute of medicine has also made recommendations on developing and implementing a methodology that can be used to evaluate the impact of disabilities on veterans' quality of life . this methodology could presumably be used to recommend appropriate compensation for veterans' noneconomic loss . crs is not aware of similar studies or efforts to identify ways to compensate ssdi recipients for noneconomic loss .
