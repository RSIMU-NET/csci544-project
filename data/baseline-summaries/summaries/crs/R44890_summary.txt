cipa . the administration's request for cipa totaled $1.20 billion , a 37% decrease from the fy2017 actual level of $1.91 billion . the department asserted that because the united states would not have an opportunity to achieve a reduction in its u.n. peacekeeping assessment rate until december 2018 , reduced u.s. funding had to be achieved through reductions in overall u.n. peacekeeping budget levels or reduced u.s. contributions . the department added that while u.n. peacekeeping missions help achieve u.s. government objectives , these missions must be implemented in a more effective manner , enabling them to better "address conflicts , support political solutions , and meet the needs of the people they are intended to help. the request also included a call to other permanent members of the u.n. security council to join the united states in a strategic review of each peacekeeping mission , and more equitable mission cost sharing among u.n. member states . 3362 would have provided $1.50 billion for cipa . this would have been a 25% increase relative to the administration's fy2018 request and a 22% decrease from the fy2017 actual figure . the appropriations report noted that the committee recommendation provided the resources necessary to fund the assessed cost of peacekeeping missions at the statutory level of 25% . it also stated the committee's concern about the scope , duration , and costs of u.n. peacekeeping missions and supported u.s. efforts to bring down costs while maintaining u.s. interests and international security . the senate committee measure , s. 1780 , would have provided $1.38 billion for cipa . this figure constituted an approximately 16% increase compared with the administration's request , a 27% decrease from the fy2017 actual figure , and an 8% decrease from the amount that would have been provided under h.r . as with the house committee measure , the appropriations report for s. 1780 stated that the bill provided sufficient funds for contributions equal to the 25% statutory limitation on such contributions . 115-141 provided an appropriation of $1.38 billion for cipa . this marked a reduction of 28% from the fy2017 actual figure and an increase of 16% relative to the administration's fy2018 request . while the total amount provided for cipa through p.l . 115-141 is very close to that provided through the senate measure , p.l . 115-141 provides $20,000 less than what would have been provided had the senate committee measure been enacted . of this appropriation , more was provided for oco ( $967.46 million ) than was offered in the house committee measure ( $965.91 million ) and the senate committee measure ( $602.34 million ) . however , the enduring appropriation ( $414.62 million ) was lower than the senate committee measure ( $779.76 million ) and the house committee measure ( $529.91 million ) . as with the appropriations reports accompanying the house and senate committee measures , the explanatory statement accompanying this law states that sufficient funds are provided for united states contributions to peacekeeping missions at the statutory level of 25% . the administration's fy2018 budget request for the educational and cultural exchange programs account totaled $285 million , a 55% reduction from the fy2017 actual level of $634.14 million .
