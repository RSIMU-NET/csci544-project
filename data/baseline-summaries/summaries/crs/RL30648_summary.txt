the debate concerning biotechnology patents is reviewedbelow . the other significant substantive patentability standard is the so - called utility requirement . this requirement is ordinarily satisfied if the invention is operable and provides a tangible benefit . should be made freelyavailable to scientists everywhere. ( 53 ) a numberof biotechnology companies lost a substantialpercentage of their market capitalization as investors sold shares in record numbers . ( 54 ) among theseenterprises were human genome sciences , inc , which fell 25% on the day on the announcement,and incyte pharmaceuticals , inc. , which fell 30% . ( 55 ) the chief concern of many sellers was thatbiotechnology patent rights would be weakened or subject to uncertainty . ( 56 ) the united states patentand trademark office ( "pto" ) responded by issuing a press release on march 16 , 2000 , explainingthat u.s. patent policy was unaffected by the joint statement . as the impact of the clinton - blairannouncement was better understood , the stock prices of many biotechnology enterprises rose . ( 57 ) the clinton - blair announcement was not an isolated incident . however , even if credible , atleast one asserted utility must also be both specific and substantial . ï¿½ a utility is specific when it is particular to the subject matter claimed . for example , a polynucleotide said to be useful simply as a "gene probe" or "chromosome marker" doesnot have specific utility in the absence of a disclosure of a particular gene or chromosometarget . similarly , a general statement of diagnostic utility would ordinarily be insufficientto meet the requirement for a specific utility in the absence of an identification of whatcondition can be diagnosed . ï¿½ a substantial utility is one that defines a "real world" use . utilities that require or constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real world"context of use are not substantial utilities . for example , basic research that uses a claimednucleic acid simply for studying the properties of the nucleic acid itself does not constitutea substantial utility . ( 155 ) many observers have greeted the new pto guidelines favorably . the former director of the national institutes of health ( nih ) , dr. harold varmus , stated that he was "very pleased with theway [the pto] has come closer to [the nih's] position about the need to define specific utility. ( 156 ) dr. francis collins , director of the national human genome research institute , has said that thenew utility guidelines are "quite reassuring in terms of making sure that we end up with an outcomewhere the patent system is used to provide an incentive for research and not a disincentive. ( 157 ) inaddition , dr. craig venter , the president and chief scientific officer of celera genomicscorporation , recently stated that he was "pleased to see [the pto] is raising the bar" on genepatents . ( 158 ) an interesting aspect of the new pto utility guidelines is their compatability with the governing case law . although each application must be considered on its own merits , the guidelinesappear to be closer to the holding of brenner v. manson than brana .
