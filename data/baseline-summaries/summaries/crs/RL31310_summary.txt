b . examples of location unspecified projects are energy conservation funding , somemajor and minor construction projects , and classified projects for militaryconstruction ; and maintenance , furnishings and utilities accounts for familyhousing , among others . c. special accounts include brac , the nato security investment fund , thehomeowners assistance fund ( zeroed out this year ) , and the dod familyhousing improvement fund . the most noticeable reduction in budget authority is seen in domestic military construction . table 3 compares military construction budget authority betweenfy2002 and fy2003 for military construction projects located within the unitedstates , divided between the active duty and reserve ( national guard and federalreserves ) components . table 3 . domestic military construction , active duty and reserves ( $000 ) source: dod comptroller , construction programs ( c - 1 ) , department of defense budget , fiscal year 2003 , february 2002. a . these figures do not include the additional funds requested for the fy2003 derf . these figures represent decreases of 38.8% in active duty and 71.9% in reserve construction funding between fy2002 and fy2003 . secretary of defense donaldrumsfeld and dod comptroller dov zakheim stated in a press briefing on february4 , 2002 , that they expected a 20 to 25% reduction in military bases during thefy2005 brac round and anticipated this with a reduced construction request . ( 23 ) thisdecrease in construction was to be offset by an increase in sustainment funds . ( 24 ) table4 compares the dod sustainment funds requested for fy2003 with those actuallyexpended in fy2001 and appropriated for fy2002 . ( 25 ) table 4 . sustainment funding trend , fy2001-fy2003 ( current $000 ) source: dod comptroller , operation and maintenance programs ( o - 1 ) : department of defense budget for fiscal year 2003 , february 2002 . note: total obligational authority ( toa ) . sustainment includes all dodfacilities sustainment , restoration , and modernization ( fsrm ) accounts . * these figures do not include additional funds requested for the fy2003derf . the table shows that sustainment funding rose $267 million between fy2001 and fy2002 . if the same rate of increase ( 4.8% ) occurred between fy2002 andfy2003 , dod would have been expected to request $6.089 billion . instead , dodrequested $6.488 billion , or approximately $398 million beyond the normalexpectation . this increase may be considered to constitute the substantive additionalfunds devoted to maintaining existing property . in addition , some members have deemed dod funding requests for the army national guard , the air national guard , and the federal reserves particularlyinadequate . ( 26 ) until the late 1980s , the amount ofmilitary construction fundingappropriated by congress for the guard and reserve rose steadily , closely matchingthe amounts requested by dod . for fy1989 , though , the administration began todecrease its requests for guard and reserve construction . congress responded byappropriating funds in excess of the request ( see figure 1 ) . senator christopherbond commented during floor debate on fy1996 military constructionappropriations that "national guard forces traditionally have been underfunded" inconstruction requests submitted by the pentagon . ( 27 ) since fy1989 , congress hasconsistently appropriated more than the administration request , and the gap betweenrequest and enactment has grown considerably .
