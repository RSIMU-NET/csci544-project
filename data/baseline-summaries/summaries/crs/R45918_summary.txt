discoveries. patents are generally available to any person who "invents or discovers any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof. patent rights do not arise automatically . rather , to obtain patent protection under the patent act , an inventor must formally apply for a patent with the pto , beginning a process called patent prosecution . during prosecution , a patent examiner at the pto evaluates the patent application to ensure that it meets all the applicable legal requirements to merit the grant of a patent . to be patentable , an invention must be ( 1 ) â directed at patent - eligible subject matter , ( 2 ) â useful , ( 3 ) new , ( 4 ) â nonobvious , and ( 5 ) adequately disclosed and claimed in the patent application . if the pto finds these requirements met , it will issue ( i.e. , grant ) the patent . patents typically expire 20 years after the date of the initial patent application . the current law of patent - eligible subject matter will be discussed separately in detail below . the remainder of this section briefly reviews the other requirements for patentability , the scope and effect of patent claims , and the legal rights granted to the holder of a valid patent . at the most general level , there are two basic requirements for an invention to claim patent - eligible subject matter . first , the invention must fit into one or more of the four statutory categories in section 101âthe claimed invention must be a ( 1 ) process , ( 2 ) machine , ( 3 ) â manufacture , or ( 4 ) composition of matter . given the ( intentionally ) expansive nature of these terms , nearly all claimed inventions will satisfy this requirement . nonetheless , exceptions to this rule do exist . for example , in in re nuijt en , the federal circuit held that a transitory electromagnetic signal was neither a process , manufacture , machine , or composition of matter , and was therefore not patent - eligible subject matter . because most claimed inventions fit into one of the four statutory categories , the second requirement tends to be more practically important , and receives most of the attention . the second patentable subject matter requirement is that the invention cannot claim one of the judicially created categories of ineligible subject matterâthe claimed invention must not be a ( 1 ) â law of nature ; ( 2 ) natural phenomenon ; or ( 3 ) abstract idea . as explained below , the modern supreme court has articulated a two - step test for this second requirement , known as the alice / mayo framework . the supreme court has justified the three ineligible categories as necessary to prevent patent monopolies on the "'basic tools of scientific and technological work,'" which "might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it. thus , the court has explained that "a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not patentable subject matter .
