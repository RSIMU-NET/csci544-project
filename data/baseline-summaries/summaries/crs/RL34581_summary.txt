seven served entirely during the 19 th century . by 1967 ( 90 th congress ) , a total of 100 members had served 30 years or more . as of february 11 , 2009 , ( 111 th congress ) that number had risen to 240 . among members of the 111 th congress , 16 incumbent senators and 18 incumbent representatives have served 30 years or longer . table 1 lists members who have served 30 years or longer in descending order of the length of their congressional service , as measured in days . for each member , the table presents the member's party and state represented ; dates of the member's first and last day of service , by chamber ; days of service in each chamber ; and total days of congressional service . total service is also presented in years and fractions of years . calculations of days of service varied according to the pattern of a member's service . for example â€” clarence a. cannon of missouri served in one continuous period from 3 / 4 / 1923 through 5 / 12 / 1964 . the elapsed time from one date to the other was 15,045 , but because representative cannon served for each of the elapsed days and on the first day , we add one day to the elapsed time for a total of 15,046 days . justin morrill served in both the house and the senate , continuously from 3 / 4 / 1855 to 3 / 3 / 1867 in the house ( 4,383 days ) and from 3 / 4 / 1867 to 12 / 28 / 1898 in the senate ( 11,623 days ) . morrill's total congressional service was the sum of those two periods , 16,006 days . henry jackson of washington also served continuously in both the house and the senate , but because of a statutory change there is an overlap of one day in his official dates of service . jackson served in the house from 1 / 3 / 1941 through 1 / 3 / 1953 , but his first day in the senate was also on 1 / 3 / 1953 . if we simply added his house service ( 4,384 days ) and his senate service ( 11,199 days ) , we would double - count 1 / 3 / 1953 ; so we add the days of service in each chamber ( 15,583 days ) and subtract one day from that sum for jackson's total days of congressional service ( 15,582 days ) . alternately , we could simply count the days from when his house service started through the date of the day when his senate service ended . samuel smith served in the house , then in the senate , then again in the house , and then once again in the senate . his first period of service ( in the house ) did not overlap with the second ( in the senate ) .
