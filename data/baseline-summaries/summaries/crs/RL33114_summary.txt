that is all this bill does. despite this deceptively simple language of purpose , the safe harbor provision has been the subject of confusion and litigation for many years following its enactment . for over two decades , federal courts struggled to define the breadth and contours of the exemption , particularly concerning the types and uses of patented invention covered by the safe harbor . the question presented to the supreme court was "whether uses of patented inventions in preclinical research , the results of which are not ultimately included in a submission to the food and drug administration ( fda ) , are exempted from infringement by 35 u.s.c . â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) . in a unanimous opinion written by justice scalia , the court vacated the judgment of the federal circuit and held that the â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) safe harbor protected the preclinical use of patented compounds "as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing that the experiments will produce 'the types of information that are relevant to an ind or nda'" submission to the fda . the court explained: [w]e think it apparent from the statutory text that â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) 's exemption from infringement extends to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the development and submission of any information under the fdca . this necessarily includes preclinical studies of patented compounds that are appropriate for submission to the fda in the regulatory process . there is simply no room in the statute for excluding certain information from the exemption on the basis of the phase of research in which it is developed or the particular submission in which it could be included . the court rejected integra's argument that the scope of the safe harbor is limited only to preclinical studies pertaining to the safety of a drug in humans . since the fda requires an ind to be filed before human trials can begin , ind applications must include summaries of a drug's efficacy , pharmacokinetics , pharmacology , and toxicological effects in animals . this data would necessarily have to be developed in preclinical studiesâinformation that is "reasonably related" to an fda submission and thus covered by â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) . the court further disagreed with integra's claim that merck's preclinical research is disqualified from safe harbor protection because the experiments were not conducted in conformity with the fda's "good laboratory practices" ( glp ) regulations . two reasons supported the court's reasoning: first , the fda's glp regulations concerning preclinical studies apply only to experiments on drugs "to determine their safety," and not to studies of a drug's efficacy , mechanism of action , pharmacology , or pharmacokinetics ; second , even non - glp compliant safety - related studies are suitable for submission in an ind , when such studies are accompanied by a reason for the noncompliance . the original legislative intent behind the hatch - waxman act that created â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) was to facilitate the introduction of a generic drug upon the patent expiration of the brand name drug .
