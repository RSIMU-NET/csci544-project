this will be the final update of this report . a key issue in the fy2011 appropriations debate was the impact of discretionary federal spending on the nation's budget deficit . the budget deficit represents the level of spending , as measured by outlays , in excess of revenues . appropriations acts , like those detailed in this report , provide budget authority . the outlays for a fiscal year result from the budget authority provided in that fiscal year as well as some budget authority provided in previous fiscal years . included in the outlay level are all types of spending ( i.e. , emergency , non - emergency , overseas contingency operations ) occurring during the fiscal year . under the congressional budget office ( cbo ) march 2011 baseline , the last cbo baseline estimate published prior to the enactment of p.l . 112-10 , the budget deficit for fy2011 was estimated at $1,399 billion . in that baseline , cbo assumes a full - year continuation of funding in fy2011 at roughly fy2010 levels . the proposals analyzed in this report provide annualized discretionary outlay levels as follows: fy2011 president's budget ( february 2010 ) — $1,415 billion cbo baseline — $1,361 billion h.r . 1 — $1,356 billion s.amdt . 149 — $1,372 billion p.l . 112-10 — $1,365 billion h.r . 1 , the proposal which proposed the greatest reduction to budget authority relative to current levels , would result in a discretionary outlay level that is $5 billion under the cbo march 2011 baseline level of discretionary outlays . this reduction in discretionary outlays comprises 0.4% of the deficit estimated under the cbo baseline . savings from other proposals that would produce smaller reductions in discretionary outlays would correspondingly represent a smaller fraction of the cbo march 2011baseline deficit . the proposal that was ultimately enacted , p.l . 112-10 , is expected to result in a discretionary outlay level that is $4 billion above the cbo march 2011 baseline level of discretionary outlays . some reductions in discretionary spending could also affect the level of mandatory or net interest spending or the amount of revenue collected , potentially impacting the ultimate deficit level for fy2011 . for a more detailed look at the broad budgetary impact on fy2011 spending proposals , see crs report r41771 , fy2011 appropriations in budgetary context , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . the table below is intended to provide a sense of how funding for federal departments and agencies would be impacted by the different proposals , rather than the impact of each proposal on overall budget numbers . the data represent discretionary appropriations as provided in the respective proposals , by bill title . the final column compares the fy2010 and fy2011enacted funding levels . the title and bill totals do not include scorekeeping adjustments . rescissions of prior year funding are noted as separate line items and are not deducted from the title totals . this report is intended to facilitate comparative analysis of the key proposals in the now completed fy2011 appropriations process .
