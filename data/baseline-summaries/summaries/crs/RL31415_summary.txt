to recover them . ( 70 ) critical habitat is that which is "essential to the conservation of the species. the senate language - by requiring that the management activities identified in an inrmp effectively conserve listedspecies - arguably is broad and addresses the general duty to conserve , rather than speaking only tosome requirement equivalent to designating critical habitat . the senate provision would have beenan addition to title 10 of the united states code , rather than an amendment to the esa , and onlyaddressed the secretary of interior and not esa - related actions that might be taken by the secretaryof commerce . the senate language also would not affect the requirement to consult under ï¿½ 7 ofthe esa , but did not add an express requirement to consider impacts on national security to theelements that must be weighed in designating critical habitat . the enacted language on critical habitat differs from both the house and senate bills . section 318 ( a ) of p.l . 108-136 precludes the designation of critical habitat on lands owned or controlled bythe department of defense , or designated for its use , that are "subject to" an inrmp under the sikesact , if the secretary determines in writing that "such plan" "provides a benefit" to the species "forwhich critical habitat is proposed" for designation . this language is somewhat ambiguous in thatmost dod lands are "subject to" having an inrmp under the sikes act . assuming that theintended meaning is that the dod lands have in place a completed inrmp , that plan must bedetermined to "provide a benefit" to a listed species - arguably a low threshold for the secretary todemonstrate . the conference report states: .. . this approach would allow for a balance between military training requirements and protection of endangered or threatened species , as pertains topending or future critical habitat designations . the conferees would expect the secretary of the interior to assess an inrmp's potential contribution to species conservation , giving due regard tothose habitat protection , maintenance , and improvement projects and other related activities specifiedin the plan that address the particular conservation and protection needs of the species for whichcritical habitat would otherwise be proposed . consistent with current practice , the secretary wouldestablish criteria that would be used to determine if an inrmp benefits the listed species for whichcritical habitat would be proposed . ( 71 ) the report language refers to species for which critical habitat "would otherwise be proposed,"but the statutory language refers to species for which critical habitat is proposed . the wordingcontained in the report is probably what was intended , but the enacted language arguably requiresa formal proposal of critical habitat before the findings as to inrmp coverage can be made .
