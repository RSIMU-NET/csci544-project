al . v. the inter tribal council of arizona , inc. et . al. 12-71 , june 17 , 2013 . on june 4 , 2013 , the house committee on house administration held a hearing on the voter registration efficiency act ( h.r . the bill is intended to reduce the number of voters registered in multiple states , among other things . the bill would amend the national voter registration act of 1993 to require individuals registering to vote in a state to indicate if the state will be the individual's residence for the purpose of voting and for other purposes . efforts to establish a national voter registration system followed closely on the heels of passage of the voting rights act in 1965 . in the early 1970s , a substantial effort was made to establish a national "postcard" or mail registration system . in the 92 nd congress , both the senate and the house held hearings on a proposal to establish a national voter registration system , with the census bureau conducting postcard registration for federal elections . the proposal came to the senate floor for a vote but was tabled . in the 93 rd congress , both the senate and the house again considered much the same proposal ; a national postcard voter registration system , administered by a new national voter registration administration located in the census bureau . the senate passed the bill ( s. 352 , s. rept . 93-91 ) on may 9 , 1973 ( vote: 57-37 ) . the house , on may 8 , 1974 , refused to take up the bill ( h.r . 8053 , h. rept . 93-778 ) to establish a national postcard voter registration system by rejecting the rule under which the measure was to be debated on the floor ( vote:197-204 ) . in 1975 , the house passed a modified version of the postcard voter registration measure , eliminating the required mass mailing of postcards to every household ; the postcards were to be made available at post offices and other public offices ( h.r . 11552 ; august 9 , 1975 , h. rept . 94-798 , vote: 239-147 ) . the measure , however , stalled in the senate . during the first year of the carter presidency , reform efforts focused on passage of a national voter registration standard that would have allowed citizens to register to vote on election - day ( h.r . 5400 , h. rept . although the proposal initially received strong support , negative reactions from local election officials appear to have caused support to erode . the house version never came up for a vote on the floor . like the house version , the senate bill ( s. 1072 , s. rept . 95-171 ) was reported out of committee but never came up for a vote . by mid - 1977 , election - day voter registration was essentially defeated , and there was little or no effort to revive it for the rest of the carter presidency . between 1983 and 1988 various measures to reform voter registration were proposed .
