appendix a . generic drug user fee proposal appendix b. biosimilars user fee proposal appendix c. acronym . the bsufa provisions in s. 3187 and h.r . 5651 are essentially identical and differ from the hhs proposal in only minor technical details . gdufa would add new ffdca sections 744a , 744b , and 744c , and bsufa would add new ffdca sections 744g , 744h , and 744i . a biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to a brand - name ( innovator ) biological product made by a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company . a biological product , or biologic , is a preparation , such as a drug or a vaccine , that is made from living organisms . in contrast to the relatively simple structure and manufacture of chemical drugs , biosimilars , with their more complex nature and method of manufacture , will not be identical to the brand - name product , but may instead be shown to be highly similar . the biotechnology industry began developing its first biologics for use as human therapeutic agents in the late 1970s and early 1980s . the first fda approval of a biotechnology drug for human use , human insulin , occurred in 1982 . others followed , including human growth hormone in 1985 , alpha interferon in 1986 , tissue plasminogen activator in 1987 , and erythropoietin in 1989 . biotechnology products are expected to become a larger share of the drugs sold by the pharmaceutical industry to u.s. consumers . however , with no parallel to the generic alternatives for chemical drugs , the cost of therapeutic biologics is often prohibitively high for individual patients . for example , the costs per year ( in 2009 ) of some commonly used biologic drugs are reported as follows: enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis , $26,000 ; herceptin for breast cancer , $37,000 ; rebif for multiple sclerosis , $40,000 ; humira for crohn's disease , $51,000 ; and cerezyme for gaucher's disease , $200,000 . biological products are , in general , regulated — licensed for marketing — under the public health service ( phs ) act , and chemical drugs are regulated — approved for marketing — under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) . the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 ( p.l . 98-417 ) , often referred to as the hatch - waxman act , provided a mechanism for the approval of generic drugs under the ffdca but not under the phs act . on march 23 , 2010 , president obama signed into law a comprehensive health care reform bill , the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ; p.l . title vii of ppaca , the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 ( bpcia ) , established a new regulatory authority within the fda by creating a licensure pathway for biosimilars analogous to that which allowed for the approval of generic chemical drugs via the hatch - waxman act . under the new pathway , a biosimilar may be approved by demonstrating that it is highly similar to a biological product that is already allowed on the market by fda .
