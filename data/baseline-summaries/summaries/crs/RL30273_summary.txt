no further action was taken on any of these bills . 850 , as introduced , would have amended the export administration act of 1979 to grant the secretary ofcommerce sole authority over nonmilitary encryption . after a one - time 15-day technical review ( meaning a reviewtodetermine that the item works as represented ) , the secretary could no longer have required an export license for awidevariety of encryption hardware and software , except pursuant to the trading with the enemy act ( twea ) orieepa . thesecretary would also have been required , after a one - time 15-day technical review , to permit the export of strongencryption for nonmilitary end uses ( 1 ) in countries to which certain financially - related encryption could then beexported,unless there was substantial evidence that the item would be diverted to a military end use or an end use supportinginternational terrorism , modified for military or terrorist end use , or reexported without any u.s. authorization thatmightbe required under the eaa , or ( 2 ) if he determined that comparable encryption was commercially available abroadfrom aforeign supplier without effective restrictions . parts 120 through 130 . arms exportersmustregister with the federal government and obtain licenses before items may be exported . the designation of itemsas defensearticles and defense services for regulation under the aeca is not judicially reviewable . ( 13 ) unlike the eaa , the aecadoes not require foreign availability to be taken into account in licensing decisions . section 38 provides thepresident withstrong enforcement authorities and authorizes stringent criminal and civil penalties for those who violate the aecaand itsimplementing regulations . the nsa has played a role in the licensing process , advising as to the national securityimpactof an export and examining such factors as the sensitivity of a product and its end users ; it has also providedtechnicaladvice in the determination of whether an item belongs on the usml . ( 14 ) in implementing the aeca , the state department may decide that a product is not defense - related and transferjurisdiction over that item to the bureau of export administration ( bxa ) of the department of commerce ( doc ) .

( 17 ) in the early 1990'sthe department of state had exempted from aeca control nine types of encryption ( including smart cards andencryptionfor use in financial transactions ) and transferred authority over these items to the commerce department . ( 18 ) jurisdictionover encryption exports could also be transferred to doc for mass market software under an expedited commodityjurisdiction procedure ( 19 ) and as a result ofcase - by - case review .
