appendix a . levels . the same study found that fdi had a larger effect on china'sexports - a finding that would be expected given the large role of foreign affiliated firms in exports . ( 33 ) foreign affiliates are , by far , the largest source of china's exports of high - technology products . in 2000 , 93% of all exports of electronic circuits came from foreign affiliated companies . in dataprocessing , office machines , and related products , the share of foreign affiliates was as high as 85%and in mobile phones ( transmitter - receiver apparatus ) as high as 96% . ( 34 ) fdi also played a major rolein the drastic change in the composition of chinese exports . in 1985 , primary products andresources - based manufactures accounted for 49% of all exports . by 2000 , their share had droppedto 12% , while the share of high - technology exports grew from 3% in 1985 to 22% in 2000 . ( 35 ) ( seetable 7 ) this structural change in china's exports toward higher technology , more dynamic , andhigher value added products played a role in the increase in china's share of world trade , which rosefrom 1.6% in 1985 to 6% in 2000 . ( see appendix b ) table 7 . china's export structure , 1985-2000 ( percent share ) source: u.n. conference on trade and development , world investment report , 2002 , annex tablevi.5 , pp . from a macroeconomic perspective , fdi plays a dual role in easing the foreign exchange constraint faced by most developing nations . this constraint is the lack of foreign exchange to payfor imports and repay past borrowing that places bounds on the rate of economic growth and hasbeen at the heart of financial crises that have occurred in latin american , asian , and african nations . a nation generates foreign exchange by exporting more than it imports and by attracting capital fordirect and portfolio investment . in 2001 , china added $43 billion to its foreign exchange reserves ( a total of $286 billion at the end of 2002 ) . this $43 billion was generated primarily by a $17.4billion current account surplus ( including a $34 billion merchandise trade surplus ) and a $37.4billion net direct investment inflow ( inflows minus outflows of $9.7 billion ) that offset a $19.4billion deficit in portfolio investment . ( 36 ) fdicontributed both to china's surplus in investmentinflows and to its surplus in trade . without fdi , china would probably have faced a severe shortageof foreign exchange and likely would have had to curtail its rapid growth . this creates a dependencyby beijing on foreign investors who play a critical role in breaking china's foreign exchangeconstraint and in modernizing chinese industries and export structure . another effect of fdi in china and the price competitiveness of chinese exports has been the possibility that china is exporting deflation to the world economy . currently , hong kong , japan,singapore and , to a lesser extent , the united states and europe have been grappling with the effectson deflation on their economies .
