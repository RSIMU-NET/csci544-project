these distributions are called reed act distributions . the most recent reed act distribution that was a regular and not a special reed act distribution was $15.9 million and occurred in 1998 . the balanced budget act ( bba ) of 1997 , p.l . 105-33 , limited the reed act distributions for the 1999 to 2001 period to special distributions of $100 million each year . any amounts in excess of the $100 million that — absent the bba amendments — would have been transferred to the states "shall , as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year , accrue to the federal unemployment account , without regard" to its statutory limit . in march 2002 , the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 , p.l . 107-147 , provided for a one - time special reed act distribution of up to $8 billion to state accounts in the utf , where the funds were distributed based upon the formula used for regular reed act distributions , using calendar year 2000 state information . this excess balance is transferred first to the euca . when that account reaches its statutory maximum , the remaining excess balance is transferred to the fua . when all three accounts are at their statutory maximums , any remaining excess balance is distributed to the accounts of the states in the utf based on each state's share of u.s. covered wages . reed act distributions occurred in 1956 through 1958 and 1998 through 2002 . table 1 lists the distributions . the law labeled this transfer a "reed act" distribution although it differed from traditional reed act distributions , most notably because the law distributed a set dollar amount which was not determined by the statutory ceilings in the federal accounts and was distributed before the end of a fiscal year . there was no reed act distribution in 2003 , and no regular reed act distribution is projected through fy2021 . according to the department of labor , there is no projected distribution through fy2021 on account outstanding loans owed to the general fund of the u.s. treasury . according to a general account office ( gao , now know as the government accountability office ) report , the $8 billion reed act distribution reduced 2003 unemployment taxes in 22 states and uc administration costs in 17 states . the center for employment security education and research ( ceser ) , a component of the national association of state workforce agencies ( naswa ) , with the assistance of booz allen hamilton and decern consulting , examined how states used the $8 billion special reed act distribution of 2002 . this study found that approximately half of the reed act distribution was used to lower state unemployment taxes in 2003 and 2004 from what they would have otherwise been . the special distribution also led to increases in spending on uc benefits , uc administration , and employment services . the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l . 111-5 §2003 ) provided for a special utf distribution .
