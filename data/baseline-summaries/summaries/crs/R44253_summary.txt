no further action was taken . the president and the executive branch in 1962 , president john f. kennedy issued an executive order ( e.o . 11007 ) that reinforced the doj advisory committee requirements . the executive order defined an advisory committee as any committee , board , commission , council , conference , panel , task force , or other similar group ... that is formed by a department or agency of the government in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations ... that is not composed wholly of officers or employees of the government . 11007 also limited the lifespan of all federal advisory committees to "two years from the date of â€¦ formation" unless special actions were taken by an agency or department head to continue the committee . president nixon signed the federal advisory committee act into law ( p.l . 92-463 ) on october 6 , 1972 . following the signing of faca , then - president nixon rescinded e.o . 11671 , which previously had been the primary document guiding the creation and operation of federal advisory bodies . legislative and executive branch efforts since faca's enactment in the years since faca's enactment , congressional oversight hearings have resulted in legislative and executive branch attempts to clarify the statute or streamline the number of faca committees . one substantial amendment to faca was the 1977 federal advisory committee act , which incorporated the sunshine act ( p.l . 94-409 ) into the law . the sunshine act is specifically designed to make government agency meetings more publicly accessible and transparent . another significant change in faca's administration came in december 1977 when e.o . 12024 transferred advisory committee oversight duties from the director of omb to the administrator of general services . additional executive orders have been issued since the law's inception ; many of them abolished particular federal advisory committees or lengthened the lifespan of others . from 1983 through 1989 , legislation was introduced in congress to strengthen faca's management controls , as well as to establish new ethical , financial , and conflict - of - interest disclosure requirements for committee members . none of these bills were enacted . on february 10 , 1993 , president william j. clinton issued e.o . 12838 , which required each executive department to "terminate not less than one - third of the advisory committees subject to faca ( and not required by statute ) ... by the end of fiscal year 1993. . agency heads were required to review all advisory committees under their jurisdictions and eliminate them or justify in writing why they were necessary to continue . committees would need approval from the omb director to continue operation . the following year , as part of the national performance review , vice president albert gore issued a memorandum requiring all agencies to reduce advisory committee costs by 5% . the memorandum also stated that president clinton would not support legislation that established a new advisory committee or exempted an advisory committee from faca . on october 5 , 1994 , alice m. rivlin , then - acting director of omb , released a circular detailing management policy for remaining faca committees .
