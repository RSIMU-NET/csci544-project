gain from collectibles is taxed at 28% . there is also an exclusion of $500,000 ( $250,000 for single returns ) for gains on home sales . current practice departs from this approach . gains are not taxed until realized , benefitting from the deferral of taxes . ( taxes on interest income are due as the interest is accrued. ) gains on an asset held until death may be passed on to heirs with the tax forgiven ; if the asset is then sold , the gain is sales price less market value at the time of death , a treatment referred to as a "step - up in basis. taxes on long - term capital gains ( on assets held for at least a year ) are imposed at rates that correspond to pre - 2018 brackets: a 0% rate for those whose income placed them in the regular 15% bracket or less ( now in the 12% bracket ) , and 15% for taxpayers in higher brackets , except for those in the 39.6% bracket . the tax revision adopted in december 2018 ( p.l . 115-97 ) maintained the links to the income level corresponding to the rate brackets in prior law . therefore , the tax rates on capital gains are affected only by changes in the deductions to arrive at taxable income and the use of a different method of indexing for inflation . under the new law , the original 10% and 15% brackets are replaced by a single 12% rate bracket that ends at the same point as the end of the 15% bracket . there is no 39.6% bracket ( the top rate is 37% and begins at a higher level than the top bracket under previous law ) . in 2017 , the 39.6% bracket began with taxable income of $470,700 for joint returns and $418,400 for single returns . gain arising from prior depreciation deductions is taxed at ordinary rates , but there is a 25% ceiling rate on the gain from prior straight - line depreciation on real property . health reform legislation in 2010 provided for a tax of 3.8% ( the same level as the medicare rate of 3.8% on labor income ) on high - income taxpayers on various forms of passive income , including capital gains . the tax applies to passive income in excess of $250,000 for joint returns and $200,000 for single returns . gains in partnership interest derived from the performance of investment services ( carried interest ) are treated as long - term capital gains if held for at least three years . in contrast to these provisions that benefit capital gains , capital gains are penalized because many of the gains that are subject to tax arise from inflation and therefore do not reflect real income . capital gains were taxed when the income tax ( with rates up to 7% ) was imposed in 1913 . an alternative rate of 12.5% was allowed in 1921 ( the regular top rate was 73% ) . tax rates were cut several times during the 1920s . capital gain exclusions based on holding period were enacted in 1924 , and modified in 1938 , to deal with bunching of gains in one year .
