the other three are to be operational by 2020 . the united states gives the uae small amounts of assistance to help safeguard its nuclear program and prevent illicit exports of technology from it . for fy2015 , the department of energy provided the country with about $370,000 for such purposes , and for fy2016 , about $220,000 was provided for those programs . on other technology issues , in july 2014 the uae announced it will form a "uae space agency" that , by 2021 , is to launch an unmanned spaceship that will probe mars . the government plans to send its first astronaut to the international space station in april 2019 . the uae , a member of the world trade organization ( wto ) , has developed a free market economy , but its financial institutions are weakly regulated . as have the other gcc states that have long depended on exports of hydrocarbons , the uae has announced plans and policies ( "vision 2021" ) to try to further diversify its economy to a "post - oil" era . dubai emirate , in particular , has long pursued an economic strategy based on attracting investors to construct luxurious and sometimes futuristic projects that provide jobs and attract tourism and publicity . the country is also accepting investment by china under that country's "belt and road initiative" ( bri ) intended to better connect china economically to other parts of asia , central asia , the middle east , and africa.in april 2019 , the uae and china signed deals worth $3.4 billion , most of which will be invested to store and ship chinese products from the uae port of jebel ali . to help it weather the effect of the sharp drop in oil prices since mid - 2014 , the government cut some subsidies and raised capital on international markets , including an april 2016 bond offering of $5 billion and an october 2017 bond offering of about $10 billion . the government budget was only slightly in deficit 2017 and 2018 , and , coupled with the bond offerings , the uae has been able to avoid drawing down its $600 billion in various sovereign wealth funds overseen by the emirates investment authority ( eia ) . the key factor in the uae's wealth is that it exports large amounts of crude oil while having a small population that receives benefits and services . the uae exports nearly as much oil as iraq , while its citizen population is a small fraction of that of iraq . abu dhabi has 80% of the federation's proven oil reserves of about 100 billion barrels , enough for over 100 years of exports at the current production rate of about 2.9 million barrels per day ( mbd ) . of that , over 2.2 mbd are exported , and the uae has as much as 500,000 bpd of spare capacity . uae representatives indicated in late october 2018 that they might increase production to over 3 mbd , but the subsequent sharp drop in world oil prices and opec agreement in november 2018 to cut production has likely forestalled any uae production increase .
