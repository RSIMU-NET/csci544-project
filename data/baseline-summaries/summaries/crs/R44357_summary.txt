in the house , h.r . that bill had included $225 million for oe , which was the amount recommended by the house appropriations committee . in late september 2016 , a continuing resolution ( p.l . 114-223 , division c ) set fy2017 funding for oe at the fy2016 level through december 9 , 2016 . on december 10 , 2016 , a second continuing resolution provided funding at the fy2016 level through april 28 , 2017.the various steps of the congressional process for the fy2017 e&w appropriations are outlined in table 4 . for additional background on selected oe programs , funding , and policy aspects , see the following crs reports . crs report r44465 , energy and water development: fy2017 appropriations , by [author name scrubbed] crs report r43966 , energy and water development: fy2016 appropriations , by [author name scrubbed] crs report rs22858 , renewable energy r&d funding history: a comparison with funding for nuclear energy , fossil energy , and energy efficiency r&d , by [author name scrubbed] crs report r41886 , the smart grid and cybersecurity — regulatory policy and issues , by [author name scrubbed] crs report r43604 , physical security of the u.s. power grid: high - voltage transformer substations , by [author name scrubbed] crs insight in10425 , electric grid physical security: recent legislation , by [author name scrubbed . each program office has its own set of goals and funding needs . the fy2017 request sought to establish three new programs . table 3 shows the funding breakdown for existing and proposed activities by program office . it also shows congressional recommendations for fy2017 . after the administration issued its fy2017 budget request , congress held a number of doe oversight and appropriations hearings . as noted previously , further actions were taken in the house and senate on doe funding recommendations in the e&w bills , s. 2804 and h.r . in the senate , s. 2804 was incorporated into h.r . 2028 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute , and it was approved on the senate floor . the senate - passed fy2017 e&w bill included $206 million for oe — the same amount as the fy2016 appropriation . 5055 was defeated in house floor action . further opportunities arise from growing use of shale gas production and decreasing costs for information technologies which allow improved grid control and more opportunities for customer management of power use . oe operates seven program offices and one administrative office ( program direction ) . the nation's energy infrastructure is diverse . it includes a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures ( electricity , oil , and natural gas ) , an array of operating models ( public and private ) , and a variety of hardware and software . the energy sector consists of thousands of electricity , oil , and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically . thus , interdependency within the sector and across the nation's critical energy infrastructure sectors is significant . coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately - owned infrastructure .
