appendix a . key dates for ipab implementation appendix b . a comparison of ipab and medpac appendix c. medicare productivity exemptions and board recommendations ppaca section 3401 altered certain market basket updates used to adjust medicare base payment amounts and incorporated productivity improvements into those market basket updates that previously did not include them . since some providers and suppliers of services will receive a reduction in payments beyond their productivity adjustment in some years , section 3403 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( iii ) prohibits , as described below , the board from recommending in some years further reduction in payment rates to those providers and suppliers . all of the providers and suppliers subject to section 3401 productivity adjustments are listed in table c - 1 . to be exempt under section 3403 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( iii ) from board recommendations in any given year a provider would have to be slated to receive a reduction under section 3401 in its inflationary payment update in excess of a reduction due to productivity in a year in which such recommendations would take effect . reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivityÂ adjustment an "update reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivity" means that for that category of provider , after calculating any applicable percentage increase in payments due to changes in costs , reduced by the productivity adjustment , payments are further reduced by an additional applicable percentage specified in section 3401 . for example , in rate year 2012 , payments to long term care hospitals will be adjusted by changes in their costs , changes in productivity in the broader economy , and then reduced by an additional 0.10 percentage point . again , only those providers that are subject to this additional reduction in payments will receive a time - limited exemption from board recommendations . therefore , the relevant factor in determining whether providers have an exemption is whether the provider had a reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivity in the year the recommendation would take effect . if so , that provider is exempt from board recommendations that take effect in that year . providers subject to section 3401 table c - 1 also indicates which providers are subject to a productivity adjustment , a reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivity , or some other adjustment ; the applicable time period of the adjustment ; and whether the adjustment gives rise to an exemption period under section 3403 . crs analysis of cms statistics indicates that in 2009 medicare payments to exempt providers represented approximately 37% of all medicare benefit payments . proposals generated by the board in 2018 and submitted to the president and congress in 2019 could include provisions , relating to any provider , that the secretary would begin implementing effective august 15 , 2019 , and later . by 2020 , all exemptions will have lapsed and all providers of services and supplies will potentially be subject to board recommendations . such procedures are designed to promote timely consideration of such a joint resolution .
