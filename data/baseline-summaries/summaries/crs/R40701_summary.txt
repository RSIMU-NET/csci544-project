however , h.r . 5 would not limit the use of alternate assessments in the accountability system . in addition , h.r . 5 as passed by the house . 5 would make changes to title i - a accountability requirements that would affect assessments for students with disabilities . s. 1094 would authorize ( but not require ) the development of alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities . it would limit the use of alternative assessments in state accountability systems by continuing to limit the percentage of scores used within the accountability system to 1% of all students . however , s. 1094 would not authorize the development or use of alternate assessments aligned with modified achievement standards for other students with disabilities . further , it would explicitly prohibit the development or implementation of any modified achievement standard . 5 would also authorize ( but not require ) the development of alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities . 5 would not explicitly authorize or prohibit the development or use of alternate assessments aligned with modified achievement standards for other students with disabilities . appendix a. characteristics of alternate assessments appendix b . methods of redistributing scores appendix c. redistributing scores example lea a does not exceed the 1% cap ; it is 0.1% under the cap . however , lea a exceeds the 2% cap by 0.6% . the amended version of h.r . lea b is under the 1% cap by 0.3% and over the 2% cap by 0.3 percent . 5 was passed on july 19 , 2013 , by a vote of 221-207 . in this case , lea b does not exceed that 3% limit , so it does not need to redistribute any scores . it is unclear whether s. 1094 will be considered on the senate floor . subsequent references to s. 1094 and h.r . 5 in this report refer to s. 1094 as ordered reported by the help committee and h.r . because an lea ( or state ) may exceed the 2% cap by the amount it is below the 1% cap , the lea only needs to redistribute 0.5% of its proficient and advanced scores as non - proficient scores ( 0.9% + 2.6% = 3.5% ; 3.5% - 3.0% = 0.5% ) . an lea or state may exceed the 2% cap provided that it does not have more than a total of 3% proficient and advanced scores from both types of alternate assessments ( aa - aas and aa - mas ) . lea c exceeds the 1% cap by 0.4% , but it is under the 2% cap by 0.5% . an lea or state may not exceed the 1% cap ( unless the lea has an exception from the state ) , even if it has less than 2% of proficient or advanced scores on aa - mas . the 113 th congress is actively considering whether to amend and extend the esea . as part of these deliberations , consideration has been given to how students with disabilities are included in accountability systems .
