each of these is discussed below . the house armed services committee , in its report ( h.rept . 110-146 of may 11 , 2007 ) on the fy2008 defense authorization bill ( h.r . 1585 ) , approved the navy's fy2008 request for the second of two increments of procurement funding for the amphibious assault ship lha - 6 , the second of two increments of procurement funding for the first two ddg - 1000 destroyers , and the first of two increments of procurement funding for the aircraft carrier cvn - 78 . the senate armed services committee , in its report ( s.rept . 110-77 of june 5 , 2007 ) on the fy2008 defense authorization bill ( s. 1547 ) , approved the navy's fy2008 request for the second of two increments of procurement funding for the amphibious assault ship lha - 6 , the second of two increments of procurement funding for the first two ddg - 1000 destroyers , and ( with a recommended $20-million reduction ) the first of two increments of procurement funding for the aircraft carrier cvn - 78 . appendix a . legislative activity for fy2007 h.r . 109-364 ( fy2007 defense authorization act ) house in its report ( h.rept . 109-452 of may 5 , 2006 ) on h.r . 5122 , the house armed services committee recommended approval of the navy's proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring lha - 6 , but did not recommend approval of the navy's proposal to use split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the two lead ddg - 1000s . the committee for fy2007 instead recommended full funding for one ddg - 1000 , and design funding for a second . the committee's report states: the budget request recommends incremental funding for 3 of the 7 ships in the request , including for the first time construction of a surface combatant , the next - generation destroyer dd ( x ) . furthermore , during the consideration of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 ( p.l . 109-163 ) , the navy sought and was granted the authority to use incremental funding for the next aircraft carrier [cvn - 78] , which will be recorded as procured in 2008 . the committee remains concerned that the use of incremental funding is not a solution to the navy's problem in funding shipbuilding . while incremental funding can allow the navy to smooth out the dramatic spikes in shipbuilding funding required as a result of aircraft carrier construction every four or five years , it does not fundamentally increase the number of ships that a given amount of money will purchase . during the committee's hearings on shipbuilding , all witnesses emphasized the importance of program and funding stability as the top priority for reducing the cost of shipbuilding and sustaining the shipbuilding industrial base . the committee notes that congress adopted the full funding policy in the 1950s in part because of a concern that incremental funding was detrimental to funding stability . future congresses may find themselves unwilling , or unable , to fund completion of ships begun in prior years and only partially funded .
