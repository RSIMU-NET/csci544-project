the oie classification is reviewed annually . the administration argues that all beef importing countries should acknowledge this oie determination and more fully reopen their markets to u.s. beef . u.s. exports continue to recover gradually . u.s. market share for beef climbed to almost 9% in 2007 . usda reported that beef , veal , and beef variety meat exports reached more than 771,000 mt and were valued at more than $2.7 billion in 2007 . however , mexico took nearly 360,000 mt , or 47% , of the 2007 total volume ; canada took 132,000 mt , or 17% . by contrast , japan and korea , combined , imported 72,000 mt , or 9% , of all u.s. beef , veal , and variety meat exports , behind egypt , which took more than 86,000 mt , or 11% . ( see sections on korea , japan , and canada , below. ) korea has been the last of the four major foreign markets to accept u.s. beef . korea's prohibition , which had been in place since december 2003 , was first lifted on september 11 , 2006 , under a korea - u.s. health protocol negotiated in january 2006 . under this protocol , only boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age were to be acceptedâeven though oie guidelines do not consider any type of bone from these younger animals to be specified risk materials ( srms , a rule - defined list of cattle parts most likely to harbor the bse agent ) . even so , only about 25,000 mt of u.s. beef has been exported to korea since then . korea rejected renewed shipments of u.s. beef first because they found bone fragments , albeit very small ones typically acceptable in commercial trade , and , later , for what they said were unacceptable dioxin levels . no beef has entered since october 2007 . on april 18 , 2008 , the united states and korea announced a new agreement to fully reopen korea's market consistent with oie guidelines . specifically , the agreement was to allow all u.s. beef and beef products from cattle of all ages , to include bone - in as well as boneless beef , along with offals , variety meats , and processed beef products . this was dependent upon the removal of the following srms: the tonsils and part of the small intestine of all cattle ; and the brain , eyes , spinal cord , skull , dorsal root ganglia , and vertebral column from all cattle of 30 months and older , again consistent with oie guidelines . in a two - stage reopening , korea was to open first to beef from under - 30-month old cattle . it next was to allow beef from all cattle , upon publication of final rules , promulgated by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) , expanding the restrictions on feeding srms to animals and pets . because these feed rules were published in the april 25 , 2008 , federal register , the hope was that the korean market would soon be opened fully rather than in stages .
