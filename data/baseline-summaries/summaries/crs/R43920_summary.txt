the nhsc supports programs at the federal and state levels . the federal program supports loan repayments and scholarships , with the loan repayment program making the majority of all federal awards . states participating in the nhsc receive federal funding in the form of matching funds . field strength is the number of nhsc providers who are fulfilling a service obligation in a hpsa in exchange for a scholarship or loan repayment agreement . in fy2015 , the most recent data available , total nhsc field strength was 9,683 , which enabled nhsc providers to serve an estimated 10.2 million individuals in hpsas . changes in the size of the nhsc's field strength are shaped by appropriation levels . for example , increases in funding from fy2010 to fy2011 resulted in a 36% increase in field strength , from 7,530 to 10,279 . as the nhsc's field strength size has increased or decreased , the number of individuals served by nhsc providers has been affected . for example , in fy2011 , when the nhsc appropriation peaked at $315 million , nhsc providers served 10.5 million individuals , compared with 9.3 million individuals in fy2013 and 10.2 million individuals in fy2015 ( see figure 1 ) . the nhsc's workforce composition consists of an increasingly diverse set of health professionals representing mental and behavioral health , medical , nursing , dental and other disciplines . since fy2010 , behavioral / mental health providers are the largest group of providers making up the nhsc's field strength . physicians and nurse practitioners are the next largest group of providers constituting nhsc field strength . over time , congress has requested that the secretary of hhs consider adding other disciplines to the nhsc . in fy2015 , congress recognized the secretary's authority to add other disciplines to the nhsc , and urged the secretary to include pharmacists as eligible to participate in nhsc loan repayment and scholarship programs . in fy2012 , the secretary of hhs expanded eligibility for the nhsc state loan repayment program ( slrp ) to include pharmacists . the aca created the chcf and provided mandatory funding for it over a five - year period ( fy2011-fy2015 ) . the act also directed the transfer of $11 billion total from the chcf over that period to support the nhsc and federal health center programs ; the nhsc received various amounts beginning in fy2011 . for fy2016 and fy2017 , the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra , p.l . 114-10 ) extended the chcf funding for the nhsc funding transfers , as shown in table 1 . the fy2017 nhsc funding level is $288.6 million for this program , following a mandatory spending sequester for fy2017 of 6.9% ( pursuant to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 , as amended ) . from fy2012 through fy2016 , the chcf was the sole funding source for the nhsc , as no discretionary funds were appropriated to this program during this period . in each of fy2013 through fy2015 , these mandatory funds were subject to the mandatory spending sequestration that was required by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 , as amended .
