following enactment of p.l . 113-76 , the agricultural act of 2014 , also known as the 2014 "farm bill" ( p.l . 113-79 ) , amended the statutory definition of rural . the amendment ( 1 ) extended the existing provisions disregarding 1990 and 2000 decennial census data in determining certain communities' rural status to also disregard 2010 decennial census data ; and ( 2 ) expanded the population threshold for the purposes of retaining eligibility for certain communities from 25,000 to 35,000 . for more information about usda rural housing programs , see crs report rl31837 , an overview of usda rural development programs , by [author name scrubbed] . the low - income housing tax credit ( lihtc ) program is one of the federal government's primary policy tools for encouraging the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing . these non - refundable federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified rental projects via a competitive application process administered by state housing finance agencies . developers typically sell their tax credits to outside investors in exchange for equity . selling the tax credits reduces the debt developers would otherwise have to incur and the equity they would otherwise have to contribute . with lower financing costs , tax credit properties can potentially offer lower , more affordable rents . two temporary changes to the lihtc program that were made during the financial crisis were extended in the 113 th congress . the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-289 ) temporarily changed the formula used to determine how many lihtcs new rental construction is awarded . the act increased the potential number of credits a lihtc property could receive by ensuring that new construction receives lihtcs of no less than 9% multiplied by a property's eligible basis ( eligible costs ) . the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 ) extended the 9% floor for credit allocations made before january 1 , 2014 . the 113 th congress acted to extend the floor through the end of 2014 in p.l . 113-295 , which was passed by congress on december 16 , 2014 . the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-289 ) also temporarily excluded military housing allowances from the lihtc income calculations for properties near rapidly growing military bases . in general , lihtc tenants must have an income below a particular threshold to live in a lihtc unit . specifically , a tenant must have an income of either 50% or less of the area's median income , or 60% or less of the area's median income . as of the end of the 113 th congress , the housing trust fund had never received any funding . which threshold applies depends on an election made by the developer that determines the targeted low - income population . civilians as well as servicemembers are potentially eligible to live in lihtc units . however , when calculating a servicemember's income for purposes of determining their eligibility , their annual pay and basic allowance for housing ( bah ) must be included .
