however , if h.r . testimony in favor of h.r . 2346 was heard from a number of former merchant seamen and the merchant marine veterans association . testimony in opposition to h.r . 2346 came from various agencies , including the war department , the veterans administration , and the american legion . opponents to granting veteran status to merchant mariners generally focused on the freedom of a merchant mariner to make decisions about whether or not to take a particular voyage or leave service . they also focused on the higher earnings of merchant mariners relative to uniformed navy personnel . 476 , introduced in 1947 , would have expanded the existing benefits for merchant seamen related to health care and disability and introduced an education benefit . ultimately , no legislation was enacted in the immediate aftermath of world war ii to grant veteran status to merchant mariners or to provide additional benefits to merchant mariners related to health care , disability , or education . section 402 of the veterans programs enhancement act of 1988 ( p.l . 105-368 ) extended veterans' burial benefits and the right to interment in national cemeteries to merchant mariners who served on vessels engaged in oceangoing service from august 16 , 1945 , to december 31 , 1946 . in 1999 , the secretary of the air force determined that the service of oceangoing merchant marines during the period from august 15 , 1945 , to december 31 , 1946 ( those covered by p.l . 105-368 ) is not considered active duty under the provisions of p.l . 95-202 for the purposes of other benefits administered by the va . under current law and regulations , only the following groups of merchant mariners are considered to have served on active duty or are otherwise eligible for veterans' benefits . no other merchant mariners are eligible for any veterans' benefits administered by the va . although some world war ii - era merchant mariners were granted eligibility for veterans' benefits in 1985 and 1988 , the passage of time between their service and the granting of this eligibility may have made it impossible for them to fully access these benefits . for example , when these former merchant mariners were of typical college age after the war , they were not eligible for benefits under the gi bill . in addition , those with service - connected disabilities or medical conditions may have lost out on nearly 40 years of va disability compensation or medical benefits . 154 , the honoring our wwii merchant mariners act of 2017 , would provide compensation to former world war ii - era merchant mariners to account for the benefits they were not able to access before being granted veterans' benefit eligibility in the 1980s . similar legislation has been introduced in each congress since the 108 th congress . specifically , this legislation would provide a one - time payment of $25,000 to any merchant mariner who served between december 7 , 1941 , and december 31 , 1946 , and who otherwise meets the definition of service provided for burial benefits and interment eligibility in p.l .
