appendix a . 74-271 , as amended ) . the mch services block grant was established to serve as a single block grant under the previous ssa statutory heading , "title v â€“ grants to states for maternal and child welfare" ; which was referred to as "title v." in 1981 , congress combined the mch services block grant with other maternal and child health services and programs . the patent protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 ) replaced the $5 million to be appropriated in fy2009 and provided $5 million for each of fy2009-fy2012 for the program . the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 ) funded the program at $5 million for fy2013 . the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-67 ) provided a half year of funding ( $2.5 million ) , which expired april 1 , 2014 . protecting access to medicare act of 2014 ( pama ; p.l . 113-93 ) provided $2.5 million for the remainder of fy2014 ( from april 1 , 2014 , to september 30 , 2014 ) , and it provided $2.5 million for the first half of fy2015 ( october 1 , 2014 , through march 31 , 2015 ) . the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra ; p.l . 114-10 ) struck the partial funding provided and provided full - year funding of $5 million for fy2015 . it also provided $5 million for each of fy2016 and fy2017 . specifically , these reports must include information on program participation , standardized measures of maternal and child health , and data on maternal and child health systems , including measures of the pediatric and family practice workforce . while the measures are designed to standardize reporting across the states , states vary in terms of their capacity for collecting and reporting data . for example , states must provide the number of individuals served , either in person or by phone , by the title v block grant . the numbers provided by states may be estimates if the actual numbers are not available . states are also required to report expenditures by the four broad categories of service ( direct health care services , enabling services , population - based services , and infrastructure - building services ) . states are required to annually report pediatric and family practice workforce data to hrsa , including information on the number of obstetricians , family practitioners , certified family nurse practitioners , certified nurse midwives , pediatricians , and certified pediatric nurse practitioners who were licensed in the state in that year . ciss: 12.75% of the appropriation that is above 600 million . block grants to states: remainder of the total appropriation . these allocation requirements have not always been implemented ; for example , they were not implemented for the fy2016 funding ( see the " appropriations history " section of this report ) . at the state and national levels , section 505 of the ssa requires three reporting mechanisms: 1 . the first is a block grant and is the largest of the three funding programs .
