and provide an overarching framework for implementation . before congress enacted the annex vi implementing legislation in 2008 , epa had already promulgated regulations under the clean air act that were as stringent as the 1997 annex vi standards , and shipping companies were already generally meeting the standards . in addition , the agency has promulgated standards for smaller engines . epa groups ship engines in three categories . the largest of these engines — the main engines on oceangoing ships — are diesel engines with a per - cylinder displacement at or above 30 liters . these are referred to as "category 3" or "c3" engines . category 1 and 2 engines ( those smaller than 7 liters per cylinder , and those from 7 to 30 liters per cylinder , respectively ) , are used in boats or smaller ships — tugs , ferries , some great lakes freighters , fishing boats , and recreational boats , for example . category 1 and 2 engines ( those smaller than 7 liters per cylinder , and those from 7 to 30 liters per cylinder , respectively ) , are used in boats or ships that operate in u.s. waters — tugs , ferries , smaller great lakes freighters , fishing boats , and recreational boats , for example — virtually all of which are registered in the united states . while smaller than category 3 engines , these engines are still rather large: they generate at least 800 horsepower . epa is further along in regulating the emissions of these categories , as compared to category 3 . regulations that will reduce emissions of nox from new or remanufactured engines by 24% and emissions of particulates by 12% when fully implemented , were promulgated in 1999 and began taking effect between 2004 and 2007 . more stringent standards were promulgated may 6 , 2008 , and will take effect between now and 2014 . the final 2014 standards will require ultra low sulfur diesel fuel ( 15 ppm sulfur ) and high efficiency catalytic emission controls capable of reducing particulate matter emissions by 90% and nox emissions by 80% , along with "sizeable reductions" of hydrocarbon , carbon monoxide , and air toxic emissions , according to epa . as with the new category 3 regulations , epa estimates that benefits of the may 2008 rule will substantially exceed the costs of compliance – in this case , by a figure of at least 9 to 1 . the principal benefits that the agency estimated are health benefits: a reduction of between 1,150 and 1,400 premature deaths , 120,000 work days lost , and approximately 1,000,000 minor restricted - activity days annually . the agency estimates that these benefits will be worth between $8.4 billion and $11 billion in 2030 , whereas the annual social costs will be approximately $740 million in that year . the impact of these costs on society is expected to be manageable , with the price of marine transportation services estimated to increase by about 1.1% . california , being more adversely affected than most other areas , has also played a leadership role in identifying and implementing emission reduction measures applicable to shipping .
