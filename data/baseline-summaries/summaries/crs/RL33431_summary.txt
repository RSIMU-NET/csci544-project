the formula is determined administratively by doj . in fy2007 , the scaap reimbursement formula was determined through a multi - step process , as follows . doj determined a per diem rate per inmate , using a combination of correctional officers' annual salary costs and the total number of all inmate days . ( the average inmate per diem for fy2007 was $30.30 ) ; immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) in dhs analyzed applicant inmate records submitted by the applicants , and provided bja with a report reflecting the number of eligible , ineligible , unknown , and invalid inmates ; the number of inmate days and a percentage of unknown days were totaled , then multiplied by the applicant's per diem rate ; the value of each applicant's correctional officers' salary costs associated with its eligible and credited unknown inmate days was totaled . ( this value reflected the maximum allowable reimbursement ) ; and the values were compared with the annual appropriation and a percentage factor was developed , and the percentage factor was applied uniformly to all jurisdictions . the reimbursement factor for fy2007 scaap awards was approximately 42% . funding for scaap has been appropriated by congress annually since 1995 . levels of funding for the program have fluctuated from $130 million in fy1995 to $565 million in fy2002 and have remained relatively consistent between $400 and $410 million for fy2006 through fy2009 . the administration's fy2010 budget did not request funding for this program . from fy2000 to fy2008 , scaap reimbursements totaled approximately $4 billion . as table 1 illustrates , california historically has received the largest annual awards , having received more than $1.7 billion since the program's inception . florida , illinois , new york , and texas have consistently received larger awards as well , with smaller awards going to states such as west virginia , vermont , north dakota , and the u.s. territories . in 2005 , scaap was reauthorized through fy2011 , and a provision was added that required scaap reimbursement funds be used for correctional purposes only . legislation had been introduced in previous congresses that would have modified the program to include covering costs for indigent defense , translators , criminal aliens charged with two misdemeanors or a felony , and limited reimbursement to border states and states with large numbers of unauthorized aliens . in the 111 th congress , legislation has been introduced to reauthorize the program until fy2014 ( h.r . 2282 ) , and to allow costs related to criminal aliens charged with specified crimes to be considered for scaap reimbursement ( s. 168 ) . the administration's fy2010 budget request did not include funding for scaap ; however , funding for the program was included in the commerce , justice , science and related agencies appropriations act of 2010 ( h.r . 2847 as passed by the house on june 18 , 2009 , would appropriate $300 million for scaap , and the senate reported version would appropriate $228 million for the program . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) aids bja in administering the program . scaap is designed to reimburse states and localities for correctional officers' salary costs incurred for incarcerating "undocumented criminal aliens.
