appendix a . actual and estimated troop levels in afghanistan and iraq , fy2007-fy2012 crs estimated average monthly troop levels in afghanistan and in iraq for fy2009-fy2012 based on the announcements made by the white house on february 17 , february 27 , and march 27 , 2009 , and department of defense press releases and conferences . where future levels have not been identified , crs made the conservative assumptions described below . according to these announcements , the administration is deploying 21,000 more troops to afghanistan in fy2009 . these troops are in addition to a combat brigade with support of about 9,000 that was approved by president bush in december 2008 . together , this would increase troop levels in afghanistan by 30,000 by the end of fy2009 . because department of defense secretary gates suggested that increases beyond that are unlikely , crs assumes continuation of that level through fy2012 in this table . in the case of iraq , the administration plans to reduce troops in iraq by two brigade combat teams in fy2009 by not replacing two brigades coming home in june 2009 . in addition , several smaller units were withdrawn between december 2008 and april 2009 . dod is also planning to downsize some replacement units . according to administration statements , troop levels in iraq would decline to 35,000 to 50,000 by august 31 , 2010 , which crs estimates as 45,000 troops or 5 bct - equivalents ( roughly the midpoint ) . these troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2011 as required by the security agreement between the united states and iraq . conservatively , crs assumes that these u.s. troops remain in - country until the last five months of 2011 , the latest possible date that would meet the december 31 , 2011 deadline for the withdrawal of all u.s. troops in the u.s. - iraq security agreement . based on that assumption , two bcts would be withdrawn at the end of fy2011 ( august and september 2011 ) and three in the first quarter of fy2012 ( october â€“ december 2011 ) . based on these plans , crs set up a schedule that estimates how long bcts will be in - country . taking into account the number of troops and their time in - country , crs calculates the number of weighted average brigade combat team equivalents in afghanistan and iraq in each fiscal year in table a - 1 . crs assumes that each bct has 9,000 troops , 1,000 less than the army's planning assumption in order to reflect the fact that marine corps units are generally smaller . the schedule also assumes that troops are added or withdrawn at the end of each month , and that all navy and air force troops in - country are providing support to army and marine corps . the oef operation includes military personnel deployed in the following countries: afghanistan , djibouti , egypt , ethiopia , jordan , kazakhstan , kenya , kyrgyzstan , lebanon , oman , pakistan , philippines , seychelles , sudan , tajikistan , turkmenistan , uzbekistan , egypt , and yemen .
