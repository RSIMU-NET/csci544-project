the provision in h.r . 2642 covering medicaid regulations included requirements , similar to h.r . 5613 , for the secretary to submit reports to the house energy and commerce and the senate finance committees . like h.r . 5613 , s. 2819 , would impose a moratorium until april 1 , 2009 , on implementation of the case management , tcm and five other medicaid regulations until april 1 , 2009 . on may 22 , 2008 , the senate passed the supplemental appropriations act of 2008 ( h.r . 2642 included a moratorium until april 1 , 2009 , on implementation of the tcm and six other medicaid regulations . 2642 was amended by the house and passed on june 19 , 2008 . the house amendments included moratoria on implementation of six medicaid regulations , including case management and tcm , until april 1 , 2009 . in addition , h.r . 2642 retained requirements from h.r . 5613 for the secretary to report to the house energy and commerce and senate finance committees , and to hire an independent contractor to report on the specific impact of medicaid regulations . on june 26 , 2008 , the senate passed h.r . some of the changes addressed in the proposed rule are outlined below . estimates of the financial impact of the interim final rule vary . some argue that cms underestimated the impact of the case management and other regulations , and that cms is attempting to shift medicaid costs to states . cms estimated that the tcm changes in the interim final rule will reduce federal medicaid outlays by $1.28 billion over five years , whereas cbo estimated that the tcm provision in dra would reduce federal expenditures by $760 million . cbo's estimate of the impact of dra provisions was for the period fy2006-fy2010 , whereas cms's estimate was for the five year period fy2008-fy2012 . in a more recent estimate for the period fy2008-fy2012 , cbo forecasted that gross medicaid outlays would decrease by $2.0 billion for the five year period , with a $1.5 billion net reduction ( including effects in foster care administration ) in medicaid outlays for that time period . a survey of state medicaid directors by the house committee on oversight and government reform estimated the financial impact of the tcm regulation to be approximately $3.1 billion over the five years from fy2009-fy2013 . there are at least three distinct perspectives on tcm policy issues: ( 1 ) the perspective of advocates representing children and adults who could receive medicaid tcm services , ( 2 ) state governments and medicaid agencies , and ( 3 ) the federal regulatory agency ( cms ) responsible for implementing dra and enforcing states' compliance with federal medicaid statutes . as cms indicates in the interim final rule , dra required the agency to write regulations . specific guidance and definitions , cms contends , were needed to avoid further "excessive" federal outlays . cms points out that the proposed rule clarifies when medicaid will , and will not , pay for case management services . cms further claims the proposed rule will reduce past confusion about the overlap between medicaid tcm and non - medicaid programs .
