the senate version of h.r . the vote blocked s.amdt . 3407 as non - germane . on may 28 , 2010 , the house passed its version of h.r . 4213 and included the $1.15 billion for the settlement . the senate version of the bill did not recommend the $1.15 billion , and h.r . 4213 passed without the pigford ii funding . meanwhile , the house version of h.r . 4899 , the supplemental appropriations bill that passed the house on march 24 , 2010 , also included the funding for pigford ii . 4899 , which passed may 27 , did not include the funding . subsequently , the house passed an amended version of h.r . 4899 that included the funding on july 1 . however , the senate objected to the house version , and on july 27 , the house passed the senate's may 27 version of h.r . 4899 that did not include the funding for pigford ii . finally , on november 19 , 2010 , by unanimous consent , the senate passed the claims resolution act of 2010 ( h.r . 4783 ) to provide the $1.15 billion appropriation . the senate bill was then passed by the house on november 30 and signed by the president on december 8 , 2010 . nearly 40,000 of them ultimately were filed . of those , approximately 34,000 were deemed complete , timely , and eligible . the claims administrator developed an internal control design to identify and deny any invalid claims . hearing officers — retired judges and lawyers with no involvement in the case — were approved by the court , sworn in , and trained in the elements of the claims . each claim went through four to five reviews . statistical reviews of the behavior of individual hearing officers were also conducted to further ensure that each claim was subjected to a fair and consistent review process . ongoing monitoring by the government accountability office ( gao ) and usda's office of the inspector general added further auditing and data standardization to the claims review process . the claims resolution act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-291 ) , which provided the funds for the pigford ii settlement , mandated that gao evaluate the internal controls for the pigford ii review process and report twice on the review process . in december 2012 , gao published a report on its first evaluation of the review process . gao concluded that "the internal control design provides reasonable assurance that fraudulent or otherwise invalid claims could be identified and denied ; however , certain weaknesses in the control design could expose the claims process to risk of improper determinations. some of the weaknesses gao identified were a result of constraints imposed by the settlement agreement itself , and , in some cases , originated in the pigford i settlement . gao recognized that these weaknesses could not be modified by the parties implementing pigford ii . gao also identified weakness in the internal control design that could be modified .
