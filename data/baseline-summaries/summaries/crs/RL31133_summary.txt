sec . and be it further enacted , that the militia , when called into the service of the united states by virtue of this act , or any other act , may , if in the opinion of the president of the united states the public interest requires it , be compelled to serve for a term not exceeding six months after their arrival at the place of rendezvous , in any one year , unless sooner discharged . sec . and be it further enacted , that the said volunteers shall furnish their own clothes , and if cavalry , their own horses and horse equipments ; and when mustered into service shall be armed at the expense of the united states . if war existed why empower the president to apprehend foreign enemies ? war itself placed that duty upon him as a necessary and inherent incident of military command . why , if there was war , should a suspension of commercial intercourse be authorized , for what more complete suspension of that intercourse could there be than the very fact of war ? there was no declaration of war ; the tribunals of each country were open to the other â€” an impossibility were war in progress ; diplomatic and commercial intercourse were admittedly suspended ; but during many years there was no intercourse between england and mexico , which were not at war ; there was retaliation and reprisal , but such retaliations and reprisals have often occurred between nations at peace ; there was a near approach to war , but at no time was one of the nations turned into an enemy of the other in such manner that every citizen of the one became the enemy of every citizen of the other ; finally , there was not that kind of war which abrogated treaties and wiped out , at least temporarily , all pending rights and contracts , individual and national . whether this traditional understanding of war and of the effect of a declaration of war continues to be viable is a matter of considerable dispute among scholars . the right of a state to initiate war , many contend , has been outlawed by such international agreements as the kellogg - briand peace pact and the charter of the united nations . in the kellogg - briand peace pact , for instance , the parties stated that they "condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies , and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another. after world war ii the nuremberg tribunal gave teeth to this commitment by ruling that the pact rendered aggressive war illegal under international law and makes those who plan and wage such a war guilty of a crime . the charter of the united nations , in turn , states one of its purposes to be "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war," and it requires its members "to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations.
