scheduling eac action . hava envisioned that the eac would adopt voluntary guidance about how to meet the act's national election administration requirements before the states actually had to meet them . the idea was to give states the opportunity to review the federal guidance before finalizing their actions on the requirements . considering the role of the quorum requirement . 107-252 ; 116 stat . for example , the eac's advisory bodies play a particularly central role in the functioning of the agency . are there reasons to want certain stakeholders to haveâor not to haveâsuch direct access to eac actions and decisionmaking ? assigning ( and reassigning ) responsibilities . the eac is the only federal agency dedicated to election administration as a whole . as such , it is often taken to be the obvious choice to assume federal election administration responsibilities . as noted above , however , some members have suggested that some of the duties currently in the eac's portfolio might be better performed by other agencies or in other ways . are there election administration - related issues about which parts of the federal government other than the eac might have relevant expertise ? for example , the eac has traditionally been the primary federal repository of election administration best practices , but dhs also provides resources related to election security . questions might arise , with respect to certain elections - related duties , about which agencyâor combination of agenciesâis best positioned to perform them . â§â§20901-21145 ) as part of congress's response to administrative issues with the 2000 elections . assessing and meeting resource needs . the eac has been described variously as both overfunded and underfunded . developments like the emergence of new election security threats have prompted calls for additional resources for agency operations and for distribution to states via the eac . how do current levels of funding match up to the agency'sâand its grantees'âresource needs ? are there tools , such as concurrent budget submission or research into appropriate funding levels for hava payments , that might help congress better assess those needs ? are there resources other than funding , such as security clearances for commissioners or professional staff , that the eac needs and does not currently have ? the quorum requirement for official action by the commission has led at times to delays and inactivity , such as deferred updates to the vvsg . does congress seek to consider ways to reduce the likelihood or frequency of such delays ? if so , would it prefer an approach that eliminated the need for a quorum in certain cases , such as by exempting certain actions from the quorum requirement , or one that reduced the likelihood of the commission being without a quorum ? options for the latter approach might include structural changes to the commission , such as adding or removing a seat , or procedural changes to the way commissioners are seated , such as revising the roles of the president and congressional leadership in the candidate selection process . subsequent legislative proposals have similarly called for new national election administration requirements and eac guidance about how to meet them .
