, inflation - adjusted ) . the budget authority for veterans' benefits and services over the fy1940-fy2012 period has generally shown a steady increase . as can be seen in table 1 and figure 1 , the fy2012 budget authority in current dollars was more than 20 0 times the fy1940 budget authority , reflecting an average annual growth rate for the period of 7.9% . in constant 2011 dollars , the fy2012 budget authority is 1 4 times the fy1940 budget authority and reflects a 3.8% average annual growth rate over the period . budget authority is presented in both current dollars and constant 2011 dollars ( i.e. a large number of americans , 16.1 million , served in the military in world war ii ( wwii , december 7 , 1941 , through december 31 , 1946 ) , making wwii the largest conflict to date in terms of the number of servicemembers . because the servicemembers volunteered ( or were drafted ) for "the duration," a large number of servicemembers were released in a relatively short period of time at the end of the war . before the end of the war , the servicemen's readjustment act ( p.l . 346 of the 78 th congress ) , commonly known as the gi bill , was signed into law in 1944 , providing a major change in benefits for veterans . the gi bill introduced education and training benefits that enabled millions of servicemembers who may have otherwise been unable to attend college or training schools to receive a college education or specific job skills training . in addition , the housing loan guarantee benefits provided by the gi bill enabled wwii veterans to purchase homes for their families . while the current dollar budget authority for fy1975 and fy1976 was 2.0 and 2.3 times the fy1947 budget authority , in constant 2011 dollars ( after adjusting for inflation ) the budget authority for fy1975 and fy1976 was below that of fy1947 . this reflects in large part the differences between the two conflicts in terms of the timing for release of servicemembers and veterans benefits and services ( compared to the pre - conflict period ) . during the current conflicts [operation enduring freedom ( oef , which began october 2001 ) , operation iraqi freedom ( oif , march 2003 - august 2010 ) , and operation new dawn ( which began september 2010 ) ] , there is no military draft in place . servicemembers generally leave at the end of their obligation , or at retirement . the somewhat steady increase in budget authority for veterans' benefits and administration each year since the late 1990s reflects the impact of the aging of the veteran population ( with an accompanying increased demand for services ) in addition to the impact of the returning oef / oif veterans . also , increases in appropriations for disability compensation reflect changes to the conditions considered presumed to be service - connected for vietnam veterans . in fy2000 , of the 83,159 veterans who began receiving disability compensation that year , 19.8% were aged 55 or older . by fy2011 , of the 272,509 veterans who began receiving disability compensation that year , 52.9% were aged 55 or older .
