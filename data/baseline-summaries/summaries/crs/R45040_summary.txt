north american nonimmigrants ( i.e. , those from canada , mexico , central america , and the caribbean ) accounted for the next largest group of fy2016 nonimmigrant visa issuances , with 2.1 million individuals . south america accounted for 1.8 million of the nonimmigrant visa issuances . this timing coincides with the start of the great recession . while most other visa categories also experienced some fluctuation , visas issued to diplomats and other representatives held steady across the decade . since fy2009 , visas issued to temporary workers and students have seen large and steady increases resulting in growth rates of 38% and 55% , respectively , over the decade . from fy2015 to fy2016 , however , the number of student visas experienced a 25% drop . this sharp decline was largely driven by a 46% decrease in the number of f - 1 visas issued to applicants from mainland china , the most frequent recipient of f - 1 visas . saudi arabia , mexico , brazil , and india also experienced steep drops in the number of f - 1 visas issued from fy2015 to fy2016 . during fy2015 , cbp inspectors granted 181.3 million nonimmigrant admissions to the united states , according to dhs workload estimates . mexican nationals with border crossing cards , canadian nationals traveling for business or pleasure , and others not required to complete a form i - 94 accounted for over half ( 58% ) of these admissions , with approximately 104.7 million entries ( see " statistical trends " ) . the remaining categories and countries of the world contributed the remaining 76.6 million i - 94 admissions in fy2015 . the following analysis of admissions data is limited to i - 94 admissions . total i - 94 admissions more than doubled between fy2006 and fy2015 , from 33.7 million to 76.6 million . the trend in admissions of temporary visitors ( for business and pleasure ) mirrored that for visa issuances: a decline from fy2008 to fy2009 followed by a steady increase . because dhs has not yet released fy2016 data , it is unknown whether the fy2015 to fy2016 drop in nonimmigrant visas issued will also appear in the admissions data . as with the visa issuance data , tourists and business visitors dominate the admissions data ( see figure 4 ) . over three - quarters of all i - 94 admissions in fy2015 were tourists , and another 10.4% were business visitors . similar to visa issuances , other nonimmigrant categories with measurable percentages of admissions were temporary workers ( including intracompany transferees , treaty traders / investors , and representatives of foreign media ) , at almost 5% , students ( 2.6% ) , cultural exchange visitors ( 0.8% ) , and diplomats ( 0.6% ) . included in the admissions data are tourists and business visitors who entered without a visa under the visa waiver program ( vwp ) . while the number of vwp admissions has climbed steadily since fy2009 , the share of visitor ( b visa ) admissions accounted for by vwp admissions dropped from more than half ( 53.2% ) in fy2006 to less than one - third ( 32.5% ) in fy2015 ( see figure 5 ) .
