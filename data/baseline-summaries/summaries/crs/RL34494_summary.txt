this has two implications for the allocation formula . first , only a domestic parent's equity stake in its foreign subsidiary is counted as an asset — excluding the foreign subsidiary's assets financed by debt . the parent's assets , in contrast , are all included in the calculation — whether financed by equity or debt . secondly , the subsidiary's interest expense is automatically allocated to foreign sources . the jobs act addressed this perceived flaw . the analysis here indicates that worldwide allocation rules , while losing revenue , would likely be better aligned with the objective of the foreign tax credit . tax planning techniques could undermine this objective — and lead to increased revenue loss and efficiency costs . the act contained another relevant modification to the interest allocation rules , that would increase a firm's creditable taxes . specifically , the provision expands the subgroup election for banks to include other financial intermediaries , including insurance companies — which allows for the separate calculation of interest allocation . this provision could insulate some firms from a portion of the interest allocation rules , and it is at odds with the theory underlying the act's other provisions . the united states — in principle — taxes its resident corporations and individuals on their worldwide income , regardless of where it is earned , under the residence rule . the foreign tax credit and deferral are the key structural pieces of the u.s. taxation of foreign - source income . the foreign tax credit provisions generally permit u.s. taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they pay against u.s. taxes they would otherwise owe — on a dollar - for - dollar basis . for example , a u.s. corporation chartered in north dakota is potentially subject to u.s. tax on income it earns outside the united states . concurrently , however , the foreign countries where the income is earned generally tax that income , even if it is earned by a foreign ( u.s. in this case ) investor , under the source principle . in the absence of the foreign tax credit , this income would potentially face double - taxation and possibly very high tax rates . the foreign tax credit , however , generally alleviates the possibility of double - taxation of foreign - source income . with the credit , the u.s. concedes that the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income and collect the tax revenue that it generates . this results in the u.s. collecting only the u.s. tax due after paying foreign taxes — if positive . as such , the foreign tax credit helps to define the u.s. tax jurisdiction and it is not a tax expenditure favoring selected groups . while theoretically straight - forward , overlapping jurisdictions introduce numerous complications . to better understand interest allocation rules , it is useful to first examine two key structural pieces: deferral and the foreign tax credit limitation . whether an expense is deducted from foreign or u.s. income matters for tax purposes . the tax code , therefore , contains rules for allocating deductions between foreign and u.s. sources .
