the dra makes some significant changes to tanf work participation . these changes require most states to engage more of their caseloads in activities and / or reduce cash assistance caseloads from fy2005 levels . from fy2002 through fy2005 , mandatory child care funding for the child care and development block grant has been set at $2.717 billion per year . the dra increases mandatory child care funding to $2.917 billion per year for fy2006 through fy2010 , an increase from current levels of $200 million per year or $1 billion over five years . tanf bonuses totaling $300 million to states are repealed . the dra established new project and demonstration grants for promoting healthy marriages ( $100 million per year ) and "responsible fatherhood" ( $50 million per year ) . the dra establishes new categorical grants within tanf for healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood initiatives . as originally enacted and continuing under dra , tanf law allows states to use block grant and moe funds for activities to further any tanf purpose , including promotion of the formation and maintenance of two - parent families . the activities supported by the healthy marriage promotion initiatives are programs to promote marriage to the general population , such as public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and education in high schools on the value of marriage ; education on "social skills" ( e.g . marriage education , marriage skills , conflict resolution , and relationship skills ) for engaged couples , those interested in marriage , or married couples ; and programs that reduce the financial disincentive to marry , if combined with educational or other marriage promotion activities . the dra requires applicants for marriage promotion grants to ensure that participation in such activities is voluntary and that domestic violence concerns be addressed , including through consultation with experts on domestic violence . additionally , the dra makes available up to $50 million per year for responsible fatherhood initiatives . these initiatives will be funded through competitive grants made by hhs to states , territories , indian tribes and tribal organizations , and public and nonprofit community organizations ( including religious organizations ) . responsible fatherhood initiatives are defined as including activities to promote marriage ; teach parenting skills through counseling , mentoring , mediation , and dissemination of information ; support employment and job training services , and develop and promote media campaigns and a national clearinghouse focused on responsible fatherhood . ( see crs report rl31025 , fatherhood initiatives: connecting fathers to their children , by [author name scrubbed] for more on these initiatives. ) however , state expenditures in this category have generally been small . the dra continues the tanf block grant created in the 1996 welfare reform law through fy2010 . in general , tanf funding levels , rules for use of funds , and program requirements continue unchanged through fy2010 . with respect to funding , there are some exceptions: supplemental grants paid to 17 states that have met criteria of low historic grants per poor person or high rates of population growth are continued at current levels only through fy2008 .
