iraq accepted the resolution . iraq was required by resolution 688 ( april 5 , 1991 ) to end repression of its people . in forty reviews ( at 60-day intervals ) of iraqi compliance from the end of the gulf war in 1991 until august 20 , 1998 , the u.n. security council maintained the comprehensive international sanctions on iraq's imports and exports imposed by security council resolution 661 ( august 6 , 1990 ) . after the breakdown of the original weapons inspections regime in december 1998 , two additional major resolutions ( 1284 of december 17 , 1999 and 1441 of november 8 , 2002 ) were adopted in an effort to resume u.n. disarmament efforts . including resolution 1441 , a total of 17 u.n. resolutions required iraq's complete dismantlement of its wmd programs . this report discusses those resolutions and provisions that are still active , and those whose application to iraq have been terminated both before and since the fall of saddam hussein's regime . the operations of the program ended november 22 , 2003 , as mandated by resolution 1483 , but resolution 1546 ( 2004 ) empowered the iraqi government to wind down residual contracts under the program . ( see crs report rl30472 , iraq: oil - for - food program , illicit trade , and investigations . ) several u.n. resolutions assign a role for the united nations in post - saddam reconstruction and governance . resolution 1483 ( cited above ) provided for a u.n. special representative to iraq , and "called on" governments to contribute forces for stabilization . resolution 1500 ( august 14 , 2003 ) established u.n. assistance mission for iraq ( unami ) , the mandate of which has been regularly extended since . iraqi leaders do not criticize unami's humanitarian coordinating and other work , per se . however , unami represents the continuing u.n. role in iraq and many of the most nationalistic iraqi factions believe that iraq can and should manage all of its own affairs without u.n. interference . from the end of the 1991 war until the 2003 war , u.s. military deployments in the gulf region , approximately 20,000 personnel , focused on containing iraq . numbers of personnel sometimes increased at times of crisis with saddam's regime primarily over u.n. wmd inspections . the united states and britain enforced two "no fly zones" to protect iraq's kurdish minority ( operation northern watch , onw ) and its shiite population ( operation southern watch , osw ) , as well as to monitor iraqi forces . france was originally a part of the enforcement operations but dropped out in 1997 and 1998 due to opposition to what it considered an overly punitive policy toward saddam hussein's regime . onw , established in april 1991 , extended north of the 36 th parallel . turkey provided basing rights at incirlik air base for the 24 american aircraft and about 1,300 u.s. forces ( plus allied forces ) that policed the northern zone . however , turkey feared that onw protected the anti - turkish kurdistan workers' party ( pkk ) , which takes refuge in parts of northern iraq , and turkey made repeated attacks against the pkk after may 1997 .
