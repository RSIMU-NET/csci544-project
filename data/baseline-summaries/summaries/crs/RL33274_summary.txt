these values are subject to periodic revisions . department of the treasury data indicate that foreign private net purchases of treasury securities have shifted between positive and negative values at various times , as indicated in figure 4 . foreign official net acquisitions of treasury securities have also tended to change abruptly on an annual basis , at times reflecting the role of the dollar and dollar - denominated securities as safe haven assets . during the midst of the financial crisis in 2009 and 2010 , for instance , foreign private investors sharply increased their net purchases of treasury securities , which rose to over $500 billion in 2010 . from 2010 to 2013 , however , as concerns over financial market stability eased foreign private net purchases of treasury securities fell to $52 billion in 2013 . similarly , foreign governments increased their net purchases of treasury securities in 2008 and 2009 , which they maintained until foreign official net purchases fell in 2013 and again in 2015 when foreign official entities liquidated more than $200 billion in treasury securities . as figure 4 indicates , financial flows over the 2007-2015 net private and net official capital inflows have changed abruptly at times . private capital flows , representing the combination of net purchases of treasury securities , corporate stocks and bonds , and other u.s. government agency bonds , shifted from a net inflow of $1.7 trillion in 2007 to a net outflow in 2008 and 2009 , reflecting the contraction in capital flows as a result of the financial crisis . between 2010 and 2015 , net private inflows have varied sharply , often reflecting changes in private net purchases of a broad range of financial assets exclusive of treasury securities . net private inflows by u.s. citizens resumed in the 2012 to 2014 period . during the same period , net foreign official accumulations of u.s. financial assets increased from $188 billion in 2007 to $225 billion in 2012 , shifting to a net outflow in 2015 of over $200 billion . table 4 data show the total net accumulation of long - term u.s. securities , or the amount of securities purchased less those that were sold , by foreign private and official sources from 2013 to 2015 and five recent quarters . the data indicate that in between 2013 and 2014 , the net foreign private accumulation of u.s. securities tripled from $80 billion to $249 billion , before falling by a third to $155 billion in 2015 . according to the department of the treasury , the drop in net foreign purchases of u.s. securities reflects adjustments by private investors in their portfolios by reducing their holdings of u.s. corporate stocks and u.s. treasury securities and increasing their net purchases of corporate bonds and the bonds of u.s. government agencies other than treasury securities . as indicated above , the data in table 2 and table 3 show that the trade deficit is accompanied by an equal capital inflow that represents an accumulation of dollar - denominated assets by foreigners .
