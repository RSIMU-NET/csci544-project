( congressional record , vol . 144 , p. 25070 ; senate journal , p . the final two were ruled out of order . of the two motions adopted , one led to final passage of the measure in question , a joint resolution ( s.j.res . 34 ) adopted in 2002 to approve a site for a permanent nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain , nevada . agreement to the other motion to proceed was vitiated by unanimous consent immediately after it was adopted . in addition , however , one of the measures on which the senate tabled a motion to proceed , and one on which the motion to proceed was ruled out of order , were taken up by the senate at a later date and agreed to . thirteen of these 28 motions were offered under the general rules of the senate , under which they were debatable ; the remaining 15 addressed matters that , under senate practice , are considered privileged , meaning that motions to proceed to their consideration are not debatable . one of these 15 motions proposed to bring up a conference report ; the remaining 14 were offered pursuant to statutory expedited procedures . of those 14 motions , 6 addressed congressional budget resolutions under the congressional budget act ( "cba" ; p.l . 93-344 , codified as amended at 2 u.s.c . 601-688 ) or other measures governed by statutory procedures for budgetary measures ; 7 concerned joint resolutions to disapprove proposed regulations under the congressional review act ( "cra" ; title ii of p.l . 104-121 , codified at 5 u.s.c . 801-808 ) ; and 1 concerned a disapproval resolution under the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 ( p.l . 97-425 ; codified at 42 u.s.c . 10101 et seq. ) both the number and percentage of motions offered other than by direction of the majority leader exhibited a distinct increase in recent congresses in comparison to previous periods . eighteen of the 28 motions falling in this group were offered during the three most recent congresses , suggesting a possible decline in the degree of deference the senate accords to leadership scheduling efforts . the 18 motions offered during the last 3 congresses include 14 of the 20 motions that were offered by the minority leader , to whom ( at least in principle ) the prerogative of making motions to proceed may be accorded . these 18 motions also encompass 12 of the 16 motions that the senate has considered under unanimous consent agreements , which implicitly indicates at least some degree of acquiescence by , or prearrangement with , the majority leadership .
