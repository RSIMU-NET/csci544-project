postal service employees ) retired . from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018 , the cpi - w increased by 2.0% . therefore , the csrs cola beginning in january 2018 is 2.0% . the largest cash transaction ( $3.2 billion in fy2016 ) consists of employee contributions to csrs and fers . these contributions are equal to 7.0% of base pay under csrs ; 0.8% of base pay under fers for employees first hired before 2013 ; 3.1% of pay under fers for employees first hired in 2013 ; and 4.4% of pay under fers for employees first hired after 2013 . smaller cash payments are received from the district of columbia to finance retirement benefits for its employees and from additional cash contributions made by federal workers . these usually are former federal employees who are returning to government service and who had previously withdrawn their retirement contributions . the csrdf's largest sources of income are ( 1 ) annual payments from the general fund of the treasury to make up for the insufficient funding of benefits accrued under csrs , ( 2 ) payments from federal agencies and the postal service on behalf of their employees , and ( 3 ) interest payments on the u.s. treasury bonds it holds . agency contributions under csrs are equal to 7.0% of payroll , and are supplemented by transfers from the general fund of the treasury equal to approximately 12% of payroll . agency contributions to fers are required by law to be equal to the full actuarial cost of the program minus employee contributions . effective fy2015 , employing agencies contribute 13.7% of payroll on behalf of fers employees first hired before 2013 , and 11.9% of pay on behalf of fers employees first hired in 2013 or later ( including individuals hired in 2014 or later ) . these three sources of income are intra - governmental transfers that increase the fund's budget authority , as recorded in the accounts of the u.s. treasury . the fund receives treasury bonds as a record of this budget authority , which it redeems periodically as annuity payments come due . expenditures from the csrdf consist mainly of payments to retired federal employees and their surviving dependents . annuity payments totaled $82.5 billion in fy2016 . payments to the estates of decedents and payments to separating employees accounted for another $330 million . the administrative expenses of the fund were $142 million , or 0.2% of obligations . between fy1990 and fy2018 ( estimated ) , the balance of the csrdf rose from $238 billion to $972 billion , an increase of 308% . ( see table 9 . ) the balance of the fund has been rising partly because the civil service retirement programs are in a long - term transition from pay - as - you - go financing under csrs to advance - funding under fers . until 1969 , csrs benefits were funded on a pay - as - you - go basis with a small reserve equal to about one year of benefit payments to meet unexpected contingencies . employee contributions and agency contributions were less than the actuarial value of the benefits that were accrued each year by federal employees .
