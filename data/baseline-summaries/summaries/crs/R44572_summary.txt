what unmanned ew programs does dod currently fund ? does dod plan to develop additional stand - in jamming systems ? what evolutions are occurring in u.s. military operational concepts ? the air force plans to replace 14 ec - 130h aircraft with 10 ec - 37bs . is it appropriate , for example , that the air force and marine corps no longer operate their own specialized tactical ew aircraft , while the navy continues to operate and invest in the ea - 18g and its next generation jammer ew pods ? more generally , to what degree do the airborne ew capabilities of the air force , navy , and marine corps overlap , and is that overlap appropriate ? a third potential issue for congress is how dod uses advances in technology . electronic attack platforms have evolved from the manned platforms with relatively large crew sizes , such as the ea - 6b prowler and the ec - 130h compass call , to the ea - 8g growler with a crew of two and the mald - j , which does not have crew and is a standoff weapon . evolving a2 / ad environments potentially make traditional stand - in jamming too dangerous for manned aircraft . therefore , congress may consider policy for dod regarding developing platforms that are capable of operating in a2 / ad environments . another oversight issue for congress concerns the air force's planned quantity and rate for procuring ec - 37bs and replacing ec - 130hs . the air force currently maintains 10 ec - 130h compass calls for operations , with one aircraft devoted to testing and three additional aircraft in back - up inventory . how does the air force plan to use a smaller fleet of aircraft ? would 10 ec - 37b aircraft be able to meet operational demands ? some members of congress have expressed an interest in procuring ec - 37bs more quickly than the air force plans , so as to accelerate the replacement of ec - 130hs with ec - 37bs . the committee and conference report language bearing on this issue for the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 and the fy2019 dod appropriations act appear below . john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 ( h.r . 115-232 ) the house armed services committee , in its report ( h.rept . 115-676 of may 15 , 2018 ) on h.r . 5515 , the fy2019 national defense authorization act , stated that [t]he committee supports the air force's efforts to recapitalize the aging ec – 130h compass call fleet with the more capable ec – 37 type aircraft . the committee notes that the air force must first comply with the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ( public law 114 – 328 ) and the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2018 ( public law 115 – 91 ) before it can carry on with the transition plan . the air force requested $108.1 million for fiscal year 2019 for one ec – 37 .
