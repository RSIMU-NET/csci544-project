the figures in h.r . 1960 , the senate committee - reported bill ( s. 1197 ) , and h.r . 3304 are identical to the administration's proposal . taken together , the final bill stipulates a total active duty end strength which is 40,160 lower than the fy2013 level , almost entirely due to reductions in the size of the army and marine corps . however , both the army and the marine corps finished fy2013 well below their authorized end strength levels . the army's strength at the end of fy2013 was 532,043 ( instead of the authorized 552,100 ) and the marine corps' was 195,848 ( instead of the authorized 197,300 ) . therefore , the required strength reductions in those services for fy2014 would be around 18,000 . discussion: the enacted bill did not adopt the administration's proposals to increase the share of health care costs paid by military retirees . the enacted bill , however , does not prevent dod from implementing its proposal to increase the tricare prime non - mental health office visit co - pay for retirees and their families from $12 to $16 per visit . reference ( s ) : previously discussed in crs report r42651 , fy2013 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] ; crs report r41874 , fy2012 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] , fy2012 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] ; crs report r40711 , fy2010 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] , fy2010 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] ; and crs report rl34590 , fy2009 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] , fy2009 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] . crs point of contact: don jansen , x[phone number scrubbed] . background: issues of the mental health of servicemembers in the armed forces have been of concern to congress for decades . over the years , congress has addressed the issue via studies , hearings , and legislation . 1960 , title v contains three provisions related to servicemember mental health in subtitles c and i , while title vi , "health care provisions," contains 10 provisions concerning mental health . these provisions deal with varied mental health concerns , including post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) and traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) , among other mental health diagnoses . note: section numbers and order do not necessarily correspond across bills . discussion: the sections in the first house - passed bill would have expanded mental health assessments ; require evaluations of the role of mental health disorders in servicemembers' encounters with the uniform code of military justice system and separations from the armed forces , and build on previous efforts to ensure appropriate identification , diagnosis , treatment , and access to psychological health resources to active duty servicemembers , reservists , and military families .
