for example , h.r . 2363 would have outlawed killing a peace officer and fleeing the country , proposed 18 u.s.c . other proposed new federal capital offenses would have included ( 1 ) agroterrorism when death results , proposed 18 u.s.c . 2339d ( s. 1532 ) ; ( 2 ) interference with federal disaster relief efforts if death results , proposed 18 u.s.c . 3728 ) ; ( 3 ) death resulting from a violation of 18 u.s.c . 1590 ( trafficking in persons ) that involves raping or kidnapping more than one person , proposed 18 u.s.c . , ( 1 ) the offender has a prior espionage or treason conviction , ( 2 ) the offense involved a grave risk to national security , and ( 3 ) the offense involved a grave risk of death . violation of section 2339d is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years , 18 u.s.c . 3060 would have made no change in section 2339d , but it would have amended section 3591 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the capital procedures provisions to say that violations of sections 2381 ( treason ) , 794 ( espionage ) , or 2339d ( terrorist training ) may be punished by death if execution is found justified after considering the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in section 3592 , proposed 18 u.s.c . it also would have amended the list of 3592 ( c ) aggravating factors to add a fourth factor , i.e. , the defense involved substantial planning by the defendant , proposed 18 u.s.c . 3592 ( c ) ( 4 ) . assuming the conforming amendment to section 2339dâmaking it a capital offenseâwas an oversight and in spite of the proposal's caption ( "addition of terrorism to death penalty offenses not resulting death" ) , it is not clear that the courts would permit imposition of the death penalty for a violation of section 2339d unless the offense also involved a first degree murder . the eighth amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause precludes imposing the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman by an individual already under a sentence of life imprisonment at the time of the rape ; it precludes imposition of the deathâ penalty even in the case of murder unless the defendant at least acted intentionally or actedâ with reckless indifference to human life while participating in a felony involving a murder ; and since the court's decision in furman v. georgia , it has never been called upon to approve , and consequently has never approved , imposition of the death penalty for a crime that did not involve murder . 4923 / s. 122 would have repealed federal death penalty provisions and barred imposition or execution of any capital sentence for violation of federal law . it made no mention of capital punishment imposed for violation of state law . 379 , on the other hand , would have set a ten year moratorium on imposition and execution of capital sentences in any state in which an individual originally sentenced to death had subsequently been judicially found innocent . it said nothing of capital punishment imposed or executed under federal law .
