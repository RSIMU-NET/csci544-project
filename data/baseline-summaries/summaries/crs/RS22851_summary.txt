again , they were referred to committee . 2419 âthe "farm bill. rather than exempting all crp payments from self - employment tax , while still including them for income tax , the farm bill provides two alternatives that would provide some relief to taxpayers . the first offers an optional tax credit in lieu of crp payments . the second explicitly exempts crp payments from self - employment tax for certain taxpayers . crp annual payments would remain subject to income tax for all recipients . the credit would be subject to neither income nor self - employment taxes . for fy2008 through fy2012 , this provision , if enacted , would assure crp participants of a choice in the taxation of their crp benefits . they could choose the nonrefundable credit and shield their benefits from both income and self - employment tax , but potentially postpone or even eliminate some of the benefit if their tax liability does not equal or exceed their credit . they could choose to receive full payment benefits each year , pay income and self - employment tax on those benefits , and possibly generate future social security benefits . the bill does not , however , assure participants a similar choice beyond 2012 , nor does it clarify whether crp annual payments generally should be treated as self - employment incomeâan issue that has not yet been addressed by congress . they must also follow an approved conservation plan . in return , they receive annual payments . these payments are referred to as "rent" in the statute , regulations , and contracts . however , from the beginning , the internal revenue service ( irs ) has treated this income as self - employment income for those who continued to farm other land connected to the crp land . although the irs initially treated the payments as rental income for those not otherwise engaged in farming , and , therefore , not subject to self - employment tax , that treatment has changed over the years . in 2006 , the irs issued a proposed revenue ruling that would treat virtually all crp annual payments as self - employment income . net self - employment income is subject to a 15.3% self - employment tax . since crp annual payments are also subject to income tax , the total tax an individual must pay on crp payments is generally between about 25% and 56% of the total received if the crp payments are subject to self - employment tax . several bills have been introduced in recent congresses to completely exclude crp payments from self - employment income . most were simply referred to committee , and no hearings were held . during the first session of the 110 th congress , two similar bills were introduced . however , in s. 2242 , the heartland , habitat , harvest , and horticulture act of 2007 , the issue was approached in a different manner . this approach has been adopted in h.r . it was established by the food security act of 1985 and has been expanded and extended by subsequent legislation .
