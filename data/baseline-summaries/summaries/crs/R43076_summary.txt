this revised bill ( h.r . the house adopted a resolution ( h.res . 361 ) on september 28 that combined the texts of h.r . 3102 into one bill ( h.r . 2642 ) for purposes of resolving differences with the senate . on september 19 , the house passed a stand - alone nutrition bill ( h.r . 3102 ) by a vote of 217-210 . a conference agreement reconciling the differences between the two measures was reported as the agricultural act of 2014 ( h.rept . 113-333 ) on january 27 , 2014 . within eight days , both chambers approved the conference agreement , the house on january 29 by a vote of 251-166 and the senate on february 4 by a vote of 68-32 . the president signed it into law ( p.l . 113-79 ) on february 7 , 2014 . this report begins with a brief overview of the estimated budgetary impact of the 2014 farm bill , followed by a summary comparison of the major provisions of each title . a side - by - side section comprehensively compares all of the provisions in p.l . 113-79 to senate and house versions of the farm bill — including s. 954 as passed by the senate ( also referred to as the senate amendment to h.r . 2642 ) and the house - passed version of h.r . 2642 ( which includes the provisions of h.r . 3102 as a new title iv to h.r . 2642 ) — as well as to relevant provisions in then - current law . the "prior law / policy" column of the side - by - side tables reflects the provisions of the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . 110-246 ) as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 ) , which extended most of the 2008 farm bill provisions for an additional year , as well as other relevant statutes that are revised by the 2014 farm bill . the budgetary impact of the 2014 farm bill is measured relative to what the prior farm bill would have spent had it been continued . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projected that the mandatory programs of the 2008 farm bill would have cost $973 billion if continued for the next 10 years ( fy2014-fy2023 ) . this "baseline" already had been reduced by $6.4 billion to reflect the effects of sequestration over the 10-year baseline . compared to this post - sequestration baseline , the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ) reduces projected spending and the deficit by $16.6 billion ( - 1.7% ) over 10 years . ( the five - year reduction through fy2018 is $5.4 billion from a five - year baseline of $494 billion. ) 113-79 saves less than either the house - passed or senate - passed proposals . the house - passed combination of h.r . 3102 together would have reduced spending by $51.9 billion ( - 5.3% ) over 10 years . the senate - passed farm bill proposal ( s. 954 ) would have reduced spending by $17.9 billion ( - 1.8% ) over 10 years .
