the fate of the cpp is uncertain . , without the cpp ) , epa projects a 16% reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels . in terms of metric tons , epa's cpp scenario would reduce an additional 377 million metric tons ( or 15 percentage points ) of co 2 , compared to epa's baseline scenario . based on epa's regulatory impact analysis , several factors may explain the emission results in 2030 between the baseline and cpp scenarios: demand - side energy efficiency ( dsee ) improvements: states may employ dsee improvement activities as part of their plans to meet their targets . in its analysis , epa assumed that dsee efforts would decrease total electricity generation by 8% in 2030 compared to its baseline projection . coal generation decreases: epa projected coal generation to decrease by 22% - 23% in 2030 compared to its 2030 baseline projection . natural gas generation increases: epa projected natural gas generation to increase by 5% - 18% in 2030 compared to its 2030 baseline projection . renewable energy generation increases: epa projected non - hydro renewable energy generation is expected to increase by 8% - 9% in 2030 compared to its 2030 baseline projection . other organizations used models to compare baseline scenarios with various cpp scenarios . table 1 lists the co 2 emission projections from these groups and epa . some of these groups produced multiple projections , employing different assumptions of future activities: cpp implementation options ( eg , whether states engaged in emissions trading ) and levels of energy efficiency improvements , among others . all of the modeling scenarios below ( except for epa ) included the december 2015 renewable energy tax extensions . on december 18 , 2015 , president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l . the act , among other provisions , extended and modified the production tax credit ( ptc ) and the investment tax credit ( itc ) for specific renewable energy technologies . prior to the december 2015 development , the ptc had expired and the itc was scheduled to expire at the end of 2016 . the ptc will not be available to projects starting construction after december 31 , 2019 . however , ptc tax expenditures will continue after that date , because the ptc is available for the first 10 years of renewable electricity production . the itc for solar is scheduled to decline from 30% to 26% in 2020 , and 22% in 2021 , before returning to the permanent rate of 10% after 2021 . in general , the modeling results in table 1 indicate that the cpp would have a substantial impact on future co 2 emission levels from electricity generation compared to scenarios that do not include the cpp . figure 9 compares epa's projections of co 2 emissions in the electricity sector resulting from the final rule with historical co 2 emissions ( 1990-2015 ) from the electricity sector and projected emissions under epa's baseline scenario . this scenario does not include the 2015 renewable energy tax extensions , discussed below . the figure indicates that the final rule would reduce co 2 emissions in the electricity sector by 32% in 2030 compared to 2005 levels .
