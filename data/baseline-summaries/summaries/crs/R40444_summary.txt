if not , allotments will be reduced proportionally . bba 97 stipulated that only states that exhausted the relevant allotment within three years were eligible to receive unspent funds from other states . however , the secretary determined how the funds would be redistributed to states that qualified . for fy2006 , the amount available for redistribution was inadequate for covering projected federal chip shortfalls in 12 states . in dra , congress appropriated an additional $283 million to cover the projected shortfalls . two states ( illinois and massachusetts ) ultimately had higher fy2006 chip spending than anticipated , so they experienced shortfalls totaling approximately $100 million , almost all of that from illinois . in fy2007 , $147 million in unspent fy2004 original allotments was available for redistribution . in the closing hours of the 109 th congress , a bill was passed to specify how those funds would be redistributed . the national institutes of health ( nih ) reform act of 2006 ( h.r . 109-482 , nihra ) required that the funds go to states "in the order in which such [shortfall] states realize monthly funding shortfalls ... for fiscal year 2007. . the purpose was to delay any state facing a shortfall as far into the year as possible with the available funds . crs projections indicated that this particular provision would delay shortfalls until the end of march 2007 . to delay shortfalls even further , the chip provisions of nihra called for an initial redistribution of up to half of unspent fy2005 original allotments as of march 31 , 2007 ( capped at $20 million per state ) — after 2½ years of availability . for a state to forgo unspent fy2005 funds on that date , nihra required not only that the state have unspent fy2005 balances but that the state's total chip balances ( from the fy2005-fy2007 original allotments ) as of march 31 , 2007 , were at least double what the state projected to spend in federal chip funds in fy2007 . this was projected to provide an additional $138 million for shortfall states , delaying any state facing a shortfall of federal chip funds until may 2007 . the shortfalls remaining for the rest of the fiscal year were projected at just over $600 million in 12 states . on may 25 , 2007 , p.l . 110-28 ( the u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act , 2007 ; utra ) was enacted . in it , congress appropriated up to $650 million to cover shortfalls of federal chip funds in 10 states for the remainder of fy2007 . table 2 shows cumulative federal chip financing from the bba 97 era of chip — from1998 through fy2007 . for fy2008 , mmsea required that unspent fy2005 allotments be redistributed to shortfall states on a monthly basis in the order in which these states experience shortfalls . in addition to this redistribution , mmsea appropriated up to $1.6 billion for states' remaining shortfalls in fy2008 . actual shortfall funding provided in fy2008 totaled just under $1 billion , as shown in column e of table 3 .
