these adjustments vary greatly . two adjustmentsâoverseas contingency operations ( oco ) and emergency spendingâhave made up the vast majority of the spending . these adjustments are uncapped and can be used for broad purposes . five other adjustments are capped and can be used for specific programs or purposes . two additional adjustments address potential technical issues that can arise in enforcing the spending limits . title i in division a of the 21 st century cures act ( p.l . 114-255 ) , enacted in december 2016 , authorized appropriations for programs and activities related to health care , research , and opioid abuse . the act also established a distinctive budgetary mechanism related to certain authorizations that is different from the adjustments described above but has a similar effect . specifically , the act established three accounts: the national institutes of health ( nih ) innovation account , the food and drug administration ( fda ) innovation account , and the account for the state response to the opioid crisis . the act then transferred funds from the general fund of the treasury to these accounts and authorized those funds to be appropriated for specific dollar amounts in specific fiscal years . those funds were not to be available for obligation until they were appropriated in appropriations acts each fiscal year . the act further stated that when appropriations are enacted for such authorized activitiesâup to the authorized amount each fiscal yearâthose appropriations are to be subtracted from any cost estimate provided for the purpose of enforcing the discretionary spending limits . this effectively exempts any spending provided for these activities between fy2017 and fy2026 from the spending caps . specifically , the bill provides such exceptions for the accounts and amounts shown in below . in each case , the exemptions apply only to the years included in the respective table . each discretionary spending limit is enforced separately through sequestration . discretionary spending that is provided for certain purposes is effectively exempt from the spending limits . this means that when compliance with the discretionary spending limits is evaluated , these special types of spending are treated differently: adjustments . the law specifies that spending for certain activities , such as responding to a national emergency or fighting terrorism , will receive special budgetary treatment . these adjustments and the cures act exemptions complicate conversations and information related to overall discretionary spending amounts . when references are made to total discretionary spending , those figures may include spending that is provided under the adjustments authority as well as the cures act exemptions . however , when references are made to the discretionary spending limits , typically they do not include the spending that occurs as part of the adjustments or the cures act exemptions . more information is provided below on each adjustment and the cures act . while the categories of spending described below are often thought of as being exempt from the spending limits , in fact the enactment of such spending allows for a subsequent upward adjustment of the discretionary limits to accommodate the spending . for this reason , we refer to these categories of spending as "adjustments.
