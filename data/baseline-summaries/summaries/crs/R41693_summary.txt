in its analyses of h.r . 5 , cbo estimated that such reforms would reduce spending under medicare , medicaid , the state children's health insurance program , and the federal employees health benefits program by approximately $34 billion to $48 billion from 2011 to 2021 . in addition , the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) estimated that such reforms would lead to an increase in federal revenues of $6 billion to almost $10 billion over the same 10-year period . by combining the impact of federal tort reform on mandatory health spending and tax revenues , cbo estimated that such reform could reduce the federal budget deficit by approximately $40 billion to $57 billion over 10Â years . addressing problems in medical malpractice can be challenging , particularly due to the interactions of three different relevant systems , each of which is complex in its own right: health care , tort , and insurance . recent experience in the medical malpractice insurance market , within the states with respect to the number of malpractice law suits and their average settlement amounts , and among providers that have embarked on quality improvement efforts that reduce malpractice exposure and premiums , can be described as encouraging . it is not yet clear whether these trends are long term or whether they reflect the trough of another cycle in the medical liability insurance marketplace , and their link , if any , to state or federal policies is also unclear . the cyclical experience of medical malpractice insurers is reflected in aggregate data about the industry compiled and analyzed by the naic ( see figure 1 ) . from 1992 to 1998 , direct incurred losses were relatively stable , varying from a low of $3.18 billion in 1994 to a high of $4.46 billion in 1998 . however , from 1998 to 2003 , losses grew steadily year after year , to a high of $8.46 billion in that last year , coinciding with the last crisis period . from 2003 to 2010 , losses fell every year to a low of $3.52 billion with the 2011 losses of $3.66 billion only slightly higher than 2010 . ( the loss data are in nominal dollar amounts. ) \s malpractice insurance premiums roughly followed losses as those amounts increased . however , premiums have not fallen nearly as much as losses in recent years as the trend reversed . the loss ratio , which compares losses to premiums , reflects this uneven trend ( see figure 2 ) . a high ratio generally implies lower profits for insurers on the insurance portion of their operations . the loss ratio for the industry rose steadily from 78.41% in 1997 to 126.83% in 2001 , tracking closely with the losses trend . since 2001 , the loss ratio has rapidly decreased . in 2010 , the loss ratio of 51.13% was the lowest one in nearly two decades , and the 2008 , 2011 , and 2009 ratios were the second , third , and fourth lowest at 54.62% , 54.66% , and 55.66% , respectively . this means that over the past four years , the industry experienced its highest profit margin on direct premiums earned in the calendar years analyzed .
