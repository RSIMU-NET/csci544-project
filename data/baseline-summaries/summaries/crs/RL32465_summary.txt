new national security advisor j.n . dixit has beenassigned to take the lead role in relations with china , replacing his predecessor , brajesh mishra , andthe world's two most populous countries have vowed to bolster defense and trade ties while movingforward on efforts to resolve outstanding territorial disputes . ( 21 ) india also agreed toincrease bilateral defense ties with japan through periodic ministerial - level interaction . the previous nationalelection was held in october 1999 . although india's political stage is crowded with numerousregional and caste - based parties , recent years have seen an increasingly dyadic battle between twomajor parties that vie for smaller allies in a system that now requires coalitional politics ( no partyhas won a national election outright since 1984 ) . since 1998 , the bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) hadled a ruling national democratic alliance ( nda ) coalition of more than 20 parties working underthe leadership of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee . the october 1999 lok sabha electionssolidified the bjp's standing . the key opposition party during this time was the congressparty . ( 3 ) during april and may 2004 , india held a four - phase national election to seat a new loksabha . the nda called elections six months early in an apparent effort to capitalize on perceivedmomentum from positive economic news and from three convincing state - level victories overcongress in december 2003 . some 380 million indians cast ballots at nearly 700,000 pollingstations . when results were announced on may 13 , nearly all observers and participants - - includingprime minister atal vajpayee - - were surprised by the upset defeat of the nda , and by asimultaneous resurgence of the congress party led by sonia gandhi , the italian - born widow offormer prime minister rajiv gandhi , which had forged strategic and unprecedented alliances withpowerful regional parties . on may 18 , gandhi stunned her supporters by declining the position ofprime minister in a new united progressive alliance ( upa ) coalition government , insteadnominating her party lieutenant , oxford - educated economist manmohan singh , for the job . asfinance minister from 1991-1996 , singh was the architect of major indian economic reform andliberalization efforts . on may 22 , the widely - esteemed sikh became india's first - ever non - hinduprime minister . poll results also were notable for the best - ever showing of a leftist alliance led by thecommunist party of india ( marxist ) , which won a total of 62 seats , nearly all of them from westbengal and kerala . although this left front is not part of the new upa government , it is supportingthe upa from outside . investor fears that a new coalition government including communists mightcurtail or halt india's economic reform and liberalization process apparently led to huge losses in thecountry's stock markets: bombay's benchmark sensex index lost 11% of its value on may 17 , thesecond - largest daily loss ever , and the value of india's largest companies reportedly declined by some$40 billion over seven days , with state - owned businesses slated for public sale taking the greatesthits .
