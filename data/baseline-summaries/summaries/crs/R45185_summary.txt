the process is not automatic . appropriations are required to perform studies and construction ; that is , congressional study and construction authorizations are necessary but insufficient for usace to proceed . it first presents a table with the various pieces of legislation that functioned as usace omnibus authorization bills and identifies the titles relevant to usace . the appendix next provides supplementary information to what was provided in " usace authorization legislation: 1986 to present process " regarding the evolution of the bills and the contents of specific bills . overview table table b - 1 provides additional information on each of the bills that functioned as an omnibus usace authorization bill often titled as a water resource development act ( wrda ) since 1986 . the table includes the following bills . wrda 1986 ( p.l . 99-662 ) wrda 1988 ( p.l . 100-676 ) wrda 1990 ( p.l . 101-640 ) wrda 1992 ( p.l . 102-580 ) wrda 1996 ( p.l . 104-303 ) wrda 1999 ( p.l . 106-53 ) wrda 2000 ( p.l . 106-541 ) wrda 2007 ( p.l . 110-114 ) water resources reform and development act of 2014 ( wrrda 2014 ; p.l . 113-121 ) water infrastructure improvements for the nation act ( wiin ; p.l . 114-322 ) america's water infrastructure act of 2018 ( awia 2018 , p.l . 115-270 ) the table lists the titles used in the bills and the agency or department related to the majority of the provisions in each of those titles . the titles are shown in the table as being primarily associated with either usace civil works or primarily associated with programs and activities of agencies or departments other than usace ( with the relevant agency or department shown in parentheses ) . the placement in one of the two columns of the table is a broad sorting and does not reflect the details of each provision within a title . for titles listed as primarily usace , a few provisions in a title may relate principally to other agencies or departments while the bulk of the title is usace related , and vice versa for titles listed as not primarily associated with usace . titles related to revenue and trust funds that are closely associated with usace projects and usace appropriations are shown in the table as usace titles . as appropriate , clarifying notes are provided in the final column . as shown in table b - 1 , usace was the focus of the majority of titles for all of the bills except wiin and awia 2018 . for two of the bills — wrda 1992 and wrrda 2014 — there were titles for which the majority of the provisions were related to the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) while also being related to usace activities . for example , title v of wrrda 2014 included authorizations that included both epa and usace , authorities only related to epa , and an authority only related to usace .
