this marked an increase of 12.5% . the department of commerce does not attempt to deflate the annual nominal amounts for direct investment with a specific price deflator . instead , the department publishes alternative estimates based on current cost and market value to provide other measures of the value of direct investment . foreign direct investments in the u.s. manufacturing sector as a whole in 2011 were higher than in 2010 and accounted for nearly half of the overall increase in foreign direct investment in 2011 . foreign direct investment in the banking , finance , retail trade , and professional services all increased in 2011 , compared with investments in 2010 . in comparison , investments were down in the wholesale trade , real estate , and information sectors . data for the first two quarters of 2012 indicate that foreign direct investment in the united states is down about 41% from the amount recorded in the comparable period in 2011 . such investments may well continue to lag behind similar investment in 2010 in the second half of the year if the rate of economic growth stalls . new spending by u.s. firms on businesses and real estate abroad , or u.s. direct investment abroad , although substantial , fell sharply in 2009 compared to 2008 . net investments fell from $332 billion in 2008 to $221 billion in 2009 , according to the department of commerce . as indicated in figure 1 , a drop in u.s. direct investment abroad that occurred in 2005 reflects actions by u.s. parent firms to reduce the amount of reinvested earnings going to their foreign affiliates for distribution to the u.s. parent firms in order to take advantage of one - time tax provisions in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l . according to the u.n. world investment report , global foreign investment flows reached $1.5 trillion in 2011 , a 16% increase over the amount recorded in 2010 in 2011 , as indicated in table 1 . the growth in foreign investment flows reflects higher profits by multinational corporations and an increase in the rate of growth in developing countries . in 2009 , global foreign investment flows dropped by 33% from that recorded in 2008 , reflecting the financial crisis and drop in economic growth in most developed economies . the developed economies traditionally have absorbed about two - thirds of global direct investment flows , but this share dropped to half between 2009 and 2011 , reflecting the differential impact of the financial crisis which affected the developed economies more than the developing economies . africa continues to receive the smallest share , generally less than 5% , with latin america receiving about 14% and asia getting close to one - third during the 2009-2011 period . a study on investment trends by the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) reported that direct investment outflows reached a record $1.8 trillion in 2007 , in part due the decline in the value of the dollar relative to the euro , which results in an upward valuation in dollar terms in investments that originally had been priced in euros .
