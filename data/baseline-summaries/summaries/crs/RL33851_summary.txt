these agreements have been renewed several times since then . the working assumption at the time was that there were approximately 2 million refugees in pakistan and 1.5 million in iran . almost everyone was caught off - guard , when subsequently 2.15 million afghans returned in 2002 , and yet most of the camps in pakistan ( and to some extent the cities in iran ) continued to house large numbers of afghan refugees . it turned out that there were far more afghans living in pakistan than most analysts had thought . although the numbers of returns declined in subsequent years , it can be seen from table 1 that through 2005 the pace remained very strong . unhcr estimates that , as of december 2006 , perhaps 2.46 million registered and unregistered afghans are currently living in pakistan and more than 900,000 in iran . who among these afghans is a refugee and who is not is a matter of debate in each country . still , perhaps as many as 3.5 million registered and unregistered afghans still live in exile . in pakistan , 80 percent of those remaining have been there for more than two decades ; 50 percent were born in exile . the united states government ( usg ) has provided humanitarian assistance to afghan refugees since the early 1980s . funding for afghan refugees declined rapidly since it peaked after the u.s. - led invasion in october 2001 . almost all assistance has been provided through the migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) account , and has been programmed by the department of state's bureau of population , refugees , and migration ( prm ) . this funding is used not only for the protection and care of refugees in countries of asylum , but also for the reintegration of afghan returnees in afghanistan . table 2 presents usg assistance to afghan refugees and returnees since the u.s. - led invasion in october 2001 . since the majority of prm funding is provided to regional projects , it is not possible to provide a breakdown of assistance by country . even after four years of exceptionally high refugee return numbers , the population of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran remains the second - highest in the world . if recent returnees — also central to prm's mandate — are added to this number , afghans represent by far the largest population of refugees and returnees in the world . funding for afghan refugees has , however , diminished both overall and as a percentage of prm's total annual budget since fy2002 . the united states thus faces the challenge of maintaining its crucial assistance in this area of the world despite competing priorities . this challenge may become even more difficult in the near future , because maintaining the successful repatriation program is likely to become more , not less , expensive as time goes on . this is because the refugees remaining in pakistan and iran have fewer resources in and ties to afghanistan than those who returned earlier . they have also , on average , spent far more time outside of afghanistan than earlier returnees ( see figure 2 ) .
