perhaps most notably , h.r . 6286 ( cole ) during the 111 th congress , and s. 1091 ( corker ) and h.r . 3792 ( wamp ) during the 110 th congress , would have eliminated existing caps on coordinated party expenditures . exact amounts are determined by formula and updated annually by the fec . limits for senate candidates in 2016 , adjusted for inflation , ranged from $96,100 in states with the smallest vaps to approximately $2.9 million in california . in 2016 , parties may make up to $48,100 in coordinated expenditures in support of each house candidate in multi - district states , and $96,100 in support of house candidates in single - district states . state party committees may authorize their nat ional counterparts to make coordinated party expenditures on their behalf ( or vice versa ) . if such agreements exist , one party could essentially assume the spending limit for another in particular states , in which case the designated party could spend up to its own limit and up to the other party's limit . parties may also make coordinated expenditures on behalf of presidential candidates . for 2016 , the presidential limit is $23.8 million . reconsidering coordinated party expenditure limits is a consistent part of the debate over the role of political parties compared with other political committees and "outside groups. however , bills devoted specifically to altering the limits have not been considered recently . on april 18 , 2007 , the senate committee on rules and administration held a hearing on s. 1091 ; it was not subject to additional legislative action . 3792 was introduced on october 10 , 2007 ; it did not receive additional action . since that time , legislative activity concerning coordinated party expenditures has been limited . during this period , most proposals to alter coordinated party expenditure limits have been components of other bills . as table 1 below shows , public financing and appropriations legislation considered during the 114 th congress would increase or eliminate limits on coordinated party expenditures in some cases . as of this writing , only one such bill , s. 1910 , has advanced beyond introduction , but this appropriations bill was superseded by another measure that excluded the coordinated party expenditure language . although coordinated expenditures played a large role in party financial activity throughout the 1970s and 1980s , recent elections suggest that party reliance on coordinated expenditures is changing . as table 2 and figure 1 ( below ) show , although the colorado i decision permitted parties to make unlimited independent expenditures during and after the 1996 cycle , those expenditures remained relatively modest through 2002 . from 1996 to 2002 , total party coordinated expenditures outpaced independent expenditures â€” often by large amounts . beginning in 2004 , however , party spending shifted dramatically , with far more total independent expenditures than coordinated expenditures . in 2004 , the two major parties made more than four times in independent expenditures what they did in coordinated expenditures . that allocation of resources continued thereafter , albeit in some cases less dramatically than in 2004 .
