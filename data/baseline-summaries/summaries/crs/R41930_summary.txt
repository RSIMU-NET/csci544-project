both entitle victims to restitution . both may result in the forfeiture of property . the first of the two , the mail fraud statute , emerged in the late 19 th century as a means of preventing "city slickers" from using the mail to cheat guileless "country folks. but for penalty increases and amendments calculated to confirm its breadth , the prohibition has come down to us essentially unchanged . speaking in 1987 , the supreme court noted that "the last substantive amendment to the statute ... was the codification of the holding of durland ... in 1909. . congress did amend it thereafter to confirm that the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud statute reached schemes to defraud another of the right to honest services and to encompass the use of commercial postal carriers . the wire fraud statute is of more recent vintage . enacted as part of the communications act amendments of 1952 , it was always intended to mirror the provisions of the mail fraud statute . since its inception , changes in the mail fraud statute have come with corresponding changes in the wire fraud statute in most instances . the mail and wire fraud statutes are essentially the same , except for the medium associated with the offense â€” the mail in the case of mail fraud and wire communication in the case of wire fraud . as a consequence , the interpretation of one is ordinarily considered to apply to the other . in construction of the terms within the two , the courts will frequently abbreviate or adjust their statement of the elements of a violation to focus on the questions at issue before them . as treatment of the individual elements makes clear , however , there seems little dispute that conviction requires the government to prove the use of either mail or wire communications in the foreseeable furtherance of a scheme and intent to defraud another of either property or honest services involving a material deception . the mail and wire fraud statutes essentially outlaw dishonesty . due to their breadth , misconduct that constitutes mail or wire fraud may constitute a violation of one or more other federal criminal statutes as well . this overlap occurs perhaps most often with respect to ( 1 ) crimes for which mail or wire fraud are elements ( "predicate offenses" ) of another offense ; ( 2 ) fraud proscribed under jurisdictional circumstances other than mail or wire use ; and ( 3 ) honest services fraud in the form of bribery or kickbacks .
