this number is reported in the last column . the final section presents findings . the omb mid - session review projected revenues to be $115 billion higher than forecast in february , while cbo projected revenues $99 billion higher than its march forecast . according to cbo projections , the deficit will fall from 2.6% of gdp in fy2005 to 2.0% of gdp in fy2006 . this revenue increase arose from increases in both individual and corporate income and followed an increase in 2005 . in 2005 , gdp grew by 6.5% , but revenues grew by 14.5% ; in 2006 gdp is projected to grow by 6.6% and revenues by 11.6% . in 2005 , revenues from social insurance taxes grew by 8.3% , revenues from individual income taxes by 14.6% , and revenues from corporate taxes by 47% . in 2006 , cbo estimates revenues from social insurance taxes will grow by 5% , revenues from individual income taxes will grow by 14.3% , and revenues from corporate income taxes will grow by 22.2% . this growth in revenues is not due to any extraordinary growth of output , as the economy has been growing at rates typical of those following recoveries from previous recessions . moreover , according to cbo , the economy has essentially reached its full employment level . rather , the growth in revenues is due largely to an increase in taxes as a percentage of output . most of the increase in taxes as a percentage of output is due to income taxes , with about 60% of the effect coming from the individual income tax and the remainder from the corporate tax . table 1 reports , since 1990 , the growth rate of real output and revenue from the corporate and individual income taxes as a percent of gdp as reported by cbo . before discussing the data in this table , it is important to correct the data for a major effect from tax legislation , the introduction of bonus depreciation in 2002 , its expansion in 2003 , and its termination at the end of 2004 . this provision is having effects on corporate tax revenue outside of economic performance . bonus depreciation allowed depreciation deductions to occur earlier than they would have otherwise , thereby shifting revenue from the present to the future . using the revenue estimates made at the time for bonus depreciation and another small tax issue having to do with losses , and assigning a share to corporations equal to the share of accelerated depreciation on equipment reported in the joint committee on taxation's ( jct ) tax expenditure estimates ( 79% ) , we correct the corporate tax ratio to see what it would have been without this legislative change . using these figures , there no longer appears to be a significant growth in corporate tax revenues from 2005 to 2006 . the effect of the depreciation change accounted for 84% of the faster growth in corporate tax revenues , and without it , corporate taxes would have grown by less than 9% rather than by 22% . ( it accounts for slightly over half the 47% growth from 2004 to 2005. )
