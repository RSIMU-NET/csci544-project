comparable fy2004 funding data are not available . the fy2005 budget requests $909 million , an increase of $120 million over fy2004 for consular relations . the number of ftes would increase by 123 to 4,106 ftes . the funding for the visa activities within the bureau of consular affairs comes from the various fee accounts as presented previously in table 2 . the department of state fy2005 budget documents specify that $185 million of the $909 million fy2005 request for consular relations would come from direct appropriations and the remainder would come from various fees , as follows: $601,249,000 from machine - readable visa ( mvr ) fees ; $5,100,000 from diversity lottery fees ; $1,000,000 from federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) fingerprint fees ; $16,800,000 from the affidavits of support fees ; and $100,000,000 from fees that would be provided under a proposed enhanced border security program . a summary of the grounds for excluding aliens follows . the report provides a legislative history of the debate to transfer visa issuance policy functions to dhs and analyzes legislative proposals in the 107 th congress to reassign the visa issuance activities . a discussion of the current division of responsibilities between dhs and dos and the ongoing issues in the 108 th congress conclude the report . there are two broad classes of aliens that are issued visas: immigrants and nonimmigrants . humanitarian admissions , such as asylees , refugees , parolees and other aliens granted relief from deportation , are handled separately under the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) . those aliens granted asylum or refugee status ultimately are eligible to become legal permanent residents ( lprs ) . illegal aliens or unauthorized aliens include those noncitizens who either entered the united states surreptitiously ( i.e. , entered without inspection , or who violated the terms of their visas ) . the adjudication and issuance of visas are largely fee - based , rather than a government service funded by direct appropriations . for the most part , prospective immigrants and nonimmigrants cover the costs of visa processing . the consular affairs immigrant visa application processing fee is $335 , and the nonimmigrant processing fee is $100 . moreover , the 107 th congress permanently authorized the collection of machine - readable visa ( mrv ) fees at $65 — or the cost of the machine - readable visa service if higher — and a $10 surcharge for machine - readable visas in nonmachine - readable passports . these mrv fees are credited as an offsetting collection used by dos to recover costs of providing consular services . the largest amount of direct appropriations for overseas visa services was $20 million in fy1998 , as table 1 indicates . according to dos documents , none of the fy2003 and fy2004 appropriations went to overseas visa services . beginning in fy2003 , however , consular operating expenses were shifted from the diplomatic and consular programs appropriation to funding by mrv fees . the overall budget authority line item for "conduct of consular relations" grew from $589 million in fy2003 to $789 million in fy2004 .
