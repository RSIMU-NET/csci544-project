, intervention ) , such as abstinence - only education . for a policy to have an impact , it must be determined that the impact did not just occur by chance . in other words , the difference must be determined to be "statistically significant. differences between experimental and control groups that pass statistical significance tests are reported as policy impacts . the random assignment experimental approach generally is considered to provide the most valid estimate of an intervention's impact , and thereby provides useful information on whether , and the extent to which , on average , an intervention causes favorable impacts for a large group of subjects . ( for information about some of the problems with the experimental approach , see crs report rl33301 , congress and program evaluation: an overview of randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) and related issues . ) there is a significant difference between abstinence as a message and abstinence - only interventions . many argue that sexual activity in and of itself is wrong if the persons are not married . others agree that it is better for teenagers to abstain from sex , but are primarily concerned about the negative consequences of sexual activity , namely unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ) . these two viewpoints are reflected in two teen pregnancy prevention approaches . the abstinence - only education approach centers on the abstinence - only message and exclusively funds programs that adhere solely to bolstering that message . the title v abstinence education block grant administered by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) supports this approach . the comprehensive sexual education approach provides funding ( through many other federal programs ) for both prevention programs ( that often include an abstinence message ) and programs that provide medical and social services to pregnant or parenting teens . since 1991 , teen pregnancy , abortion , and birth rates have all fallen considerably . in 2002 ( the latest available data ) , the overall pregnancy rate for teens aged 15-19 was 75.4 per 1,000 females aged 15-19 , down 35% from the 1991 level of 115.3 . the 2002 teen pregnancy rate is the lowest recorded since 1973 , when this series was initiated . however , it still is higher than the teen pregnancy rates of most industrialized nations . after increasing sharply during the late 1980s , the teen birth rate for females aged 15-19 declined every year from 1991 to 2005 . the 2005 teenage birth rate of 40.4 per 1,000 women aged 15-19 is the lowest recorded birth rate for u.s. teenagers . in 2005 , the number of births to teens was 421,123 ( 10.2% of the 4.1 million births in the u.s. ) , of which 6,717 births were to girls under age 15 . nearly 23% of all nonmarital births were to teens in 2005 . although birth rates for u.s. teens have dropped in recent years , they remain higher than the teenage birth rates of most industrialized nations . according to a recent report on children and youth , in 2005 , 34% of ninth graders reported that they had experienced sexual intercourse .
