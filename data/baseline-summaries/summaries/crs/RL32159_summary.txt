outline the following . an evaluation plan should be a consideration at every stage of the proposal's development . data collected for the problem statement form a comparative basis for determining whether measurable objectives are indeed being met , and whether proposed methods are accomplishing these ends ; or whether different parts of the plan need to be fine - tuned to be made more effective and efficient . among the considerations will be whether evaluation will be done by the organization itself or by outside experts . the organizations will have to decide whether outside experts have the standing in the field and the degree of objectivity that would justify the added expense , or whether the job could be done with sufficient expertise by its own staff , without taking too much time away from the project itself . methods of measurement , whether standardized tests , interviews , questionnaires , observation , and so forth , will depend upon the nature and scope of the project . procedures and schedules for gathering , analyzing , and reporting data will need to be spelled out . applicants are advised: make it interesting ! the basic sections of a standard grant proposal include the following: 1. cover letter 2. proposal summary or abstract 3. introduction describing the grant seeker or organization 4. problem statement ( or needs assessment ) 5. project objectives 6. project methods or design 7. project evaluation 8. future funding 9. project budge . the one - page cover letter should be written on the applicant's letterhead and should be signed by the organization's highest official . it should be addressed to the individual at the funding source with whom the organization has dealt , and should refer to earlier discussions . while giving a brief outline of the needs addressed in the proposal , the cover letter should demonstrate a familiarity with the mission of the grantmaking agency or foundation and emphasize the ways in which this project contributes to these goals . the grant proposal summary outlines the proposed project and should appear at the beginning of the proposal . it could be in the form of a cover letter or a separate page , but should definitely be brief â€” no longer than two or three paragraphs . the summary should be prepared after the grant proposal has been developed in order to encompass all the key points necessary to communicate the objectives of the project . it is this document that becomes the cornerstone of the proposal , and the initial impression it gives will be critical to the success of the venture . in many cases , the summary will be the first part of the proposal package seen by agency or foundation officials and very possibly could be the only part of the package that is carefully reviewed before the decision is made to consider the project any further . when letters of support are written , the summary may be used as justification for the project . remaining alternatives available when funding has been exhausted .
