the report closes with concluding remarks . individuals and firms must prepare and submit applications to the uspto if they seek to obtain patent protection . uspto officials , known as examiners , then assess whether the application merits the award of a patent . under the patent act of 1952 , a patent application must include a specification that so completely describes the invention that skilled artisans are able to practice it without undue experimentation . the patent act also requires that applicants draft at least one claim that particularly points out and distinctly claims the subject matter that they regard as their invention . the patent acquisition process is commonly known as "prosecution. while reviewing a submitted application , the examiner will determine whether the claimed invention fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute . two of the most important patentability criteria are novelty and nonobviousness . to be judged novel , the claimed invention must not be fully anticipated by a prior patent , publication , or other knowledge within the public domain . the sum of these earlier materials is termed the "prior art. to meet the standard of nonobviousness , an invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan based upon the teachings of the prior art . if the uspto allows the application to issue as a granted patent , the owner or owners of the patent obtain the right to exclude others from making , using , selling , offering to sell , or importing into the united states the claimed invention . the term of the patent is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the patent application was filed . patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions , or license others to do so . the grant of a patent permits inventors to receive a return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery , often by charging a higher price than would prevail in a competitive market . a patent proprietor bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention . patent owners who seek to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal courts . although issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity , accused infringers may assert that a patent is invalid or unenforceable on a number of grounds . the federal circuit possesses national jurisdiction over most patent appeals . the u.s. supreme court retains discretionary authority to review cases decided by the federal circuit . once the uspto formally issues a patent , the agency's involvement with that legal instrument ordinarily comes to a close . however , the uspto may be called upon to reconsider its initial decision to approve a patent application through several administrative review proceedings . most of these proceedings are revocation proceedings â€” that is to say , they are primarily used by individuals who seek to challenge the validity of an issued patent . they include reexamination , inter partes review , post - grant review , and covered business method review .
