the version of h.r . 4870 reported by the senate appropriations committee included no prohibition on a - 10 retirements . however , it would have added to the budget a total of $325.7 million in the military personnel and o&m accounts of the air force , air force reserve and air national guard to continue operating the full complement of a - 10s through fy2015 . the enacted bill includes a prohibition against retiring any a - 10s ( section 8141 ) and adds $337.1 million to continue operating the fleet in fy2015 . congressional action on appropriations for selected ground combat vehicles is summarized in table a - 5 while action on selected communications systems is summarized in table a - 9 . those additions , which mirror the house version of h.r . 4870 , are partly offset by several relatively minor reductions . this increases the number of f - 35s funded in fy2015 to 40 aircraft . the budget request did not include funds to continue production of the navy's ef - 18g growler , a version of the f / a - 18e / f fighter that is modified to jam enemy radars . according to the house appropriations committee , recent navy studies conclude that it would be advantageous to increase from five to seven the number of growlers typically aboard a carrier . in addition , sustaining the growler production line at the boeing plant in st. louis , mo , would facilitate the navy's purchase of additional f / a - 18e / f fighters , if the navy reduced its purchase of f - 35s because of the cost or technical problems . the enacted bill adds to the budget $1.46 billion to buy 12 additional growlers and to keep the production line warm . the house version of h.r . 4870 would have added $975.0 million and the senate version $1.30 billion for the same purpose . the enacted fy2015 defense appropriations bill provides $65.17 billion for oco funding , $1.54 billion more than the amended oco request . it includes three congressional additions costing more than $1.0 billion apiece: $2.9 billion for operations and maintenance ( o&m ) activities that dod included in its base budget request , but which the bill funds in oco accounts exempt from the statutory budget caps ; $1.0 billion ( section 9018 ) "for the purposes of improving military readiness," and $1.2 billion for equipment for the national guard and reserve components . these additions are partly offset by several relative modest reductions and two relatively large ones: a reduction of $2.7 billion from the $4.0 billion requested for dod funding of the counterterrorism partnerships fund ( ctpf ) intended to build up the counterterrorism capacity of other governments ; and a reduction of $533.0 million justified on the basis that the army's request for oco military personnel funding was larger than required .
