both versions of h.r . 2 would supersede the current slate of farm programs and policies authorized by the 2014 farm bill , p.l . 113-79 , many of which are to expire in 2018 unless congress acts to reauthorize or extend them . certain programs , such as crop insurance , are permanently authorized and would continue to operate in the absence of new farm legislation or an extension of the current farm bill . the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) could continue to operate as long as funding is appropriated . but if the current farm law were to expire , many other programs — such as revenue support programs for producers of major agricultural commodities — including corn , wheat , milk , sugar , and others — would be governed by so - called permanent laws , which date from the late 1930s and 1940s and do not expire . to this end , h.r . 75-430 ) and agricultural act of 1949 ( p.l . 81-439 ) , rely on supply controls to buttress price support regimes that would raise market prices of these basic farm commodities above existing levels . the vote to approve h.r . 2 followed a failed vote of 198-213 on the same bill on may 18 , 2018 . the final passage vote on june 21 followed a vote of 233-191 approving a motion to reconsider , which was made after the unsuccessful vote on final passage of may 18 . the senate passed its version of h.r . 2 , the agriculture improvement act of 2018 , on june 28 , 2018 , on a vote of 86-11 . both the house - and senate - passed versions of h.r . 2 continue the tradition of multi - year farm bills that would establish policy for farm programs and nutrition assistance . 2 addresses agriculture and food policy across 11 titles in the house bill and 12 titles in the senate bill . these titles cover commodity support programs , agricultural conservation , trade and international food aid , domestic nutrition assistance , credit , rural infrastructure and economic development , research and extension , forestry , horticulture , and a variety of other policies and initiatives . the disparity in the number of titles between the two bills reflects the provision of a separate title for energy programs in the senate bill , whereas the house bill would eliminate what had been a separate energy title in the 2014 farm bill and place these agricultural energy programs within the title on rural infrastructure and economic development . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) issued its scores of h.r . 2 as passed by the house and the senate on july 24 , 2018 . cbo projected that spending on mandatory programs in the senate bill would total $867 billion over the 10-year period fy2019-fy2028 and $865 billion in the house bill . these totals compare with cbo's estimate of the cost of extending the current 2014 farm bill for 10 years of $867 billion .
