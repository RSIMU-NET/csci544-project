50 , was rejected by the senate in october 2019 . some states have tried to use a "pass - through work around" to reduce the salt cap's impact on some of their taxpayers with pass - through business income . many types of businesses that do not pay corporate income taxes ( including s corporations and partnerships ) pass through income to their owners , who pay taxes on that income at the individual level . the tcja roughly doubled the standard deduction and limited other itemized deductions . the tcja also prohibited salt deduction claims on taxes paid on foreign real property for tax years 2018 through 2025 . the salt cap , the increased value of the standard deduction , and other tax changes enacted by the tcja have reduced the number of taxpayers claiming the salt deduction and the total tax savings from those claims . table 1 shows the most recent estimates of reductions in federal revenues attributable to the salt deduction for fy2017 , the last full year before enactment of p.l . revenue losses from the salt deduction in fy2017 ( $100.9 billion ) nearly equaled the total losses projected from fy2019 through fy2023 ( $117.2 billion ) . the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) projects that 16.4 million taxpayers will claim a salt deduction for tax year 2019 , compared to 46.6 million taxpayers who the internal revenue service ( irs ) reported claiming the deduction in 2017 . recent research has estimated the salt cap's effect on salt deduction claims independent of other tax changes enacted through the tcja . a 2019 treasury inspector general report examined the salt cap's hypothetical effect had it been imposed in tax year 2017 , prior to the other tcja changes taking effect . the report found that the cap would have reduced salt deduction benefits for 10.9 million taxpayers ( about 25% of all households claiming the deduction ) and reduced deduction amounts by $323 billion , or just over half of the actual amounts deducted in that year . in june 2019 , jct estimated that holding all other portions of the tax code constant , repealing the salt cap for tax year 2018 would decrease fy2019 federal revenues by $77.4 billion . several states also took legal action related to the salt cap following enactment of the tcja , filing suit against the u.s. government in july 2018 and challenging the cap's constitutionality . a september 2019 federal district court ruling upheld the salt cap's constitutionality , asserting that it did not unconstitutionally penalize certain jurisdictions . legislation introduced in the 116 th congress would modify the salt cap , including proposals that would ( 1 ) repeal the salt cap entirely ; ( 2 ) increase the salt cap's value for all taxpayers ; ( 3 ) increase the salt cap's value for some taxpayers ; ( 4 ) make the salt cap permanent ; and ( 5 ) repeal irs regulations affecting salt cap liability . table 4 displays legislation in the 116 th congress that would directly modify the salt cap . this section explores features of localities and households that are likely to influence the distribution and intensity of salt cap effects on tax liability .
