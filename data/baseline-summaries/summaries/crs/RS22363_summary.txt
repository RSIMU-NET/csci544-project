what standards can and cannot do . standards can address only issues that were considered by the developers of those standards , and the way that they are developed and implemented can also affect the way issues are addressed . the vss and its certification process were criticized for not anticipating the kinds of security weaknesses with dres that have been discovered in some certified systems , and for limiting testing of systems to controlled laboratory conditions rather than realistically simulated election conditions . the 2005 vvsg strengthened the security requirements , and the 2007 draft completely rewrote them . the 2005 version did not address the second criticism , but the 2007 draft would require more realistic testing . development and implementation of the vvsg . the development of standards can involve lengthy deliberations under the best of circumstances , and hava may have exacerbated that characteristic by creating a complex process for the development of the vvsg . hava does not specify an updating cycle for the guidelines , but international standards are often updated on a three - to five - year cycle . some observers believe that a four - year development cycle is desirable , to permit systems to be used for two federal election cycles without requiring recertification . others have criticized the process for development of the vvsg as being too slow and cumbersome . there appears to be an inherent conflict in responsiveness of the guidelines to , on the one hand , evolving needs and technology and , on the other , time and cost constraints inherent in responding appropriately to such changes . achieving the right balance is likely to be difficult . funding has also been an issue . although hava requires nist to assist in the development of the vvsg and the certification process , it did not authorize any funding specifically for that purpose . appropriations legislation has been addressing that gap by specifying eac funds to be transferred to nist for their support activities . however , funding for the eac was authorized only through fy2005 , and some observers have called for abolishing the eac . certification process . the development of plans for certification testing has also raised issues . some observers believe that the public trust would best be served by open certification testing , whereas others believe that the release of proprietary vendor information that would accompany such open testing would be a strong disincentive for investment and innovation by vendors , and therefore counterproductive . the process for selecting testing laboratories has also been criticized , with some observers arguing that the process does not provide sufficient independence of testing laboratories from manufacturers and creates concerns about conflicts of interest . however , it is generally recognized that the hava process is likely to be superior to the one it replaced , which was criticized as slow and expensive . nevertheless , no voting systems have been certified by the eac for use in the 2008 federal election . until such certifications are in place , election jurisdictions around the country must rely on certifications obtained before the eac process went into effect . vvsg revisions .
