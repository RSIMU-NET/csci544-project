appendix a . strategic plans of key border protection entities appendix b. appropriations table b - 1 includes appropriations information for agencies with border protection - related functions , including those agencies whose functions are most directly tied to this mission . these agencies include the customs and border protection ( cbp ) , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , united states coast guard , transportation and security administration , drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , and the executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) . ( 2 ) is it working ? and ( 3 ) are there more effective alternatives to achieve border protection ? therefore , the funding figures that are presented should not be construed to depict funding for combating illegal immigration and providing border security . the answers to these questions are important for congress to conduct proper oversight of border protection functions , as well as to gauge its priorities . moreover , such questions provide an opportunity for legislators to re - evaluate the policies that have been pursued in providing border protection , especially as these policies might impact other elements of the u.s. border , such as markets and communities . this report provides an overview of the current border protection framework and its operationally oriented strategic elements and measures their effectiveness . the report draws on documents from congress and the administration , as well as other publications , to pull together an overarching picture of protection at the border . this overview includes a historical background and a definition of what "border protection" means in a contemporary context . building on this definition , the report provides two theoretical models for border protection approaches based on unilateral and cooperative approaches , followed by an extended analysis of the major elements within the current border protection framework . this analysis also includes discussions of how and why , certain strategic elements notwithstanding , many of the current border - related security policies focus on the physical border rather than conceptualizing the border in broader terms . statistical analyses of some key indicators are used to evaluate the impact of the current framework . lastly , this report offers some policy options — both short - term and long - term — for addressing the effectiveness of current border protection policies . it is important to note that while this report deals only with the movement of people , the same principles discussed also apply to the cargo side of border protection . while policymakers have wrestled with notions of what border protection should look like , for border enforcement agencies , the practical questions have remained similar for decades . in essence , border agencies have attempted to develop agency - specific strategies that prevent activities which circumvent u.s. laws on cross - border activities . although the framework for border protection has evolved , much of the current framework is rooted in traditional enforcement activities and deterrence - based principles as discussed below . for critics and advocates of u.s. border protection policy , there are a host of competing policy alternatives for how to effectively protect the border .
