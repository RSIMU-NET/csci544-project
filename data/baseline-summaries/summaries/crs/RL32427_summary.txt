appendix a . project impact . the most important measure of mcc activity is the long - term impact compacts can have on poverty reduction through increased incomes among poor people — the legislative mandate of the agency . these and other issues are discussed below . when the mcc was proposed , it was expected that , within a few years , the level of funding would ramp up to about $5 billion per year . for a variety of reasons , not least of which is the limitation on available funding for foreign aid more broadly , the mcc never achieved anywhere near that level of funding . in fact , in most years since the mcc was established , its enacted appropriation has been below the president's request . on may 23 , 2017 , the trump administration issued its fy2018 budget request , including $800 million for the mcc , a cut of $105 million ( - 11.6% ) from fy2017-enacted levels . on july 24 , 2017 , the house appropriations committee reported its version of the fy2018 state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations ( h.r . 3362 ) , providing $800 million for the mcc in fy2018 , matching the trump administration request and $105 million less than it received in fy2017 . on september 14 , the house approved h.r . 3354 , an omnibus appropriations act , including the state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations ( division g ) , providing $800 million for the mcc in fy2018 . on september 7 , 2017 , the senate appropriations committee reported its version of the fy2018 state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations ( s. 1780 ) , providing $905 million for the mcc , equal to the fy2017 level and $105 more than the administration request . on march 23 , 2018 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) was signed into law , providing $905 million for the mcc , the same level as in fy2017 . on february 12 , 2018 , the trump administration issued its fy2019 budget request , including $800 million for the mcc , a cut of $105 million ( - 11.6% ) from fy2018-enacted levels . in recent years , several proposals have been made to expand the mcc's range of possible partners and activities , all so that it may better meet its mandate of poverty reduction through economic growth . these options are discussed below . at its december 2014 meeting , the mcc board stated its support for possible efforts by the agency to consider developing regionally oriented partnerships , especially in south asia . compacts addressing regional issues , mcc argues , could provide higher rates of return on mcc investments , benefitting from economies of scale and supporting trade between nations . to enable the possibility of working on a regional basis , the mcc proposed legislation in its fy2016 , fy2017 , and fy2018 budget presentations that would allow it to undertake concurrent compacts — more than one in an individual country at the same time .
