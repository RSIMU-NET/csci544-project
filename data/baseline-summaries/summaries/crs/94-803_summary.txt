social security colas trigger increases in other programs . supplemental security income ( ssi ) benefits and railroad retirement "tier 1" benefits ( equivalent to a social security benefit ) are increased by the same percentage as the social security cola or are held constant when a cola is not paid to social security beneficiaries . railroad retirement "tier 2" benefits ( equivalent to a private pension ) are increased by an amount equivalent to 32.5% of the social security cola . a cola trigger mechanism was first adopted in p.l . 92-603 , the social security amendments of 1972 , and triggered colas were first payable in 1975 . prior to 1975 , congress sporadically approved colas through the adoption of legislation . on october 11 , 2018 , the social security administration ( ssa ) announced that a 2.8% social security cola would be paid in january 2019 . the bls release of the september 2018 cpi - w on that day made possible the comparison of the two july - september sets of cpi - w data needed to compute the cola ( one for 2017 and another for 2016 ) . table 1 shows how the determination for a january 2019 cola is computed under procedures set forth in section 215 ( i ) of the social security act . since automatic social security benefit colas began in 1975 , there have been three years in which no cola was payable: 2010 , 2011 , and 2016 . the social security act specifies that a cola is payable automatically if the average cpi - w for the third quarter of the current year is higher than the highest average cpi - w for the third quarter of past years , which is called the "cost - of - living computation quarter. from 1975 , when this provision became effective , to 2008 , a new cost - of - living computation quarter was established in each subsequent year , which triggered the payment of a cola each year . if the average cpi - w for the third quarter of the current year is equal to or less than the average cpi - w for the cost - of - living computation quarter , no cola is payable . ( social security payments always reflect the benefits due for the preceding month. ) for example , the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2009 was less than the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2008 ( 211.001 and 215.495 , respectively ) . as a result , an automatic cola in january 2010 was not triggered and the third quarter of 2008 remained the cost - of - living computation quarter ( i.e. , the benchmark ) used to determine if a cola would be payable in january 2011 . table 3 shows the history of social security colas since the automatic colas began in 1975 . table 4 provides a comprehensive summary of all ad - hoc legislative cost - of - living adjustments to social security benefits before automatic adjustments began in july 1975 . the first increase occurred in october 1950 , 10 years after social security benefits were first issued in 1940 .
