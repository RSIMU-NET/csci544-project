this provision is discussed in detail below . after a brief description of the estate and gift tax and of options , this report compares the alternatives , focusing largely on a $1 million exemption and 55% rate , a $3.5 million exemption and a 45% rate , and a $5 million exemption and a 35% rate . several policy effects and issues are analyzed: the share of decedents subject to tax ; revenue effects ; distributional effects ; and effects on savings , charitable contributions , and compliance and administration . the report also considers other aspects of the proposals , such as whether the exemptions are indexed for inflation , a proposed inheritance of the exemption for spouses ( which applies under the new rules to 2011 and 2012 ) , and proposals to address perceived abuses . this section describes the estate tax as it existed in 2009 and will exist in future years , absent legislative change . for 2010 , there is no estate tax , although the gift tax remains and there is a tax on gains accumulated during the decedent's lifetime when assets are sold by heirs ( with a $1.3 million exemption plus $3 million for a spouse ) . an election can be made for 2010 to apply either 2010 or 2011 rules . because the exemption from gains is smaller than the overall estate tax exemption for 2011 , some estates would have lower tax liability by electing the 2011 rules . the principal components of any policy that continues the estate tax are the amount of the exemption and the tax rate . as indicated earlier , the exemption in 2009 was $3.5 million , the exemption is scheduled at $5 million for 2011 and 2012 , and in 2013 the estate tax will revert to an exemption of $1 million , absent a change in the statute . thus , while any level of exemption might be considered , the two most common levels mentioned are $3.5 million and $5 million . the level of the exemption affects not only the revenue but the number of estates that are subject to the tax . the second principal component of a continued estate tax is the rate , which will return to 55% in 2013 absent legislative change ; rates of 45% applied in 2009 and a 35% rate applies in 2011-2012 . some proposals would apply the capital gains tax rate ( currently 15% but scheduled to go to 20% in 2013 ) or some multiple of it . another issue is whether to index the exemption for inflation . some components of the income tax , such as rate brackets and standard deductions , are indexed , while others ( such as child credits ) are not . over time , as prices rise , a fixed exemption causes more estates to be subject to tax . without indexation , congress may return from time to time to reconsider the exemption . a final issue is the potential carryforward of an unused estate tax exemption to the surviving spouse . the provision , adopted in recent legislation for 2011 and 2012 , would allow spouses to inherit unused estate tax exemptions .
