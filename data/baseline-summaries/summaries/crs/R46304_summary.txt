 ) , the president has wide authority over the collection of corporate activity abroad for statistical and analytic purposes . what supply lines are available to the united states ? what is current baseline u.s. production capacity and what is u.s. production capacity in the event an administration invokes the defense production act ( dpa ) ? what control do chief executive officers of u.s. companies or the u.s. government have over u.s. corporate facilities and operations that are nationalized in china ? what happens if the united states hardens its own borders ? what happens if u.s. allies and partners are in crisis and turn to national tools and approaches ? what are u.s. dependencies on china in other critical areas such as microelectronics ? congress faces a series of interrelated questions about whether and how to calibrate trade policy to best position the united states in the current crisis and beyond . in response to a u.s. investigation of china's unfair trading practices under section 301 , since 2018 , the united states has imposed a series of tariffs and china has responded with a series of counter tariffs that now affect a majority of trade between the two countries . temporary tariff relief for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals could incentivize imports for the united states and other markets , but tariff policy cannot address the deeper issues of supply shortages , export constraints imposed by a number of countries including china , and product certification requirements in the united states and other markets . tariff liberalization has been insufficient to address industrial policies within borders such as regulatory standards , procurement terms , and local content requirements that china and others impose in a range of sectors including pharmaceuticals and medical equipment . recent actions by countries around the world to impose export barriers highlight potential gaps and limits to the power of wto rules prohibiting export bans during times of global crisis . these actions also raise questions about what new rules or protocols might be needed in the future . liberalization of u.s. import requirements also created some of the challenges the united states is facing now , such as loosening requirements for u.s. pharmaceutical firms to report on shortages and how they classify imported content for finished products that qualify as u.s. products . new liberalization could reward chinese industrial policies in medical equipment and pharmaceuticals that seek to win new ground for chinese firms in overseas markets . the potential for china to overwhelm global markets as it leans on exports for economic recovery raise questions about whether additional policy measures might be needed . rather than waiting until market injury has already occurred to seek damages , for example , congress may want to be watching trade patterns for signs of import surges and oversee the administration's potential use of safeguard measures . similar to the australian government's decision on march 29 , 2020 to impose new temporary restrictions on all foreign investment proposals out of concern that strategic investorsâparticularly those of chinese originâmight target distressed assets , congress may want to carefully monitor or consider whether to impose requirements about potential predatory commercial activity in the united states .
