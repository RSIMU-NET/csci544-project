these revenue losses are significant . all three studies also reported effects after macroeconomic feedback . none of the revenue estimates reflects the elimination of the border adjustment , which is estimated to add $1.2 trillion to the ten year cost . the tpc estimates a revenue loss of $3,100.9 billion for the first 10 years and $2,225.6 billion for the second 10 years . if the affordable care act taxes are excluded , the cost is $2,297.6 billion in the first 10 years and $795.6 billion in the second 10 years . ( the repeal of these taxes cost $803.1 billion in the first 10 years and $1,430.0 billion in the second 10 years. ) of these , the individual income tax costs are $1,219.0 billion in first 10 years and $303.9 billion in second 10 years , or less than half . structural elements ( rates , standard deduction , itemized deductions , personal exemptions , child and dependent credits , and alternative minimum tax ) are close to revenue neutral , losing $95.9 billion in first 10 years but gaining $202.4 billion in the second 10 years . these results are consistent with the findings of limited changes from current law in the previous section on distribution and horizontal equity . most of the losses on the individual side are from the treatment of business and investment income . the maximum tax rate on business income and expensing plus the disallowance of net interest deductions loses $1,050.3 billion in first 10 years and $221.9 billion in the second 10 years . the timing difference reflects the pattern of expensing whose revenue loss ( assuming depreciation on existing assets is continued ) loses significant revenue initially and then a smaller amount over time , plus the disallowance of net interest deductions , which gains more revenue over time as more loans are covered . the more generous treatment of capital gains , dividends , and interest results in losses of $497.8 billion in the first 10 years and $848.6 billion in the second 10 years . tpc also includes other tax expenditures assumed at a gain of $385.2 billion in the first 10 years and $515.7 billion in the second 10 years . corporate revenue losses are $890.7 billion in the first 10 years and $192.5 billion in the in second 10 years . as with the case of business income , the significant decline in revenue loss over the two periods is due to the pattern of expensing and disallowance of net interest deductions . there is also a small offset from the deemed repatriation of foreign source income ; without that one - time gain , the loss in the first 10 years would be $1,062.4 billion . the border adjustment accounts for a significant offset to loses , gaining $1,179.6 billion in the first 10 years and $1,689.3 billion in the second 10 years . the estate and gift tax repeal costs $187.4 billion in the first 10 years and $299.1 billion in the second 10 years .
