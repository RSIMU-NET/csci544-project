those perceptions have changed somewhat under president bolsonaro . whereas the past several brazilian administrations sought to maintain autonomy in foreign affairs , bolsonaro has called for close alignment with the united states . within latin america , for example , the bolsonaro administration has adopted a more confrontational approach toward cuba and has closely coordinated with the trump administration on measures to address the crisis in venezuela . the bolsonaro administration also has expressed support for controversial u.s. actions outside the region , such as the killing of iranian military commander qaasem soleimani . bolsonaro's realignment of brazilian foreign policy has been controversial domestically , with some analysts arguing it has not resulted in many concrete benefits for brazil . they note , for example , that the trump administration maintainedâand threatened to imposeâtrade barriers on key brazilian exports , such as beef and steel , despite having signed several bilateral commercial agreements during bolsonaro's official visit to the white house in march 2019 ( see " recent trade negotiations " ) . likewise , u.s. officials reportedly have warned brazil that the closer defense ties implied by president trump's designation of brazil as a major non - nato ally could be in jeopardy if brazil allows chinese telecommunications company huawei to participate in brazil's 5g cellular network ( see the " defense cooperation " section ) . some brazilian analysts also argue that abandoning the country's commitment to autonomy in foreign affairs has weakened brazil's international standing and caused tensions in its relations with other important partners , such as fellow members of the brics ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) group . there does not appear to be public support for the trump administration's foreign policy within brazil ; in 2019 , 60% of brazilians expressed no confidence in president trump to "do the right thing regarding world affairs. scientific studies have found that the amazon plays an important role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing and sequestering carbon . although findings vary , one recent study estimated the forest absorbs 560 million tons of carbon dioxide per year and its biomass holds 76 billion tons of carbonâan amount equivalent to seven years of global carbon emissions . the amazon also pumps water into the atmosphere , affecting regional rainfall patterns throughout south america . an estimated 17% of the amazon basin has been deforested , however , and some scientists have warned that the forest may be nearing a tipping point at which it is no longer able to sustain itself and transitions to a drier , savanna - like ecosystem . efforts to conserve the forest often focus on brazil , since the country encompasses about 69% of the amazon basin . within brazil , the government has established an administrative zone known as the legal amazon , which includes nine states: acre , amapã¡ , amazonas , maranhã£o , mato grosso , parã¡ , rondã´nia , roraima , and tocantins ( see figure 1 ) . although rainforest covers most of the legal amazon , savanna ( cerrado ) and wetlands ( pantanal ) are present in portions of the region .
