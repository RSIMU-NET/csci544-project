table 5 . effects of alternative tax cuts on tax liability , 2000 , joint returns , two children source: crs calculations , assumes itemized deductions equal to 18.8% of income , all income is ordinary income . does not incorporate the alternative minimumtax . the percentiles correspond to adjusted gross incomes of $27,000 , $49,000 , $75,000 , $126,000 , $180,000 and$500,000 , based on treasury data . table 6 provides a measure of relative equality by examining the percentage change in disposable income . the 10% cut in rates clearly redistributes after taxincome to favor high income individuals . the equal percentage point tax cut also redistributes income to favorhigher income individuals , although not to thedegree of the 10% tax cut . extending the 15% bracket also tends to make incomes more equal except at extremelyhigh incomes . only the 3.8 percentage pointcut in the lowest rate tends to favor middle and lower income individuals . note that no change ( short of increasinga refundable credit ) could have a larger effecton the half - median ( 25th percentile taxpayer ) because their tax liability is eliminated by the rate cut ( because of the $1000 in child credits ) . table 6 . percentage change in after tax income , alternativetax proposals , 2000 , joint returns , twochildren source: crs calculations , assumes itemized deductions equal to 18.8% of income , all incomeis ordinary income . does not incorporate the alternative minimumtax . the percentiles correspond to adjusted gross incomes of $27,000 , $49,000 , $75,000 , $126,000 , $180,000 and$500,000 , based on treasury data cited earlier . data on taxes other than income taxes are also taken from treasury estimates cited earlier . what sort of income tax cut would be required to be neutral with respect to the distribution of disposable income ? increases in the standard deduction coupledwith an equal percentage increase in rates would probably be most likely to accomplish this effect althoughindividuals that are excluded from the tax wouldrequire an increase in a refundable credit ( such as the earned income tax credit ) . rate cuts that reduce lower bracketrates by larger percentage points that higherbracket rates would also tend to be more neutral across the income classes . it can also be difficult to evaluate a tax cut that simultaneously changes rates and brackets and does not change them in a proportional way . for example , theproposal of president bush would substitute a rates of 10 , 15 , 25 and 33 for the existing brackets of 15 , 28 , 31 , 36and 39.6 . however , the 10% bracket ( cuttingthe 15% bracket by a third , or five percentage points ) would apply to only the first $12,000 ( about a fourth ) of theexisting 15% bracket ; remaining income in thatbracket would receive no tax cut . however , the coverage of the tax wasprojected to be rising due to the expiring of provisions allowing personal credits to offset the amt and the continualerosion of the amt exemption . currently,1.3% of taxpayers are projected to fall under the amt in 2000 , although over 15% of taxpayers in the $100,000 to$200,000 income class are amt taxpayers .
