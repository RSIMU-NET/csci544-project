examples of these proposals are described below . table 2 provides summary information on these proposals . the house and senate versions of the postal service protection act of 2013 ( h.r . 630 and s. 316 ) both included a proposal to alter the allocation of costs of csrs benefits for individuals with service under both uspod and usps . 630 and s. 316 would have required opm to use final high - three pay rather than 1971 salary in calculating the federal government's portion of these csrs benefits . any surplus created by this reallocation of csrs costs would have been transferred to the postal service retiree health benefit fund and the postal service fund . several proposals would have provided usps a refund of the fers overpayment: the house version of the postal service protection act of 2013 ( h.r . 630 ) , would have refunded any usps fers overpayment for fy2010 . the senate version postal service protection act of 2013 ( s. 316 ) , would have refunded any usps fers overpayment for fy2013 . the united states postal service stabilization act of 2013 ( h.r . 961 ) and the innovate to deliver act of 2013 ( h.r . 2690 ) would have refunded any usps fers overpayment in any fiscal year that a surplus occurred . the postal reform act of 2013 ( h.r . 2748 ) would have refunded any usps fers overpayment in any fiscal year that a surplus occurred minus any usps csrs and other federal retirement liabilities . the postal reform act of 2013 ( s. 1486 ) would have refunded any usps fers overpayment for fy2013 and future years . the united states postal service stabilization act of 2013 ( h.r . 961 ) and the innovate to deliver act of 2013 ( h.r . 2690 ) would have required opm to calculate the dynamic normal costs of usps fers benefits separately for usps employees . the postal reform act of 2013 ( h.r . gao has also concurred with this assessment . in general , usps's fers overpayment is a result of the significantly different composition of usps's fers workforce compared with fers employees in the rest of the federal workforce . that is , the dynamic normal cost of fers benefits for usps employees is less than the dynamic normal cost of fers benefits for fers employees in the rest of the federal workforce . currently , opm uses the same demographic assumptions to calculate the dynamic normal costs for all fers employees â€” without distinguishing between the characteristics of usps and non - usps employees . current opm estimates using the same demographic assumptions for all fers employees , including usps employees , yield a usps fers overpayment of about $3 billion as of fy2012: according to the most recent actuarial estimate received from opm , the postal service had overfunded its fers obligations by $2.6 billion at september 30 , 2011 , the latest actual data available . the reduction in the estimated surplus from amounts previously reported resulted primarily from changes to government - wide economic and demographic assumptions made by opm , as well as actual fiscal year 2011 experience .
