fema , the u.s . the three larger islandsâst . croix , st. thomas , and st. johnâare home to nearly all of the roughly 105,000 people living in the u.s. virgin islands . the usvi capital , charlotte amalie , is located on st. thomas , which is the primary center for tourism , government , finance , trade , and commerce . the virgin islands national park covers about two - thirds of the island of st. john , which is located to the east of st. thomas . st. croixâsituated approximately 40 miles south of st. thomas and st. johnâis the agricultural and manufacturing center of the usvi . the u.s. virgin islands also includes a fourth smaller islandâwater islandâas well as many other smaller islands and cays . the british virgin islands ( bvi ) are , by and large , east and slightly north of the u.s. virgin islands . the southern shore of tortola , the largest island in bvi , is less than two miles north of the northern shore of st. john , usvi . on his second voyage to the caribbean in november 1493 , admiral christopher columbus and his crew reached the archipelago of the lesser antillesâthe string of islands ranging southeast from puerto rico . as his ships sailed northwest toward puerto rico , they encountered one larger island , which columbus named santa ursula , and saw to the north what they thought were at least 40-odd other islands , which were called "las once mil vã­rgenes. santa ursula , now known as st. croix , was described as "very high ground , most of which was bare , the likes of which no one had seen before or after. over time those islands became known as the virgin islands . in the decades following columbus's voyages , the spanish crown had nearly sole control over all trade and navigation in the caribbean . by the mid - 1500s , merchants and privateers from france , england , and holland moved into the region to trade with colonists who chafed at the high prices and narrow restrictions of spanish imperial rules . spanish galleons returning to spain with goods and gold provided an additional motivation to privateers and pirates . the spanish shifted much of their settlements and operations to the south american mainland and to the larger caribbean islands , where resources were easier to exploit and defenses were easier to mount . the smaller islands to the east in the lesser antilles were thus largely left to others . control of many of those islands , including the virgin islands , shifted back and forth among european powers , as peace treaties settled in europe seldom applied in the new world . in 1672 , the royal danish west indian company ( det kongelige octroyerede danske vestindiske compagnie ) took control of st. thomas and set up plantations . the company expanded to st. john ( then st. jan ) in 1718 and then purchased st. croix from france in 1733 . sugar production and export was the primary economic sector during the period of danish colonial control , although cotton , tobacco , indigo , and other products were also exported .
