the federal government has no juvenile justice system of its own . instead , starting in the 1960s , the federal government began establishing federal juvenile justice entities and grant programs in order to influence the states' juvenile justice systems . eligibility for some of these grant programs is tied to certain mandates that the states must adhere to in order to receive federal funding . this report provides a brief overview of the juvenile justice grant programs and the overall appropriation administered by the department of justice's ( doj's ) office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) . the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act ( jjdpa ) was first passed by congress in 1974 and was most recently reauthorized in 2002 by the 21 st century department of justice appropriations authorization act . the jjdpa's provisions are currently unauthorized , having expired in fys 2007 and 2008 , although congress continues to provide appropriations for some of the act's activities . the jjdpa as originally enacted had three main components: it created a set of institutions within the federal government that were dedicated to coordinating and administering federal juvenile justice efforts ; it established grant programs to assist the states with setting up and running their juvenile justice systems ; and it promulgated core mandates that states had to adhere to in order to be eligible to receive grant funding . while the jjdpa has been amended several times over the past 30 years , it continues to feature the same three components . the jjdpa has been a primary channel through which the federal government provides juvenile justice funding to the states ; nonetheless , other congressionally authorized and administratively established programs , administered by ojjdp , have contributed to the overall package of federal juvenile justice funding . the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l . 112-55 ) provided $262.5 million for juvenile justice programs . of this $262.5 million , $138 million was for jjdpa programs . additionally , more than 25% of the juvenile justice program funding provided for fy2012 was designated for activities that had not been funded previously under the juvenile justice programs account ( including funding for missing and exploited children programs , child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and practitioners , and grants and technical assistance in support of the national forum on youth violence prevention ) . the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 ( p.l . 113-6 ) provided $279.5 million for juvenile justice programs for fy2013 . of note , section 3001 of the act provided for a series of rescissions of fy2013 budget authority . after applying these rescissions and the sequestration ordered by president obama on march 1 , 2013 , doj reports that juvenile justice programs were funded at nearly $261.0 million for fy2013 . juvenile justice funding continued to decline in fy2014 ; through the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l . 113-76 ) , congress appropriated $254.5 million for juvenile justice programs . one notable change to the juvenile justice funding pattern was an elimination of jabg funding in fy2014 . funding for juvenile justice programs dropped again in fy2015 ; through the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .
