as peacekeeping operations have become ongoing , congress has switched to using regularappropriations . examining the funding patterns for combat operations in the first gulf war , somalia , haiti,kosovo , afghanistan , and operation iraqi freedom shows they were all funded initially withsupplemental appropriations . thus , although supplementalappropriations were not used to fund the united states' initial involvement in bosnia , congress didturn to supplemental appropriations to fund combat and later peacekeeping operations after the initialhumanitarian airlift . table 1 suggests that in the past decade , congress generally has funded combat operations withsupplemental appropriations and ongoing peacekeeping operations with regular appropriations . eachoperation , however , has gone through an interim period of initial post - combat peacekeeping in whichcongress has used different combinations of supplemental and regular appropriations . others prefer supplementals due to theunpredictability of military and peacekeeping circumstances in iraq and afghanistan . thisunpredictability , they argue , makes it extremely difficult to estimate the costs of either type ofoperation in advance . this report examines 46 cases since fy1990 in which congress approved funding for combat or peacekeeping operations using regular appropriations , supplemental appropriations , or acombination of the two . table 1 shows that since 1990 , congress generally has funded combatoperations with supplemental appropriations . in initial post - combat peacekeeping operations,however , congress has tended to rely on a combination of supplemental and regular appropriations . in each case , the president requested supplemental funding shortlyafter operations were underway , and congress approved the requests within months . the only exception to this pattern is bosnia , where united states' involvement began in 1993 with a humanitarian airlift . dod funded this airlift using resources previously appropriated bycongress in fy1993 regular appropriations . ( 2 ) infy1995 , when the united states first launchedairstrikes in support of u.n. peacekeepers , dod used a combination of supplemental appropriationsand fy1995 regular appropriations to fund combat operations . according to the president , the united states concluded major military operations inafghanistan in december , 2001 and in iraq on may 1 , 2003 . ( 3 ) except for funds appropriated forafghanistan in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution , both operations have beenfunded to date using supplemental appropriations , including the recently enacted fy2004supplemental . although the president has declared the end of major combat in both operations , lowintensity conflict is still prevalent , making it unclear whether iraq and afghanistan can yet bereferred to as ongoing peacekeeping operations . going forward , congress might designate a pointat which an operation becomes ongoing , and thus merits funding in the regular appropriationsprocess . table 1: methods of funding for wars and contingency operations , first persian gulf war to operation iraqi freedom notes: please note that certain operations,such as operation desert shield , were funded more thanonce in the same fiscal year . an asterisk indicates that dod covered some of the cost by using existing resources thatwere originally programmed for other purposes . sources: this table was conceived of and partially assembled by [author name scrubbed] and nina serafino of crs , using the cited public laws and corresponding congressional reports .
