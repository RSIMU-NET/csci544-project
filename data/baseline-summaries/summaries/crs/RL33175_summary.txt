( 2 ) the differences in approach across the bills fall into three areas: attempts to ensure thatimported drugs are safe and effective ; attempts to influence industry behavior so drugs are availablefor import by u.s. consumers at cost savings to current domestic prices ; and administrativearrangements . impetus to amend current law goes beyond the concern with drug safety . even were thesecretary to issue the certification necessary to begin the drug importation section in the ffdca,many analysts and members of congress anticipate manufacturer resistance . the vitter - gutknechtand dorgan - emerson bills contain specific provisions designed to influence industry behavior ; thegregg - bradley bills do not . the timing and funding of importation activities vary across current law and the proposedbills . the following table arrays the prescription drug importation provisions of current law andthe three pairs of proposed bills , with the columns ordered chronologically based on the date ofenactment or introduction . organized by topic , the rows do not directly follow the order ofprovisions in any of the compared documents . current law bars importation unless the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) certifies that imports are safe and offers cost savings to u.s. consumers . congress reaffirmed thisrequirement , first established by the medicine equity and drug safety ( meds ) act of 2000 , mostrecently in the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act ( mma , p.l.108-173 ) in december 2003 . the three bill pairs each would eliminate this requirement and , instead,include other potential safeguards regarding drug safety and effectiveness . they all would actprimarily by replacing or amending section 804 of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) , which had been initially added to the ffdca by the medicine equity and drug safety ( meds ) act of 2000 ; individual bills would amend other laws . this report compares the provisions of three approaches to prescription drug importation ( represented by three senate and three house bills ) with provisions on the subject in currentlaw .
