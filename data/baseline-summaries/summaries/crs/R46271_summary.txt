115-141 , and is in effect through 2021 . for more information on the lihtc , see crs report rs22389 , an introduction to the low - income housing tax credit , by mark p. keightley . the provision was enacted in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l . prior to the 2017 tax revision ( the tax cuts and jobs act , p.l . 115-97 ) , the deduction for net interest was limited to 50% of adjusted taxable income ( income before taxes ; interest deductions ; and depreciation , amortization , or depletion deductions ) for firms with a debt - equity ratio above 1.5 . interest above the limitation could be carried forward indefinitely . the revision limited deductible interest to 30% of adjusted taxable income for businesses with gross receipts greater than $25 million . although no rationale was provided when the credit was introduced , sponsors of earlier freestanding legislation and industry advocates indicated that the purpose was to encourage the rehabilitation , rather than the abandonment , of short - line railroads . these railroads were spun off in the deregulation of railroads in the early 1980s . advocates also indicated that this service is threatened by heavier 286,000-pound cars that must be used to connect with longer rail lines . under prior law and the temporary provisions of the 2017 tax revision , this interest limit applies to earnings ( income ) before interest , taxes , depreciation , amortization , or depletion ( referred to as ebitda ) . after 2021 , the 2017 tax revision changes the measure of income to earnings ( income ) before interest and taxes ( referred to as ebit ) . because ebit is after the deduction of depreciation , amortization , and depletion , it results in a smaller base and thus a smaller amount of eligible interest deductions . the temporary broader base ( ebitda ) , which expires in 2021 , allows more interest deductions . the current , more generous rules for measuring the adjusted taxable income base are more beneficial to businesses with depreciable assets , although affected businesses might be able to avoid some of the change in the deduction rules by leasing assets from financial institutions , such as banks , that generally have interest income . this change in base is projected to have a significant revenue consequence: the joint committee on taxation estimated the revenue gain from the provision to increase from $19.2 billion in fy2021 to $30.2 billion in fy2023 , when the change is fully in effect , an increase of more than $10 billion . this revenue change suggests the cost of allowing the broader measure of income ( ebitda ) through 2021 is around $10 billion annually . for additional discussion of the interest limitation , see crs report r45186 , issues in international corporate taxation: the 2017 revision ( p.l . 115-97 ) , by jane g. gravelle and donald j. marples . under permanent law , the excise tax on rum is $13.50 per proof gallon and is collected on rum produced in or imported into the united states .
