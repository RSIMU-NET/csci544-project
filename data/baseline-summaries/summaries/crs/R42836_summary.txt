the corps has broad constitutional authority for its water projects . the supreme court historically has held that the corps' authority derives from the commerce clause and the significant interest in promoting navigation throughout the nation's waterways . the court has stated that if a particular project serves a purpose of navigation , "it is constitutionally irrelevant that other purposes may also be advanced. it has cited other valid purposes such as flood control , watershed development , and "recovery of the cost of improvements through utilization of power" as examples of the breadth of federal authority over waters . thus , a state's authority over its waters is "subject to the power of congress to control the waters for the purpose of commerce. accordingly , if congress authorizes the corps to impound water at one of its projects for purposes related to commerce , the federal authority over the water supersedes the state's authority for those purposes . notwithstanding this broad authority , congress historically has deferred to states' authority regarding allocation , as discussed in later sections of this report . in addition to the corps' general constitutional authority , congress has provided statutory authority for specific actions by the corps related to m&i water supplied at its projects . under the wsa , the corps may include permanent storage space at its projects for municipal and industrial use , even if such a purpose was not originally authorized . under the 1944 fca , the corps may contract with other government or private parties for the temporary use of surplus water from its projects . states in the missouri river basin have objected to the corps' plan to charge a fee for surplus water stored at its reservoirs . states have argued that maintaining surplus water supply in the federal reservoir and charging citizens for the right to access that water which otherwise would be available through natural flow of the river violates their legal right to state waters . north dakota , in which lake sakakawea is located , has asserted ownership of the waters flowing within the state boundaries , claiming that charging for access to that water while it is stored in a corps' project violates that legal right . the u.s. supreme court has long held that a state owns the navigable waters within its borders . in 1842 , the court explained that when the united states was formed , "the people of each state became themselves sovereign ; and in that character hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common use , subject only to the rights since surrendered by the constitution to the general government. under the constitutional equal footing doctrine , states that later joined the union acquired the same rights granted to the original states , and therefore also acquired ownership of their state's navigable waters upon achieving statehood . thus , the missouri river basin states may claim the right to waters within their state boundaries since their admission to the union .
