each issue is discussed below . in january 2007 , representative mike ross introduced h.r . 462 , the emergency amateur radio interference protection act . on august 4 , 2007 , the house of representatives passed h.r . 3221 , the new direction for energy independence , national security , and consumer protection act . if signed into law , section 9113 ( a ) ( 8 ) would require an assessment by a newly established grid modernization commission to determine , biannually , the progress being made toward modernizing the electric system , including an "assessment of ancillary benefits to other economic sectors or activities beyond the electricity sector , such as potential broadband service over power lines. crs report rl33542 , broadband internet regulation and access: background and issues , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl32728 , electric utility regulatory reform: issues for the 109 th congress , by [author name scrubbed] . american public power association , http: / / www.appanet.org american radio relay league , http: / / www.arrl.org edison electric institute , http: / / www.eei.org federal communications commission , http: / / www.fcc.gov / fcc noi: http: / / hraunfoss.fcc.gov / edocs_public / attachmatch / fcc - 03-100a1.pdf fcc nprm: http: / / hraunfoss.fcc.gov / edocs_public / attachmatch / fcc - 04-29a1.pdf national telecommunications and information administration , http: / / www.ntia.doc.gov / united power line council , http: / / www.uplc.org united telecom council , http: / / www.utc.or . "how broadband over powerlines works," robert valdes , http: / / computer.howstuffworks.com / bpl.htm / printable ( undated ) . such underestimation increases the risk of interference . according the report , as currently applied to bpl systems , part 15 measurement guidelines do not address the unique characteristics of bpl emissions . overall , the report concludes that bpl could interfere with licensed radio spectrum , even though under the current part 15 testing parameters , emission levels would be within the limits . this bill was referred to the house committee on energy and commerce . no further action has been taken . in june 2007 , senator mark pryor introduced s. 1629 , which contains the same study requirements as h.r . that bill was referred to the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation . therefore , it was recommended that the compliance measurement procedures be refined . the ntia stated , however , that refining the compliance measurement procedures should not impede deployment of bpl because the technology can reportedly be deployed within a more narrow range of frequencies that will not cause interference . for these reasons , the ntia did not recommend that the fcc relax part 15 field strength limits for bpl systems . instead , ntia recommended new measurement provisions derived from existing guidelines , including using measurement antenna heights near the height of power lines ; measuring at a uniform distance of 10 meters from the bpl device and power lines ; and measuring using a calibrated rod antenna or a loop antenna in connection with appropriate factors relating magnetic and electric field strength levels at frequencies below 30 mhz .
