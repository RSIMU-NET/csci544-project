no retrieval mission is currently planned . dr. michael griffin was sworn in as nasa administrator , replacing mr. o'keefe , on april 14 , 2005 . at his senate confirmation hearing on april 12 , 2005 , dr. griffin stated that he would revisit the question of whether to use the shuttle to service hubble after the second successful post - columbia shuttle flight , at which time nasa would be able to assess the risk factors associated with "essentially a new vehicle" . the nasa authorization act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-155 ) , enacted in december 2005 , called for a shuttle servicing mission after the shuttle returned to flight successfully "unless such a mission would compromise astronaut safety. the second post - columbia flight took place successfully in july 2006 . in october 2006 , nasa announced that a hubble servicing mission will indeed take place . the launch is now scheduled for october 8 , 2008 , on space shuttle atlantis . in october 2006 , administrator griffin stated that the "cradle to grave" cost of the servicing mission will be $900 million: $500 million to keep the hubble team together from 2004 through 2008 ; $200 million for the gyroscopes , batteries , and instruments that will be installed ; $100 million for external tanks and solid - rocket boosters for the additional shuttle flight ; and $100 million for shuttle launch processing . nasa expects that if the 2008 servicing mission is successful , hubble will continue to operate until 2013 , rather than being deorbited in 2010 as previously planned . according to one nasa official , "hubble's most impressive accomplishments ... lie in its future. the cost of the additional years of operation , however , may affect funding and scheduling for other astronomy missions . for example , to offset the funding that congress provided for hubble in fy2005 , nasa's may 2005 operating plan postponed two other astronomy missions and reduced funding for mars exploration . before the columbia accident , the end of hubble expenditures was expected to be a source of funding for the james webb space telescope . the shuttle system was immediately grounded . nasa established the columbia accident investigation board ( caib ) to determine the causes of the accident and recommend corrective actions . the final nrc report on servicing options , released on december 8 , 2004 , found it "unlikely that nasa will be able to extend the science life of [hubble] through robotic servicing" and that the risk of a shuttle mission to hubble is similar to the risk of a single shuttle mission to the iss . ( for more on the columbia accident , see crs report rs21408 , nasa ' s space shuttle program: the columbia tragedy , the discovery mission , and the future of the shuttle . ) it was quickly apparent that sm - 4 would be delayed . as the caib deliberated , nasa decided that the 2010 hubble retrieval mission was too risky compared to the benefits . on january 16 , 2004 , mr. o'keefe informed workers at stsci and nasa's goddard space flight center ( which built hubble and oversees stsci ) that he was canceling sm - 4 .
