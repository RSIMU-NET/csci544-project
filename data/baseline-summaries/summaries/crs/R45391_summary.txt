the time limits for probation are comparable . the court may set the term of probation for a juvenile under 18 years of age at no longer than the sooner of ( a ) the date on which the juvenile will turn 21 years of age ; or ( b ) five years ( or one year if the misconduct in an adult would be punishable by imprisonment for not more than five days ) . for juveniles between the ages of 18 and 21 , the limit is the shorter of ( a ) three years ; or ( b ) one year ( if the misconduct in an adult would be punishable by imprisonment for not more than five days ) . the adult mandatory and discretion condition statutes apply including the requirement that any discretion conditions involve only such deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably necessary to comply with statutory sentencing principles . the court may later revise or revoke a juvenile's probation and order the juvenile's detention for violation of his probation conditions . detention authority following revocation mirrors the court's initial detention authority with two exceptions . first , regardless of the juvenile's age at the time of revocation , the court is initially governed by the time limits that apply to the detention of juveniles between the ages of 18 and 21 . second , an individual who is 21 years of age or older may not be detained beyond the age of 23 , or beyond the age of 25 if the misconduct is punishable by imprisonment for 12 years or more . subject to those restrictions , when the misconduct that resulted in the delinquency determination would be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 years or more , the court may order a term of detention no longer than the shorter of ( i ) five years ; or ( ii ) the term at the top of the sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines that would apply had the juvenile been an adult . for less serious forms of misconduct , the limit is the shorter of ( i ) three years ; ( ii ) the term at the top of the sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines that would apply had the juvenile been an adult ; or ( iii ) the maximum term of imprisonment that would apply had the juvenile been an adult . when a court orders juvenile detention , it may also impose a term of juvenile delinquent supervision to be served after the individual's release from detention . juvenile delinquent supervision has its own time limits and its own set of conditions . the conditions are the same as those available when the court sentences a juvenile to probation . this solution suffered two unfortunate limitations . it did not account for juveniles charged with capital crimes . state law ordinarily excluded capital offenses from the jurisdiction of its juvenile courts . second , state juvenile courts had no jurisdiction over juveniles who lived , and whose misconduct occurred upon , indian reservations or military installations over which the state had no legislative jurisdiction . congress addressed these shortcomings with the federal juvenile delinquency act of 1938 .
