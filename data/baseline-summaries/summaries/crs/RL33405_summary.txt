there is a further complication in the senate . section 402 of the senate - passed budget resolution , s.con.res . 83 , ( 1 ) establishes the $872.8 billion cap on fy2007 discretionary funding , ( 2 ) exempts funding that is designated as "emergency" appropriations from the cap , but also , ( 3 ) sets a cap of $86.3 billion on emergency funding in fy2007 ( the total was reduced from $90 billion in a floor amendment ) . the fy2006 supplemental appropriations bill , h.r . 4939 "deems" all of these requirements to apply in the senate in the absence of a conference agreement on the budget resolution . this presents a problem for the appropriators , however , because costs of a later emergency fy2007 supplemental request for iraq and afghanistan , expected next february , together with costs of katrina - recovery and other disaster relief , bird flu preparations , border security , agricultural disaster relief , and other purposes , will almost surely exceed the cap by a substantial amount . it will still be possible to go ahead with emergency funding for these purposes , but only with offsetting rescissions of funds for costs that exceed the cap . as a result , the senate appropriations committee took a step to reduce the potential need for offsets by declaring only part of the funding for iraq and afghanistan in the bill as fy2007 emergency funding . within title ix of the bill , only funds in chapter 1 , military personnel , and chapter 2 , operation and maintenance , are designated as emergency funding exempt from the fy2007 caps . these chapters provide $42.1 billion of the $50 billion in title ix . funds in chapter 3 , procurement , chapter 4 , rdt&e , chapter 5 , revolving and management funds , and chapter 6 , related agencies , which provide $7.9 billion , are simply made available "on enactment" of the bill . the effect is to have these amounts scored as fy2006 rather than fy2007 money . this is the key point . the additional $7.9 billion in fy2006 funds will not trigger a point of order for exceeding fy2006 discretionary spending levels , since room remains under the fy2006 budget caps due to the $8 billion across - the - board cut in appropriations that congress made at the end of last year . aside from the overall budget issues , the senate appropriations committee version of the defense appropriations bill addresses a number of other key policy matters . the $9.1 billion of cuts in spending come mainly in operation and maintenance ( o&m ) , $3.8 billion , and in general provisions of the bill , $2.6 billion ( see table 3 above ) .
