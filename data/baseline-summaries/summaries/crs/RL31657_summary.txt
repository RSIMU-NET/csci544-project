appendix a . the mhpa does not apply to medicare . in 1999 , the general accounting office ( gao ) reviewed the extent to which employers were complying with the mhpa and how they had revised their health plans . gao surveyed 863 employers in 26 states without full parity laws . while 86% of the employers reported compliance with the mhpa , a majority of these plans ( 87% ) restricted their mental health coverage in other ways . for example , about two - thirds of mhpa - compliant plans covered fewer outpatient visits and hospital days for mental health treatment than for other medical treatment . surveys by the labor department and the centers for medicare & medicaid services found similar results . many plans that had to increase annual and lifetime dollar limits to comply with the mhpa reportedly introduced other more restrictive mental health design features to mitigate the financial impact of the law's more generous dollar limits . despite concerns about the mhpa's effect on claims costs , only 3% of employers surveyed by gao reported that their costs had increased , and less than 1% of surveyed employers dropped their mental health coverage altogether following the law's enactment . it is difficult to gauge the impact of the mhpa's increased dollar limits , however , because many plans took steps to counter increases in claims costs by restricting mental health coverage in other ways . though limited in its scope , the mhpa nevertheless appears to have added momentum to the passage of state parity laws . all states , except wyoming , have passed some form of parity legislation since the federal law was enacted in 1996 . some states passed parity laws that essentially mirrored the mhpa , and later strengthened the laws to exceed the provisions of the federal law . the mhpa originally sunset on september 30 , 2001 . in three separate legislative actions , the 107 th congress extended the mhpa through the end of 2003 . title vii of the fy2002 labor - hhs - education appropriations bill ( h.r . 107-116 ) reauthorized the mhpa in all three federal statutes through december 31 , 2002 . section 610 of the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 ( h.r . 107-147 ) further amended the mhpa provisions in the irc — but not in erisa or the phs act — by extending the authorization an additional year through december 31 , 2003 . finally , the mental health parity reauthorization act of 2002 ( h.r . 107-313 ) reauthorized the mhpa provisions in erisa and the phs act through december 31 , 2003 . the 108 th congress extended the mpha through the end of 2005 . first , the mental health parity reauthorization act of 2003 ( s. 1929 , p.l . 108-197 ) reauthorized the mhpa through december 31 , 2004 . the bill amended the mhpa provisions in erisa and the phs act , but not the irc . section 302 of the working families tax relief act of 2004 ( h.r . 108-311 ) reauthorized the mhpa through december 31 , 2005 . 108-311 amended the mhpa provisions in all three statutes .
