there was corroboration about their names . hozaifa parhat , one of the 22 uighurs who were in afghanistan until late 2001 then ended up at guantanamo by 2002 and whose name was placed in the landmark court case on whether to release them , readily told his combatant status review tribunal between 2004 and 2005 that he saw mahsum who was the leader at the uighur camp in afghanistan . parhat and some other uighur detainees also said that they heard of abdul haq . in 2004 , the deputy leader , abudula kariaji , said that etim had sent militants trained in small arms and explosives to china and had met in 1999 with osama bin laden , who allowed some uighurs to train in afghanistan but did not support their non - arab cause of over - throwing china's rule . in january 2008 , al qaeda in afghanistan issued a book on 120 "martyrs" that included five who were uighurs born in xinjiang and fought with the taliban in afghanistan . one of them was said to have died fighting u.s. military forces that launched attacks in 2001 . in 2003 , mehmet emin hazret , the leader of the east turkistan liberation organization ( etlo ) , another organization targeted by the prc's 2002 report as a "terrorist organization," denied that his group was responsible for violent incidents or had knowledge of an organization called etim , although he knew of its alleged leaders who had been in prc prisons . hazret also denied that etlo had links to al qaeda . nonetheless , he acknowledged that etlo would inevitably set up a military wing to target the prc government for its oppression of the uighur people . the prc's own report of 2002 on "east turkistan terrorists" claimed bombing incidents in xinjiang from 1991 to 1998 , with none after that year . that report did not discuss bombings outside of xinjiang or call those other violent incidents "terrorism. the report alleged that some "terrorist" bombings occurred in february to april 1998 and injured 11 people . however , there were no prc or non - prc media reports of such incidents in 1998 . moreover , xinjiang's party secretary wang lequan and chairman abulahat abdurixit said in beijing in early 1998 and 1999 that there were no major violent incidents in 1998 . in april 1998 , a prc official journal published a comprehensive report on crime , cited bombings in 1997 but none in 1998 , and stated that china had no terrorist organizations and had not been penetrated by any international terrorist groups . in may 1998 , xinjiang's vice chairman zhang zhou told foreign reporters that there was an explosion near kashgar earlier that year , but no one was killed or wounded . before august 2008 , the last bombing incident in xinjiang reported by prc and non - prc media occurred in 1997 , when three bombs exploded in three buses in urumqi on february 25 , 1997 , while two other undetonated bombs were found on two buses . many reports speculated that the deadly attacks were timed for the mourning period of prc paramount ruler deng xiaoping , who died on february 19 .
