corporation . a legally defined association of joint owners or shareholders that is treated as a single person for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits . this includes corporations , limited liability companies , and similar entities . most incorporated farm operations are family held . these three categories represent over 98% of u.s. farm operations ( table 1 ) . special rules exist for evaluating both the eligibility of and relevant payment limits for institutional and other exceptional types of potential legal entities . however , because of their small number ( less than 2% of u.s. farm operations ) and unique nature , they are not discussed further in this report . generally , program eligibility begins with identification of participants . identifying who or what is participating and therefore how payments may be attributed is the cornerstone to most farm program eligibility . to be eligible to receive any farm program payment , every person or legal entity — including both u.s. and non - u.s. citizens — must provide a name and address , and have either a social security number ( ssn ) in the case of a person , or a taxpayer identification number ( tin ) or employee identification number ( ein ) in the case of a legal entity with multiple persons having ownership interests . in this latter situation , each person with an interest must have a tin or ein and must declare an interest share in the joint entity using the requisite usda forms . all participants in programs subject to payment eligibility and payment limitation requirements must submit to usda two completed forms . the first , ccc - 901 ( members' information ) , identifies the participating persons and / or entities ( through four levels of attribution if needed ) and their interest share in the operation . the second form , ccc - 902 ( farm operating plan ) , identifies the nature of each person's or entity's stake — that is , capital , land , equipment , active personal labor , or active personal management — in the operation . these forms need be submitted only once ( not annually ) but must be kept current in regard to any change in the farming operation . critical changes to a farming operation might include adding a new family member , changing the land rental status from cash basis to share basis , purchasing additional base acres equivalent to at least 20% of the previous base , or substantially altering the interest share of capital or equipment contributed to the farm operation . this information is critical in determining the extent to which each person is actively engaged in the farming operation as described below . aef criteria are a required component of eligibility for payments under the principal revenue support programs of the 2018 farm bill , including the agriculture risk coverage ( arc ) and price loss coverage ( plc ) programs and benefits under the marketing assistance loan ( mal ) program .
