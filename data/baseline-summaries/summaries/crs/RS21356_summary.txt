110-252 , as amended ) . for tax year 2009 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 ยง1007 ) excluded the first $2,400 from income taxes . thus , the number of persons who had reportable unemployment insurance income was less than it would have otherwise been . during the 1970s , some policy studies had shown that the proportion of wages replaced by uc benefits on an after - tax basis was large enough to erode a claimant's work incentive . this meant that the amount of unemployment benefits reported as income for tax purposes in 2009 was less than it would have otherwise been under the permanent law income tax treatment of unemployment compensation . however , uc benefits of lower - income claimants remained untaxed because their total income was under the tax threshold ( i.e. the difference in the number of taxpayers reporting uc income in tax year 2010 as compared with 2009 was large , with an additional 3.6 million returns in 2010 . the difference in returns was attributable to both the increase of potential weeks of euc08 benefits available in 2010 ( p.l . 111-92 , enacted in november 2009 ) and the termination of the exclusion of the first $2,400 of uc income from income tax calculations . nationally , the number of unemployed persons began to decrease in 2011 and as a result this triggered a decrease in the number of weeks available for some extended unemployment benefits ( eb and euc08 ) as both programs incorporated automatic reduction mechanisms based upon unemployment rates . these reductions in the number of persons receiving benefits and the potential number of weeks of unemployment benefits were reflected in the decreased number of returns reporting unemployment benefits as well as reported amount . by 2013 , the number of returns containing uc income had decreased to 9.3 million , the lowest level since 2007 . 99-514 ) , effective for benefits received after december 31 , 1986 . although this action reversed the original policy of taxing uc benefits only above an agi threshold , it occurred in the context of a law that removed many low - income filers from the tax rolls , lowered the marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers , and expanded eligibility for the earned income credit . the rationale for full taxation of uc benefits was to treat uc benefits the same as wages and to eliminate the work disincentive caused by favorable tax treatment for uc benefits relative to wages . concern about claimants' cash flow problems caused by the lack of tax withholding from uc benefits arose during the 1990-1991 recession . 102-318 required states to inform all new claimants of their responsibility to pay income tax on uc benefits and to provide them with information on how to file estimated quarterly tax payments . 103-465 required states to withhold federal income tax from uc benefits if a claimant requested withholding , and permitted states to withhold state and local income taxes . 103-465 set the federal withholding rate at 15% of the gross benefit payment amount .
