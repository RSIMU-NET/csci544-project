these baselines differ in a number of ways . revenues are lower under the alternative baseline as it assumes an extension of the individual income tax provisions of p.l . 115-97 , which are scheduled to expire in 2026 under current law . in addition , noninterest spending is higher under the alternative baseline , which assumes limits on discretionary spending are not to take effect and the base for emergency spending is set at historical levels . under the alternative baseline , deficit reduction becomes more difficult because debt and interest payments have grown more quickly . the peter g. peterson foundation's 2015 fiscal summit ( solutions initiative iii ) brought together the american action forum , the american enterprise institute , the bipartisan budget center , the center for american progress , and the economic policy institute to develop specific , "scoreable" policy proposals that would place the federal budget on a sustainable long - term path . each plan provided a roadmap to reduce budget deficits and stabilize the debt , although they differed in the details . all of the plans aimed at reducing the debt - to - gdp ratio , but they varied in spending , taxes , and the deficit relative to output . for those plans in which measures were reported ( for 2040 ) , spending - to - gdp ratios ranged from 17.8% to 24.3% , whereas taxes - to - gdp ratios varied from 21.2% to 23.5% . there is also the issue of which generation bears the burden during the transition . the more the system relies on tax increases as opposed to benefit cuts in the short and medium term , the more the burden is shifted to younger generations . similar life - cycle arguments could be applied to any program for the elderly — including medicare and nursing home costs under medicaid — to the extent that the program's costs increase because of longevity . these programs are financed by a combination of payroll taxes and general revenues , but most of these taxes would be collected during most individuals' working years . cost increases for health care are a different matter , in part because they seem to be growing continuously and in part because they can be viewed in different ways . to the extent that rising costs reflect better medical care that extends and improves the quality of life , spending more money on health care may appropriately reflect preferences of individuals whose higher incomes permit them to spend more of their resources in this area . however , to the extent that rising medical costs reflect serious inefficiencies in the system arising from failure to allocate resources by price and causing patients and their physicians to consume large and inefficient amounts of health care , then increased benefits may not be justified . if benefits are to be largely maintained , and because it is relatively clear that cutting other forms of spending will probably not be adequate , what are the tax options ?
