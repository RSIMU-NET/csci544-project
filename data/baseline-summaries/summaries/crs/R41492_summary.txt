neither h.r . 5850 nor s. 3644 included funding for the president's transformation initiative . ( for an expanded discussion of transforming rental assistance , see crs report r41233 , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) : fy2011 appropriations . ) the administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative aimed at supporting economic development projects in distressed areas . the proposed catalytic competition grants program ( ccgs ) would use the statutory framework of the cdbg program . unlike cdbg funds , which are allocated to states and local governments by formula , the ccg program funds would be awarded competitively to local governments , nonprofit entities , or consortia of public , nonprofit , and for - profit entities , including local governments , states , and community development corporations . neither h.r . the remainder is contract authority . consequently , while the funding for thud in summaries of h.r . 1 is $52.4 billion , that represents a total funding level of $108.0 billion . 1 would cut dot funding by $8.5 billion below the fy2010 enacted level , though most of that reduction ( $6.2 billion ) would come from two programs: fra's high speed and intercity passenger rail ( hsipr ) program and fhwa's tiger ii grant program . hsipr would be cut by almost $5 billion ( rescinding virtually all of the $2.5 billion provided for fy2010 , and providing no funding for fy2011 ) . tiger ii would be cut by $1.2 billion ( rescinding the $600 million provided for fy2010 , and providing no funding for fy2011 ) . beside those , almost $1 billion would come from providing no funding for two fhwa grant programs for which no funding had been requested in the fy2011 budget request . the majority of dot programs would be funded at roughly their fy2010 level under h.r . the senate alternative , s.amdt . 149 , would cut dot funding by $3.1 billion below the fy2010 enacted level . half of that reduction would come from funding the hsipr program at $1.0 billion , the level requested in the fy2011 budget request , rather than the $2.5 billion it received in fy2010 . almost $1 billion would come from not funding the two fhwa earmarked programs for which no fy2011 funding was requested , and another $700 million would come from rescissions of prior year funding . other than the zeroing out of hsipr and tiger ii in h.r . 1 , the two proposals were relatively similar . see table 5 for details . continuing resolutions passed during march 2011 included reductions in some dot programs . see table 6 for details . table 7 presents funding provided for dot in the fy2010 thud appropriations act , and the amounts requested for fy2011 by the administration , provided by the house , and recommended by the senate committee on appropriations . the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) is the federal agency charged with administering a number of programs designed to promote the availability of safe , decent , and affordable housing and promote community development .
