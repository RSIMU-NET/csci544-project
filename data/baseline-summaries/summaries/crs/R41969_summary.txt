these issues are discussed in more detail below . the global economy has been reshaped over the past two decades . shifts in global shares of production and trade from advanced nations to a small group of developing countries , many located in asia , have been pronounced and dramatic . shifts in financial holdings and assets are also occurring , but at a slower rate . as a result of these changes , the global economy has seen the rise of more countries that can contribute to global growth and that have the resources to be important regional and global actors . whether these trends will continue over the next few decades remains unknown . most projections of the shift in global economic power are based on some assumptions about the future rates of growth of developed and developing countries . fiscally constrained developed countries are predicted by a number of economic forecasters to grow at rates that are three to five percentage points lower than developing countries . much could happen that would narrow this gap in growth rates , thus offsetting predicted outcomes . in the case of advanced countries , successful efforts at consolidation and reduction of public debt levels could instill investor confidence and unleash growth - creating , entrepreneurial activity that leads to higher than projected growth rates . in the case of developing countries , whose growth has been facilitated by access to export markets , capital , and technology , a rise in world - wide trade barriers could adversely affect their growth rates . most rising economic powers , which have grown by borrowing and adapting existing technology , may also have to become more successful at innovation if they are to continue on a rapid growth trajectory . moreover , many of these countries face formidable internal obstacles to growth , such as an aging work force , corruption , and political stability , that could easily alter projections for growth . regardless of future trends , the rise of many heavily populated developing countries to date has posed significant opportunities and challenges for u.s. economic interests . on the one hand , most economists view the transition of developing countries from low to higher levels of production and wealth as being a "win - win" situation and mutually advantageous . this view is that a larger world economic pie , combined with hundreds of millions of people in developing countries escaping poverty , is good for everyone via dramatic increases in world production and consumption . on the other hand , the rising economies have affected u.s. employment opportunities and incomes differentially , with more favorable impacts for highly educated workers . because many of these countries' governments play a large role in guiding market developments and corporate growth , there is also concern that the distribution of the benefits that are derived from international trade and investment flows may be distorted . shifts in relative economic power positions also raise broader questions concerning possible impacts on u.s. influence and leadership of the global economy .
