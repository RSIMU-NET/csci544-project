appendix a . discretionary spending and the budget control act of 2011 congress has taken a number of steps in recent years to limit federal discretionary spending . in april 2011 , lawmakers agreed to cuts in discretionary spending for a broad range of agencies and programs as part of negotiations to complete the fy2011 appropriations process and avert a government shutdown . four months later , as part of negotiations to raise the debt ceiling , congress and the president enacted the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ) . the bca established enforceable discretionary spending limits , or caps , for defense and nondefense spending for each of fy2012 through fy2021 , and provided for further annual spending reductions equally divided between the categories of defense and nondefense spending beginning in fy2013 . within each spending category , those further reductions are allocated proportionately to discretionary spending and mandatory spending , subject to certain exemptions and special rules . all the spending summarized in this report falls within the nondefense category . under the bca , spending reductions are achieved through two different methods: ( 1 ) sequestration ( i.e. , an across - the - board cancellation of budgetary resources ) and ( 2 ) lowering the bca - imposed discretionary spending caps . the office of management and budget ( omb ) is responsible for calculating the percentages and amounts by which mandatory and discretionary spending are required to be reduced each year , and for applying the relevant exemptions and special rules . the bca requires mandatory spending reductions to be executed each year through a sequestration of all nonexempt accounts . discretionary spending also was reduced through sequestration in fy2013 . however , for each of the remaining fiscal years ( i.e. , fy2014 through fy2021 ) , the annual reductions in discretionary spending required under the bca are to be achieved by lowering the discretionary spending caps by the total dollar amount of the required reduction . this means that the cuts within the lowered spending cap may be apportioned through the annual appropriations decisionmaking , rather than via an across - the - board reduction through sequestration . fy2013 sequestration nonexempt nondefense discretionary spending in fy2013 generally was subject to a 5.0% sequestration . fy2014-fy2017 nondefense discretionary spending caps table a - 1 shows the original nondefense discretionary ( ndd ) spending caps for fy2014-fy2017 established by the bca . for each of those four fiscal years , the bca required the caps to be lowered by approximately $37 billion to achieve the necessary reduction in ndd spending . however , the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( bba13 ) amended the bca by establishing new levels for the fy2014 and fy2015 ndd spending caps , and eliminating the requirement for those caps to be reduced . while the bba13 caps were set at a level that was lower than the original bca caps ( see table a - 1 ) , they were higher than the bca - lowered caps that they replaced . the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( bba15 ) further amended the bca by establishing new levels for the fy2016 and fy2017 ndd spending caps , and eliminating the requirement for those caps to be lowered .
