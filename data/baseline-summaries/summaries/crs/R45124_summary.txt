the credit amounts were indexed for inflation . the phaseout parameters of the child credit ( eg , phaseout thresholds of $400,000 married filing jointly , $200,000 other taxpayers , 5% phaseout rate ) apply to the family credit . this law made the egtrra changes to the child tax credit permanent and extended the $3,000 refundability threshold enacted as part of arra for five years , through the end of 2017 . the protecting americans from tax hikes ( path ) act of 2015 ( division q of p.l . 114-113 ) made the arra modification to the child tax credit — the $3,000 refundability threshold — permanent . in addition , the path act modified the taxpayer identification requirement for the credit to specify an id requirement for each child for whom the credit is claimed . specifically , a taxpayer claiming the credit must provide a valid taxpayer identification number ( tin ) for each qualifying child on their federal income tax return . all the modifications to the child tax credit and the new family credit are currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 . valid tins include individual taxpayer identification numbers ( itins ) , social security numbers ( ssns ) , and adoption taxpayer identification numbers ( atins ) . the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 ( jgtrra ; p.l . 108-27 ) temporarily accelerated the scheduled increase in the maximum credit amount . specifically , while egtrra increased the maximum credit amount to $600 per child for 2003 and 2004 , jgtrra increased this amount to $1,000 per child for those two years . in the summer of 2003 , the $400 increase in the credit for 2003 was paid in advance from the department of the treasury to many families who qualified for the child tax credit . these direct payments were distributed based on information contained on taxpayers' 2002 income tax returns . the jgtrra provisions were scheduled to expire after 2004 , and the child tax credit would have reverted to its scheduled level under egtrra — $700 per child in 2005 . in september 2004 , congress passed the working families tax relief act of 2004 ( wftra ; p.l . 108-311 ) , which further accelerated the implementation of key provisions of egtrra . this act extended the maximum amount of the credit established under jgtrra , $1,000 per child , through 2009 . for 2010 , the egtrra provisions would apply and the maximum amount of the credit would remain $1,000 per child . in addition , wftra increased the refundability rate to 15% for 2004 . itins are supplied solely so that noncitizens are able to comply with federal tax law , and do not affect immigration status . the law also required that the tin — for both the qualifying child and the taxpayer — be issued on or before the due date of the return . at the end of 2017 , congress passed the 2017 tax revision ( p.l . 115-97 ) which made numerous changes to the federal income tax for individuals and businesses , including temporarily expanding the child tax credit . these temporary changes to the child tax credit are summarized in table 1 .
