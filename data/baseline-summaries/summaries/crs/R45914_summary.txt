some policymakers have argued that current accountability provisions are inadequate . some have asserted that non - ihe - based programs in particular are not sufficiently scrutinized . others think that all teacher preparation programs should be subject to outcome measures beyond passage of certification exams and that programs should be judged by their graduates' professional readiness , ability to find employment , and retention in teaching , as well as the performance of their students . this section briefly describes the history of federal policy in this area . the hea , as amended by the heoa , addresses current k - 12 teacher issues through programs supporting the improvement of teacher preparation and recruitment . title ii of the hea authorizes grants for improving teacher education programs , strengthening teacher recruitment efforts , and providing training for prospective teachers . this title also includes reporting requirements for states and ihes regarding the quality of teacher education programs . title iv of the hea authorizes teacher education assistance for college and higher education ( teach ) grants to encourage more students to prepare for a career in teaching and student loan forgiveness for individuals teaching in certain high - need subjects . teachers may also be eligible for loan relief through the title iv public service loan forgiveness program . the 116 th congress is expected to consider reauthorizing the hea . thus far , numerous bills have been introduced to amend current law and address teacher recruitment and retention . this section discusses issues that may arise as the potential reauthorization process unfolds . the policy issues discussed here are based on existing and prior legislative proposals and are intended to provide some context for their consideration . these issues include modifying the title ii grant partnership structure , targeting support to specific teacher shortage areas or non - instructional staff , expanding teacher preparation program accountability requirements , reforming administration of the teach grant program , and expanding or consolidating teacher loan forgiveness programs . currently , ihes are a required partner in the tqp program and often serve as the sponsor of a partnership . with the rise of alternatives to traditional routes into the teaching profession , some proposals would eliminate the requirement that ihes be a partner by allowing non - ihe - based teacher preparation providers to serve as tqp grantee sponsors as well . current law defines a "partner institution" as a four - year ihe . policymakers may consider amending this definition to allow two - year ihes or other nonprofit teacher preparation programs to serve as a tqp partner institution or partnership sponsor . to be a partner in a tqp grant , leas and schools must be designated as "high - need" according to definitions in title ii of the hea . those definitions attempt to direct support , in part , toward low - income leas and schools . some feel the thresholds set by the hea are too low and that funds should be reserved for very low - income leas and schools . current federal teacher recruitment and retention programs often direct support to certain instructional areas that are considered hard - to - staff , such as mathematics , science , and special education .
