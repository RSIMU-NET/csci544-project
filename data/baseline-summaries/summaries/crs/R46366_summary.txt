this report focuses on db plans . table 2 shows the applicable minimum and maximum percentages under map - 21 , htf , and bba . figure 5 shows a hypothetical example of how segment rates are determined using the funding corridors . the red line shows the average of a segment's interest rates for the prior 25 years . the yellow and gold lines indicate the minimum and maximum rates around the 25-year average under the map - 21 provisions . the light green and dark green lines indicate the widening of the corridors around the 25-year average under the htf provisions ( starting in 2018 ) . the light blue and dark blue lines are the minimum and maximum rates around the 25-year averages in current law , as passed in the bba ( starting in 2021 ) . because of the htf and bba extensions , the minimum and maximum corridors have remained at 90% and 110% , respectively , since 2012 . subsequent legislation expanded this delayed effective date to certain charities . later legislation modified funding rules for these plans , referred to as cooperative and small employer charity ( csec ) pension plans . with two exceptions , csec plans are multiple - employer pension plans established by eligible cooperatives and certain charitable organizations to provide retirement benefits for their employees . ppa provided a delayed effective date of january 1 , 2017 , for certain multiple - employer cooperative plansâsuch as pension plans for agriculture , electric , and telephone cooperativesâto adopt the new funding rules . the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-192 ) extended ppa's delayed effective date to apply to certain charitable organizations' pension plansâmultiple - employer plans whose employers are charitable organizations described in 26 usc â§501 ( c ) ( 3 ) . the cooperative and small employer charity pension flexibility act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-97 ) established funding rules for and provided a definition of csec pension plans . among other provisions , this act permanently exempted these plans from ppa's funding rules and outlined minimum funding standards for csec plans . plans must indicate if they use the csec - specific funding rules in their required annual reporting to the department of labor ( dol ) . table a - 1 provides a list of csec plans and funded status in the 2017 plan year . section 3 of division p of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l . 113-235 ) expanded the definition of csec plans to include plans maintained by an employer that meet several criteria . it appears that the boy scouts of america master pension trust is the only plan that meets these expanded criteria . section 3609 of the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act ; p.l . 116-136 ) applies csec funding rules to plans sponsored by certain charitable employers "whose primary exempt purpose is providing services with respect to mothers and children," among other criteria . it appears that the pension plan sponsored by march of dimes is the only plan that meets these expanded criteria .
