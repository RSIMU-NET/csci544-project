tier i amounts are equivalent to social security benefits . tier ii amounts are increased annually by 32.5% of the social security cola . the surviving spouses ( and in some cases former spouses ) of railroad workers may be eligible to receive widow or widower annuities from rrb after the worker's death . rrb survivor annuities are generally higher than comparable social security benefits since families of railroad workers may be entitled to tier ii amounts as well as tier i amounts ( which are equivalent to social security benefits ) . at full retirement age , a surviving spouse may be eligible for up to 100% of the worker's rrb annuity ( or his or her own social security benefit , if higher ) . as early as age 60 ( or age 50 , if disabled ) , widows and widowers may receive a reduced annuity . at any age , a widow ( er ) caring for a deceased worker's child under age 16 may receive an annuity of up to 75% of the worker's tier i amount plus 100% of the worker's tier ii amount . the railroad retirement and survivors' improvement act of 2001 ( p.l . 107-90 , hereafter cited as "the 2001 law" ) was based on joint recommendations negotiated by railroad labor and management . the 2001 law increased initial annuities for the widow ( er ) s of qualifying railroad employees . other provisions in the 2001 law , which are not covered in this report , include ( 1 ) allowing railroad retirement funds to be invested in non - governmental assets ; ( 2 ) removing the early retirement reduction from tier i amounts for employees with 30 years of railroad experience who retire at age 60 or 61 ; ( 3 ) reducing the number of years required to be fully vested for tier ii annuities ; ( 4 ) repealing a maximum limitation on annuities ; and ( 5 ) phasing in changes to the tier ii tax structure . to see how widow ( er ) annuities are calculated under current law and prior law , consider a widow who has reached the full retirement age whose husband died in 2006 . this illustration is based on a hypothetical widow ; other widow ( er ) s' outcomes will vary . as shown in table 2 , the widow's initial annuity under prior law ( had it applied in 2006 ) would have been $1,150 ( $1,000 tier i and $150 tier ii ) . under current law , the widow's initial minimum amount would be $1,300 per month ( $1,000 tier i and $300 tier ii ) . her tier ii annuity under current law is composed of a regular tier ii amount of $150 as well as a guaranty amount of $150 ( each representing 50% of the tier ii annuity her husband would have received in 2006 ) . because of the addition of the guaranty amount to her regular annuity , her total annuity amount is $150 more than she would have received under prior law .
