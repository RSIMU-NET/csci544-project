the size of the privately owned fleet fluctuates . as of august 2015 , it was about the same size it was in 2000 , but in the intervening period it reached a peak of 107 ships in 2011 . during the first seven months of 2015 , 10 ships left and eight ships joined the fleet . a vessel cannot be transferred to a foreign flag without marad's approval unless it no longer receives msp subsidies or is being replaced with an equally capable vessel . ships joining the u.s. - flag international fleet would seek a "registry endorsement" from the u.s. coast guard , submitting documentation demonstrating u.s. ownership , among other things . over 30 of the u.s. - flag ships carrying preference cargoes ( about 40% of the fleet ) were built before 2000 . if preference cargoes were not available , they might be scrapped , as likely being too old to be attractive to a foreign - flag carrier . about 60% of the 80 ships in the fleet are controlled by u.s. entities owned by four large foreign shipping lines ( they are permitted as "documentation citizens," as explained below ) . the ships owned by these entities also make up the majority of the vessels receiving msp subsidies . the largest operator of u.s. - flag international vessels , maersk line , which also owns farrell lines , owns 27 u.s. - flag vessels . most of the u.s. owners not affiliated with a foreign parent company have small fleets under the u.s. flag . three of them have between five and seven ships each , and about a dozen companies have one or two u.s. - flag ships each . by contrast , the leading foreign - flag containership lines operate hundreds of containerships each , and the largest foreign - flag tanker operators own more than 100 ships each . information about the revenues and profits of u.s. - flag international maritime operations is not publicly available . however , it appears that the profitability of u.s. - flag international services is highly dependent on revenues from preference cargos , as many of the operators also use foreign - flag vessels to compete for commercial business . according to a marad study , "u.s. - flag carriers face a significantly higher cost regime than do foreign - flag carriers. this study found that a u.s. - flag containership in international trade , for example , has a daily operating cost that is more than twice that of a foreign - flag containership ( see table 1 ) . according to the study , the largest cost difference comes from higher wage costs for u.s. - flag containerships . several recent developments suggest that the volume of preference cargo may change in the coming years . u.s. food - aid policy has been increasing the use of cash payments and local or regional sourcing of food overseas , potentially reducing food - aid shipments from the united states . the drawdown of forces in iraq and afghanistan has reduced military shipments to these regions .
