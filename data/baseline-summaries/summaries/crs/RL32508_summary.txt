each has strengths andlimitations . ( 62 ) whileno serious observer would argue that u.s. isr requirements could be met by only one approach,many believe that there have been insufficient efforts to achieve an appropriate mix that providesoptimal collection capabilities while avoiding unnecessary duplication or wasted resources . satellite imagery has long been one of the most valuable tools of the intelligence profession . the need for to obtain accurate estimates of soviet military forces in the mid - 1950s led the unitedstates , in order to avoid highly dangerous overflights by conventional aircraft , to develop specialplanes that could fly at very high altitudes and ultimately to build reconnaissance satellites that couldidentify small objects from space . satellite imagery became the cornerstone of arms control effortsin the cold war and , coupled with the availability of precision guided munitions , became the keyto those post - cold war defense tactics that rely on highly selective targeting to destroy selectedtargets with minimal collateral damage . satellite programs are among the most expensive intelligence efforts , with individualsatellites costing a billion dollars each . the need to replace aging satellite programs led theintelligence community in the mid - 1990s to initiate the future imagery architecture ( fia ) programthat is intended to provide a greater number of smaller satellites that can provide coverage of moreregions for longer periods . fia has , however , received considerable criticism . in 1998 , the houseintelligence committee has concluded: for several years , the committee has been concernedwith the increasing costs of several major national reconnaissance office ( nro ) programs and thenrp's [national reconnaissance program through which the nro is funded] growing share of thenfip budget . not seeing any relief from the tight fiscal environment , the committee has sought tofind technological innovations and managerial reforms in the nrp that could reduce costs . this goallay behind the committee's push to shift to larger numbers of smaller satellites , which the committeethought also would provide better performance against hard targets , reduce satellite vulnerability,and help to counter foreign denial and deception practices . the committee , in summary , is not satisfied that allappropriate measures have been taken to reduce or control costs in the nrp or to adequately measurethe cost - effectiveness of all overhead collection activities . the committee believes that the dcineeds to exercise much more knowledgeable and diligent oversight of nro programs , with an eyeto freeing up funds for investment elsewhere , wherever possible . this oversight must extend fromrequirements tradeoffs , to cost estimating , to acquisition oversight . the dci also needs to acquirethe expertise necessary to make tradeoffs across the major nfip programs . the dci can no longerafford to rely on the major program managers to police their organizations and budgets . thecommittee has recommended additional funds for the dci to accelerate the development of thesecapabilities . ( 63 ) one media account in december 2002 reported that "the national reconnaissance office'snext - generation spy satellites , known as future imagery architecture , are more than a year delayedand almost $3 billion over cost , spurring an internal pentagon debate about whether to proceed withthe program at all , say people familiar with the discussions.
