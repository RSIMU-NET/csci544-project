in its report on h.r . 5136 , the house armed services committee noted that the air force could replace the lost aircraft by continuing to operate another fighter of the same type slated for retirement . the house - passed bill would have added to the budget $485 million to continue development of an alternate jet engine for the f - 35 . the senate committee's bill would not have provided additional funds for the second engine . the enacted version of the bill takes no specific position on the additional funding . the final bill did not include a senate committee provision that would have barred the expenditure of any additional funds for the alternate engine unless the secretary of defense certified that that project would reduce the life - cycle cost and improve the operational readiness of the f - 35 fleet while neither disrupting the plane's development program nor resulting in a reduction in the number of planes purchased . in a may 20 , 2010 , pentagon press conference , secretary gates reaffirmed his intention to recommend that president obama veto any defense bill that funded the alternate f - 35 engine . following are some highlights . the version of the fy2011 national defense authorization act passed may 28 by the house ( h.r . 111-491 ) would authorize $725.9 billion for dod and other defense - related activities , which is $2.7 million less than the administration requested . the version of the bill reported by the senate armed services committee on june 4 , 2010 , ( s. 3454 ; s.rept . 111-201 ) , would authorize $725.7 billion , a reduction of $240.7 million from the administration's request . the senate did not act on this version of bill , partly because of opposition to a provision that would have repealed a 1993 law ( 10 u.s.c . 654 ) that , in effect , had barred from military service those who are openly homosexual , establishing a policy colloquially referred to as "don't ask , don't tell. s. 3454 was set aside after the senate , on december 9 , 2010 , rejected a motion to invoke cloture on motion to begin consideration of the bill . the vote was 57-40 in favor of invoking cloture , which would have required 60 "yea" votes . members of the house and senate armed services committees subsequently negotiated a compromise version of the authorization bill ( h.r . 6523 ) , which dropped the provision relating to the "don't ask ; don't tell" policy which was cleared for the president on december 22 , 2010 , and signed by the president on january 7 , 2011 ( p.l . as is customary , h.r . 6523 authorized lump - sum totals to be appropriated for each several dozen appropriations accounts in the dod and energy department budgets ( table 11 ) . however , neither the text of the bill nor the accompanying joint explanatory statement included the customary funding tables allocating those totals among specific programs . following are highlights of h.r . 5136 as passed by the house , s. 3454 as reported by the senate armed services committee , and the final version of the authorization bill , h.r .
