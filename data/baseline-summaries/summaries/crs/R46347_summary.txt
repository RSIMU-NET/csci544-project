congress is also considering providing additional support . this report describes some of the actions that usda has taken in response to the covid - 19 emergency , including cfapâin particular , how cfap is funded and how usda intends to use the funds . the description of usda covid - 19 response efforts is preceded by: first , a brief review of food supply chain issues where the u.s. agricultural sector has experienced economic harm or is potentially vulnerable to the effects of the covid - 19 pandemic ; and second , a review of current assessments of the economic harm to u.s. farm income , as well as to individual commodity sectors , resulting from covid - 19 . the report then describes the emergency funds that have been allocated to address the u.s. agricultural sector , and how usda plans on using those funds , including a detailed description of cfap producer payments , and usda's food purchase and distribution efforts . this is followed by a review of the announced positions for selected u.s. agricultural stakeholders in regard to how the covid - 19 pandemic has affected their industries , what their anticipated losses might be , and what their expectations are vis - ã  - vis congressional funding and usda's announced program response . it is still too early to make any definitive statements about what the eventualâ economic impacts will be on the u.s. economy or the agricultural sector , since it is unknown how long the disease will persist and what shape the economic recovery might take . for example , will the overall impact be v - shaped with a quick outbreak followed by a quick recovery , or will it be l - shaped with an elongated tail representing a slow recovery and a gradual reopening of businesses and retail outlets ? or be w - shaped if the virus recycles and re - emerges later in the summer or fall in a more virulent formâas did the h1n1 pandemic in 2009 , or the 1918 flu pandemicâthus , causing a new round of shutdowns and economic closures ? this section reviews federal supplementary funding appropriated for assistance to the u.s. agricultural sector in response to the covid emergency , and the usda programs that were initiated with that supplementary funding . in addition to the supplementary funding , usda announced that it was increasing certain flexibilities and extensions in several of usda's farm programsâmany authorized by the 2018 farm bill ( p.l . 115-334 ) âas part of its effort to support the food supply chain . also , usda has established a "coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) " web page that assembles information from a broad range of agriculture - related topics and issues , including the expanded program flexibilities . the website includes "frequently asked questions ( faqs ) " for several prominent issues and agencies , links to additional resources , and a usda covid - 19 federal rural resource guide .
