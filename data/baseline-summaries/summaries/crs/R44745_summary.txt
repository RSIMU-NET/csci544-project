appendix a . timing rules and carryforwards of the adoption credit below is an illustrative example of how a taxpayer who incurs $20,000 in adoption expenses would claim the adoption tax credit using the carryforward . for simplicity , this example is a domestic private adoption ( i.e. , not a special needs nor a foreign adoption ) . in addition it is assumed that the taxpayer's income is below the phaseout amount , so he or she can claim the maximum credit . in 2012 , the taxpayer incurs $5,000 of expenses , but since the adoption is not finalized , the credit cannot be claimed on his or her 2012 income tax return . instead , the taxpayer must wait to file a 2013 tax return to apply these expenses toward claiming the credit . ( for domestic adoptions , if the adoption is not yet finalized , the expenses can be applied toward claiming the adoption tax credit the year after they are incurred. ) on a 2013 tax return , the taxpayer can apply expenses incurred in 2012 and claim up to a $5,000 tax credit for that year . however , in 2013 the taxpayer's income tax liability is $3,000 , so the actual amount of the adoption tax credit the taxpayer can claim in 2013 is $3,000 . the taxpayer can carry forward the difference of $2,000 . on the taxpayer's 2014 tax return , he or she can apply the $15,000 of expenses incurred in 2013 as well as the $2,000 in carried - forward expenses from the previous year , for a total of $17,000 of expenses . ( the $15,000 of expenses incurred in 2014 can be claimed on the taxpayer's 2014 return because the adoption is finalized in 2014. ) the maximum amount of the credit the taxpayer can claim in 2014 is $10,190 ( the statutory maximum minus the $3,000 of credit already claimed ) . as a result of the $3,000 tax liability in 2014 , the taxpayer will claim a $3,000 credit , and carry forward the difference of $7,190 . on a 2015 tax return , even though the taxpayer has incurred no additional expenses , he or she can apply the carried - forward expenses of $7,190 and continue to claim the credit . the maximum amount of the credit that can be claimed in 2015 is $7,400 ( the statutory maximum minus the $6,000 of credit already claimed ) . however , in 2015 the taxpayer's income tax liability is $4,000 , so the actual amount of the adoption tax credit the taxpayer can claim in 2015 is $4,000 . the taxpayer can carry forward the difference of $3,190 . the taxpayer can apply the carried - forward expenses of $3,190 and continue to claim the credit on a tax return in 2016 . the maximum amount of the credit that can be claimed in 2016 is $3,460 ( the statutory maximum minus the $10,000 of credit already claimed ) . in 2016 the taxpayer's income tax liability is $4,000 , so the actual amount of the adoption tax credit the taxpayer can claim in 2016 is $3,190 . the taxpayer has no additional carryforward . some of these options are discussed below .
