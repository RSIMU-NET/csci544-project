1 , and amended on apr . workers' rights — along with environmental conditions — will likely be prominent in the debates over both the jordan agreement and trade promotion authority . they are also likely to loom large in the debate over the merits of a bilateral textile agreement , which the u.s. and vietnam are likely to negotiate in the next year . many proponents of linking labor rights and trade agreements have argued that congress should not pass the bta until vietnam's labor conditions improve further . some labor rights advocates contend that globalization occasionally has weakened vietnam's labor rights regime in the textile and apparel industries ; at times , textile multinationals and industrialized governments have pushed the vietnamese government — against the wishes of the vgcl — to relax its enforcement of certain provisions of the labor code . other labor rights advocates argue that while congress should pass the vietnam - u.s. bta , it should do so only after the signing of a textile and apparel agreement that includes conditions on labor rights along the lines of the provisions of the cambodia - u.s. textile agreement . that agreement , which was signed in january 1999 , is designed to reward improvements in labor rights with increased access to the u.s. textile and apparel market . the agreement establishes annual quota levels , which can be increased by up to 14% each year if the u.s. determines that worker rights in the cambodian textile sector "substantially comply" with "international recognized core labor standards" and cambodian labor laws . opponents of linking the vietnam - u.s. bta to improvements in labor conditions contend that obtaining mfn status will indirectly help improve vietnamese labor conditions . by promoting economic development , they argue , the bta will provide vietnamese workers with more opportunities , increased knowledge , and improved means to promote their rights . foreign investment , which is likely to increase if the bta is passed , is also thought by some to raise working conditions generally by bringing in multinational corporations that pay higher wages and have better health and safety conditions than do local enterprises . finally , supporters of unconditional passage of the bta argue that the agreement will improve labor rights by promoting the rule of law in vietnam . for instance , they point out that the bta requires vietnam to publicize in advance most business - related laws and regulations , a move that should enhance the transparency of the country's legal regime . the following list includes various labor laws and regulations that are applied in the socialist republic of vietnam . most of the titles on this list , with a few exceptions , are in english . they are mainly found in the following two publications: 1 ) foreign investment laws of vietnam ( loose - leaf ) , compiled by the vietnamese ministry of planning and investment and translated by phillips fox , an australian law firm ( hereafter foreign investment laws of vietnam ) .
