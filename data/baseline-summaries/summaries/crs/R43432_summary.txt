bonus depreciation has continued to be extended . it expired in 2010 but was extended retroactively through 2010 by the small business jobs act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-240 ) , enacted at the end of september 2010 . this bill was not a stimulus bill , but one associated with small business . its temporary nature is critical to its effectiveness . most of the major provisions of the stimulus bills in 2008 and 2009 ( the economic stimulus act of 2008 , p.l . 110-185 , and the american recovery and reinvestment act , p.l . 111-5 ) or their replacements have expired . therefore , a question arises about the nature of bonus depreciation . if it is not included in the extenders package , its status as a temporary provision becomes clear . but if it is included , the action may or may not indicate that the provision has become permanent . however , if it is effectively permanent , there are important implications for the overall treatment of capital income , international comparisons of tax rates , consistency with tax reform proposals , and revenue issues . this report discusses bonus depreciation as either a temporary stimulus provision or a permanent part of the tax code . tax depreciation rules determine how quickly the cost of an investment in assets , such as equipment or buildings , can be deducted . because these assets produce output over a period of years , the cost of acquiring them is also deducted over a period of years so that costs can be matched with receipts to measure profits . to measure profits correctly , the deduction in each period should match the decline in the value of the asset ( i.e. , the change in price if it were to be sold ) ; this change in value is called economic depreciation . bonus depreciation was first enacted in the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-147 ) at a 30% rate , for three years , with the purpose of stimulating investment during an economic slowdown . concerns about the economy had come in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks . although the bonus depreciation rate was increased by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 ( p.l . 108-27 ) to 50% in the following year and extended for a year , it expired at the end of 2005 . with the financial distress and recession that began in 2007 , the economic stimulus act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-185 ) was enacted to stimulate the economy , including a single year of bonus depreciation at 50% . bonus depreciation was not the centerpiece of the stimulus ; the major tax cut , much larger than bonus depreciation , was an individual tax rebate . as the recession continued , a much larger stimulus measure was adopted in 2009 ( the american recovery and reinvestment act , p.l . it extended bonus depreciation for an additional year , through 2009 .
