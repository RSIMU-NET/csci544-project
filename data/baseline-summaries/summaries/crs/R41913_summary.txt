on may 4 , 2017 , h.r . 10 was ordered to be reported by the house financial services committee . this report begins with a description of the debit payments process and network pricing for the four - party system and the three - party system . the three - party system is explained for illustrative purposes , but implementation of the durbin amendment only applies to the four - party network where an interchange fee exists . the report concludes with a discussion of some implications of regulation ii for merchants , consumers , and banks as well as with some recent observations . this section outlines the four - party and three - party network systems prior to implementation of the durbin amendment . on june 29 , 2011 , the federal reserve issued regulation ii , a final rule , which capped the interchange fee received by large issuers ( with $10 billion or more in assets ) to 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction . the federal reserve also allowed for a 1 cent adjustment if the issuer implements fraud - prevention standards . regulation ii was implemented after the federal reserve conducted a survey in the form of public comments to obtain transaction cost information . although some merchants argued that the federal reserve had set the interchange fee cap at a level higher than allowed by statue , the final rule was upheld . regulation ii does not regulate the merchant discount fee charged to the merchant by the network provider or acquirer ; it only limits the amount of the merchant discount fee that can be remitted in the form of interchange fee revenue t o covered institutions . consequently , a two - tiered interchange fee system exists , meaning that institutions exempted from regulation ii may receive revenues consistent with interchange fees set above the cap . some network providers did agree to implement a two - tiered interchange pricing system . the final rule also gives merchants the ability to route transactions to multiple network providers . furthermore , if interchange revenues for smaller issuers were to decline over time , the losses could be material , especially if their processing costs are higher relative to those of large issuers . hence , declining profit margins from this line of business could possibly result in greater financial distress particularly for depository institutions that are increasingly sensitive to noninterest or fee income . numerous pricing arrangements among thousands of exempt institutions under $10 billion and data limitations increase the difficulty to monitor whether this trend is emerging . debit card issuers covered by regulation ii had expected to lose interchange fee income under the regulated cap , but the evidence has been uneven particularly for those institutions that process large volumes of debit card operations . some covered institutions initially experienced declines in debit interchange revenues shortly after rule implementation , but they have since seen some gradual increase over time , which is consistent with the reported growth of debit card transactions since 2009 . by contrast , some covered institutions saw an initial increase in interchange revenues but have since seen some gradual decline over time .
