2584 as reported . these provisions are for selected epa programs and activities that received prominent attention during deliberations on the fy2012 appropriations . amendments that were agreed to or failed during house floor debate of h.r . 2584 , as well as submitted amendments pending action , are not included in the tables , as the house floor debate of h.r . 2584 was suspended and not completed . concerns regarding epa's fy2012 funding generally focused on federal financial assistance for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects , grants to assist states in implementing air pollution control requirements , climate change research and related activities , and environmental cleanup of superfund sites . a similar recurring reporting requirement had been in existence for nearly a decade through fy2007 , under provisions in the annual appropriations bills for foreign operations . section 426 and section 427 of p.l . 112-74 are the same as section 424 and section 425 of p.l . 112-74 and proposed in h.r . 2584 as reported by the house appropriations committee , this report highlights a number of these provisions . the information regarding the provisions presented throughout this report is primarily an extraction of language contained in p.l . 112-74 and proposed in h.r . 2584 for purposes of reference , and is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of all provisions related directly or indirectly to epa programs . accounting for the across - the - board rescission , fy2012 enacted appropriations for all of the accounts were above the levels proposed in the house appropriations committee - reported bill ( h.r . as all the terms and activities contained within the provisions were not always explicitly defined , the scope of the effects of many of the provisions is subject to interpretation , and therefore neither definitions nor potential impacts are inferred in this report . the house committee had proposed roughly a 55% reduction below fy2011 enacted appropriations ( to the fy2008 level ) for grants to aid states to capitalize their clean water state revolving funds ( srfs ) . the drinking water srf would also have been reduced to the fy2008 level , although the magnitude of the decreases below the fy2011 enacted and fy2012 requested levels would have been smaller than the decreases for the clean water srf . there was variability among the fy2012 enacted amounts for program activities below the account level , compared to the fy2012 proposals and the fy2011 enacted amounts . in those cases where fy2012 enacted amounts were the same as proposed for fy2012 and fy2011 enacted , the fy2012 enacted levels would be a decrease once the 0.16% across - the - board rescission is taken into account . not including the 0.16% across - the - board rescission , the fy2012 enacted amount was generally the same as fy2011 enacted and the proposed amount for fy2012 in the senate draft , more than the $250.0 million proposed in the house committee - reported h.r . 2584 , but less than the $350.0 million included in the fy2012 request . from july 25 , 2011 , to july 28 , 2011 , the house considered h.r . 2584 but did not complete debate on the bill .
