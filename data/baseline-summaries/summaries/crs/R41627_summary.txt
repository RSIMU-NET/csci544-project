section 1856 ( b ) of p.l . this provision is the basis for the secretary's waiver authority . on june 28 , 2010 , the secretary promulgated regulations , with the secretaries of labor and the treasury , defining the restrictions on annual limits . in the interim final regulations on restricted annual limits , the secretaries of hhs , labor , and the treasury announced that hhs would establish a waiver process for limited benefit plans in order to preserve coverage at similar premiums . in other words , it was assumed that applying the restriction on annual limits to limited benefit plans would result in substantive increases in the premiums charged for those insurance products . hhs , however , expressed concern that consumers might be confused about the value of their coverage in relation to the restriction on annual limits . accordingly , hhs is requiring plans that are approved for the waiver to prominently display in their materials a "black box type" warning in 14-point bold font explaining that their plan does not meet the standards of the law with respect to annual limits . organizations may apply for a waiver on an annual basis until january 1 , 2014 , when annual limits are prohibited . the standards of the waiver apply equally to all applicants , as there are no differential or preferred paths to a waiver by the category of the applicant , such as unions or small businesses . the operational process for applying for a waiver was published as a memorandum on september 3 , 2010 . the plan year refers to the 12-month period during which a policy or plan benefit is effective . among the immediate reforms are consumer protections from high oop costs by placing restrictions on and eventually prohibiting the use of annual limits . this report provides an overview of the waiver available for the restriction on annual limits and will be periodically updated to reflect any legislative or regulatory changes . for plan years beginning on or after six months after enactment , group health plans , grandfathered group health plans , and health insurance issuers offering group or individual plans are restricted , as determined by the secretary of hhs ( hereafter the secretary ) , from establishing annual limits on the dollar value of essential health benefits for any participant or beneficiary . essential health benefits may be further defined by the secretary , but they must include at least the following types of care: ambulatory patient services , emergency services , hospitalization , maternity and newborn care , mental health and substance use disorder services , prescription drugs , rehabilitative services and devices , laboratory services , and preventive and wellness and chronic disease management and pediatric services , including oral and vision care . annual limits are permissible for health care expenses that are not considered part of the essential health benefits . ppaca also requires the secretary to ensure that there is access to needed services with a minimal impact on premiums in the context of defining the restriction on annual limits .
