the median tenure was unchanged for four positions . this may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states . although pay is not the only factor that might affect an individual's decision to remain in or leave a particular job , staff in positions that generally pay less typically remained in those roles for shorter periods of time than those in higher - paying positions . some of these lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level positions in some house committees ; if so , house office employees in those roles appear to follow national trends for others in entry - level types of jobs , remaining in the role for a relatively short period of time . similarly , those in more senior positions , which often require a particular level of congressional or other professional experience , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . there is wide variation among the job titles used for various positions in congressional offices . between october 2000 and march 2016 , house and senate pay data provided 13,271 unique titles under which staff received pay . of those , 1,884 were extracted and categorized into one of 33 job titles used in crs reports about member or committee offices . office type was sometimes related to the job titles used . some titles were specific to member ( eg , district director , state director , and field representative ) or committee ( positions that are identified by majority , minority , or party standing , and chief clerk ) offices , while others were identified in each setting ( counsel , scheduler , staff assistant , and legislative assistant ) . other job title variations reflect factors specific to particular offices , since each office functions as its own hiring authority . some of the titles may distinguish between roles and duties carried out in the office ( eg , chief of staff , legislative assistant , etc. ) some offices may use job titles to indicate degrees of seniority . others might represent arguably inconsequential variations in title between two staff members who might be carrying out essentially similar activities . examples include the following: seemingly related job titles , such as administrative director and administrative manager , or caseworker and constituent advocate job titles modified by location , such as washington , dc , state , or district chief of staff job titles modified by policy or subject area , such as domestic policy counsel , energy counsel , or counsel for constituent services committee job titles modified by party or committee subdivision . the average can be affected disproportionately by unusually low or high observations . a few individuals who remain for many years in a position , for example , may draw the average tenure length up for that position . a number of staff who stay in a position for only a brief period may depress the average length of tenure . another common measure of central tendency , the median , represents the middle value when all the observations are arranged by order of magnitude .
