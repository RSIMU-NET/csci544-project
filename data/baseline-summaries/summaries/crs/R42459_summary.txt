there were two main exceptions . first , the farmer had until january 1 , 1990 , or two years after the completion of a soil survey — whichever was later — to be actively applying an approved conservation plan . second , if a farmer was actively applying an approved conservation plan , then they had until january 1 , 1995 , to be full in compliance with the plan . the program benefits that could be lost included price supports and related payments , farm storage facility loans , crop insurance , disaster payments , any farm loans that will contribute to excessive erosion of highly erodible land , and storage payments made to producers for crops acquired by the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) . swampbuster the "swampbuster" or wetland conservation provision extends the sodbuster requirement to wetland areas . producers who plant a program crop on a converted wetland would be ineligible for certain usda program benefits . the most controversial debate over the swampbuster provision was on the definition of an affected wetland areas . this resulted in many wetland areas being exempt , including wetlands converted before enactment ( december 23 , 1985 ) , artificially created lakes , ponds , or wetlands , wetlands created by irrigation delivery systems , wetlands on which agricultural production is naturally possible , or wetlands converted if the effect of such action is minimal . changes since the 1985 farm bill since the enactment of the 1985 farm bill , each succeeding farm bill has amended the compliance provisions ( both highly erodible land and wetland conservation ) . 1990 farm bill the compliance provisions were amended in several ways in the food , agriculture , conservation , and trade act of 1990 ( p.l . 101-624 , 1990 farm bill ) . conservation provisions were expanded to include wetlands converted after enactment ( november 28 , 1990 ) , where agricultural commodity production was made possible . this meant that crop production did not actually have to occur in order to be found out of compliance , only that production was made possible through activities such as draining , dredging , filling , or leveling the wetland . the 1990 farm bill added six more federal farm programs to the list of benefits that could be lost for non - compliance , including many of the conservation programs . a graduated penalty was added so that under some circumstances , producers could be subject to a loss in benefits of between $500 and $5,000 . this graduated penalty may be applied only once every five years . the revisions protect tenant farmers who may be ruled out of compliance because of the actions of the landowner or previous tenants . compliance exemptions were also expanded to include highly erodible land set aside , or taken out of production , under the commodity support programs . 1996 farm bill beginning in 1994 , conservation policy discussions in congress focused on identifying ways to make the compliance programs less intrusive on farmer activities . as a result , conservation compliance provisions were significantly amended in the federal agricultural improvement and reform act of 1996 ( p.l . 104-127 , referred to as the 1996 farm bill ) .
