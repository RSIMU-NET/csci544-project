lame duck sessions have been held for a variety of reasons . their primary purpose is to complete action on legislation . they have also been used to prevent recess appointments and pocket vetoes , to consider motions of censure or impeachment , to keep congress assembled on a standby basis , or to approve nominations ( senate only ) . in recent years , most lame duck sessions have focused on program authorizations , trade - related measures , appropriations , and the budget . critics of lame duck sessions object to recently defeated members or parties managing and acting on the legislative agenda . proponents consider these post - election sessions to be useful for lawmaking at the end of a congress . in the last two decades , lame duck sessions have become a routine occurrence during even - numbered years , regardless of which party is in the majority before the election . prior to 1933 , the last regular session of congress was always a lame duck session . however , the 20 th amendment to the constitution changed the dates of the congressional term from beginning and ending on march 4 of odd - numbered years to january 3 of odd - numbered years . as a result , lame duck sessions are no longer an automatic feature of congress . between 1935 and 1998 , one or both houses held a lame duck session in 12 of the 32 congresses ( 74 th - 105 th ) . in contrast , both houses held a lame duck session in every congress from the 106 th through the 114 th ( 2000-2016 ) . these sessions are now an anticipated — although not guaranteed — biennial event . from 1935 to 2016 , seven lame duck sessions followed an election that changed the majority party in one or both chambers of congress . two occurred during a presidential election year ( 1948 , 1980 ) , two followed a midterm election during the second term of a president ( 2006 and 2014 ) , and three followed a midterm election during the first term of a president ( 1954 , 1994 , 2010 ) . tabl e 1 displays lame duck sessions that convened after an election that changed the majority party in either the house or the senate . the table identifies the number of seats the majority party lost as well as the key measures approved during the post - election periods . in each of the lame duck sessions that followed a midterm election in a president's first term in office , the same party controlled the white house , the house , and the senate . below , more information is provided on the 1954 ( republican - controlled ) , 1994 ( democratic - controlled ) , and 2010 ( democratic - controlled ) lame duck sessions of congress . for a detailed review of lame duck sessions of congress ( 1935-2016 ) , see crs report r45154 , lame duck sessions of congress , 1935-2016 ( 74th - 114th congresses ) . in the 1954 midterm election , the republican party lost its majorities in both chambers during president eisenhower's first term in office .
