it is a federal crime . in fact , federal obstruction of justice laws are legion ; too many for even passing reference to all of them in a single report . this is a brief description of those that outlaw interference with congressional activities . the general federal obstruction of justice provisions are six: 18 u.s.c . 1512 ( tampering with federal witnesses ) , 1513 ( retaliating against federal witnesses ) , 1503 ( obstruction of pending federal court proceedings ) , 1505 ( obstruction of pending congressional or federal administrative proceedings ) , 371 ( conspiracy ) , and contempt . all but §1503 apply to congressional activities . in addition to these , there are a host of other statutes that penalize obstruction by violence , corruption , destruction of evidence , or deceit . in addition to the basic federal crimes of obstruction of justice , federal law features a host of criminal statutes that proscribe various obstructions according to the obstructive means used , be it physical violence , bribery , property destruction , or deception . thus , quite aside from the general obstruction provisions of §§1512 , 1513 , 1505 , and 1503 , several federal statutes outlaw the use of threats or violence for the purpose of obstruct federal government activities . section 1512 ( b ) outlaws witness tampering by corrupt persuasion . several other federal statutes outlaw bribery in one form or another . the main federal bribery statute is 18 u.s.c . 201 which prohibits bribing federal officials , employees , jurors and witnesses . although it makes no mention of bribery , the honest services component of the mail and wire fraud statutes , 18 u.s.c . 1341 , 1343 , 1346 , in some circumstances may afford prosecutors of public corruption greater latitude and more severe penalties than §201 . the hobbs act , 18 u.s.c . 1951 , condemns public officials who use their position for extortion . none of the three are rico or money laundering predicate offenses . there are no explicit statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction for any of them , but the courts are likely to conclude that overseas violation of their provisions are subject to prosecution in this country . none of them feature an individual conspiracy component , but all of them are subject to general federal law governing conspiracy , principals , accessories after the fact , and misprision . in addition to the obstruction of justice provisions of 18 u.s.c . 1503 and 1512 , four other general statutes outlaw obstructing the government's business by deception . three involve perjury: 18 u.s.c . 1519 prohibits destruction of evidence in connection with federal investigation or bankruptcy proceedings ; 18 u.s.c . 1520 prohibits destruction of corporate audit records ; and 18 u.s.c . 2232 ( a ) prohibits the destruction of property to prevent the government from searching or seizing it . 1623 which outlaws false swearing before federal courts and grand juries ; 18 u.s.c . 1621 the older and more general prohibition that proscribes false swearing in federal official matters ( judicial , legislative , or administrative ) ; and 18 u.s.c . 1622 which condemns subornation , that is , inducing another to commit perjury .
