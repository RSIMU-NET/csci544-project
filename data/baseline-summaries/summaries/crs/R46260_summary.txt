â§6906 , which was treated as mandatory spending . in each of these three years , funding was provided for pilt at the full statutory calculation levels . since fy2008 , congress has provided funding for pilt through both one - year and multiyear appropriations . congress's actions have resulted in full funding and partial funding in different years ( table 1 and figure 1 ) . the authorized payment level under section 6902 , which accounts for nearly all payments under pilt , is calculated pursuant to the statutory requirements . this section has remained largely unchanged since it was amended in 1994 to add the requirement to adjust for inflation , among other changes . the inflation adjustment clause has resulted in increasing payment and ceiling rates since that time . congress routinely considers whether the current formula is the best means of calculating payments under pilt or whether the formula should be amended . for example , in the 116 th congress , bills have been introduced that would adjust the payment structure for counties with a population of less than 5,000 . this adjustment would have implications for how population or area would be incorporated into calculating pilt payments and whether pilt payments were provided in an equitable manner . this shift began in the late 19 th century and continued into the 20 th century . along with this shift came the understanding that , because these lands were exempt from state and local taxation and were no longer likely to return to the tax base in the foreseeable future , some compensation should be provided to the impacted local governments . following several decades of commissions , studies , and proposed legislation , congress passed pilt to at least partially ameliorate this hardship . pilt payments generally can be used for "any governmental purpose," which could include assisting local governments with paying for local services , such as "firefighting and police protection , construction of public schools and roads , and search - and - rescue operations. the office of the secretary in doi is responsible for the calculation and disbursement of payments under pilt . payments under pilt are made annually to units of general local governmentâtypically counties , though other types of governmental units also may be used ( hereinafter , counties refers to units of general local government ) âcontaining entitlement lands . pilt comprises three separate payment mechanisms: section 6902 , section 6904 , and section 6905 payments , all named for the sections of law in which they are authorized . section 6902 payments account for nearly all payments made through pilt . the section 6902 authorized payment amount for each county is calculated according to a statutory formula that is subject to a maximum payment based on the county's population ( see " pilt payments under section 6902 " ) . the remaining payments are provided through section 6904 and section 6905 under selected circumstances and typically are limited in duration . through fy2019 , pilt payments have totaled approximately $9.2 billion ( in current dollars ) . members of congress routinely consider amending pilt within both appropriations and authorizing legislation .
