no further action occurred on the legislation . the 435 seat limit for the size of the house was imposed in 1929 by statute ( 46 stat . altering the size of the house would require a new law setting a different limit . article i , ยง2 of the constitution establishes a minimum house size ( one representative for each state ) , and a maximum house size ( one for every 30,000 persons , or 10,306 representatives based on the 2010 census ) . for the 2010 apportionment , a house size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats held from the 112 th to the 116 th congresses . however , by retaining seats through such an increase in the house size , other state delegations would become larger . at a house size of 468 , california's delegation size , for example , would be 56 instead of 53 seats , texas's delegation size would be 38 instead of 36 seats , and florida's delegation size would be 29 instead of 27 seats . table 1 , below displays the apportionment of the seats in the house of representatives based on the 2000 census apportionment population ( the current house apportionment ) and the apportionment of seats in the house based on the 2010 census apportionment population ( the distribution of seats among the states for the 113 th congress ) . in addition , table 1 also shows the impact on the distribution of seats in the house if the district of columbia were to be treated as if it were a state for apportionment purposes for both a house size of 435 seats and a house size of 437 seats . first , due to population changes between the 2000 census and the 2010 census , table 1 shows a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th congress ( beginning in january 2013 ) . illinois , iowa , louisiana , massachusetts , michigan , missouri , new jersey , and pennsylvania will each lose one seat ; new york and ohio will each lose two seats . arizona , georgia , nevada , south carolina , utah , and washington will each gain one seat ; florida will gain two seats ; and texas will gain four seats . these are the actual seats to be allocated based on the results of the 2010 census . second , if the district of columbia were to be given a vote in the house of representatives and treated as if it were a state in the reapportionment of congressional seats following the 2010 census , and the house size remained at 435 , minnesota would lose a seat relative to what it is scheduled to get as a result of the 2010 census . thus , minnesota's delegation would fall to seven representatives if the district of columbia were to given a vote and the house size remained at 435 representatives .
