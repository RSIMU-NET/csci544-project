110-140 ) significantly expanded this mandate . the rfs mandate has been a major impetus to the development of u.s. biofuels industries , especially the ethanol industry . as a result , ethanol production capacity and the demand for corn as a biofuel feedstock have grown dramatically over the past few years . another factor that could lead the epa administrator to waive certain parts of the rfs is the "blend wall. the vast majority of the rfs is met using ethanol blended into gasoline at the 10% level ( e10 ) . in 2005 , the united states produced 3.9 billion gallons of ethanol , requiring roughly 1.4 billion bushels of corn ; in 2007 , those numbers had increased to 6.5 billion gallons and 2.3 billion bushels . in prior years this had not been a problem because the volume of biofuels needed to meet the rfs mandate was below the maximum amount of ethanol that could be supplied as e10 ; but stakeholders were especially concerned about the possibility of facing this "blend wall" in either 2013 or 2014 . in november 2013 epa proposed using its general authority to lower the rfs mandates in cases of "inadequate supply. epa proposed an overall mandate of 15.21 billion gallons for 2014 , instead of the 18.15 billion gallons of biofuels scheduled for 2014 in eisa , and below the 2013 mandate of 16.55 billion gallons . within the overall rfs there are sub - mandates for the use of cellulosic biofuels , biomass - based diesel fuels , and other advanced biofuels . however , questions have been raised over whether there is enough feedstock supply and production capacity to meet some of these carveouts , especially the cellulosic biofuel carveout . epa waived most of the 2010 cellulosic biofuel carveout â€” eisa set the mandate at 100 million gallons but epa only required 6.5 million gallons , more than 90% less than scheduled by eisa . in his letter , governor perry stated that he initiated the petition because of the negative effect of the requirements on the texas economy and on global food prices . in august 2008 , epa denied the waiver request because the agency found that the effects of the rfs on food , feed , and fuel prices was minimal , and thus the economic effects of the rfs "could not be categorized as severe. in august 2012 , arkansas governor mike beebe and north carolina governor beverly eaves perdue submitted petition letters to epa requesting full or partial waivers of the 2012 and 2013 rfs mandates . governors of several other states joined that petition . the governors cited the effects of the 2012 drought , further compounded by the increased grain demand from the rfs , as leading to severe economic harm to their states , especially their livestock producers . however , epa denied these petitions for similar reasons as in 2008 . however , there is a limit to the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline at this level , and other options for supplying ethanol ( eg , higher - level ethanol blends such as e15 and e85 ) are currently constrained because of infrastructure and other impediments .
