the conference report ( h.rept . 110-659 ) was filed on may 20 , and on the next day , the house approved h.res . 1214 , passed on a 220 to 199 vote , clearing the way for consideration of the conference agreement . the administration's budget proposed fy2009 outlays of $3,107 billion , about $92 billion above the cbo baseline . both the administration and cbo have issued projections of future federal outlays . in addition , the budget resolutions passed by house and senate budget committees , which reflect congress's priorities , specify future paths for spending and revenues . table 2 summarizes these projections . deficits occur when congress and the president enact policies that cause federal spending to exceed federal receipts . deficits increase government debt held by the public , generally increasing net interest payments . surpluses occur when federal receipts exceed outlays , which reduces federal debt held by the public . the house agreed to an amended version of s.con.res . 70 on may 14 without objection , which laid the groundwork for a conference committee . the budget conference report , h.rept . 110-659 , was filed on may 20 . the next day , the house cleared the way for consideration of the conference agreement by passing h.res . on june 4 , 2008 , the senate passed the s.con.res . 70 conference report on a 48-45 vote , and the house passed it the next day on a 214-210 vote . house passage of the fy2009 budget resolution automatically passed and transmitted to the senate legislation ( h.j.res . 92 ) to raise the debt limit . table 1 contains budget estimates for fy2009 from cbo , the administration ( the office of management and budget , omb ) , and congress ( house and senate budget committees ) . estimated budget totals can vary due to differing underlying economic , technical , and budget - estimating assumptions and techniques , as well as differences in policy assumptions . minor differences in underlying assumptions , which may generate small short - term discrepancies , can produce wide divergences in projected long - term budget paths . budget estimates issued by the president , cbo , congress , or by others , should be expected to change as new data arrive or as economic conditions change . the economic slowdown caused by financial turmoil and rising commodity prices that started in the third quarter of 2007 has continued to affect budget estimates and projections . early in 2008 , cbo predicted that economic growth would slow in calendar year 2008 and recover in 2009 . the president's budget acknowledged economic challenges , but predicted strong growth in both 2008 and 2009 . over the course of 2008 , the economy weakened according to many measures such as employment , although other measures such as economic growth and household consumption did not slow as much as some had expected . as a result of the deepening of the economic slowdown , omb and cbo in summer 2008 adjusted forecasts of revenues downwards and outlays upwards .
