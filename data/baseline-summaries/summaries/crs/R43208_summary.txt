finally , p.l . 113-2 granted hud broad authority to waive or establish alternative program requirements , except for provisions governing fair labor standards , fair housing , civil rights , and environmental review . however , p.l . 113-2 included two exceptions related to environmental review requirements . specifically , it allowed cdbg disaster fund grantees who use their funding to meet certain fema matching requirements to adopt , without public review , environmental reviews performed by other federal agencies . the hud proposal would have denied direct cdbg funding to communities whose minimum allocation is less than 0.0125% of the amount allocated to all entitlement communities . hud has argued that grants below a certain amount are too small to be effective . according to the administration , 239 communities would have fallen below the threshold based on the program's proposed funding level for fy2014 , and an additional 57 grandfathered communities would have been eliminated because they no longer met the program's population threshold for entitlement status . in cases where a grantee has already performed an environmental review or the activity or project is excluded from an environmental review , p.l . although these cities would not receive direct funding they could become a part of their respective urban county's cdbg program . under the sequestration process for fy2013 mandated by the bca , the office of management and budget ( omb ) was required to implement across - the - board spending cuts to achieve budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding . on january 2 , 2013 , the president signed the american taxpayer relief act , p.l . 112-240 , ( atra ) , which averted scheduled income tax rate increases and postponed spending reductions required by the sequestration process . according to the office of management and budget , sequestration has resulted in an $85 billion reduction in fy2013 discretionary spending , including a 5% ( $965 million ) reduction in funding for cdf activities . the $965 million identified in the omb document includes $800 million reduction in the $16 billion for cdbg disaster relief and $165 million reduction in the $3.308 billion in cdf fy2013 regular appropriations . the fy2013 appropriations for the formula - based components of the cdbg program ( entitlement communities and states , and insular areas ) totaled $3.078 billion , which was approximately 6.8% ( $225 million ) less than the $3.303 billion appropriated for fy2011 . for fy2012 , the cdbg allocations awarded to entitlement communities and states totaled $2.948 billion . this represented 10.7% ( $355 million ) less than the amount allocated in fy2011 . the reductions in appropriations for formula grant activities from fy2011 to fy2013 resulted in the average grant amount for entitlement communities declining from $2 million in fy2011 to $1.8 million in fy2013 . this was a 10.1% reduction in the average grant amount awarded to entitlement communities ( see table 4 ) . although the recent reductions in cdbg funding represented a decline in resources available to support local community and economic development activities , they were less than the 45% reduction proposed in the fy2014 departments of transportation and housing and urban development appropriations act , h.r .
