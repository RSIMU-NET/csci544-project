bush ) did not . the fy1978 revisions by president jimmy carter ( a 101-page document ) were submitted on february 22 and the fy1982 revisions by president ronald reagan ( an initial 159-page document and a subsequent 435-page document ) were submitted on march 10 and april 7 , respectively . in past years , congress authorized the submission of a budget for a fiscal year after the statutory deadline by enacting a deadline extension in law . for example , the deadlines for submission of the budgets for fy1981 , fy1984 , and fy1986 were extended from mid - january to late - january or early - february by p.l . 99 - 1 , respectively . beginning in the late 1980s , however , several original budgets have been submitted late without authorization . the purpose of this report is to provide background information that addresses these questions . the budget and accounting act of 1921 , as amended , requires the president to submit a budget annually to congress toward the beginning of each regular session ( 31 u.s.c . this requirement first applied to president warren harding for fy1923 . the deadline for submission of the budget , first set in 1921 as "on the first day of each regular session," has changed several times over the years: in 1950 , to "during the first 15 days of each regular session" ; in 1985 , to "on or before the first monday after january 3 of each year ( or on or before february 5 in 1986 ) " ; and in 1990 , to "on or after the first monday in january but not later than the first monday in february of each year. the 20 th amendment to the constitution , ratified in 1933 , requires each new congress to convene on january 3 ( unless the date is changed by the enactment of a law ) and provides a january 20 beginning date for a president's four - year term of office . therefore , under the legal framework for the beginning of a new congress , the beginning of a new president's term , and the deadline for the submission of the budget , all outgoing presidents prior to the 1990 change were obligated to submit a budget . the 1990 change in the deadline made it possible for an outgoing president to leave the annual budget submission to his successor , an option which the three outgoing presidents since then ( george h.w . bush , bill clinton , and george w. bush ) took . because president george h.w . bush chose not to submit a budget for fy1994 ( and was not obligated to do so ) , president bill clinton submitted the original budget for fy1994 rather than budget revisions . similarly , the budget for fy2002 was submitted by the incoming president george w. bush , rather than by outgoing president bill clinton . the office of management and budget ( omb ) provided considerable advance notice of the plan for fy2002 . president george w. bush indicated early on that he would not submit a budget for fy2010 .
