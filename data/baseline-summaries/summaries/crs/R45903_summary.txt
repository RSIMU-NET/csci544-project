in response to u.s . section 232 and section 301 tariffs on u.s. imports of chinese goods imposed in 2018 , china levied retaliatory tariffs on imports of almost all u.s. agricultural products . in 2017 , china was the second - leading export market by value for u.s. agricultural products . however , after the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on u.s. imports beginning in april 2018 , u.s. agricultural exports to china experienced a 53% decline from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $9.2 billion in 2018 ( figure 3 ) . china thus moved down in rank to become the fourth - largest u.s. agricultural market , after canada , mexico , and japan . among other goods , china imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on u.s. soybeans in july 2018 . since 2000 , china had been the top export market for u.s. soybeans . in 2017 , china imported about $12 billion worth of u.s. soybeans , accounting for 57% of the total value of all u.s. soybean exports that year . with higher tariffs in place , china has been purchasing more soybeans from brazil and other countries to meet its demand . consequently , u.s. soybean exports to china in 2018 declined to $3 billion ( figure 3 ) . u.s. census bureau trade data indicate china was still the top foreign destination for u.s. soybeans in 2018 , followed by mexico , which imported $1.8 billion of u.s. soybeans . reduced chinese import demand in 2018 contributed to declining farm prices for affected commodities and lower u.s. agricultural exports to china for several commodities , including sorghum , soybeans , cotton , and pork . consequently , u.s. soybean prices reached 10-year lows during july - october 2018 ( figure 4 ) , weighing on prices of other agricultural commodities , such as corn , that compete with soybeans for acreage . prices recovered some during the last quarter of 2018 , coincident with reported commitments by china to purchase a "very substantial amount of u.s. agricultural" goods . however , chinese purchases failed to materialize and u.s. commodity prices resumed their downward trend through the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing . as u.s. soybean prices declined in 2018 , brazilian soybean prices started to rise , indicative of a greater demand for brazilian soybeans from china ( figure 4 ) . since 2007 , brazilian and u.s. soybean prices had tended to move together . starting in april 2018 , u.s. soybean prices started to fall and brazilian soybean prices started to rise . china's imposition of a 25% tariff on u.s. soybeans in july 2018 initially precipitated a widening of the gap between the two prices . on october 23 , 2018 , u.s. soybean free on board ( fob ) prices were $86 per metric ton lower than brazilian ( paranaguã¡ ) fob prices . the brazilian soybean price started to fall in late october in anticipation of a record - high south american soybean harvest . u.s. soybean prices started to climb at the same time , partly due to farmers' willingness to hold stocks and in response to larger exports to non - chinese destinations . anticipation of chinese purchases also contributed to rebounding of u.s. prices .
