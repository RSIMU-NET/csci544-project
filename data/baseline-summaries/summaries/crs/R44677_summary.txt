the extension could be retroactive . the extensions also could be short - term , long - term , or permanent . another option would be to allow expired provisions to remain expired . congress may also choose to evaluate the extension of certain expiring provisions , in lieu of considering an extenders package that addresses most or all of the provisions scheduled to expire . the ptc for wind was extended through 2019 , although the credit amount was reduced by 20% for facilities beginning construction in 2017 , 40% for facilities beginning construction in 2018 , and 60% for facilities beginning construction in 2019 . the 30% itc for business solar was extended through 2019 and the deadline changed from a placed - in - service deadline to a construction start date . the business solar itc was set to be 26% for facilities beginning construction in 2020 , and 22% for facilities beginning construction in 2021 , so long as these facilities are placed in service before the end of 2023 . the business solar itc is scheduled to return to 10% in 2022 . the tax credit for residential solar was extended through 2021 , with a phaseout starting in 2020 . the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l . 113-295 ) , passed late in the 113 th congress , made tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2013 available to taxpayers in the 2014 tax year . the act extended most ( but not all ) expiring tax provisions , and most of the provisions extended in p.l . 114-113 had been included in past tax extenders legislation . the cost of the tax extenders package enacted as p.l . 113-295 was estimated to be $41.6 billion over the 10-year budget window . earlier in the 113 th congress , the senate finance committee had reported a two - year extenders package . certain expiring energy - related provisions have received particular attention , as long - term extensions of certain energy tax benefits were provided for wind and solar , but not other technologies , in legislation enacted at the end of 2015 . in recent years , congress has chosen to extend most , if not all , recently expired or expiring provisions as part of "tax extender" legislation . the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l . 112-240 ) extended dozens of temporary provisions that had either expired at the end of 2011 , or were set to expire at the end of 2012 . the provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 were extended retroactively . the cost of the tax extenders package enacted as part of arra was estimated to be $73.6 billion over the 10-year budget window . several provisions that were considered "traditional extenders" — that is , they had been extended multiple times in the past — were not extended under atra . as lawmakers consider whether to extend expired tax provisions beyond 2016 , cost is one factor . since many provisions were made permanent in the path act , a temporary extenders package for provisions that expired in 2016 would cost less than past extender packages .
