the trustees note that these changes have important implications . in 2005 , total medicare expenditures represented 2.73% of gdp . in 2006 ( the first year of the new drug benefit ) , total expenditures were 3.11% of gdp . the percentage is expected to increase to 7.23% by 2035 and to 11.18% by 2080 . the trustees note that over the past 50 years , total federal tax receipts have averaged 11% of gdp . they further note that projected medicare costs will exceed those for social security by 2028 , and be more than double the cost of social security by 2083 . there is concern that over time the economy will be unable to support the increasing reliance on general revenues which in large measure comes from taxes paid by the under - 65 population . in response , mma ( section 801 ) required the trustees report to include an expanded analysis of medicare expenditures and revenues . specifically , a determination must be made as to whether general revenue financing will exceed 45% of total medicare outlays within the next seven years ( on a fiscal year basis ) . general revenues financing is defined as total medicare outlays minus dedicated financing sources ( i.e. , hi payroll taxes ; income from taxation of social security benefits ; state transfers for prescription drug benefits ; premiums paid under parts a , b , and d ; and any gifts received by the trust funds ) . the 2006 report projected that the 45% level would first be exceeded in fy2012 ; the 2007 report projected that it would first be exceeded in 2013 , while both the 2008 and 2009 reports project the first year at 2014 . the four findings were within the required seven - year test period . the reports , therefore , made a determination of "excess general revenue medicare funding. mma ( sections 802-804 ) requires that if an excess general revenue funding determination is made for two successive years , the president must submit a legislative proposal to respond to the warning . the congress is required to consider the proposals on an expedited basis . however , passage of legislation within a specific time frame is not required . on january 6 , 2009 , the house approved a rules package ( h.res . 5 ) that nullifies the trigger provision for the 111 th congress . because the medicare trustees issued such a warning in 2008 , the mma required that the president submit legislation to congress responding to the warning within the 15-day period , beginning on the date of the budget submission to congress this year . however , the president considers this requirement to be advisory and not binding , in accordance with the recommendations clause of the constitution . the president's 2010 budget includes proposals that if enacted would bring the share of medicare funded by general revenues below 45% ( estimated medicare savings are $92.3 billion over the five - year budget period , $287.5 billion over the 10-year budget period , and about $49.9 billion in 2014 ) . the budget requests that these savings be set aside in a reserve fund for health care reform .
