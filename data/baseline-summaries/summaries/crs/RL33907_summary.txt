it is not clear what these amounts represent . the $50 million hhs obligated for the botulinum antitoxin program support could fall under the "other services" category , since it was not an acquisition per se , but the amount of this contract does not correlate to the amount categorized as "other services. another possibility is that president's budget accounted for the rpa vaccine contract ( awarded in november 2004 ) in fy2004 rather than fy2005 . this interpretation is supported by the fy2007 budget reporting that only $189 million was obligated in fy2005 . however , the total of the $878 million rpa obligation and the $50 million botulinum antitoxin program obligation is greater than the budget authority made available in fy2004 ( $885 million ) . this interpretation also would not account for the division of the funds into the two object classifications . furthermore , the fy2007 dhs preparedness directorate biodefense countermeasures congressional justification materials list acquiring the rpa vaccine as one of its fy2005 accomplishments . the source of the fy2004 account discrepancy of $835 million is not apparent . in fy2005 , hhs reported awarding three contracts for a total of $1.008 billion . the fy2007 budget states that the actual amount obligated in fy2005 was $189 million . the dhs fy2007 congressional justification documents state that its fy2005 accomplishments include the rpa , ki , and ava contracts . these would equal the $1.008 billion calculated from the hhs figures . it is not apparent to what the $189 million stated in the budget correlates . like the preceding two years , the stated obligations for fy2006 are different according to hhs and the president's budget . for fy2006 , hhs reported awarding six contracts , with obligations totaling $824 million . this is $32 million less than the $856 million stated as "actual obligations" in fy2006 in the president's fy2008 budget . combining all of the differences in reporting through fy2006 , the president's budgets state that $48 million more have been obligated than the hhs documents report . effective management and congressional oversight of project bioshield require specific and clear knowledge of the funds remaining available . for the administration to most effectively plan and prioritize future acquisitions , it must know the amount of funds remaining available . for congress , knowing the amount of funds remaining can be important in assessing program management , the implementation pace , and general program effectiveness . due to conflicting statements from executive branch agencies , the amount of funds remaining available for obligation for this program is not clear . according to hhs , as of june 2007 , it has obligated $2.331 billion from this account . this figure does not include the $878 million that should be recovered in fy2007 from the cancellation of the rpa anthrax vaccine contract . taking this recovery into account , $1.889 billion would be available for obligation in fy2007-fy2008 and $4.064 billion would be available until the end of the program in fy2013 . as stated above , using the president's budget figures to calculate obligations would reduce these numbers by $48 million .
