appendix a . a hold letter appendix b . the "notice of intent to object" section of the calendar of business appendix c. a notice of intent to objec . holds can be used to accomplish a variety of purposes . although the senate itself makes no official distinctions among holds , scholars have classified holds based on the objective of the communication . if objection is heard , the consent request does not take effect . choke holds contain an explicit filibuster threat and are intended to kill or delay action on the target of the hold . blanket holds are leveled against an entire category of business , such as all nominations to a particular agency or department . mae west holds intend to foster negotiation and bargaining between proponents and opponents . efforts to modify the original request may be undertaken — a process that can require extensive negotiations between and among senate leaders and their colleagues — but there is no guarantee that a particular objection can be addressed to the satisfaction of all senators . until recently , many holds were considered a nonymous ( or secret ) because the source and contents of the request were not made available to the public , or even to other senators . written hold requests emerged as an informal practice in the late 1950s under the majority leadership of lyndon b. johnson as a way for senators to make routine requests of their leaders regarding the senate's schedule . early usage was largely consistent with prevailing expectations of senate behavior at that time , such as reciprocity , deference , and accommodation of one's senate colleagues . over time , holds have evolved to become a potent extra - parliamentary practice , sometimes likened to a "silent filibuster" in the press . "the hold started out as a courtesy for senators who wanted to participate in open debate," two senators wrote in 1997 . since then , "it has become a shield for senators who wish to avoid it. these and other senators were concerned that keeping holds confidential tended to enable senators who placed holds to block measures or nominations while leaving no avenue of recourse open to their supporters . many hold requests take the form of a letter addressed to the majority or minority leader ( depending on the party affiliation of the senator placing the hold ) expressing reservations about the merits or timing of a particular policy proposal or nomination . an example of a hold letter is displayed in appendix a . more often than not , senate leaders — as agents of their party responsible for defending the political , policy , and procedural interests of their colleagues — honor a hold request because not doing so could trigger a range of parliamentary responses from the holding senator ( s ) , such as a filibuster , that could expend significant amounts of scarce floor time .
