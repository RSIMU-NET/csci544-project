the lwcf is used for three purposes . first , the four principal federal land management agencies — bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , national park service , and forest service — draw primarily on the lwcf to acquire lands . the sections on each of those agencies earlier in this report identify funding levels and other details for their land acquisition activities . second , the lwcf funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the nps , sometimes referred to as stateside funding . third , administrations have requested , and congress has appropriated , money from the lwcf to fund some related activities . this third use is relatively recent , starting with the fy1998 appropriation . programs funded have varied from year to year . most of the appropriations for federal acquisitions generally are specified for management units , such as a specific national wildlife refuge . the appropriations for the state grant program and other related activities rarely have been specified for individual projects or areas . from fy1965 through fy2007 , about $30 billion was credited to the lwcf . about half that amount — $15 billion — has been appropriated . throughout history , annual appropriations from lwcf have fluctuated considerably . until fy1998 , lwcf funding did not exceed $400 million , except from fy1977-fy1980 , when funding was between $509 million and $805 million . in fy1998 , lwcf appropriations exceeded the authorized level for the first time , spiking to $969 million from the fy1997 level of $159 million . a record level of funding was provided in fy2001 , when appropriations reached $1.0 billion , partly in response to president clinton's lands legacy initiative and some interest in increased and more certain funding for lwcf . for fy2008 , the total lwcf appropriation was $255.5 million . this was a $110.4 million ( 30% ) reduction from fy2007 ( $365.9 million ) , as well as a $123.2 million ( 33% ) reduction from the administration's request for fy2008 ( $378.7 million ) . both the house and the senate appropriations committee had supported decreases from the fy2007 level . the senate committee had recommended $292.9 million for lwcf , while the house had approved $261.9 million . the fy2008 law included an additional $7.7 million for land appraisals related to federal land acquisitions , but it did not appear that this amount would be derived from lwcf . the fy2008 appropriated level included funds for federal land acquisition , the stateside program , and other purposes as described below . for land acquisition , the fy2008 law contained $129.7 million for land acquisition , a $16.7 million ( 15% ) increase over fy2007 ( $113.0 million ) and more than double the administration's request for fy2008 . the house and the senate appropriations committee had supported higher funding . the house had approved $155.6 million , with an additional $7.8 million for land appraisals apparently not derived from lwcf . the senate appropriations committee had recommended $152.2 million for land acquisition , and $7.8 million for land appraisals with funds derived from lwcf .
