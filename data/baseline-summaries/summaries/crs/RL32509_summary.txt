section 1106 . 67-13 ; 42 stat . 20-27 ) established for the first time the requirement that the president annually submit a budget proposal to congress . the president's budget proposal , or the budget of the united states government as it is referred to in section 1105 ( a ) of the u.s. code , consists of estimates of spending , revenues , borrowing , and debt ; policy and legislative recommendations ; detailed estimates of the financial operations of federal agencies and programs ; and other information supporting the president's recommendations . initially , the 1921 act required the president to include budget information for the upcoming fiscal year , as well as for the most recently completed and current fiscal years . for fy1999 , it was submitted on may 26 , 1998 â€” 50 calendar days before the deadline . figure 1 shows the number of days the mid - session review was submitted before or after the deadline for each year from fy1973-fy2017 . the submission of the mid - session review was delayed for more than three weeks on nine occasions: fy1985 , fy1986 , fy1987 , and fy1988 under the reagan administration ; fy1994 and fy1998 under the clinton administration ; fy2002 under the george w. bush administration ; and fy2010 and fy2012 under the obama administration . the delays for fy1994 , fy2002 , and fy2010 occurred in presidential transition years . the circumstances surrounding the instances where submission was delayed longer than three weeks are discussed in further detail below . during the first three years of his administration , president reagan submitted the mid - session review either on time or no more than 15 days late . during the next four years of his administration , however , growing and persistent deficits made his relationship with congress on budgetary matters especially turbulent , marked by delay and gridlock in all phases of legislative action on the budget . the mid - session reviews for four consecutive years , fy1985-fy1988 , were submitted between 22 and 46 days late . on september 29 , 1987 , the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 ( title i of p.l . 100-119 ) was enacted , which in part amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( title ii of p.l . 99-177 ) to modify the sequestration process . a requirement was added that the president include in the mid - session review preliminary sequestration estimates as well as the economic and technical assumptions that would be used in the initial sequestration report for the fiscal year due in august . the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the 1987 act noted: for fy 1989 and beyond , the president's july 15 mid - session budget report must provide an estimate of the deficit excess and net deficit reduction computed using the economic and technical assumptions that he will use in the initial sequestration report for that fiscal year . it is imperative that the director of omb actually deliver this mid - session report by july 15 . when he issues the initial sequestration report , he is required to use those same economic and technical assumptions .
