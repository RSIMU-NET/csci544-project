ch . 107 renewable energy research and development , which includes those sections that are under other titles of the 2018 farm bill . the 2018 farm bill made three substantive modifications to bioenergy - related definitions as follows ( 7 u.s.c . "biobased product"â similar to prior law except it expands the term to include renewable chemicals ; 2 . "biorefinery"â defined as a facility that converts renewable biomass or an intermediate ingredient or feedstock of renewable biomass into biofuels , renewable chemicals , or biobased products and may produce electricity ; and 3 . "renewable energy system "â defined as a system that produces useable energy from a renewable source , including the distribution components necessary to move energy produced by the system to the initial point of sale , and other components and ancillary infrastructure such as a storage system , but not any mechanism for dispensing energy at retail ( eg , a blender pump ) . the first two modifications were designed to expand access to federal support for renewable chemicals and intermediate ingredients or feedstocks of renewable biomass , respectively . the last modification was designed to expand access to federal support for ancillary infrastructure ( eg , storage system ) associated with a renewable energy system . administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rural development agency ( rd ) , usda . program overview : the biobased markets program was originally established under the 2002 farm bill as a federal procurement preference program that required federal agencies to purchase biobased products under certain conditions ( 7 u.s.c . the 2008 farm bill renamed the federal biobased procurements preference program as the biobased markets program . usda refers to the program as the biopreferredâ® program . the biopreferredâ® program promotes biobased productsâthose derived from marine and forestry materialsâthrough two initiatives: ( 1 ) a mandatory purchasing requirement for federal agencies and their contractors and ( 2 ) a voluntary labeling initiative for biobased products . products that meet the minimum biobased content criteria may display the usda certified biobased product label . under the biobased markets program , federal agencies and their contractors are generally required to purchase biobased products from 109 categories of goodsâamong which are cleaners , carpets , lubricants , office supplies , and paintsâwhen an agency procures $10,000 or more worth of an item within these categories during the course of a fiscal year , or where the quantity of such items or of functionally equivalent items purchased during the preceding fiscal year was $10,000 or more . changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill ( p.l . 115-334 ) extended the biobased markets program through fy2023 , while adding some new implementation requirements . it requires the secretary to update the eligibility criteria for determining which renewable chemicals will qualify for a "usda certified biobased product" label . the farm bill requires the secretary and the secretary of commerce to develop north american industry classification system ( naics ) codes for both renewable chemical manufacturers and biobased product manufacturers , and for the secretary to establish a national registry of testing centers for biobased products .
