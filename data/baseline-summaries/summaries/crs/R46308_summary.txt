five feasibility studies were conducted . reclamation did not recommend any projects for construction funding , although two studies found feasible alternatives for rural water supply . reclamation issued concluding reports for appraisal investigations and feasibility studies of projects that were not recommended for construction funding . reclamation provided a range of reasons for issuing concluding reports: studies being incomplete , no found feasible alternatives , lack of funding , and program expiration . according to reclamation , some concluding reports were not issued due to a lack of time or resources . in these cases , reclamation considered the appraisal reports as concluding reports for the purposes of the rural water supply program . â§4321 et seq.] critics have sometimes expressed concerns over this approachâspecifically , whether the authorized project would have emerged as the most cost - effective preferred alternative had a feasibility study been performed prior to authorization . each rural water project authorization required that the cost ceilings authorized in the legislation be indexed to adjust for inflation to include the rising cost of materials and labor , which was estimated to be 4% annually . the result of these indexing requirements is that the overall cost of authorized rural water projects has risen and continues to rise due in part to actual federal appropriations for projects falling short of the optimal funding scenarios that were assumed under planning projections . as of early 2020 , reclamation reported that $1.2 billion was needed to construct authorized , ongoing rural water projects . for fy2021 , the administration's budget proposal requested $30.3 million: $8.1 million for ongoing construction at four authorized rural water projects and $22.2 million for o&m of tribal systems ( eg , $14.5 million for the mni wiconi project , $7.7 million for the garrison diversion unit m&i , and $20,000 for the mid - dakota rural water system ) . the fy2021 request is $114.8 million less than fy2020 enacted funding of $145.1 million . the fy2021 request continues a trend since fy2014 in which the president's budget requested reduced funding for rural water projects from prior - year enacted levels . reclamation also has emphasized its authority to accept nonfederal contributions in excess of cost - sharing requirements as one way to expedite projects in the absence of increased federal funding . in the fy2021 budget request , reclamation noted that nonfederal parties have the ability to move forward with important investments in water resources infrastructure by contributing amounts in excess of minimum contributions . the rural water supply act of 2006 ( title i of p.l . 109-451 ) authorized the rural water supply program and directed the secretary of the interior to undertake certain activities to implement the program . specifically , the act directed reclamation to conduct appraisal investigations and feasibility studies ( or to ensure that nonfederal entities conducted such studies ) and to recommend proposed projects to congress for construction authorization and subsequent funding . in 2008 , reclamation published an interim final rule ( 43 c.f.r . â§404 ) that established operating criteria for the program and defined the criteria for the prioritization , eligibility , and evaluation of appraisal investigations and feasibility studies , in accordance with the act .
