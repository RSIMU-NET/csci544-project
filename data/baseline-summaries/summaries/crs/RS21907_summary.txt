each circumstance was different . franklin delano roosevelt was the nation's only president elected to four terms . he was first elected in 1932 . president roosevelt died while serving his fourth term on april 12 , 1945 . the second world war was coming to an end . congress and the american public wanted a memorial to the president . before congress acted with legislation , the treasury department announced plans to place roosevelt's image on the dime . the image on the obverse side of the dime at that time was a winged liberty head "mercury. the mercury dime was first issued in 1916 , so the 25-year requirement had been met and the treasury could act without legislation . the dime was chosen as a tribute because president roosevelt had helped to establish the "march of dimes" fundraising campaign to combat polio . the president had himself suffered from polio . the new design was completed and the new dime was minted by january 30 , 1946 , the late president's birthday and the date for the kick off of the 1946 march of dimes campaign . president john fitzgerald kennedy was elected to office in 1960 . on november 22 , 1963 , the president was assassinated . many memorials and tributes to president kennedy were planned after his death ; the idea to place his likeness on a coin was an early suggestion . in december of 1963 , president johnson sent a message to congress requesting legislation to authorize the minting of 50-cent coins with the image of president kennedy . the image on the obverse side of the half dollar at that time was of benjamin franklin . the likeness of benjamin franklin had been on the coin since 1948 , so the 25-year requirement had not been met . there was some debate in congress about removing benjamin franklin's image and whether more time should pass before the decision was made to put president kennedy's image on a coin . nevertheless , legislation ( h.r . 9413 ) was quickly passed in both the house and senate . on december 30 , 1963 , p.l . 88-256 was enacted authorizing the coinage of the kennedy half dollar . president dwight d. eisenhower was a two - term president first elected in 1952 . president eisenhower had been the commanding general of the victorious forces in europe during world war ii . the president died on march 28 , 1969 . at the time of his death , there was no circulating dollar coin . the previous dollar coin was minted between 1921 and 1935 . it was called the peace dollar ; the obverse side had the image of the statue of liberty's head . legislation ( h.r . 14127 ) to place the likeness of president eisenhower on a dollar coin was introduced in the fall of 1969 . the legislation was passed as title ii of the omnibus bank holding company act , p.l . 91-607 , enacted on december 31 , 1970 . debate about the coin addressed its composition and specifically whether to include any silver . old silver dollars were taken out of circulation because their metal value had become greater than their face value .
