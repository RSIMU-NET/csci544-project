, children receiving survivor's benefits ) . ( see table 1 . ) as discussed in greater detail in the appendix , which describes the methodology used in this report , it is not possible to precisely identify the social security beneficiary status of children on the sipp . among the estimated 8.5 million children living in families that received social security in april 2013 based on sipp data , an estimated 3.2 million ( 37% ) were in families in which social security was reported as having been received on behalf of at least one of the children in the family â€” a number quite close to the 3.3 million child recipients reported by administrative data , four months earlier . ( see figure 1 . ) as noted in the appendix , most , but not all , of these 3.2 million children from the sipp are probably child beneficiaries . another 1.9 million ( 22% ) lived in families where a parent or guardian reported receiving social security benefits , though not directly on behalf of a child . these 5.1 million children are grouped together in analyses that follow as child beneficiaries and children of parents or guardians that receive social security . the remaining 3.4 million children ( 40% ) lived in families where social security was received by someone other than a child or the children's parent ( s ) or guardian ( s ) ; in such cases social security benefits may have been received by an extended family member ( eg , grandparent , aunt or uncle , cousin , niece or nephew ) or an older adult sibling . for this latter group , children may incidently be affected by social security , but not directly as a matter of policy aimed at them . the estimates presented in this report are based on survey data and are subject to respondent misreporting . additionally , the sipp data do not provide the comprehensive detail to precisely identify child beneficiaries . it should also be noted that estimates of the pre - transfer poverty status of children ( i.e. , poverty status excluding social security from total income ) provide one measure of the relative importance of social security in combating poverty . the pre - transfer poverty estimates should not be confused with the full effects on poverty of eliminating the social security program , as some individuals would alter their behavior in absence of the program . identifying child social security beneficiaries on the sipp it is not possible to precisely identify the social security beneficiary status of children on the sipp . the sipp collects information on social security receipt and the reasons for receipt for persons age 15 and over . additionally , it collects information about whether an adult ( defined as a person age 15 and over ) collects social security on behalf of children under age 21 . in such cases , however , it does not identify the specific children in the family for whom social security benefits are received , nor the specific reason ( s ) benefits are received on children's behalf . in such cases it is uncertain whether all or only some children under 21 in the family are direct beneficiaries .
