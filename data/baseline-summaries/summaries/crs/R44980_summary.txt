according to h.rept . 115-230 , the report accompanying h.r . 3266 , the house appropriations bill reflects "a gradual shift towards early stage research and development activities," and includes "a limited scope of deployment activities. the appropriation recommendation in s. 1609 affirms "the importance of the development and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies , which are critical to expanding u.s. energy security and global leadership. both statements are supported with proposed appropriations that would fund most eere programs at levels above the administration's request . 3219 and s. 1609 would provide appropriations for fy2018 above the administration's request of $184 million for sustainable transportation . 3219 would appropriate $268 million for sustainable transportation in fy2018 , while s. 1609 would appropriate $553 million . both appropriations reports also express continued support for the following programs within vehicle technologies that the administration's request would terminate: supertruck ii , the clean cities program , and efforts to reduce energy consumption of the commercial off - road vehicle sector . 3219 would support these and other projects within vehicle technologies at $125 million , while s. 1609 would provide approximately $278 million . 3219 and s. 1609 both recommend appropriations for fy2018 above the administration's request of $134 million for renewable energy . 3219 would appropriate nearly $190 million , while s. 1609 would appropriate nearly $390 million . both bills would provide support for later - stage r&d and deployment projects in contrast to the administration's request . for solar energy , both the house bill and senate committee bill support research in thin - film photovoltaics . 3219 would also encourage access to solar energy for low - income communities . s. 1609 would support solar workforce development training for veterans and continued research for systems integration , balance of system cost reduction , and innovations in manufacturing competitiveness . for wind energy , the house bill supports efforts to lower market barriers for distributed wind including small wind for rural homes , farms , and schools . the senate committee bill would support demonstration projects for distributed wind and offshore wind and would support testing facilities such as the national wind technology center . for the water program , h.r . 3219 would continue to support the hydronext initiative and research , development , and deployment of marine energy components and systems for marine hydrokinetic technology . s. 1609 would support funding for commercial viability of pumped storage hydropower and research into mitigation of marine ecosystem impacts and continued construction of an open - water wave energy test facility . for geothermal , there were no specific comments in h.rept . 115-230 ; s. 1609 would continue to support low - temperature co - produced resources and forge in fy2018 . both bills would provide appropriations for fy2018 above the administration's request of $160 million for energy efficiency . 3219 would appropriate nearly $481 million , while s. 1609 would appropriate nearly $737 million . for advanced manufacturing , h.r . 3219 would provide funds for improvements in steel industry and transient kinetic analysis , and would also support advanced textile research .
