not so , ruled the supreme court . "[b]y properly objecting to the honest - services jury instructions at trial , defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal . to whom should the disclosure be made and what information should it convey ? these questions and others call for particular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohibition in this context. as for skilling himself , it was clear to the court that the conduct with which he was charged and for which he was convicted did not constitute honest services fraud as construed by the court . it left for the lower courts the question of whether this tainted his conviction on other grounds . skilling raised a second constitutional issue â€” namely , that pre - trial publicity made skilling's trial presumptively unfair . here , the court affirmed the holding of the lower court . the court felt the trial court committed no error when it denied skilling's motion for a change of venue given the steps it took to ensure selection of an impartial panel . nor , the court concluded , did actual prejudice taint the jury that convicted skilling . justices sotomayor , stevens , and breyer contended that the trial court's voir dire of prospective jurors should have been more thorough and accordingly dissented from that portion of the opinion . the court's skilling construction of the honest services statute doomed the jury instructions in black's honest services case as well . the court wrote a second opinion , however , to address a separate issue raised there . the seventh circuit had held that black forfeited his right to challenge the erroneous honest services jury instruction when he objected to separate jury verdicts on the government's alternate honest services fraud and money or property fraud theories . they did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the government - proposed special - verdict forms. black afforded the supreme court an opportunity to pass on the foreseeable harm limitation on the honest services statute . the defendants were executives of a publicly held corporation , hollinger international , inc . they were also majority stockholders in a canadian private corporation , ravelston corp. ltd. , which in turn held a controlling interest in hollinger . rather than receive their compensation from hollinger directly , the executives were paid by ravelston out of management fees that ravelston charged hollinger . in order to take greater advantage of canadian tax laws , the executives arranged for , and were compensated from , non - compete agreements between themselves and a hollinger subsidiary . there was a factual dispute regarding the extent to which hollinger's board had knowledge of this arrangement . the defendants argued that the board had been aware of the deal and that the payments they received constituted legitimate compensation for the do - not - compete agreements . in contrast , the government alleged that the do - not - compete payments were actually management payments received without corporate approval . the defendants urged the lower court to adopt the foreseeable harm test .
