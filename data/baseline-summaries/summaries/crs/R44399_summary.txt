according to s.rept . 114-64 , the fy2016 office expense allowance component ranges from $121,120 to $453,274 . the three components result in a single sopoea authorization for each senator that can be used to pay for any type of official expense . each senator can choose how much to allocate to various types of expenses ( eg , travel or personnel or supplies ) , although additional limits pertain to spending on franked mail . each senator may also determine the number , job title , location , and duties of staff within his or her office . the sopoea allocation formula results in varying levels depending on the state from which a senator is elected . both senators from a state receive the same allocation . figure 1 demonstrates the variation in authorization levels that has resulted from the sopoea allocation formula from fy1996 through fy2016 . for fy2016 , sopoea levels range from $3,008,288 to $4,760,211 . the difference between the median level ( $3,064,818 ) and the average ( $3,263,940 ) for fy2016 demonstrates the cluster of similar allocation levels for many states , with a larger differential for some of the larger states . overall funding for the sopoea , described below , has decreased or remained flat in recent years , and the fy2016 maximum , minimum , average , and median allocation levels all remain below the corresponding fy2010 allocation levels . the sopoea for all senators is funded in one line - item within the "contingent expenses of the senate" account in the annual legislative branch appropriations bills . as seen in figure 2 , this appropriations account has decreased in recent years , from a high of $422.0 million in fy2010 to $390.0 million in fy2014 , a decrease of 7.6% , not adjusted for inflation . appropriations acts for fy2015 ( p.l . 114-113 ) continued the fy2014 level . this level represents the lowest funding since the $373.5 million provided in fy2008 . adjusted for inflation , the fy2016 level is approximately equivalent to the fy2004 funding level . the senate has taken actions to reduce this account both directly — for example , the fy2011 continuing appropriations act stated that "each senator's official personnel and office expense allowance ( including the allowance for administrative and clerical assistance , the salaries allowance for legislative assistance to senators , as authorized by the legislative branch appropriation act , 1978 ( p.l . 95-94 ) , and the office expense allowance for each senator's office for each state ) in effect immediately before the date of enactment of this section shall be reduced by 5 percent" — and more indirectly through broader appropriations actions that may have influenced the funding level for this account ( i.e. , continuing resolutions , across - the - board rescissions , and the fy2013 sequestration ) . the sopoea appropriations account includes agency contributions for benefits provided to employees paid by this account . as stated above , it does not include certain services provided to senators from other accounts . this may include , for example , services or allowances provided by the sergeant at arms and doorkeeper of the senate , the secretary of the senate , or the architect of the capitol .
