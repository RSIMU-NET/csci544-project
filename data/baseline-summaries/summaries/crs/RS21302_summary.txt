in response , h.r . 106-398 amended the federal fire prevention and control act ( p.l . in october 2006 , the usfa released two studies addressing these issues . a related issue is the role of the federal government in assisting fire departments to hire personnel . in the 108 th congress , congress enacted the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response firefighters ( safer ) act as section 1057 of the fy2004 national defense authorization act ( p.l . the safer act authorizes federal grants of over $1 billion per year through 2010 directly to fire departments for the hiring of firefighters and recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters . from fy2001 through fy2003 , the assistance to firefighters grant ( afg ) program ( as part of usfa / fema ) received its primary appropriation through the va - hud - independent agencies appropriation act . in fy2004 , the assistance to firefighters program began to receive its annual appropriation through the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on homeland security . award caps were raised , nonfederal matching requirements were lowered , eligibility was extended to include nonaffiliated emergency medical services ( i.e . ambulance services not affiliated with fire departments ) , and the scope of grants was expanded to include firefighter safety r&d . 4200 did not contain the provision on volunteer firefighter discrimination . the reauthorization legislation designated the usfa administrator as the administering authority of the fire grant program . 4200 was signed into law ( p.l . 108-375 ) on october 28 , 2004 . section 3603 of p.l . 108-375 directed usfa , in conjunction with the national fire protection association , to assess the needs and capacity of fire departments and to measure the impact of the fire grant program in meeting the needs of the fire service . the program received an appropriation of $100 million in fy2001 ( its initial year ) , $360 million in fy2002 , $745 million in fy2003 , $746 million in fy2004 , $650 million in fy2005 , $539 million in fy2006 , $547 million in fy2007 , and $560 million in fy2008 . table 1 shows recent appropriated funding for firefighter assistance . a primary issue in the 110 th congress is how appropriations for fire grants should compare with the authorized levels of $1 billion for those years . the administration's budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants , as well as zero funding for safer grants . opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments , while the administration has cited the availability of other risk - based dhs first responder grant programs , and has argued that reduced levels for afg are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of a terrorist attack or major disaster . aside from budget issues , an ongoing issue has been the focus of the fire grant program . administration budget proposals have sought to shift the priority of the fire grant program to terrorism preparedness . firefighting groups have questioned this proposed shift , arguing that the original purpose of the fire act ( enhancing basic firefighting needs ) should not be compromised or diluted .
