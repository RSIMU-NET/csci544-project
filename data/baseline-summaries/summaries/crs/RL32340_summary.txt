they can be extinguished at will and created at will . itdoes not even require concurrence of the other body when we take such an action . deprivingmembers of the right to vote in a committee is fully within the power of the house , by abolishingthe committee . giving them additional rights to vote is within the power of the house by creatinga new committeeâ¦ . nothing that the resident commissioner could do in a committee vote couldbecome a final decision unless a majority of the elected members of congress supported his position . however , in the standing committee itself i think that the member from puerto rico should havea vote . ( 22 ) an immediate question arose: should the delegate serve in the house or in the senate ? thenorthwest ordinance , which had been enacted by the unicameral congress under the articles ofconfederation , had only specified a "seat in congress. some members of congress argued that theproper place for delegate white was the senate since his method of election , by the territoriallegislature , was similar to that of senators . others suggested that perhaps mr. white should sit inboth chambers . proposals for seeking senate concurrence in the matter of admitting delegate whiteand for confining his right of debate to territorial matters were dismissed . on november 18 , 1794,the house approved the resolution to admit delegate white to a nonvoting seat in that body . ( 23 ) at least one delegate hasserved in every congress since , with the single exception of the fifth congress ( 1797-1799 ) . debate surrounding delegate white's taking the oath further revealed house members'various perceptions of his status . some members believed that mr. white should be required to takethe oath . representative james madison disagreed . he argued: the proper definition of mr. white is to be found in thelaws and rules of the constitution . he is not a member of congress , therefore , and so cannot bedirected to take an oath , unless he chooses to do it voluntarily .

( 25 ) ultimately , the house decided that since mr. white was not a member , he was not requiredto take the oath . ( 26 ) atthe same time , congress , by law , granted mr. white the same franking privileges and compensationas members of the house . ( 27 ) the white case established several precedents for the treatment of future delegates .
