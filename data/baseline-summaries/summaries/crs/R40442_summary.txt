( figure 3 ) . reduce crop insurance subsidies . the proposal is not detailed , but savings could be achieved by reducing the subsidy on premiums that farmers pay , reducing underwriting gains received by the insurance companies that sell the policies , or reducing administrative and operating expense reimbursements to the insurance companies . the administration estimates savings of $5.2 billion over 10 years . relative to the $72 billion of crop insurance subsidies estimated from fy2010-fy2019 in the cbo baseline , the proposal would reduce the crop insurance baseline by 7.2% over 10 years ( table 3 , figure 2 ) . the budget also mentions reductions in the market access program ( map ) and elimination of the resource conservation and development ( rc&d ) program , both of which are outside the scope of the farm commodity programs . much of the attention given to the administration's budget proposal has centered on the proposal to eliminate direct payments to farms with sales of more than $500,000 . several observations may be made about the effect of using a limit on sales , and on the number and types of farms that would be affected . a limit on sales would add a new type of "payment limit" for farm commodity support . currently there is ( 1 ) a limit on amount of payments that a farmer can actually receive , and ( 2 ) an adjusted gross income ( agi ) limit to determine eligibility . the proposal would add a third type of payment limit — an eligibility test of $500,000 of gross farm sales . a $500,000 limit on sales generally would be more restrictive than the existing agi limit of $750,000 of "farm agi" ( after expenses ) and $500,000 of "nonfarm agi. the agi measure is after expenses are subtracted from income ; farms with $750,000 of farm agi likely have sales exceeding $1-$2 million or more . the proposed limit on sales would be on a gross basis — that is , before expenses . gross farm sales may be more variable than net farm sales ( "farm agi" ) . net farm sales are less variable because higher expenses may offset higher sales . thus , many opponents to the proposal have argued that farms exceeding a $500,000 sales limit may have very little profit or even a loss . the high magnitude of commodity price increases during 2007-2008 changed the share of farms with sales over $500,000 from the 3% - 4% share of the previous nine years to 5.5% in 2007-2008 . although this share may decline in the future given the drop in commodity prices since the fall of 2008 , it highlights that sales may be variable and more subject to "bracket creep" than net measures of income . sales vary directly with prices and yields . years with high prices or yields could push farms over the limit . in contrast , a net income measure may be more constant if higher production expenses occur or tax management tools are used . for example , expenses may vary in proportion to production ( eg , costs per acre , fertilizer - to - yield ) .
