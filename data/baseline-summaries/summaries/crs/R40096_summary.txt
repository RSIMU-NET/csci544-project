appendix a . comparative time line for implementing the 1997 and 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs the time line presented in table a - 1 reflects the most recent key milestone dates for implementing the 1997 and the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs , including actual completions . these milestones are driven primarily by statutory requirements . circuit court's decision . on january 15 , 2013 , epa published a final rule further revising the pm naaqs . the january 2013 revisions changed the existing ( 2006 ) annual health - based ( "primary" ) standard for "fine" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ( or pm 2.5 ) , lowering the allowable average concentration of pm 2.5 in the air from the current level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter ( µg / m 3 ) to a limit of 12 µg / m 3 . the existing primary daily ( 24-hour ) standard for pm 2.5 that was reduced from 65 µg / m 3 to 35 µg / m 3 in 2006 was retained , as was the existing standard for larger , but still inhalable , "coarse" particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter , or pm 10 . "secondary" standards that provide protection against "welfare" ( non - health ) effects , such as ecological effects and material deterioration , are identical to the primary standards and the same as in 2006 . the proposed rule regarding the pm naaqs published june 29 , 2012 , solicited comments on two options for a 24-hour pm 2.5 standard to improve visibility that were not adopted in the final rule . for an overview of the revisions to the pm naaqs published january 15 , 2013 , see crs report r42934 , air quality: epa's 2013 changes to the particulate matter ( pm ) standard , by [author name scrubbed] . the following sections of this report focus primarily on the naaqs implementation process for designating geographical nonattainment areas with respect to the revisions to the pm 2.5 standards under the 2006 particulates naaqs , including comparisons with the final designations under the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs . if states fail to develop an adequate implementation plan , epa can impose one . under caa , states are required to meet the 2006 pm 2.5 standard "as expeditiously as practicable," but no later than five years from the effective date of designation , which would be december 2014 , unless an extension allowed under the caa is granted . the designation of geographical areas unable to meet the naaqs is a critical step in naaqs implementation , and historically has been an issue of concern and debate among epa , states and tribes , various stakeholders , and some members of congress . epa's 2006 revisions of the pm 2.5 standards increased the number of areas ( typically defined by counties or portions of counties ) in nonattainment , and subsequently will potentially result in an encumbrance on states to achieve compliance . a february 24 , 2009 , decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit did not vacate the 2006 standards but granted petitions in part , denying other challenges , and remanded the standards to epa for further consideration .
