title xv of p.l . 111-5 additionally tasked the council of economic advisers ( cea ) with submitting quarterly reports to the committees on appropriations on the effect of arra - provisions on employment and other economic indicators . the cea's mandate thus extends well beyond the above - described reporting requirements , which apply only to $271 billion in direct government investment spending out of a total of $787 billion . the first quarterly report of the cea was issued in september 2009 . based on two different estimating procedures , it found that arra might have added some one million jobs to employer payrolls in august 2009 compared to what employment would have been in the absence of the legislation . as noted above , cbo was charged in arra with commenting on the number of jobs created or saved as a result of direct government purchases of goods and services , grants and loans to private entities , and grants to states and localities . although it did so in estimated impact of the american recovery and reinvestment act on employment and economic output as of september 2009 , cbo went further to provide a broader estimate than can be gleaned from the reports of primary and secondary recipients of more than $25,000 from appropriations in arra ; it is an estimate more comparable to that of the cea . based upon information provided by macroeconomic models and historical relationships , cbo estimated that arra's tax cuts and outlay increases that occurred through september 2009 increased the number of people employed by between 600,000 and 1.6 million compared to the employment level without the law . the cea's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs as of august 2009 , discussed in the preceding paragraph , falls within the range estimated by cbo . in its second quarterly report , released in january 2010 , the cea estimated the effect of arra on employment through december 2009 . it found that the stimulus law might have raised year - end employment by about 1.7 – 1.9 million jobs above what it otherwise would have been . similarly , cbo estimated in its report covering the fourth quarter of 2009 that arra's policies might have increased the number of people employed by 1.0 – 2.1 million . the cea's third quarterly report , released in april 2010 , showed arra's employment effect through march 2010 . it estimated that the law might have raised employment by 2.2 – 2.8 million jobs above what it otherwise would have been as of the first quarter of 2010 . similarly , cbo estimated in its report covering the first quarter of 2010 that arra's policies might have increased the number of people employed by 1.2 – 2.8 million . the fourth quarterly arra jobs report of the cea covering the second quarter of 2010 was released on july 14 . based on the two methods utilized by the cea , arra might have increased employment compared to what it otherwise would have been in the quarter by between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs .
