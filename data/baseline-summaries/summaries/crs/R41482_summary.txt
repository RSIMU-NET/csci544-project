the dominican republic continues to experience relative political stability and steady economic growth . with high approval ratings and a large congressional majority , most analysts predict that president medina will be able to pass reforms rather easily through 2016 . dominican - u.s. relations could become strained , however , due to u.s. concerns about human rights and labor issues . a population of about 10.3 million occupies an area about the size of new hampshire and vermont combined . between 900,000 and 1.2 million of the people currently living in the dominican republic are undocumented ; many of them are haitians or descended from haitians . with a per capita gross domestic product ( gdp ) of roughly $5,770 ( 2013 ) , the dominican republic is classified by the world bank as an upper middle - income country . this stands in sharp contrast to neighboring haiti , a low - income country with a per capita gdp of just $810 ( 2013 ) that was struggling economically even before a devastating earthquake hit the country in january 2010 . the two countries had similar gdp per capita levels in 1960 , but while growth in haiti has stagnated and its per capita gdp has shrunk by half since that time , the dominican republic has posted one of the fastest growth rates in latin america , and its per capita gdp has quadrupled . after fighting to achieve its independence from spain in 1821 and then from haiti in 1844 , the dominican republic embarked upon a bumpy road toward its current democratic form of government characterized by frequent coups , dictatorships , and u.s. interventions ( including 1916-1924 and 1965-1966 ) . rafael trujillo ruled the country as a dictator from 1930 to 1961 , often employing violent tactics to quell political opposition . despite his brutality , trujillo's strong anticommunist stance earned him tacit support from the united states . his acolyte , joaquín balaguer , then served as president from 1960-1962 , 1966-1978 , and 1986-1996 . as a result of the dominance of these caudillo ( strongman ) leaders , the dominican republic did not develop into a modern democracy until the 1990s . in 1994 , an agreement commonly referred to as the "pact for democracy" removed the aging balaguer from power and paved the way for the country's first truly free and fair elections to be held in 1996 . since the mid - 1990s , the dominican republic has , for the most part , continued to post solid economic growth ( see figure 2 below ) and developed democratic institutions , albeit with very high levels of corruption . in 1996 , leonel fernández of the center - left dominican liberation party ( pld ) succeeded joaquín balaguer as president and presided over a period of strong economic growth fueled by expansion in tourism and free trade zones . in the 2000 presidential elections , after top pld officials were charged with misusing public funds , hipólito mejía ( 2000-2004 ) , an agrarian engineer of the populist dominican revolutionary party ( prd ) , defeated the pld candidate , danilo medina .
