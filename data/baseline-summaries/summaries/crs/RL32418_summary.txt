appendix a . past ssn force - level goals this appendix summarizes attack submarine force - level goals since the reagan administration ( 1981-1989 ) . the reagan - era plan for a 600-ship navy included an objective of achieving and maintaining a force of 100 ssns . the george h. w. bush administration's proposed base force plan of 1991-1992 originally called for a navy of more than 400 ships , including 80 ssns . in 1992 , however , the ssn goal was reduced to about 55 boats as a result of a 1992 joint staff force - level requirement study ( updated in 1993 ) that called for a force of 51 to 67 ssns , including 10 to 12 with seawolf - level acoustic quieting , by the year 2012 . the clinton administration , as part of its 1993 bottom - up review ( bur ) of u.s. defense policy , established a goal of maintaining a navy of about 346 ships , including 45 to 55 ssns . the clinton administration's 1997 qdr supported a requirement for a navy of about 305 ships and established a tentative ssn force - level goal of 50 boats , "contingent on a reevaluation of peacetime operational requirements. the clinton administration later amended the ssn figure to 55 boats ( and therefore a total of about 310 ships ) . the reevaluation called for in the 1997 qdr was carried out as part of a joint chiefs of staff ( jcs ) study on future requirements for ssns that was completed in december 1999 . the study had three main conclusions: "that a force structure below 55 ssns in the 2015 [time frame] and 62 [ssns] in the 2025 time frame would leave the cinc's [the regional military commanders - in - chief] with insufficient capability to respond to urgent crucial demands without gapping other requirements of higher national interest . additionally , this force structure [55 ssns in 2015 and 62 in 2025] would be sufficient to meet the modeled war fighting requirements" ; "that to counter the technologically pacing threat would require 18 virginia class ssns in the 2015 time frame" ; and "that 68 ssns in the 2015 [time frame] and 76 [ssns] in the 2025 time frame would meet all of the cincs' and national intelligence community's highest operational and collection requirements. the conclusions of the 1999 jcs study were mentioned in discussions of required ssn force levels , but the figures of 68 and 76 submarines were not translated into official dod force - level goals . the george w. bush administration's report on the 2001 qdr revalidated the amended requirement from the 1997 qdr for a fleet of about 310 ships , including 55 ssns . in revalidating this and other u.s. military force - structure goals , the report cautioned that as dod's "transformation effort matures — and as it produces significantly higher output of military value from each element of the force — dod will explore additional opportunities to restructure and reorganize the armed forces. dod and the navy conducted studies on undersea warfare requirements in 2003-2004 .
