then the alternative minimum tax could be eliminated . it is unlikely , however , that the tax base of the regular individual income tax will be broadened to the point where there would be no place for an alternative minimum tax . the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 ( p.l . 101-509 ) increased the amt tax rate from 21% to 24% . omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 ( p.l . 103-66 ) made two major changes in the amt . first , it increased the amt exemption amounts from $40,000 to $45,000 for taxpayers filing joint returns , from $30,000 to $33,750 for taxpayers filing single returns , and from $20,000 to $22,500 for married taxpayers filing separately , estates , and trusts . second , it created a two - tiered tax rate structure for the amt . a 26% tax rate is applicable to the first $175,000 of a taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income in excess of the exemption amount and 28% on alternative minimum taxable income in excess of $175,000 . the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( p.l . 105-34 ) established that the maximum tax rate applicable to capital gains income under the regular income tax would also apply to capital gains income under the amt . the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act , 1999 ( p.l . 105-277 ) allowed the nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset an individual's regular income tax in full for tax year 1998 only , even though the personal tax credits might be larger than the amount by which the taxpayer's regular income tax exceeded his tentative minimum tax . in addition , it repealed , for tax year 1998 only , the provision that reduced the additional child tax credit by the amount by which an individual's amt exceeded his regular income tax liability . another legislative change in the amt occurred in the tax relief extension act of 1999 ( p.l . 106-170 ) which extended , through december 31 , 2001 , the existing law tax provision that allows individuals to offset their regular income tax by the full amount of their nonrefundable personal tax credits regardless of the amt . the report will be updated as legislative action warrants . the first individual minimum tax was enacted in 1969 and was an add - on minimum tax . that is , it was a tax that was paid in addition to the regular income tax . the tax rate for the add - on minimum tax was 10% and the tax base consisted of eight tax preference items , the most significant of which was the portion of capital gains income that was excluded from tax under the regular income tax . since its enactment in 1969 , the individual minimum tax has been modified numerous times , in 1971 , in 1976 , in 1977 , in 1978 , in 1982 , in 1986 , in 1990 , in 1993 , in 1997 , in 1998 , in 2001 , in 2002 , in 2003 , in 2004 , in 2006 , in 2007 , in 2008 , and in 2009 .
