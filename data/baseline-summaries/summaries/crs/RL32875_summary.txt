after the enactment of p.l . 104-193 ( the 1996 welfare reform law ) , there was a sharp drop in tanf cases overall and thereby tanf cases in the cse program , given that tanf cases are automatically enrolled in the cse program . the cse caseload reached its peak in fy1998 with 19.4 million cases and has steadily fallen , with some fluctuations , since then . even though tanf cases declined steadily after welfare reform , the number of children born to unmarried women did not reach its peak until 2008 . moreover , the percentage of births to unmarried women held steady at 41% from 2008 through 2013 . in 2014 , it dropped slightly to 40%.thus , a full understanding of why the cse caseload has fallen remains unclear . in fy2015 , there were 14.7 million cse cases ( a reduction of 24% since fy1998 ) . the underlying data for figure 2 ( shown in table a - 2 ) indicate that afdc cases comprised 85% of the cse caseload in fy1978 , but tanf dropped to about 10% of the caseload in fy2015 . by the same token , non - afdc cases represented only about 15% of the cse caseload in fy1978 , and non - tanf cases increased to almost 90% of the caseload in fy2015 . in judicial cases , child support staff collects information and other evidence about the alleged father and refers the case to the state child support attorney ( referred to as the iv - d attorney ) for legal action . the iv - d attorney represents the state child support agency . a parent may also hire a private attorney to represent him or her . when the case goes to trial , the mother may be required to be present in court to testify about the father . if the custodial parent lives in a different state , the custodial parent may be allowed to present testimony telephonically . figure 4 shows the number of paternities established or acknowledged in the cse program during the period from fy1978 through fy2015 and the number of births to unmarried women during the period from fy1978 through fy2014 . it indicates that the number of paternities established or acknowledged increased substantially from fy1978-fy1999 , dropped in fy2000 , fluctuated between fy2001 and fy2003 , increased from fy2004 to fy2009 , and has fallen in each of the years beginning with fy2010 . during the period fy1978-fy2015 , the number of paternities established or acknowledged nationwide increased 1,241% from 111,000 in fy1978 to 1,484,477 in fy2015 ( see table 3 ) . from its high of 1,810,564 in fy2009 , the number of paternities established or acknowledged fell 18% nationwide , from 1.8 million in fy2009 to about 1.5 million in fy2015 . it should be noted that in any given year , the cse program establishes paternity for both babies born outside of marriage in the given year as well as for older children ( up to age 18 ) who were born outside of marriage . table a - 2 also indicates that the cse caseload increased 256% over the period fy1978-fy2015 , from 4.146 million in fy1978 to 14.745 million in fy2015 .
