for example , p.l . 108-84 ( 117 stat . 1043 ) , the first continuing resolution for fy2004 , set the duration of the measure at 31 days: sec . procedures under the act were fully implemented beginning in fy1977 , and this change in the start of the fiscal year yielded immediate results — all of the regular appropriations acts for fy1977 were enacted on time . this initial success , however , was short - lived , and congressional reliance on continuing resolutions has persisted in the ensuing years . as was previously noted , after fy1977 , all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only three other instances — for fy1989 , fy1995 , and fy1997 . consequently , one or more continuing resolutions were needed each year during this period . in total , 161 continuing resolutions were enacted into law during the period covering fy1977-fy2012 , ranging from zero to 21 in any single fiscal year . on average , about six continuing resolutions were enacted each fiscal year during this interval ( see table 3 , at the end of the report , for further information on all crs enacted between fy1977 and fy2012 ) . full - year continuing resolutions provide funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year ( through june 30 for fy1976 and prior years , and through september 30 for fy1977 and subsequent years ) . they represent a determination by congress to abandon any further efforts to enact separately the remaining unfinished regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year , and to bring the annual appropriations process for that year to a close ( except for the later consideration of supplemental appropriations acts ) . while congress has employed full - year continuing resolutions on many occasions , it has not done so consistently over time . prior to the full implementation of the budget act in fy1977 , full - year continuing resolutions were used occasionally . full - year continuing resolutions , for example , were enacted into law for four of the six preceding fiscal years ( fy1971 , fy1973 , fy1975 , and fy1976 ) . following the successful completion of action on the regular appropriations acts for fy1977 , congress returned to the use of full - year continuing resolutions for more than a decade . for each of the 11 fiscal years following fy1977 , covering fy1978-fy1988 , congress enacted a full - year continuing resolution covering at least one regular appropriations act . three years later , congress enacted another full - year continuing resolution , for fy1992 . most recently , a full - year continuing resolution was enacted for fy2011 .
