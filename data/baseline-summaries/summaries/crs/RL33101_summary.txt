table 1 . native hawaiian recognition bills incongres . congress has enacted a number of programs for native hawaiians , in addition to thehawaiian home lands program . ( 130 ) one concern among proponents of native hawaiianrecognition is that many or all of these federal programs for native hawaiians may beendangered if a native hawaiian political entity is not created . ( 131 ) federal nativehawaiian programs either are solely for native hawaiian communities or organizations orexplicitly include native hawaiian communities or organizations among the eligibleapplicants . some of these programs benefit indians as well . the programs provide a notinsignificant amount of federal dollars for native hawaiians . a 2003 report of the councilfor native hawaiian advancement estimated that in fy2002 over $70 million flowed intohawaii because of such native hawaiian programs . ( 132 ) among themajor federal native hawaiian programs listed in the catalog of federal domestic assistance ( cfda ) ( 133 ) are the following . native hawaiian education act ( p.l . 107-110 , title vii , part b ) ; f2004obligations were $33.3 million , according to the cfda . higher education act , title iii , institutional aid for alaska native andnative hawaiian serving institutions . native hawaiian health care improvement act ( p.l . 102-396 ) ; f2004obligations were $10.5 million , according to the cfda . native hawaiian housing block grants ( p.l . 106-569 , hawaiianhomelands homeownership act , â§513 ) ; f2004 obligations were $9.6 million , according tothe cfda . loan guarantees for native hawaiian housing ( p.l . 106-569 , hawaiianhomelands homeownership act , â§514 ) ; f2004 loan guarantees were $39.7 million , accordingto the cfda . native american programs act of 1974 ( p.l . 93-644 , as amended ) ; shared program with indians and native american pacific islanders ; total program fy2004obligations were $35 million , according to the cfda . native american employment and training ( p.l . 105-220 , â§166 ) ; shared program with indians ; total program fy2004 obligations were $55 million , accordingto the cfda . while the senate did not passh.r . 4904 , the bill would have been enacted through a provision in theconsolidated appropriations act , 2001 ( h.r . 106-554 ) , until a senateconcurrent resolution removed the provision by correcting the enrollment of h.r.4577 ( s.con.res . ( 128 ) all the billsprovided for a recognition process very similar to that in s. 147 and h.r . 309 , but differed in various other provisions , including the determinationof land transfers to , and the jurisdictional powers of , a native hawaiian political entity . thenature of the federal government's relationship to native hawaiians was an issue long beforethe 106th congress , however , in both the department of the interior ( 129 ) and the halls ofcongress . congress came closest to enacting a native hawaiian recognition bill in the 106thcongress , when the house passed h.r . native hawaiian recognition bills have been considered in the 106th - 108th congresses,and at least one of the bills has been reported in each congress ( see table 1 below ) .
