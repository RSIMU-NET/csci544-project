, u.s. treasury securities ) . the deficit continued to grow in 2011 by 15% . overall u.s. trade deficits reflect a shortage of savings in the domestic economy and a reliance on capital imports to finance that shortfall . a savings shortfall is the analogue of excessive spending that is financed by borrowing . in the 112 th congress , legislation directed at the trade deficit has been taking several strategies . some bills address trade barriers by particular countries , particularly china . others are aimed at preventing manipulation of exchange rates or at imposing import duties to compensate for the arguably undervalued chinese currency , as tracked in greater detail by other crs reports . the merchandise ( goods ) trade balance is the most widely known and frequently used indicator of u.s. international economic activity . also important is the concept of total merchandise trade , total exports plus total imports . in 2011 , total merchandise trade reached $3,688 billion , a 16% increase over the 2010 value . this follows a 22% increase in 2010 ( to $3,191 billion ) and a 23% decrease in 2009 ( to $2,616 billion ) . merchandise exports in 2011 totaled $1,480 billion , while imports reached $2,208 billion ( census basis ) . the u.s. merchandise trade deficit fell massively from $816 billion in 2008 to $504 billion in 2009 but then increased to $635 billion in 2010 and $727 billion in 2011 ( figure 7 ) . u.s. merchandise exports decreased in 2001 and 2002 in response to the global slowdown , but then generally increased each year until 2009 ( table 4 ) . as shown in figure 8 , the growth of imports has also been steady , although they too fell by 6.4% in 2001 before recovering in 2002 . in 2003 , import growth was nearly double export growth , although in 2004 , export growth almost caught up with that of imports , and in 2005 , the rate of increase for both dropped slightly . growth in exports and imports slowed in 2007 with exports rising by 12.3% and imports by 5.7% . likewise in 2008 , exports grew faster than imports ( 12.4% versus 7.3% ) , but the trade deficit still increased . this is because u.s. imports are greater than u.s. exports , so exports must grow significantly faster than imports just for the deficit to remain constant . then in 2009 , with the full force of the financial crisis , exports decreased more slowly than imports ( - 17.9% versus - 25.9% ) , before each took a sharp upward turn in 2010 as recovery began . in 2010 exports rose by 21% , followed by a slowing to 16% growth in 2011 . u.s. imports grew 23% in 2010 followed by 15% in 2011 . the current account provides a broader measure of u.s. trade because it includes services , investment income , and unilateral transfers in addition to merchandise trade ( table 5 ) . the balance on services includes travel , transportation , fees and royalties , insurance payments , and other government and private services .
