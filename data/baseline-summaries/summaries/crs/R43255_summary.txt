appendix a . additional resources below are resources for additional information about each mental health provider type , including national associations of state boards , professional associations , accrediting organizations for educational programs , and other relevant organizations . in some cases , a single organization may serve multiple roles ( eg , a professional association may also accredit educational programs ) . psychiatrists american academy of addiction psychiatry ( aaap ) : http: / / www.aaap.org / american academy of child & adolescent psychiatry ( aacap ) : http: / / www.aacap.org / american academy of clinical psychiatrists ( aacp ) : http: / / www.aacp.com / american board of medical specialties ( abms ) : http: / / www.abms.org / american board of psychiatry and neurology ( abpn ) : http: / / www.abpn.com / american psychiatric association ( apa ) : http: / / www.psychiatry.org / national board of osteopathic examiners: http: / / www.nbome.org / psychologists american psychological association ( apa ) : http: / / www.apa.org / association of state and provincial psychology boards ( asppb ) : http: / / www.asppb.net / social workers association of social work boards ( aswb ) : http: / / www.aswb.org / council on social work education ( cswe ) : http: / / www.cswe.org national association of social workers ( nasw ) : http: / / www.socialworkers.org / social work policy institute ( swpi ) : http: / / www.socialworkpolicy.org / advanced practice psychiatric nurses american academy of nurse practitioners ( aanp ) : http: / / www.aanp.org / american nurses credentialing center ( ancc ) : http: / / www.nursecredentialing.org / american psychiatric nurses association ( apna ) : http: / / www.apna.org / national association of clinical nurse specialists ( nacns ) : http: / / www.nacns.org / national council of state boards of nursing ( ncsbn ) : http: / / www.ncsbn.org / marriage and family therapists american association for marriage and family therapy ( aamft ) :  http: / / www.aamft.org / association of marital and family therapy regulatory boards ( amftrb ) : http: / / www.amftrb.org / . workforce data are collected and reported by multiple sources . however , each source has its limitations in assessing the overall size of the workforce . hrsa designates mental health professional shortage areas ( mhpsas ) based on the ratios of psychiatrists , appns , clinical psychologists , clinical social workers , and mfts to the population ; however , hrsa does not systematically collect the data used to designate mhpsas ( see text box ) . hrsa's area health resource files ( ahrf ) compiles health - related data from various sources . the ahrf draws much of its health workforce data from datasets created by — and more readily available from — the department of labor . some other sources of health workforce data in the ahrf are updated infrequently , if at all . for example , the 2016-2017 arhf includes the number of psychologists from a 2009 analysis by a private research center . thus , other sources of mental health workforce size estimates may be more useful than the ahrf to policymakers .
