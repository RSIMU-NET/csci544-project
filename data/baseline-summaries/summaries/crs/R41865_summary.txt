reports . most legislation never proceeds through full committee consideration and remains in committee for the remainder of a congress . however , committees may , by majority vote , report some bills and resolutions for consideration by the entire chamber . the house requires a written report on the legislation , but the senate does not . how did members vote on proposed amendments and final passage ? to answer these and similar questions , researchers must identify the chronological steps the legislation followed through congress and the materials that document what happened during each of these steps . this report briefly describes the actions a piece of legislation might undergo during the legislative process and provides information on resources for retrieving legislative history materials . this report focuses on legislative history research , and therefore does not contain detailed information about the legislative process . however , because a general understanding of the legislative process is helpful when compiling a legislative history , overviews of certain congressional actions are provided . detailed guides on the legislative process for the house and senate are available online: how our laws are made , revised and updated , by john v. sullivan parliamentarian , united states house of representatives presented by mr. brady of pennsylvania july 24 , 2007 https: / / www.congress.gov / resources / display / content / how+our+laws+are+made+ - +learn+about+the+legislative+process enactment of a law by robert b. dove parliamentarian , united states senate updated: february 1997 https: / / www.congress.gov / resources / display / content / enactment+of+a+law+ - +learn+about+the+legislative+process in addition , there are a number of congressional research service ( crs ) reports on various aspects of the legislative process referenced throughout this report and available on crs's website at http: / / www.crs.gov . the legislative history resource materials discussed below vary in scope and availability . for example , the government printing office's ( gpo's ) federal digital system ( fdsys ) , through its website http: / / www.gpo.gov / fdsys / search / home.action , is an online collection of official congressional publications and databases containing texts of legislation , the congressional record , house and senate calendars , committee prints , committee hearings , committee reports , and other material useful for legislative research . however , the information available on these websites is limited to more recent congresses . by contrast , print publications may be more historically complete , but limited to only one type of document or information . for example , the congressional record and its predecessor publications , which are available in print going back to 1789 , contain information on procedural actions for legislation and transcripts of the proceedings on the house and senate floor , but do not contain the text of committee hearings . the references cited below are available online through government sources or in hard copy through crs or the law library of congress . they are also commonly available at local libraries , law libraries , or federal depository libraries . gpo has a website to assist patrons in finding the nearest depository library , at http: / / catalog.gpo.gov / fdlpdir / fdlpdir.jsp . references to commercial services that require subscriptions are limited to those available in all congressional offices .
