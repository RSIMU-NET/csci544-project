foreign capital inflows are playing an important role in the economy . such inflows bridge the gap between u.s. supplies and demands for credit , thereby allowing consumers and businesses to finance purchases at interest rates that are lower than they would be without overseas capital inflows . similarly , capital inflows allow federal , state , and local governments to finance their budget deficits at rates that are lower than they would be otherwise . these foreign capital inflows allow the nation to support expenditures exceeding its current output level and finance its trade deficit . a sharp reduction in those inflows likely would complicate domestic efforts at making and conducting economic policies . to date , the world economy has benefitted from the stimulus provided by the nation's combination of fiscal and monetary policies and a trade deficit . foreign investors now hold slightly less than 55% of the publicly held and publicly traded u.s. treasury securities , 26% of corporate bonds , and about 12% of u.s. corporate stocks . the large foreign accumulation of u.s. securities has spurred some observers to argue that this foreign presence in u.s. financial markets increases the risk of a financial crisis , whether as a result of the uncoordinated actions of market participants or by a coordinated withdrawal from u.s. financial markets by foreign investors for economic or political reasons . in 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , and 2010 , net official inflows exceeded net private inflows . recently , private capital flows by u.s. citizens shifted from a net outflow of $1.4 trillion in 2007 to a net inflow of $866 billion in 2008 , reflecting the financial turmoil during that period . net private outflows by u.s. citizens , however , resumed in the 2009 to 2011 period . during the same period , u.s. official outflows increased from $22 billion in 2007 to $530 billion in 2008 . in contrast , foreign private inflows of capital dropped from $1.6 trillion in 2007 to $47 billion in 2008 . during the same period , foreign official inflows increased slightly from $481 billion in 2007 to $487 billion in 2008 . as a result of these changes , net official flows , or the combination of u.s. and foreign officials flows dropped from a net outflow of $458 billion 2007 to a net inflow of $47 billion in 2008 . in addition , net private flows increased from a net inflow of $199 billion in 2007 to a net inflow of $581 billion in 2008 . in 2009 , however , net private inflows dropped to a negative $774 billion , while net official inflows rose to nearly $1 trillion , as indicated in table 1 economists generally attribute the rise in foreign investment in the united states to comparatively favorable returns on investments relative to risk , a surplus of saving in other areas of the world , the well - developed u.s. financial system , and the overall stability of the u.s. economy .
