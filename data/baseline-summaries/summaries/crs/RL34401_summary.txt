among its provisions , p.l . 112-144 directs the secretary of health and human services to intensify and expand activities related to enhancing scientific knowledge regarding nanomaterials included or intended for inclusion in products regulated under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act or other statutes administered by the food and drug administration , to address issues relevant to the regulation of those products , including the potential toxicology of such nanomaterials , the potential benefit of new therapies derived from nanotechnology , the effects of such nanomaterials on biological systems , and the interaction of such nanomaterials with biological systems . other investments have supported infrastructural technologies . for example , nist has contributed to developing tools and standards that enable measurement and control of matter at the nanoscale , thereby supporting the conduct of r&d and the ability to manufacture nanoscale materials and products . as understanding of nanotechnology has matured , the nni has worked with a variety of industry organizations to facilitate the movement of research results from the laboratory bench to the marketplace in fields as disparate as semiconductors , energy , concrete , and forest products . the nni agencies also have sought to address research needs and regulatory issues related to environmental , health , and safety , as well as issues such as public understanding and workforce education and training . record_id=13347 report to the president and congress on the fourth assessment of the national nanotechnology initiative , pcast ( acting as the nnap ) , april 2012. http: / / www.whitehouse.gov / sites / default / files / microsites / ostp / pcast_2012_nanotechnology_final.pdf review of federal strategy for nanotechnology - related environmental , health , and safety research , committee for review of the federal strategy to address environmental , health , and safety research needs for engineered nanoscale materials , committee on toxicology , nrc , 2009. http: / / www.nap.edu / catalog.php ? record_id=12559#toc report to the president and congress on the third assessment of the national nanotechnology initiative , pcast ( acting as the nnap ) , march 2010. http: / / www.whitehouse.gov / sites / default / files / microsites / ostp / pcast - nni - report.pdf the national nanotechnology initiative: second assessment and recommendations of the national nanotechnology advisory panel , pcast ( acting as the nnap ) , april 2008. http: / / www.whitehouse.gov / sites / default / files / microsites / ostp / pcast - nnap - nni - assessment - 2008.pdf a matter of size: triennial review of the national nanotechnology initiative , nrc , 2006. http: / / www.nap.edu / catalog.php ? record_id=11752 the national nanotechnology initiative at five years: assessment and recommendations of the national nanotechnology advisory panel , pcast ( acting as the nnap ) , may 2005. http: / / www.whitehouse.gov / sites / default / files / microsites / ostp / pcast - nni - five - years.pdf small wonders , endless frontiers: a review of the national nanotechnology initiative , nrc , june 2002. http: / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? isbn=0309084547 list of nni and nanotechnology - related acronym .
