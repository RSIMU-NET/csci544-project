the ncp government is under pressure . it remains isolated internationally , with icc arrest warrants against president bashir and his defense minister that restrict official travel , western sanctions against the regime , and limited access to international financing . the loss of south sudan spurred criticism from some elements within the regime , and the failing economy and allegations of large - scale state corruption have led even some islamists to question the ruling party's trajectory . inflation and related economic troubles have fueled periodic protests in urban centers in recent years . protestors have been killed by police on several occasions , notably in september 2013 , when as many as 200 people were killed during a demonstration against a decision to end fuel subsidies . in late 2013 , ghazi salahaddin atabani , then head of the ncp's parliamentary caucus and a former top presidential advisor , was expelled from the party along with several other ncp "reformists" after criticizing the government's response to the fuel subsidy protests . he subsequently formed the reform now party ( rnp ) . the rnp and another party , the popular national congress ( pnc ) , led by prominent islamist and former regime ideologue hassan al turabi , represent growing islamist opposition to the ncp . turabi was a key architect of the national islamic front , the political organization behind the 1989 coup , which was later transformed into the ncp after an internal power struggle between turabi and bashir . those talks , like auhip - hosted talks between the splm - n and the government in december , were inconclusive . the sudanese government , meanwhile , seeks to maintain ownership of the national dialogue process , and president bashir has resisted proposals by mbeki to meet under auhip auspices with the political parties who have suspended their involvement in the process . u.s. - sudan relations have long been turbulent . sudan was seen as a cold war ally starting in the late 1970s , but after the 1989 coup that brought bashir and the national islamic front to power , the united states downgraded diplomatic relations and cut off aid . the clinton administration designated sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 , identifying sudan as a "rogue state" and supporting neighboring ethiopia , eritrea , and uganda as "frontline states" to contain khartoum , and to provide support to the southern rebellion . in 1996 , under western pressure , sudan expelled osama bin laden from the country . however , relations between washington and khartoum deteriorated further in august 1998 , when , in response to the u.s. embassy bombings in east africa , president clinton ordered the bombing of a khartoum pharmaceutical factory purportedly linked to bin laden . u.s. policy shifted under president george w. bush to focus on achieving reforms through increased diplomatic engagement . the u.s. embassy in khartoum , which had suspended operations in 1996 , reopened in 2002 . the united states has not appointed an ambassador to sudan since 1997 ; a charg√© d'affaires leads the u.s. embassy , and a special envoy directs policy in washington . the united states maintains sanctions on sudan through executive orders and congressionally - imposed legal restrictions .
