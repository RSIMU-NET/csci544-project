one such area is hazard mitigation . the fiscal management challenges and the role of the federal government in hazard mitigation programs will likely be considered in light of recent catastrophic events and current economic conditions . hazard mitigation is a concept supported through a multitude of federal agency programs and at all levels of government . today , the burden for hazard mitigation still lies predominately with individuals and local government . efforts to mitigate the impact of natural hazards have been undertaken for decades . in the earliest history of community planning , leaders would consider the possible risks from flooding when deciding where to locate buildings along a body of water . earthquakes , mud slides , hurricanes , wildfires , and other extreme weather events also pose a hazard to communities . today , the challenges of mitigating the impacts of hazards are more complicated . while there is widespread support for hazard mitigation , there are challenges that pose barriers to effective hazard mitigation . current economic conditions at the federal , state and local level have brought attention to fiscal management challenges in many areas of government . the federal government encourages state and local governments to address hazards through various programs , notably hmgp . understanding the fiscal management challenges of hazard mitigation programs is critical in evaluating current and future programs . additionally , consideration of the federal role in hazard mitigation includes areas where complications in implementing hazard mitigation activities have arisen . one area of complication is the lag between a major disaster declaration and expenditure of federal hazard mitigation assistance . another area is the structure of grants administration at the federal , state , and local level . a decision by congress to increase federal hazard mitigation assistance would potentially address some problems and challenges ; however , that approach may not ensure greater effectiveness . the potential cost savings of hazard mitigation has to be weighed against the fiscal management challenges of estimating the costs . other approaches may include changing the structure of mitigation grants by consolidating federal programs , modifying grant eligibility criteria , and funding certain project types to provide a higher degree of technical assistance for risk assessment . an evaluation of the risk analysis used in federal programs and public safety regulations may also provide a higher degree of effective hazard mitigation . now that hazard mitigation has become an established and accepted concept among stakeholders , congress may wish to consider what additional steps will strengthen the foundation they have built . mitigation is an activity designed to reduce the impacts from such hazards or events . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) defines mitigation as follows: mitigation is defined as any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate long - term risk to life and property from a hazard event . mitigation , also known as prevention ( when done before a disaster ) , encourages long - term reduction of hazard vulnerability . the goal of mitigation is to decrease the need for response as opposed to simply increasing the response capability . mitigation can save lives and reduce property damage , and should be cost - effective and environmentally sound .
