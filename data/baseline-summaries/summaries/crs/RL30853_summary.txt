compliance was 100% . to introduce some flexibility in the distribution and timing of reductions , the act creates a comprehensive permit and emissions allowance system . an allowance is a limited authorization to emit a ton of so 2 . issued by epa , the allowances would be allocated to phase 1 and phase 2 units in accordance with baseline emissions estimates . power plants which commence operation after november 15 , 1990 would not receive any allowances . these new units would have to obtain allowances ( offsets ) from holders of existing allowances . allowances were allowed to be traded nationally during either phase . the law also permitted industrial sources and power plants to sell allowances to utility systems under regulations developed by epa . allowances were allowed to be banked by a utility for future use or sale . the act provided for two types of sales to improve the liquidity of the allowance system and to ensure the availability of allowances for utilities and independent power producers who need them . first , a special reserve fund consisting of 2.8% of phase 1 and phase 2 allowance allocations was set aside for sale . allowances from this fund ( 25,000 annually from 1993 to 1999 and 50,000 thereafter ) were sold at a fixed price of $1,500 an allowance . independent power producers had guaranteed rights to these allowances under certain conditions . second , an annual , open auction sold allowances ( 150,000 from 1993 to 1995 , and 250,000 from 1996 to 1999 ) with no minimum price . utilities with excess allowances could have them auctioned off at this auction , and any person could buy allowances . the act essentially capped so 2 emissions at individual existing sources through a tonnage limitation , and at future plants through the allowance system . first , emissions from most existing sources were capped at a specified emission rate times an historic baseline level . second , for plants commencing operation after november 15 , 1990 , emissions had to be completely offset with additional reductions at existing facilities beginning after phase 2 compliance . however , as noted above , the law provided some allowances to future power plants which met certain criteria . the utility so 2 emission cap was set at 8.9 million tons , with some exceptions . the act provided that if an affected unit did not have sufficient allowances to cover its emissions , it would be subject to an excess emission penalty of $2,000 per ton of so 2 and required to reduce an additional ton of so 2 the next year for each ton of excess pollutant emitted . the act also required epa to inventory industrial emissions of so 2 and to report every five years , beginning in 1995 . if the inventory showed that industrial emissions may reach levels above 5.60 million tons per year , then epa was to take action under the act to ensure that the 5.60 million ton cap would not be exceeded . the act required epa to set specific no x emission rate limitations â€” 0.45 lb . 7401 et seq .
