appendix a . 117 into law ( p.l . 112-175 ) , funding the government until march 27 , 2013 . on february 13 , 2012 , the obama administration submitted its fy2013 budget proposal . the administration's priorities on foreign affairs funding for fy2013 did not differ significantly from the congressional priorities indicated by the enacted fy2012 funding levels . the fy2013 request totaled $54.9 billion for the state - foreign operations appropriations , including a core budget proposal of $46.6 billion plus $8.2 billion for extraordinary and temporary war - related overseas contingency operations ( oco ) in frontline states . the total request represented an increase of 2.6% over the estimated fy2012 funding level for state - foreign operations , including a 4.5% increase in state department and related agencies accounts and a 0.1% increase in foreign operations accounts . within the budget , the administration requested authority and $770 million in funds for a new bilateral economic aid account — the middle east and north africa incentive fund ( mena if ) — to provide flexible and transparent support for arab spring countries in transition toward democracy . within the security aid category , the administration sought $800 million for the pakistan counterinsurgency capability fund ( pccf ) , even though most past pccf funding has not been disbursed and many lawmakers have voiced concerns about u.s. - pakistan relations , in general , and aid to pakistan , specifically . figure 1 provides a breakout of the fy2013 request by funding category . the fy2013 request reflected a slight increase of state department administration of foreign affairs funding as a share of the total request , from 25% in fy2012 to 26% requested for fy2013 , a slight decrease from 40% in fy2012 to 39% requested for fy2013 for bilateral economic aid , and a small increase from 19% in fy2012 to 19.5% in the fy2013 request for security assistance funding . these three categories make up more than 85% of the total state - foreign operations funding requested . for a full listing of funds requested for state , foreign operations and related agency accounts , by account , see appendix c . ( for a description of all the accounts , see crs report r40482 , state , foreign operations appropriations: a guide to component accounts , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. ) u.s. national security , trade promotion , and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities . others favored a more robust foreign affairs budget for various reasons . in particular , some members of congress in both political parties , as well as the previous and current secretaries of defense , viewed a solid foreign affairs budget as essential to assisting the defense department in promoting u.s. national security and foreign policy interests , perhaps even saving long - term spending by preventing the much costlier use of troops overseas . note that while there was a spike in foreign aid in 2004 , there was only a slight increase in state department funding that year as diplomacy funding lagged .
