appendix a . 99-177 , as amended ) . given the somewhat unique funding characteristics of this program , this section of the report explores funding concepts , funding levels , and insight into how shortfalls and surpluses of discretionary funding in the program have been addressed . the pell grant program since approximately fy2008 has been funded through three funding streams . a larger mandatory appropriation funds the mandatory add - on award amounts . recent and historical discretionary maximum award levels and mandatory add - on award levels are shown in table 1 and appendix a , respectively . appendix c presents the three distinct funding streams and enacting legislation since fy2008 . grant payments are made to eligible students who apply for aid and enroll in eligible programs notwithstanding the prescribed appropriation levels in any one year in such a way that some liken the program to a quasi entitlement . costs for the pell grant program are award year - specific and are primarily affected by the number of eligible students who apply for aid and enroll in eligible programs , the total maximum award amount , and award rules . the number of eligible students may be affected by economic conditions and legislative changes to the federal need analysis methodology and award rules . as discussed earlier , the total maximum award amount is determined by both the annual appropriations act and the hea . other factors that contribute to changes in program costs include the cost of higher education . the congressional budget office reports and estimates program costs at least annually . table 7 provides a summary of current and future estimated pell grant program costs from ay2012-2013 through ay2021-2022 , as of april 2018 . costs associated with the discretionary base maximum award and costs associated with the mandatory add - on award are specified . table 7 shows that the total program cost has declined from ay2012-2013 to ay2016-2017 and is estimated to increase thereafter . from ay2012-2013 to ay2015-2016 , the number of pell grant recipients decreased annually ( table 2 ) although the total maximum award amount increased annually since ay2013-2014 ( table a - 1 ) . declining undergraduate enrollment in degree - granting postsecondary institutions from 28.2 million in ay2011-2012 to 26.3 million in ay2015-2016 is reflected in a reduction of pell grant recipients . the decrease in the number of pell grant recipients from ay2012-2013 to ay2015-2016 , which is particularly evident in the decrease in costs related to the discretionary award level , outweighs the increase in the total maximum award , which is demonstrated in increased costs associated with mandatory award levels . the sar and isir contain the information submitted on the fafsa and the individual's efc . institutions that receive valid sars or valid isirs for eligible pell grant applicants are required to disburse pell grant funds to students who successfully enroll in approved coursework . pell grants are portable aid , that is , the grant aid follows students to the eligible postsecondary education institutions in which they enroll .
