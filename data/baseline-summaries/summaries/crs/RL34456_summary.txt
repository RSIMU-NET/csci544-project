appendix a . recent military operations occurring during united states presidential transition periods appendix b . representative examples of incidents of national security interest occurring during periods of governmental transition appendix b provides a representative listing of incidents of terrorism that have occurred during times of transitions of heads of state . the criteria for inclusion in this chart was based on the aggressor's real or perceived intent to change the course of an election or affect future policy of the country during a time of transfer of presidential authority . it should be noted that , barring relatively few examples , there is little evidence that incidents of national security significance were planned for a specific date prior to an election . while varying levels of planning occur prior to an incident , as with most criminal acts , the leader directs , or the individuals act , when opportunity for the best possible outcome is presented . with respect to times of presidential transition , the most optimal time for an attack , for a variety of reasons , may not present the best opportunity for the aggressors to attempt an incident . as such , the potential time frame for risk is present during any phase of the transition , with the effects of an incident differing based on the location of the event , the proximity to the election date , and the reaction and actions of the u.s. national security enterprise . many security experts believe that some of the incidences noted below had a significant impact on the outcome of the country's national election or subsequent policies . national security observers are fearful that terrorists groups may see some of the incidences as successes and feel embolden to attempt to affect future national transfers of power by launching attack just before the election . these groups may see the timing of such an action as a viable strategic opportunity to further the goals of their cause . however , it should be noted , other security experts suggest that incidences of national significance taken prior to a national election could produce a reaction that is counter to the long - term goals of the terrorist group . appendix c. congressional legislation addressing various aspects of national security considerations during presidential transitions , in chronological order ( 1963-2008 ) . the executive branch is not alone in attempting to ensure the country passes power from one administration to the next in a safe and thoughtful manner . however , the outgoing and incoming administrations are viewed as primarily responsible for addressing risks to the nation and taking actions to prevent and respond to any incident that may affect the electoral process . whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm national security interests during this period of transition or the new president experiences a relative peaceful period shortly after entering office , many national security issues will be awaiting the new administration . how the newly elected president recognizes and responds to these challenges will "depend heavily upon the planning and learning that takes place during the transition from one administration to another.
