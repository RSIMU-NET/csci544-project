we will starve theterrorists of funding. ( 4 ) a key instrument in thiseffort was presidential executive order 13224,issued on september 23 , which blocked "all property and interests in property" of certain designatedterrorists and individuals and entities materially supporting them . ( 5 ) as of late november 2002 , some250 individuals and groups , most of them al qaeda - related , had been designated under the order and$36 million in terrorist - related funds in 92 separate accounts reportedly had been frozen by u.s.financial institutions . ( 6 ) the vast bulk of terrorist assets and funding sources , though , are considered to lie outside of the united states . consequently , washington has made considerable effort to enlist support of othernations in the campaign against terrorist financing . to some extent , international efforts havemirrored u.s. policy . for example , the united nations security council ( unscr ) , pursuant tounscr resolution 1390 ( january 16 , 2002 ) and related preceding resolutions , maintains aconsolidated freeze list of some 300 individuals and entities linked to al qaeda , osama bin laden,and the taliban . ( 7 ) the european union and a numberof individual states maintain their ownterrorism lists and blocking orders . as a result of these various activities , approximately $85 millionof terrorist bank funds reportedly has been frozen outside the united states in the post - september11 period . of the total $121 million blocked worldwide , more than 75% reportedly has been linkedto the taliban and al qaeda and the rest to other terrorist entities . ( 8 ) the bulk of the activity hasoccurred in a few countries . although almost 170 nations have blocking orders in force , only 4countries , including the united states , account for about two - thirds of the blocked $121 million,according to u.s. financial data . how effective the campaign to limit terrorist finance has been is a matter of controversy . u.s. officials regard the effort as a vital adjunct to the overall fight against terrorism . they claim thatasset seizures to date have constricted the funds of al qaeda and other terrorist groups . a treasurydepartment fact sheet of september 2002 noted: "our war on terror is working - - both here in theunited states and overseas . ï¿½ al qaeda and other terrorist organizations are suffering financiallyas a result of our actions . potential donors are being more cautious about giving money toorganizations where they fear the money might wind up in the hands of terrorists . in addition , greaterregulatory scrutiny over financial systems around the world in the future may identify those whowould support terrorist groups or activities. ( 9 ) others have expressed skepticism about the campaign . as a recent report by a u.n. security council monitoring group observes , "al qaeda continues to have access to considerable financialand other resources. as noted above , reports indicate that less than 20 percent of the reported $121million total in blocked terrorist assets have been frozen since mid - january 2002 , which suggests thatthe campaign is yielding sharply diminishing returns . "government officials have indicated that ithas proved extremely difficult to identify these additional funds and resources," the u.n. reportconcludes .
