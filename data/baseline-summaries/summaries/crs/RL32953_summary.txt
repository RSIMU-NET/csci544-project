table 1 . comparison of key topics covered by s.1151 and the draft amendmen . as discussed in the next section , emission reduction estimates under both options involveat least some uncertainty , particularly for the draft amendment . thus the estimates provided in table2 should be considered "ballpark" in nature . in 2004 , the energy information administration ( eia ) analyzed an earlier version of s. 1151 . ( 13 ) under eia's analysis , s. 1151 would achieve a 6.7% reduction in overall greenhouse gasemissions in 2010 compared with its projected business - as - usual scenario , but would not returngreenhouse gas emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels . this result contrasts with crs's estimate thatthe draft amendment would result in a 2.5% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010compared with eia's business - as - usual scenario . ( 14 ) crs did not estimate longer term reductions from either s. 1151 or the draftamendment because of the inherent uncertainty involved in such projections . qualitatively , it canbe stated that emissions of greenhouse gases would likely continue to increase under both options,although somewhat more slowly than business - as - usual . in the case of s. 1151 , thepercentage of greenhouse gases not covered by the bill would increase and would be uncontrolledby the reduction program . thus , the initial reduction in emissions achieved in 2010 would be slowlyeaten up over time . in the case of the draft amendment , covered emissions would continue to growto the extent that projected economic growth outstripped the 2.4% annual reduction in carbonintensity ( 2.8% beginning in 2020 ) , and to the extent that increased costs drove covered entities toinvoke the safety valve rather than further reduce emissions . in the longer term , emissions couldpotentially rise faster under the draft amendment than under s. 1151 . table 2 . projected emissions under s. 1151 and draftamendment ( billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents ) sources: 1990 and 2000 data: u.s. submission to the united nations framework convention onclimate change , 2010 projections . 2028: energy informationadministration , analysis of senate amendment 2028 , the climate stewardship act of 2003 ( may2004 ) . 2028 is very similar to s. 1151 and is used as a surrogate here . however , the number of covered entities may be more or less under s. 1151 then assumedhere , so the estimates may understate or overstate actual reductions that would be achieved unders . for the draft amendment , calculations by crs are based on projected gdp andcarbon intensity improvements by energy information administration , annual energy outlook 2005 ,doe / eia - 0383 ( 2005 ) , february 2005 . see text for discussion of uncertainties surrounding the draftamendment's estimate . estimates do not take into account the potential for carbon sequestration . the two proposals - - s. 1151 and the draft amendment - - would establishmarket - based systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases . however , the proposals differ in howthose systems would work . s. 1151 would establish an absolute cap on emissions fromcovered entities , and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap .
