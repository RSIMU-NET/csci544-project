they will be discussed in alphabetical order . created by the bonneville project act of 1937 ( 16 u.s.c . §832 ) just before the completion of two large dams in the pacific northwest — bonneville dam in 1938 and grand coulee dam in 1941 — bpa was the first pma . though it serves a smaller geographical area , bpa is on par with wapa ( which serves the largest area ) in the size of its transmission system . the agency constructed and maintains approximately 75% of the high voltage transmission lines in the northwest , a system of over 15,000 miles of transmission line and approximately 300 substations . bpa differs from the other three pmas in that it is self - financed: it receives no federal appropriations . since passage of the federal columbia river transmission system act of 1974 ( 16 u.s.c . §838 ) , bpa covers its operating costs through power rates set to ensure repayment to the treasury of capital and interest on funds used to construct the columbia river power system . bpa also has permanent treasury borrowing authority , which it may use for capital on large projects . this money is also repaid , with interest , through power sales . bpa borrowing authority totals $4.45 billion , through congressional allocations of $1.25 billion on three separate occasions and a final allocation of $700 million in 2003 . the agency intends to use $461 million of its remaining borrowing authority in fy2007 and $538 million in fy2008 . sepa is unique among the four pmas in two ways . it is the smallest pma , with just over 40 employees , and , unlike the other three agencies , sepa does not operate or maintain any transmission facilities and thus contracts with other utilities for transmitting the federal power it markets to over 13 million consumers . sepa , like the other pmas aside from bonneville ( with its self - funding provision ) , receives annual appropriations and subsequently repays this funding through power revenues . sepa's fy2007 appropriation request was $6.5 million . actual appropriations , reflecting an across - the - board rescission for the department of energy , were $6.4 million . swpa serves over 100 preference customer utilities with over 7 million end - use customers in the south - central united states . the agency manages nearly 1,400 miles of high - voltage transmission lines with 24 substations . swpa returns revenues to the u.s. treasury for repayment , with interest , of the federal investment in generation and transmission facilities and , like sepa and wapa , for repayment of annual appropriations . swpa requested an appropriation of $30.4 million in the president's fy2008 budget . appropriations , reflecting a department of energy across - the - board rescission , were $30.2 million . created by the department of energy organization act of 1977 ( p.l . 95-91 ) , wapa is the newest and largest of the pmas . wapa's service area covers 1.3 million square miles , and its power — transmitted by a high voltage grid over 17,000 miles long — serves customers in 15 western states .
