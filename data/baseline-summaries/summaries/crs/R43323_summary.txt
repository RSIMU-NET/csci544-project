in its report on h.r . 2397 , the house appropriations committee dubbed the advance appropriation proposal a "funding gimmick" and added to the bill $950.0 million to fully fund the second fy2014 submarine . because neither h.r . 1960 nor s. 1197 had been passed by both chambers , there was no basis for convening a house - senate conference to reconcile the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of the fy2014 ndaa . in lieu of a formal conference report , members of the house and senate armed services committees , meeting informally , negotiated a compromise version of the bill . to expedite senate action on that final version of the bill , the negotiated text was passed by the house and senate as an amendment to a bill ( h.r . 3304 ) that already had been passed by each chamber , but on the specific language of which the house and senate had not yet come to agreement . on december 12 , 2013 , the house voted 350-69 to adopt the negotiated ndaa text as an amendment to h.r . 3304 and to pass the amended bill . on december 19 , 2013 , the senate concurred in the house action — in effect , passing the negotiated ndaa text — by a vote of 84-15 . unlike the more inclusive national defense authorization act , the annual dod appropriation bill covers only dod military activities and excludes military construction , which is funded in the annual appropriations bill that also funds the department of veterans affairs and related agencies . the house version of the fy2014 dod appropriations bill ( h.r . 2397 ) , passed on june 24 , 2013 , by a vote of 315 to 109 , would provide $585.1 billion for those activities — including both the base budget and oco costs — which is nearly $4.4 billion less than the administration requested . the senate appropriations committee's version of the bill ( s. 1429 ) , reported on july 30 , 2013 , would provide $587.5 billion , which is nearly $2.2 billion less than the request . ( see table 16 . ) for the fy2014 base budget , h.r . 2397 would add $1.20 billion to the administration's request to offset what the house appropriations committee called the budget's "unrealistic" assumptions about the extent to which "efficiencies" would reduce the cost of building maintenance , depot overhauls of major weapons , and other routine operations . the house bill also added to the amount requested $536 million in anticipation of higher - than - budgeted fuel costs and several billion dollars for various weapons and r&d programs , including increases of $950 million for a submarine , $923 million to modernize navy cruisers the budget would retire , and $667 million for medical r&d projects . but those additions would be more than offset by reductions to the base budget request , many of which the house appropriations committee said would have no adverse impact on dod operations .
