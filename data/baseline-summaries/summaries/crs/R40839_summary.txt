, the government ) for ndm . producers and others counter that foreign subsidies for exports of dairy products have at times limited u.s. production of protein products . whey protein is also used in a variety of food products . a "milk protein concentrate" ( mpc ) contains both casein and whey protein , and is often identified by its protein content , such as mpc42 for a product with 42% protein . current quotas for most dairy products are distributed on an historical basis , while importers must apply for licenses to import dairy products . s. 1542 would introduce two separate trqs . the first would be for mpcs classified under hts subheading 0404.90.10 for imports with a protein concentration of 40% to 90% . annual imports in excess of 18,488 metric tons would be assessed a duty of $1.56 / kg ( $0.708 / lb. ) the second trq would be for the combined imports of three products: milk protein concentrate ( 90% protein ) , casein , and caseinates ( hts 3501.10.10 , 3501.10.50 , and 3501.90.60 , respectively ) . annual imports in excess of 55,477 metric tons would be assessed a duty of $2.16 / kg ( $0.98 / lb. ) the duty on import quantities below each quota would remain at the current low level ( $0.0037 / kg or $0.0017 / lb .

 ) , except for imports under hts 3501.10.50 , which would remain free . more than half the annual trade in mpcs and casein / caseinates would be affected by the new , higher duties . imports under hts 0404.90.10 averaged 51,000 metric tons during 2006-2008 compared with 18,499 metric tons under the proposed trq . similarly , imports of casein products averaged 108,000 metric tons compared with 55,477 metric tons under the proposed trq . enactment of the proposed legislation likely would entail the united states' entering into compensation negotiations with wto member countries that are major suppliers of mpcs to the u.s. market . s. 1542 authorizes the president to enter into such negotiations ( section 3 ) . article xxviii of the original general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt 1947 ) provides the mechanism for wto member countries to negotiate compensation when a tariff concession ( in this case the current low tariff for mpc imports ) is modified or withdrawn . article xxviii allows member countries to increase tariffs or set new trqs , but in exchange for withdrawing or modifying a concession compensation must be provided to affected member countries . compensation does not mean a monetary payment ; it means , in this case , that the united states is supposed to offer a benefit or concession such as a tariff reduction which is equivalent to the benefits which the united states has withdrawn or modified . formulas for determining the amount of compensation are provided in the understanding on the interpretation of article xxviii that is part of the 1994 wto uruguay round agreements ( gatt 1994 ) . the understanding on article xxviii provides that when an unlimited tariff concession is replaced by a trq , the amount of compensation provided should exceed the amount of the trade actually affected by the modification .
