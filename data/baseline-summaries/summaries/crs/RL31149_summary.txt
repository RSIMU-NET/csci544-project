110-161 ) did not include such language . lawsuits challenging the nps final winter use plan did not request preliminary injunctions , however , allowing local operations to continue under the same temporary rules that had been in effect for the previous three years . in the 108 th congress , representative holt twice attempted to amend interior department appropriation bills to prohibit spending to manage recreational snowmobile use in the three yellowstone area park units except in accordance with the clinton administration rule phasing out snowmobiles . the first such amendment ( h.amdt . 2691 ) was defeated on a tie vote , 210-210 , july 17 , 2003 . the second attempt ( h.amdt . 4568 ) was defeated on june 17 , 2004 , by a vote of 224-198 . other legislation to prohibit snowmobile access to national parks and to grant continued access was introduced , but not acted on , in the 107 th and 108 th congresses . snowmobile issues remain far from resolved , despite actions by congress , epa , the national park service , and the courts . congress and the nps have provided a temporary resolution of the yellowstone access issue since 2004 , but the issue is now returning to the limelight , as a federal district court has vacated final regulations for yellowstone access for a third time . the development of these rules showed that public interest in snowmobile issues remains significant , and that the national park service's preferred alternatives for snowmobile access to yellowstone remain overwhelmingly unpopular . the draft yellowstone area winter use plan that was open for comment from march through june 2007 generated 122,190 public comments , of which only 193 ( 0.1% ) supported the nps preference . continued action is also likely in the courts , as the national park service responds to the latest court decision . among those opposed , environmental groups and individuals that want snowmobiles banned from the park form a solid majority . this level of opposition would seem to guarantee that members of congress will retain an interest in the resolution of these issues . comparative data for all five of these units are not available for years after 1999-2000 . one of the five , rocky mountain national park , has closed all but one snowmobile route since 2004 â€” the one route remaining being a 2-mile trail that provides access to national forest land heavily used by snowmobiles . epa concluded that "either the preferred alternative should be modified or a different alternative should be selected that meets the resource protections identified by the national park service. snowmobile visits to yellowstone increased during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 winter seasons , peaking at 87,206 in the latter winter . in subsequent years , snowmobile visitors to yellowstone plummeted , to a low of 24,049 in 2004-2005 . changes in access policy ( described later in this report ) as well as drought and low snow pack in recent years contributed to the decline . two other yellowstone area park units , grand teton national park and the rockefeller memorial parkway , experienced an even more steep decline , from a combined 35,000 snowmobile visits in 2000-2001 to about 7,500 in 2004-2005 .
