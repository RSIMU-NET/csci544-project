some of the available options have nothing to do with the unified agenda . for example , either congress or the president could require or encourage agencies to engage in pre - nprm communications with the general or affected public through public meetings , anprms , advocacy panels , or other consultative devices . other alternatives include newer methods of communication that have been suggested by the white house's deputy chief technology officer , including blogs and other forms of "social media. also , gao's 2009 report on federal rulemaking discussed tracking systems in place at dot and other agencies that identified key milestones that the agencies needed to accomplish to produce a final rule . these tracking systems , or elements of these systems , could be made available to the public to disclose when proposed rules are expected to be issued . the results of this analysis are presented in table 1 below . for about three - quarters of the proposed rules ( 176 of 231 , or 76.2% ) , the agencies published unified agenda entries for their upcoming proposed rules before they published the related nprms . two - thirds of the time ( 154 of 231 proposed rules , or 66.7% ) , those agenda entries were published even earlier , before oira started its reviews of the draft nprms . viewed another way , however , for about one - quarter of the proposed rules , the agencies did not use the unified agenda to alert the public of those nprms before they were published in the federal register , and one - third of the time there were no "proposed rule" agenda entries published before oira started its reviews .
