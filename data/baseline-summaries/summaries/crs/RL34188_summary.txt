congress pays the u.s . postal service for franked mail through annual appropriations for the legislative branch . each chamber makes an allotment to members from these appropriations . in the senate , the allocation process is administered by the committee on rules and administration ; in the house , by the committee on house administration . data on congressional official mail costs are only available back to fy1978 . the post office , however , kept records of overall franking costs beginning in fy1954 , when congress began reimbursing the post office for franked mail costs . franked mail costs differ only slightly from congressional official mail costs , as they include the franking privilege granted to former presidents and widows of former presidents . figure 2 is a plot of overall franked mail costs ( fy1954 to fy1977 ) and official mail costs ( fy1978 to fy2015 ) in both current and constant 1954 dollars . figure 2 demonstrates that franked mail / official mail costs significantly increased and then significantly decreased between fy1954 and fy2015 . although costs began to increase during the 1960s , the largest increases occurred during the 1970s . costs remained high during the 1980s , and then were reduced significantly beginning in fy1989 . the sharp increase in costs that begins in the late 1960s and extends into the 1980s is plausibly attributable to several factors . the overall volume of mail sent by members of congress increased rapidly during this time period , aided by computer technology that simplified the creation of mass - mailing newsletters and other frankable mail . second , postal rates increased significantly during the same time period , with first - class mail rates more than tripling from 8 cents in fy1972 to 25 cents by fy1988 . standard mail ( formerly third - class ) rates doubled from 5 cents in fy1972 to 10 cents in fy1988 . official congressional mail costs have decreased significantly in the past 30 years . even - numbered - year franking expenditures have been reduced by over 85% from $113.4 million in fy1988 to $16.9 million in fy2014 . odd - numbered - year franking expenditures have been reduced by over 90% from $89.5 million in fy1989 to $8.3 million in fy2015 . figure 3 illustrates changes in official mail costs , by chamber , between fy1978 and fy2015 . the decrease in official mail expenditures during the early 1990s was primarily due to congressional reforms that placed individual limits on members' mail costs and required public disclosure of individual member franking expenditures . in 1986 , the senate established a franking allowance for each senator and for the first time disclosed individual member mail costs . in 1990 , the house established a separate franking allowance for its members and required public disclosure of individual mail costs . tighter restrictions were also placed on member mass mailings . since october 1992 , members have been prohibited from sending mass mailings outside their districts . since october 1994 , senators have been limited to mass mailings that do not exceed $50,000 per session of congress . senators may not use the frank for mass mailings above that amount .
