appropriations are complex . for example , the budget requests for some agencies are large , numbering several hundred pages and containing numerous funding , programmatic , and legislative changes for congressional consideration . neither measure had subsequent legislative action . because regular fy2015 appropriations were not enacted prior to october 1 , 2015 , continuing appropriations were temporarily provided after that date . under the continuing appropriations resolution , 2015 ( cr ) , agencies generally received funding at the fy2014 level minus an across - the - board reduction of 0.0554% . funding was generally provided under the authority and conditions , and to the same extent and manner , as in fy2014 . further , funding could not be used to initiate or resume projects or activities for which funding or authority was not provided for fy2014 . the cr provided appropriations through december 11 , 2014 ; two subsequent laws extended continuing funding through december 17 , 2014 . on december 16 , 2014 , regular fy2015 appropriations were enacted for interior , environment , and related agencies as part of p.l . the law included total appropriations of $30.48 billion for these agencies , primarily in division f. this report provides a brief overview of fy2015 appropriations levels . it first addresses the appropriations requested by the president for fy2015 for agencies in the bill and compares the requested appropriations with fy2014 enacted appropriations . it next discusses the fy2015 appropriations contained in h.r . 5171 as reported by the house appropriations committee and the appropriations recommended in the senate interior subcommittee draft . it then summarizes the components of the fy2015 enacted appropriations and compares the fy2015 enacted level with funding enacted for the prior five years ( fy2010-fy2014 ) and recommended for fy2015 . further , appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts , activities , and subactivities , and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information . this report does not provide account - and subaccount - level information . further , it does not discuss agency highlights under the president's request , the house committee - reported bill , the senate interior subcommittee draft , or the fy2015 appropriations law , such as increases , decreases , budgetary reorganizations , and legislative changes . for information on fy2015 appropriations for a particular agency , or for individual accounts , programs , or activities administered by a particular agency , contact the key policy staff identified at the end of this report . appropriations enacted for interior , environment , and related agencies over the prior five fiscal years ( fy2010-fy2014 ) peaked in fy2010 at $32.32 billion . relative to fy2010 , fy2015 enacted appropriations decreased by $1.84 billion ( - 5.7% ) . the overall decline can be attributed primarily to reduced appropriations for epa , which fell $2.15 billion ( - 20.9% ) . the appropriations for doi agencies and related agencies have increased since fy2010 â€” by $43.7 million ( 0.4% ) for doi and $277.1 million ( 2.5% ) for related agencies . with the exception of fy2010 , fy2015 appropriations were higher than the appropriations enacted for each of the fiscal years during the five - year period .
