the supreme court is the highest appellate body . the constitutional court rules on the legality and constitutionality of governmental acts and on disputes between branches of government or federative entities . a 2015 law gives the constitutional court the legal authority to disregard verdicts by interstate bodies that defend human rights and freedoms , if the court concludes that such verdicts contradict russia's constitution ( although the latter requires compliance of rules established by international treaties over domestic law ) . a supreme commercial court , which handled commercial disputes and was viewed by experts as relatively impartial , was dissolved in september 2014 , with its areas of jurisdiction transferred to the supreme court ; lower - level commercial courts continue to function . the russian economy has gone through periods of decline , growth , and stagnation since 1991 . in the first seven years after the dissolution of the soviet union ( 1992-1998 ) , russia experienced an average annual decline in gross domestic product ( gdp ) of 6.8% . a decade of strong economic growth followed , in which russia's gdp increased on average 6.9% per year . the surge in economic growth — largely the result of increases in world oil prices — helped to raise the russian standard of living and brought a significant degree of economic stability . the russian economy was hit hard by the global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn that began in 2008 . the crisis exposed weaknesses in the economy , including its significant dependence on the production and export of oil and other natural resources and its weak financial system . the russian government's reassertion of control over major industries , especially in the energy sector , also contributed to an underachieving economy . as a result , russia's period of economic growth came to an abrupt end by 2009 . although russian real gdp increased 5.2% in 2008 , it declined by 7.8% in 2009 . russia began to emerge from its recession in 2010 , with 4.5% gdp growth that year , but by 2013 growth had again slowed to 1.3% . since 2014 , two external shocks — low oil prices and international sanctions — have contributed to considerable economic challenges . in particular , russia has grappled with the following: economic contraction , with growth slowing to 0.7% in 2014 before contracting by 2.8% in 2015 ; capital flight , with net private capital outflows from russia totaling $152 billion in 2014 , compared to $60 billion in 2013 ; rapid depreciation of the ruble , more than 50% against the dollar over the course of 2014 ; increasing inflation , from 6.8% in 2013 to 15.5% in 2015 ; declining trade , with the dollar value of exports and imports down by 31% and 36% , respectively , from 2014 to 2015 ; budgetary pressures , with the budget deficit widening from 1.2% in 2013 to 3.4% in 2015 ; drawing on international reserves to offset fiscal challenges , with reserves falling from almost $500 billion in january 2014 to $356 billion in april 2015 ; and more widespread poverty , which increased from 16.1 million living in poverty in 2014 to 19.2 million in 2015 ( 13.4% of the population ) .
