( see table 18 . ) china relies heavily upon investment from hong kong and other east asian countries and regions . a significant amount of fdi from hong kong comes from taiwan or from mainland chinese companies via their subsidiaries in hong kong . annual or utilized fdi from japan and south korea surpassed that of the united states in 2003 . what light do the trade data shed on the controversy over economic relations with china ? first , china has burst onto the u.s. trading scene in recent years . in 2003 , the prc surpassed japan to become america's third largest trading partner , after canada and mexico , while the united states is the prc's second largest trading partner , after the expanded european union ( 25 nations ) . in 2005 , according to prc data , eu - china trade was valued at $217.3 billion compared to u.s. - china trade of $211.6 billion . china's largest export market is the united states followed by the eu - 25 and japan . although china is a new player in international trade , it is taking major shares of markets once dominated either by other countries and u.s. domestic industries . china is the second largest source of u.s. imports of merchandise ( $243 billion in 2005 ) after canada ( $287 billion ) . prc imports surpassed those of mexico in 2003 and of japan in 2002 . china now accounts for over 14% of u.s. imports ( 2005 ) , up from 12% in 2003 , 8% in 1999 , and 3% in 1990 , although this share still falls short of japan's 18% in the early 1990s . second , the data show that while u.s. trade with china is unbalanced , the same is also true for europe and japan , although to a lesser extent . china runs a trade surplus with the world's three major economic centers . the u.s. bilateral deficit in 2005 ( $201 billion ) , however , was 1.6 times larger than that of the eu - 15 ( $121.8 billion ; the eu - 25 deficit was $133 billion ) and seven times that of japan ( $28.5 billion ) . ( as reported by the united states , eu , and japan. ) third , the data show that the u.s. trade deficit with china is rising with the overall u.s. trade deficit or growing at a slightly faster rate . between 1996 and 1998 , china's share of the overall u.s. merchandise trade deficit averaged 24% ; between 1999 and 2001 , china's share was 18% , and between 2002 and 2004 , 22% . in 2005 , the united states trade deficit with china constituted 26% of its global trade deficit . over the same period , the shares of the u.s. deficit in goods trade accounted for by japan , the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) , and the east asian newly industrialized countries ( nics ) have decreased while the european union's share has increased . fourth , the data show that u.s. exports to china are growing faster than u.s. exports to other nations .
