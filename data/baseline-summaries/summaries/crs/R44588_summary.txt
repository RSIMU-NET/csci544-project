appendix a . historical trends this appendix offers a 20-year historical perspective on trends in agricultural appropriations from fy1997 to fy2017 . comparisons are made using nominal and real data across ( 1 ) mandatory versus discretionary spending , ( 2 ) nutrition spending compared to the rest of the bill , and ( 3 ) agriculture appropriations relative to the entire federal budget , economy , and population ( figure a - 1 through figure a - 7 , table a - 2 through table a - 4 ) . historical trends in the appropriations are also summarized as compounded annualized percentage changes over various time periods ( table a - 1 ) . a shorter , 10-year comparison across the major titles in the agriculture appropriation is shown in figure 3 earlier in the report , and agency - level data are presented for a four - year period in tables throughout the report . appendix b . budget sequestration sequestration is a process of automatic , largely across - the - board reductions that permanently cancel mandatory and / or discretionary budget authority and is triggered when spending would exceed statutory budget goals . the current requirement for sequestration is in the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l . table b - 1 shows the rates of sequestration that have been announced so far and the amounts of budget authority that have been cancelled from accounts in the agriculture appropriations bill . although the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-67 ) raised spending limits in the bca to avoid sequestration of discretionary accounts in fy2014 and fy2015 — and the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( p.l . 114-74 ) did it again for fy2016 and fy2017 — they do not prevent or reduce sequestration on mandatory accounts that originated in the bca . in fact , the original fy2021 sunset on the sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended three times to pay for avoiding sequestration of discretionary spending in the near term or as a general budgetary offset for other bills . first , congress extended the duration of mandatory sequestration by two years ( until fy2023 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2013 . second , congress extended it by another year ( until fy2024 ) to maintain retirement benefits for certain military personnel ( p.l . third , congress extended sequestration on non - exempt mandatory accounts another year ( until fy2025 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2015 . some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration . the nutrition programs and the conservation reserve program are statutorily exempt , and some prior legal obligations in crop insurance and the farm commodity programs may be exempt as determined by the office of management and budget ( omb ) . generally speaking , the experience since fy2013 is that omb has ruled most of crop insurance as exempt from sequestration , while the farm commodity programs have been subject to it . regarding the 2014 farm bill , the first farm commodity program payments from the 2014 farm bill began in october 2015 , and usda indicated that they would be subject to the 6.8% reduction applicable to fy2016 .
