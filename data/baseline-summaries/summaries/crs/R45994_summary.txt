payments to minnesota counties . enacted in 1948 , this program pays three northern minnesota counties 0.75% of the appraised value of the land , without restrictions on using the funds . the fy2018 mandatory appropriation for the payment to states funds was $234.6 million . srs p ayments . srs authorized an optional , alternative payment to both the fs 25% revenue - sharing payments and the blm payments to the counties in oregon containing the o&c and cbwr lands . the payment amount is determined by a formula that is based in part on historical revenue payments and that declines overall by 5% annually . similar to the 25% revenue - sharing payments , the payment is made after the end of the fiscal year and the bulk of the payment is to be used for roads and schools in the counties containing the national forests . the agency may retain a portion of the payment for use on specified projects . funding for the payment first comes from receipts and , if necessary , is supplemented through transfers from the general fund of the treasury . the original authorization for srs payments expired at the end of fy2006 , but congress reauthorized the payments several times ( through various laws ) and payments were made annually from fy2001 through fy2016 . the authorization expired for the fy2016 srs payment , and counties received the 25% revenue - sharing payment for one year , in fy2017 . congress then reauthorized the srs payments for two years ( fy2017 and fy2018 ) . srs payments are disbursed after the fiscal year ends , so the fy2017 payment was made in fy2018 and the fy2018 payment was made in fy2019 . national grassland fund p ayments . these payments are authorized by the bankhead - jones farm tenant act , which requires payments of 25% of net ( rather than gross ) receipts directly to the counties for roads and schools in the counties where the national grasslands are located . these payments are sometimes referred to as payments to counties , because the payment is made directly to the counties and the allocation is based on the national grassland acreage in each county . the funding level in this account varies annually , depending on fluctuations in revenue from the nfs and whether srs is authorized . for example , over the five years from fy2014 to fy2018 , annual mandatory appropriations averaged $269.6 million . the fy2018 appropriation was lower than the annual average , and the fy2017 appropriation ( $73.1 million ) was much lower than the annual average . these low figures occurred primarily because of the expiration of srs payments in fy2017 . srs payments are generally higher than 25% payments and often require supplemental funding from the general fund of the treasury . the knutson - vandenberg ( k - v ) trust fund was established by the act of june 6 , 1930 , and is funded through revenue generated by timber sales . the agency determines the amount collected on each sale , which can be up to 100% of receipts from the sale . the fund is used for two purposes .
