the figures in h.r . 3979 are identical to the administration's end - strength request except for the air force ; the proposed final bill recommends an air force end - strength slightly higher ( +2,080 ) than the administration's request . taken together , the proposed final bill stipulates a total active duty end - strength which is 50,720 lower than the fy2014 level . the committee report which accompanied h.r . 4435 noted that "the services plan for more drastic reductions in end strength and force structure in fiscal year 2016 absent a change in the budget control act of 2011" and expressed concerns that "this continued stress on the force , coupled with potential further reductions as a result of the bca's discretionary caps , may have serious implications on the capacity and capability of the all - volunteer force and the ability for the services to meet the national defense strategy. reference ( s ) : previously discussed in crs report r43184 , fy2014 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel issues , and similar reports from earlier years . crs point of contact: [author name scrubbed] , x[phone number scrubbed] . background: although the reserves have been used extensively in support of operations since september 11 , 2001 , the overall authorized end strength of the selected reserves has declined by about 4% over the past twelve years ( 874,664 in fy2001 versus 842,700 in fy2014 ) . much of this can be attributed to the reductions in navy reserve strength during this period . there were also modest shifts in strength for some other components of the selected reserve . for comparative purposes , the authorized end strengths for the selected reserves for fy2001 were as follows: army national guard ( 350,526 ) , army reserve ( 205,300 ) , navy reserve ( 88,900 ) , marine corps reserve ( 39,558 ) , air national guard ( 108,022 ) , air force reserve ( 74,358 ) , and coast guard reserve ( 8,000 ) . between fy2001 and fy2014 , the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the army and navy reserve ( - 29,800 or - 33.5% ) , army national guard ( +3,674 or +1.1% ) , air force reserve ( - 3,958 or - 5.3% ) , and coast guard reserve ( +1,000 or +12.5% ) . a smaller change occurred in the air national guard ( - 2,622 or - 2.4% ) , while the authorized end strength of the army reserve ( - 300 or - 0.15% ) and the marine corps reserve ( +42 or +0.11% ) have been largely unchanged during this period . this approach does not constitute a rejection of the dod proposal , which was endorsed by the joint chiefs of staff . rather , consideration of further changes to co - pays is deferred until after the committees receive the report of the military compensation and retirement modernization commission , which is due in february 2015 .
