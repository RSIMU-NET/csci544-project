the 2017 tax revision , p.l . dividends ( like capital gains ) are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income . the rates are 0% , 15% , and 20% depending on the rate bracket that ordinary income falls into . a $4,000 to $9,000 effect per household , given the 126 million households that were estimated at that time , would produce a total effect ranging from $504 billion to $1,134 billion , or between 2.5% and 5.7% of gdp in 2018 . the corporate rate cut from 35% to 21% cost about $125 billion over a full year , and it would cost about $133 billion with the additional percentage point rate reduction ( to 20% ) considered at that time . thus , in these scenarios , the effects of the tax cuts would be many times ( 3.8 to 8.5 ) larger than the costs . the projections for long - run growth in the cea study relied on a range of empirical economics literature , including the effects of changes in user cost on investment cost and corporate tax incidence . the econometric estimates of corporate tax incidence are problematic for a number of reasons , and the effects on investment considering user cost did not appear to take into account the direct effect of the tax rate change on the interest . in the absence of the tax cuts , wages should grow with the economy and wage rates should grow as the capital stock grows . in addition , tight labor markets resulting from the approach to full employment should have put upward pressure on wage rates in any case . evidence from 2018 indicated that labor compensation , adjusted to real values by the price indices for personal consumption expenditures , grew slower than output in general , at a 2.3% rate compared with a 2.9% growth rate overall . if adjusted by the gdp deflator , labor compensation grew by 2.0% . with labor representing 53% of gdp , that implies that the other components grew at 3.8% . thus , pretax profits and economic depreciation ( the price of capital ) grew faster than wages . figure 4 shows the growth rate of real wages compared with the growth rate of real gdp for 2013-2018 , indicating that wage growth has sometimes been faster than gdp growth and sometimes slower . there is no indication of a surge in wages in 2018 either compared to history or relative to gdp growth . this finding is consistent with the cbo projection of a modest effect . the department of labor reports that average weekly wages of production and nonsupervisory workers were $742 in 2017 and $766 in 2018 . wages , assuming full - time work , increased by $1,248 annually . but this number must account for inflation and growth that would otherwise have occurred regardless of the tax change . the nominal growth rate in wages was 3.2% , but adjusting for the gdp price deflator , real wages increased by 1.2% . this growth is smaller than overall growth in labor compensation and indicates that ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates .
