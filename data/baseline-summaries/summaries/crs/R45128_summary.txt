appendix a . budget sequestration sequestration is a process of automatic , largely across - the - board reductions that permanently cancel mandatory and / or discretionary budget authority . sequestration is triggered as a budget enforcement mechanism when federal spending would exceed statutory budget goals . sequestration is currently authorized in the bca ( p.l . 112-25 ) for discretionary spending through fy2021 and for mandatory spending through fy2027 , as amended by subsequent acts and explained below . besides fy2013 — when the timing of appropriations and the first year of sequestration resulted in triggering sequestration on discretionary spending — bipartisan budget acts in 2013 , 2015 , and 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 , respectively ) have avoided sequestration on discretionary spending . these acts raised the discretionary budget caps that were placed in statute by the bca and allowed congress to enact larger appropriations than were allowed under the bca . sequestration , however , continues to apply to certain accounts of mandatory spending and is not avoided by the bipartisan budget acts ( table a - 1 ) . the original fy2021 sunset on the sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended four times to pay for avoiding sequestration of discretionary spending in the near term or as a general budgetary offset for other bills: 1 . congress extended the duration of mandatory sequestration by two years ( until fy2023 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2013 . congress extended it by another year ( until fy2024 ) to maintain retirement benefits for certain military personnel ( p.l . congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts another year ( until fy2025 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2015 . congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts by another two years ( until fy2027 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 division c , section 30101 ( c ) ) . some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration . the nutrition programs and the conservation reserve program are statutorily exempt , and some prior legal obligations in crop insurance and the farm commodity programs may be exempt as determined by omb . generally speaking , the experience since fy2013 is that omb has ruled that most of crop insurance is exempt from sequestration , while the farm commodity programs , disaster assistance , and most conservation programs have been subject to it . for example , under the 2014 farm bill , the first farm commodity program payments began to be paid in october 2015 , and usda indicated that they would be subject to the 6.8% reduction that was applicable to fy2016 . thus , sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts continues in fy2018 . nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts are reduced by a 6.6% sequestration rate and thus are paid at 93.4% of what they would have otherwise provided . this results in a reduction of about $1.3 billion less than what would have been authorized from mandatory agriculture accounts in fy2018 . table a - 1 shows the rates of sequestration that have been announced so far and the total amounts of budget authority that have been cancelled from accounts in the agriculture appropriations bill .
