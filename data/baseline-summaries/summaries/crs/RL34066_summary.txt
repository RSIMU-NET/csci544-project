no state can receive a grant less than $500,000 . the grant to puerto rico cannot exceed 0.5% of the total available for state distribution . in determining the number of lep and immigrant students in an individual state and in the united states , statutory language directs ed to use "the more accurate" of ( 1 ) data available from the american community survey ( acs ) , or ( 2 ) the number of children being assessed for english proficiency as required under title i of the esea . in practice , ed has been using the acs data to make state allocations since fy2005 . title iii grants for a specific fiscal year have been based on acs data from two years prior . for example , fy2007 grants are based on the 2005 acs data . according to testimony provided by cornelia ashby , director of education , workforce , and income security issues at the government accountability office ( gao ) , ed has not used state data because it believes the state data are incomplete . for example , ed noted that for the 2004-2005 school year , not every state provided data , and some data included only partial student counts . this section makes direct comparisons between the most recent acs data and the most recent state data . using both types of data simultaneously , however , would require state data and acs data to be available from comparable years . a third alternative , specifically designed to reduce the volatility of the acs data , would be to average the lep student counts produced by the acs for the last two or three available years , and do the same for the acs immigrant student counts . it begins with a discussion of data limitations in making these comparisons . the number of limited english proficient ( lep ) students enrolled in k - 12 education increased by 60.8% from the 1994-1995 school year to the 2004-2005 school year ; total student enrollment increased by 2.6% over the same time period . given this tremendous growth in the lep student population and the likelihood that the 110 th congress will consider legislation to reauthorize the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ; p.l . 107-110 ) , this report examines the formula used to provide grants to states under the english language acquisition program , authorized by title iii of the esea . this program provides grants to states to help ensure that lep and recent immigrant students attain proficiency in english . other states that would have experienced substantial increases in their fy2007 grant amounts include florida ( $7.8 million or 19.2% ) , utah ( $4.4 million or 123.7% ) , and new mexico ( $4.3 million or 100.2% ) . overall , increases would have ranged from $20,000 in south dakota to $34.2 million in california . much of the debate surrounding the reauthorization of this program has focused on the data used to determine how many lep and immigrant students are in each state , as these data are the basis upon which grants are determined .
