budget projections are inherently uncertain . two measures of the quality of economic forecasts are statistical unbiasedness and accuracy . statistical unbiasedness means that average forecast errors over time are close to zero . 111-123 ) on december 28 . on january 28 , the senate passed an amended version of h.j.res . 45 , which the house passed on february 4 and the president signed on february 12 ( p.l . 111-139 ) , raising the federal debt limit to $14.294 trillion . federal debt held by the public rose sharply from 40.8% of gdp at the end of fy2008 to 53.0% at the end of fy2010 . that ratio , according to the august 2010 cbo baseline , is projected to rise to 66.1% at the end of fy2011 . cbo's analysis of the president's fy2011 budget proposals suggests that ratio would reach 84.3% of gdp at the end of fy2020 . budget projections of the administration and cbo are strongly influenced by expectations of the future health of the u.s. economy . the recent economic recession has also highlighted links between the federal budget and the economy . budgetary projections for fy2011 and beyond depend in large part on how robust economic recovery is expected to be . the timing and strength of the economic recovery from the current recession will likely have major effects on the federal budget . in particular , changes in the expected path of the u.s. economy would affect future revisions of cbo baseline estimates of federal outlays and revenues . on the one hand , a faster - than - expected recovery would imply projections for higher federal revenues and lower outlays on certain "automatic stabilizer" programs whose spending increases when household incomes fall , which would lead to lower baseline projections of federal deficits . on the other hand , a slower or weaker - than - expected recovery would tend to increase projected federal deficits . the current economic recession , as noted above , has been much deeper than many economic forecasters anticipated in 2007 and 2008 . for instance , the u.s. economy contracted at an annualized real rate of 6.8% in the last quarter of 2008 and 4.9% in the first quarter of 2009 , according to commerce department estimates , a sharper decline than many economists had expected . estimates for the fourth quarter of 2009 , which put annualized gdp growth at 5.0% , seemed to signal an end of the economic recession . more recent economic data indicate a slow and uncertain period of economic recovery . according to commerce department estimates , the economy grew at an annualized real rate of 3.7% in the first quarter of 2010 and only 1.6% in the second quarter . given that in past years population growth has been about 1% per year , higher rates of economic growth would be necessary to reduce unemployment and raise living standards significantly . most economists expect unemployment rates to remain elevated for the medium term . unemployment rates have remained at high levels , with the national unemployment rate standing at 9.5% in july 2010 .
