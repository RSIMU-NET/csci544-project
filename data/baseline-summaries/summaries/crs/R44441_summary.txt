usda administration . + $ 20 million to modernize headquarters facilities . food safety inspection service . +$1 7 million for inspection improvements . food for peace grants . - $116 million from less supplemental funding ( $134 million ) to augment constant base funding of $1.466 billion . disaster assistance . - $114 million , comprised from $38 million less appropriated for programs than in fy2016 ( $206 million in the second continuing resolution plus $28 million in the omnibus appropriation ) and $76 million more in disaster designation offsets that do not count against budget caps . agricultural research agencies . - $46 million , comprised primarily of $25 million more for agriculture and food research initiative ( afri ) grants , and $26 million more for agricultural research service ( ars ) operations , offset by $112 million less for ars buildings and facilities . mandatory spending carried in the bill — mostly determined in separate authorizing laws — increases $13.5 billion over fy2016 . all of this increase is in farm programs , including a $14.4 billion increase in the reimbursement to the commodity credit corporation for higher than expected payments for farm commodity revenue support programs ( table 2 ) . this increase is automatic based on farm bill formulas and does not affect discretionary spending limits . over time , changes by title of the agriculture appropriations bill have generally been proportionate to changes in the bill's total discretionary limit , though some activities have sustained relative increases and decreases . agriculture appropriations peaked in fy2010 and declined through fy2013 . since then , total agriculture appropriations have increased ( figure 3 ) . however , whether that increase returns the appropriation to various historical benchmarks depends upon inflation adjustments and other factors . the stacked bars in figure 3 represent the discretionary spending authorized for each title in the 10 years since fy2007 . the total of the positive stacked bars is the budget authority contained in titles i - vi . it is higher than the official "302 ( b ) " discretionary spending limit ( the line ) because of the budgetary offset from negative amounts in title vii general provisions and other scorekeeping adjustments . general provisions are negative mostly because of limits placed on mandatory programs , which are scored as savings ( table 2 ) . for example , in the fy2017 appropriation , budget authority for the primary agencies in the bill ( titles i - vi ) increased $462 million ( the top of the stacked bars in figure 3 ) even though the official discretionary spending allocation decreased $623 million ( the line in figure 3 ) . increases in the use of chimps and other tools to offset discretionary appropriations ameliorated reductions in discretionary budget authority in fy2011 and succeeding years . for example , the official "302 ( b ) " discretionary total for the bill was given credit for declining 13.6% in fy2011 , while the total of titles i - vi declined only 6.4% that year ( figure 3 ) . the effect is less pronounced in fy2016 , since the offset was smaller , in part because of additional spending in general provisions for foreign food aid and emergency programs .
