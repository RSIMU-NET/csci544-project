suspects" — i.e. usda promised to address the allegations . the livestock marketing association ( lma ) issued a statement arguing that the "overwhelming majority" of its members humanely handle their animals out of "both a humane , and economic necessity" and cited its work with the industry to ensure proper handling , but criticized hsus for promoting an anti - meat agenda . hsus called for expanded government oversight of animal handling throughout the marketing chain . it also criticized usda for not fulfilling a requirement in § 10815 of p.l . 107 - 171 , the 2002 farm bill , for a report to congress on the scope , causes , and treatment of nonambulatory livestock , and for humane handling regulations if the report deems them necessary . usda noted that it had collected and published data on the number of such livestock and was completing work on causes and handling practices regarding dairy cattle , to appear in a peer - reviewed journal in 2008 . federal law requires fsis inspectors to be present at all times meat and poultry slaughter plants are operating . in the preamble to the rule , the agency said a notice to its personnel — issued after the january 2004 interim rule — already was directing fsis veterinarians to permit such animals to be slaughtered , so long as the veterinarian could verify that the animal had suffered an acute injury ( eg , a broken leg ) . however , the agency also reaffirmed its earlier findings that bse clinical signs cannot always be observed in a nonambulatory animal even though bse was much more prevalent in such animals . thus , its general ban on their use in food — with this noteworthy exception — would be continued by the final rule . in an effort they said could help to rebuild market confidence , the american meat institute , the national meat association , and the national milk producers federation petitioned fsis on april 22 , 2008 , to again amend the rules to ban nonambulatory disabled cattle from the meat supply under any circumstances . fsis published a proposed rule to do so in the august 29 , 2008 , federal register with a 30-day public comment period . the final rule was published in final form on march 18 , 2009 ( 74 federal register , pp . the rule , effective april 17 , 2009 , now specifically requires establishments to notify fsis inspectors when cattle become nonambulatory disabled after passing ante - mortem inspection ; all such cattle must be condemned and properly disposed of . in separate state action , the california governor signed into law a bill ( a.b . 2098 ) that imposes a strict prohibition against a slaughterhouse holding a nonambulatory animal ( not limited to cattle ) without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize it . the bill , effective january 1 , 2009 , also prohibits stockyards , auctions , market agencies , or dealers from holding a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal or to provide immediate veterinary treatment . violators are subject to up to one year in jail or a fine of up to $20,000 , or both .
