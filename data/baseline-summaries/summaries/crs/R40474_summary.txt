the content of h.r . 6691 was subsequently adopted in the nature of a substitute into h.r . 6842 , which was passed in the house of representatives by a vote of 266-152 . the senate did not pass h.r . 6842 , and the bill did not become law . in the 111 th congress , senator john ensign had introduced s.amdt . 575 to s. 160 , the district of columbia voting rights act of 2009 . this amendment , which also used the language of h.r . 6842 ( 110 th congress ) , was approved by the senate on february 26 , 2009 , and became title ii of s. 160 ( hereinafter title ii - s. 160 ) . although s. 160 was passed in the senate by a vote of 61-37 , it was later reported that movement on this legislation was stalled . as the house passed h.r . 6842 ( 110 th congress ) in september 2008 , the dc council continued to enact emergency legislation until permanent legislation could become effective . language contained in the emergency acts later was encompassed in the permanent legislation . in 2009 , the firearms control amendment act of 2008 ( fcaa ) and the inoperable pistol amendment act of 2008 ( ipaa ) were passed by the dc council and transmitted to congress for the requisite 60 days before becoming effective , respectively , on march 31 , 2009 , and may 20 , 2009 . overall , the fcaa and ipaa not only amended firearms provisions of the dc code that were at issue in heller , but also provided a different range of restrictions on the regulation of firearms and firearm ownership . it is worth noting that the district's new firearms amendments under the fcaa and ipaa were challenged and upheld in the united states district court for the district of columbia on march 26 , 2010 . as discussed above , the language of title ii - s. 160 had been adopted from a bill ( h.r . 6842 ) introduced in the 110 th congress , which originated prior to the enactment of the two new dc acts . the most recent congressional legislation , h.r . 645 , though it also seeks to overturn or loosen many of the district's gun provisions , takes into consideration the passage of these two new acts , the fcaa and ipaa . sections 3-8 of h.r . 645 would amend firearms provisions in the dc code in substantially the same manner as title ii - s. 160 , by limiting the district's ability to promulgate rules regulating firearm possession , and repealing the district's registration scheme , among other things . sections 9-13 would preserve certain provisions of ipaa , while section 14 would repeal other provisions of the ipaa and all of the fcaa . the next provisions discussed were all amendments to the dc code pursuant to the enactment of the fcaa and ipaa . these provisions would no longer exist under the congressional proposal because section 14 of h.r .
