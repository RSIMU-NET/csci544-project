some implications are discussed below . the most fundamental u.s. goals of the confrontation with north korea are to prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to prevent an attack — either nuclear or conventional — on the united states or on its allies in the region . both actions would dramatically diminish u.s. security . the bush administration appears to be divided on how to best achieve these goals , with one group favoring negotiation to shape north korea's behavior and another group advocating measures that will weaken the regime and ultimately lead to its collapse . pursuing u.s. objectives through the six - party talks is complicated by the fact that other states have calculated their own national interests with regard to north korea differently . japan's goals converge most closely with u.s. objectives: to bolster its own security from the threat of a north korean missile attack and to resolve the issues surrounding the abduction of several japanese citizens by north korea in the 1970s and 1980s . for china and south korea , the political instability and economic consequences of a collapse of north korea may represent the worst outcome . pursuit of u.s. goals is dependent on some degree of cooperation from beijing and seoul . the nuclear test by pyongyang has compelled china and south korea to agree to harsher measures , but it is unlikely to alter their ultimate objective of preventing the collapse of north korea . the options outlined below are not intended to be exhaustive , but to provide a spectrum of alternatives . the approach taken by the united states may combine elements of several of the possible strategies . crs report rl33567 , korea - u.s. relations: issues for congress , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl33590 , north korea ' s nuclear weapons development and diplomacy , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rs21391 , north korea ' s nuclear weapons: latest developments , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl31900 , weapons of mass destruction: trade between north korea and pakistan , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rs21582 , north korean crisis: possible military options , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl31696 , north korea: economic sanctions , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl33324 , north korean counterfeiting of u.s. currency , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rs21834 , u.s. assistance to north korea: fact sheet , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl31785 , foreign assistance to north korea , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl32493 , north korea: economic leverage and policy analysis , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rs21473 , north korean ballistic missile threat to the united states , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl32167 , drug trafficking and north korea: issues for u.s. policy , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl33389 , north korea: a chronology of events in 2005 , by [author name scrubbed] , [author name scrubbed] , and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl32743 , north korea: a chronology of events , october 2002-december 2004 , by [author name scrubbed] , [author name scrubbed] , and [author name scrubbed] .
