( 3 ) epa granted four of the eight petitionsfor the 1-hour ozone standard: connecticut , massachusetts , new york,and pennsylvania . petitions from four other states were denied as these states no longer had areas that were not inattainment with the 1-hour standard . the rule specifies nox allocations for 392 facilities in 12 states and thedistrict ofcolumbia , and implemented through a cap - and - trade program . circuit court of appeals upheld epa'sauthorityto issue the rule on may 15 , 2001 , but ordered epa to reconsider factors used in setting emission limits ( appalachianpower co. v. epa ) . epa responded to the court's order on august 3 , 2001 . on january 15 , 2002 , the epaannounced itwould delay the compliance deadline for the section 126 rule from may 1 , 2003 , to may 31 , 2004 , in line with thedeadlinefor the nox sip call . epa argues that a court order issued august 24 , 2001 , had already suspended the compliancedeadline for powerplants , and it would be unfair to make other emission sources meet an earlier deadline . in january 2000 , epa decided to indefinitely stay its original final determinations with respect to the 8-hour standard , givenlitigation regarding that standard . it also announced that findings with respect to petitions by the district ofcolumbia,delaware , maryland , and new jersey would be determined in the future . since the filing of the nsr lawsuits in november 1999 ( and subsequent lawsuits filed in 2000 ) , several significant actionshave occurred . first , in february 2000 , epa announced that it had come to an agreement with tampa electriccompany ona consent decree that will settle the nsr lawsuit against that utility . the agreement will reduce nox emissions byover85% ( and so 2 emissions by almost 80% ) through a combination of fuel switching to natural gas,pollution controlequipment optimization , and other techniques . the estimated $1 billion program is expected by tampa electric tohave a"small" impact on its customers' bills .
