firm size is measured by using employment . additionally , 99% ( 968,134 ) of c corporations have less than 500 employees , which is the most common employment - based threshold used by the sba . not considering the ramifications of particular policies on small c corporations could result in a large share of small businesses being overlooked . additionally , when formulating policy it may be useful to keep in mind the distribution of employment across firm size . while the vast majority of corporate and pass - through businesses are small in terms of number of employees , the 0.4% ( 21,561 ) of firms with more than 500 employees account for over 50% of all employees . relatedly , are all large businesses also c corporations ? answering these questions may help to better target particular tax , and nontax , policies . this report uses 2015 u.s. census data to investigate how the size of businesses varies by legal form ( corporate and pass - through ) , as well as the distribution of employment across firm types . the majority of both corporations and pass - throughs in 2011 had fewer than five employees ( 55% of c corporations and 64% of pass - throughs ) . this report does not attempt to resolve the debate over what exactly constitutes a small business . the data presented below are from the census bureau's 2015 statistics of u.s . businesses , the most recent census data by legal form . the census provides data separately for businesses with no employees ( their nonemployer data ) and businesses with at least one employee ( their employer data ) at some point in the year . this report uses employer data only , mainly because nonemployers generate less than 4% of all business sales and receipts according to census , and because census excludes nonemployers from the majority of its own statistics . it could also be argued that many nonemployers likely represent individuals involved in side work or short - term contract work , which can be viewed as distinct from the more traditional businesses captured in the employer data . in 2015 , 124.1 million people were employed by employer firms . c corporations accounted for approximately 54.9 million employees ( 44.2% ) , s corporations accounted for 32.6 million employees ( 26.2% ) , partnerships accounted for 14.3 million employees ( 11.6% ) , sole proprietors accounted for 4.7 million employees ( 3.8% ) , nonprofits accounted for 15.7 million employees ( 12.6% ) , governments accounted for 1.3 million employees ( 1.0% ) , and 0.5 million employees were categorized as being employed at "other" entities ( 0.4% ) . corporations and pass - throughs account for a combined 96.5 million workers , with 55% employed at corporations and 45% employed at pass - throughs . in 2015 , there were 5.5 million corporations and pass - throughs with at least one employee at some point during the year . there were 2.9 million s corporations , 1.0 million c corporations , 0.9 million sole proprietorships , and 0.7 million partnerships .
