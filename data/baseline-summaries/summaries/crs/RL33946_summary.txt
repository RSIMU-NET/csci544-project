in its report ( h.rept . 110-652 of may 16 , 2008 ) on h.r . the house recedes . the conferees note that while there may be credible research initiatives to explore the use of molten salt reactors for commercial power generation , the use of molten salt reactors on naval vessels is not currently technically feasible and a requirement to perform a study on the use of molten salt reactors is premature . this is due to technology challenges with material construction ( molten salt reactors are inherently corrosive to metals ) , storage of the liquid fuel , and radiation shielding for the crew from a non - solid fuel reactor . the conferees recommend that the navy continue to monitor the progress of technology development in commercial application of molten salt reactors , including licensing , for potential future application . ( page 708 ) . the house - reported version of h.r . 5658 contained a provision ( section 1013 ) that would amend section 1012 of the fy2008 defense authorization act ( see discussion below ) to include amphibious ships and amphibious command ships of a certain minimum size as among the types of ships to be built in the future with nuclear power unless the secretary of defense notifies congress that nuclear power for a given class of ship would not be in the national interest . section 1013 stated: sec . policy relating to major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy . section 1012 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( p.l . 110-181 ) is amended by adding at the end the following: ' ( d ) amphibious assault ships , including dock landing ships ( lsd ) , amphibious transport - dock ships ( lpd ) , helicopter assault ships ( lha / lhd ) , and amphibious command ships ( lcc ) , if such vessels exceed 15,000 dead weight ton light ship displacement. 5658 , the house armed services committee stated: this section would amend section 1012 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( p.l . 110-181 ) by requiring that in addition to future ship classes of aircraft carriers , major surface combatants , and submarines , that assault echelon amphibious ships also must be constructed with integrated nuclear power systems if the ship's light weight displacement is greater than 15 thousand tons . the committee believes the future naval force should not be reliant on the availability of fossil fuel for fleet operations . removing the need for access to fossil fuel sources significantly multiplies the effectiveness of the entire battle force and eliminates the dependence on foreign nation support of deployed naval forces .
