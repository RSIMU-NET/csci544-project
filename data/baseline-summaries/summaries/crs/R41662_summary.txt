unlike h.r . 235 , the prohibition provision in s. 310 would be effective on or after the date of enactment of this legislation . 569 is a house companion bill to s. 310 and contains the same legislative language . 3427 and s. 1826 are companion bills that , among other provisions , would authorize states to create self - employment assistance ( sea ) programs available to recipients of euc08 and eb benefits . sea allowances would be paid in lieu of ( and in the same amount as ) unemployment benefits under the euc08 and eb programs for up to 26 total weeks to eligible individuals who ( 1 ) have at least 13 weeks of remaining benefit entitlement through the euc08 and eb programs and ( 2 ) are participating in entrepreneurial training activities . sea participants would be exempt from the work availability and work search requirements under euc08 and eb . 3427 and s. 1826 , sea benefits would be available to up to 1% of all euc08 and eb claimants in each participating state . participants would be able to discontinue sea participation at any time and receive any remaining entitlement to euc08 or eb benefits . under current law , states are authorized to set up sea programs for recipients of regular uc benefits , but not recipients of euc08 or eb benefits , as proposed by h.r . 3427 and s. 1826 would also provide federal funds to states that submit approved applications to be used for ( 1 ) the creation , development , and administration of the proposed sea programs and ( 2 ) the promotion and enrollment of euc08 and eb recipients in sea programs . appropriated funds for these grants to states would total $35 billion for each fy2012 through fy2014 . the sea provisions in h.r . 3427 and s. 1826 are substantively similar to the sea provisions that were included in p.l . s. 1743 would give states the option to create a "learn to earn" program , if approved by the u.s. dol . all learn to earn state programs would be authorized for fy2013 and fy2014 only . a learn to earn program ( which is similar to the "bridge to work" program proposed in the american jobs act [ s. 1549 , s. 1660 , h.r . 12 ] ) would allow individuals to continue to receive euc08 benefits as wages for work performed in a short - term work experience placement of up to 10 weeks for not more than 38 hours per week . learn to earn state programs would be required to compensate claimants at a rate equivalent to the minimum wage , with the euc08 benefit payment counted as wages for that calculation . the state would be permitted to augment the euc08 benefit . for individuals participating in a learn to earn program , work search requirements would be suspended during the participation and additional wages paid by the program would not offset euc08 benefit amounts . any earnings acquired during program participation would not be considered earnings for the purposes of employment taxes , but would be treated as unemployment benefits for tax purposes .
