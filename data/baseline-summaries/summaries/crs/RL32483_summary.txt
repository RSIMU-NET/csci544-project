tracking progress . sips must include several provisions to ensure the adequacy of the sip . in particular , the sip must include requirements for submitting sip revisions to epa every 10 years , beginning in 2018 . progress reports tracking the state's reasonable progress efforts are due every five years . reports must include a determination of the adequacy of the state's sip . an alternative program is provided in section 309 as an option for nine former members of the grand canyon visibility transport commission ( gcvtc ) . five states chose to meet the epa deadline for inclusion under this option . based on the commission's 1996 report , section 309 allows states to choose to follow the commission's recommendations for reducing visibility impairment in the 16 class i areas in colorado rather than the section 308 program , up to the year 2018 . focused primarily on so 2 emissions , which are a major component of regional haze , states set voluntary "so 2 milestones," instead of requiring bart . if the milestones are not achieved , then a back - up mandatory emissions trading program would be activated to ensure compliance with the milestones . the successor organization to the gcvtc , the western regional air partnership ( wrap ) submitted to epa an annex to the commission's report in 2000 that identifies the voluntary so 2 reduction milestones out to the year 2018 , along with the back - up trading program details . the 2018 milestone of 510,000 tons would represent a reduction of 320,000 tons from 1990 emissions of 830,000 tons . epa approved the annex in 2003 . while working on the regional haze rule , epa was also proposing to implement a new national ambient air quality standard ( naaqs ) for very fine particulates ( pm 2.5 ) , which are key contributors to regional haze . to implement the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs , a monitoring network had to be established and three years of data collected before states could identify pm 2.5 nonattainment areas and begin the development of sips . adhering to the separate schedules could lead some states to revising sips twice , once for visibility and then , a year or two later , for pm 2.5 attainment . as a result , epa proposed that states preparing sips for attaining the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs combine it and their submittal of the regional haze sip revisions . 105-178 , enacted june 9 , 1998 , congress codified this proposal and also extended deadlines for areas not designated nonattainment . the enacted language stipulates that sips implementing the regional haze rule be submitted on the same schedule as those for pm 2.5 nonattainment areas . this linking of the implementation schedules of regional haze and pm 2.5 rules effectively extended the regional haze actions . under the nationwide section 308 program , states classified as attainment under the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs have one year after that designation ( which occurred on december 17 , 2004 ) to submit to epa their revisions to sips to implement the regional haze requirements .
