no further action was taken . to date , there has been one hearing in the 114 th congress on the emv transition . on october 7 , 2015 , the house of representatives committee on small business held a hearing , "the emv deadline and what it means for small businesses. the 113 th congress held three hearings that addressed data breaches , both generally and in response to specific breaches . members were particularly interested in whether the payments industry was on track to meet the october 1 , 2015 , deadline . other issues discussed included the current state of technology and standards to protect consumers from international cybercriminals , and the evolution of cyberattacks against the u.s. industry from rogue hackers to sophisticated international crime syndicates and foreign governments . questions and concerns remain that congress might choose to monitor . data on the impact of emv signature verification on fraud reduction do not exist because signature verification was not adopted in other countries ( they chose to adopt pin verification ) . so , while the primary driver of the transition is fraud reduction , it remains to be seen if signature verification will produce the same level of fraud reduction in the united states as pin verification has produced in other countries . congress may follow the renewed interest by some states to encourage pin adoption . the delay reaching agreement over debit card programming could cause the emv debit card transition to lag behind the emv credit card transition . one study found that fraud reduction in pos transactions was achieved more quickly by migrating all card products at or near the same time . the payments industry will need to stay on track to achieve the simultaneous transition , which could have an impact on overall fraud reduction , and the relative level of fraud between credit cards and debit cards . given the broad interest in reducing data breaches and fraud , and the october 1 , 2015 , transition deadline , the 114 th congress might examine the effectiveness of the transition to determine whether legislative action may be needed , especially if major breaches continue to occur . many questions were raised in hearings during the 113 th congress , including: are companies implementing the additional security safeguards recommended to decrease c ard - n ot - p resent f raud ? cnp fraud decreased significantly in countries where both card issuers and merchants implemented additional safeguards on such transactions . card issuers here have implemented various methods to offer those safeguards , but success will be largely dependent on widespread use by merchants . are companies taking adequate steps to prepare for a data breach ? data breaches will likely continue , but there are steps that companies can take to prepare for them and mitigate their damage . for example , experian has published a preparation guide for companies that could make post - breach activity easier and more conducive to assisting law enforcement . are existing post - breach consumer notification procedures adequate and consistent ? consumers might reasonably expect to receive all the information needed , in a timely manner , to protect themselves after a data breach .
