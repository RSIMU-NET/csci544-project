earlier studies include "the lancet study. in 2006 , researchers from johns hopkins university and baghdad's al - mustansiriya university published their most recent cluster study on iraqi civilian casualties , commonly referred to in the press as "the lancet study" because it was published in the british medical journal of that name . the study surveyed 47 clusters and reported an estimate of between 426,369 and 793,663 iraqi civilian deaths from violent causes since the beginning of operation iraqi freedom to july 2006 . by combining all of these sources by date , the brookings institution estimates that between may 2003 and july 2011 , 115,515 iraqi civilians died and between june 2003 and july 2011 , 10,125 iraqi police and security forces died . table 4 provides iraqi civilian , security forces , and police officers casualty estimates from nongovernmental sources . these estimates are based on varying time periods and have been created using differing methodologies , and therefore readers should exercise caution when using and comparing these statistics . each of these ministries releases their data to the press on a monthly basis . according to their totals , 9,466 civilians and 2,238 iraqi police and security forces have died since january 2008 . figure 1 charts the deaths of civilians and police and security forces as reported by the iraq ministry of health . the iraq body count ( ibc ) website bases its casualty estimates on media reports of casualties , some of which may involve security forces as well as civilians . using media reports as a base for casualty estimates can entail errors: some deaths may not be reported in the media , whereas other deaths may be reported more than once . the ibc documents each of the civilian casualties it records with a media source and provides a minimum and a maximum estimate . as of november 21 , 2011 , the ibc estimated that between 103,640 and 113,230 civilians had died as a result of military action . in a separate analysis of its data , the ibc also estimated that , between january 2006 and november 2008 , 4,884 iraqi police had been killed . it is not clear whether this distinction was made with the 2010 data reported by unami . added together , the iraq ministry of human rights would seem to have a tally of 88,948 iraqi civilian deaths from 2004 through 2010 . along with the iraq ministry of human rights , other iraqi ministries also have kept data on civilian deaths . the iraq health ministry releases data on civilian deaths and the iraq ministries of the interior and defense release data on police and security forces deaths . a separate analysis used ibc data to look at iraqi civilian deaths caused by perpetrators of armed violence during the first five years of the iraq war . table 1 provides statistics on fatalities and wounds in ond . all troops are slated for withdrawal from iraq by the end of 2011 . table 2 provides statistics on fatalities and wounds during operation iraqi freedom , which began on march 19 , 2003 , and ended august 31 , 2010 .
