see table 2 . in addition to revising the caps for the base budget , the bba provided a nonbinding level for oco in fy2017 of $58.8 billion . the president's request matches this level , which includes $5.2 billion for activities that were not funded in the base budget due to the caps such as depot maintenance and procurement of preferred munitions . the fy2017 oco request would maintain a u.s. presence in afghanistan , sustain personnel deployed to the middle east to conduct operations against isis , build capacity of the iraqi and syrian opposition forces , and support other partner nations in counterterrorism efforts . the oco request also includes $3.4 billion to enhance the u.s. presence in eastern europe , often referred to as the european reassurance initiative ( eri ) . these caps have been modified several times . the most recent changes to the caps on defense programs ( currently defined as all programs included in budget function 050 ) occurred with november 2 , 2015 enactment of the bba . the bba raised the fy2017 cap to $548.1 billion . taking account of the non - dod agencies funded in the 050 function , this implies an imputed cap of $526.3 billion on dod discretionary appropriations for fy2017 . see figure 2 . the fy2017 dod base budget request reduces military personnel accounts by $61 million from the fy2016 enacted level . it also includes $205.8 billion for operation and maintenance ( o&m ) accounts , which is an $8.4 billion increase from the fy2016 enacted amount . procurement accounts face an $8.2 billion decrease from the fy2016 enacted amount of $110.7 billion . investments in research , development , test and evaluation ( rdt&e ) accounts are up by $2.6 billion . the request is based on the force level projections in table 3 . table 4 depicts the oco budget request by appropriation title . under the budget request the number of active duty military personnel in the u.s. military services would decline from 1.30 million to 1.28 million , with the army dropping by 15,000 to 460,000 ( heading toward a planned level of 450,000 ) and the navy declining by 4,400 , partly to reflect a proposal to disband one of 10 carrier air wings . the budget proposes that military basic pay increase by 1.6% , costing about $300 million less than if military pay rose at the 2.1% rate that is the average in the private sector ( according to the labor department's employment cost index ( eci ) survey ) .
