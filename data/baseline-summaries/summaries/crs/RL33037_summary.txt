appendix a . titles and subtitles of the 2002 farm bill ( farm security and rural investment act of 2002 , p.l . gal . by 2012 ) with 5.3 billion gallons of annual ethanol production capacity currently in operation and another 4.4 billion gallons of capacity under construction and potentially on - line by early 2008 . based on a conversion rate of 2.75 gallons per bushel , the rapid expansion of ethanol production capacity suggests that the u.s. ethanol sector will need over 3 billion bushels of corn as feedstock in 2007 and over 3.6 billion bushels in 2008 ( 34% of the 2006 crop ) . several factors have emerged since 2002 that could influence the consideration of agricultural research , education , and extension policies when congress next visits this usda mission area in the context of a 2007 farm bill . the current farm bill was debated in a time of budget surpluses ; congress will construct the next bill in an era of large federal deficits . funding is the first of several major factors that will affect the upcoming debate . the other factors concern specialty crop issues , pressure to reform long - standing methods of distributing federal funds for agricultural research , and trade . some rural areas , such as those within commuting distances of metropolitan areas or with environmental amenities and / or affluent retirees , are thriving . other rural areas with sparse populations and declining economies continue to face significant challenges . the less diversified the local economy , the more vulnerable it is to economic downturns and the more difficult it may be to create new competitive forces in these areas during periods of recovery . when agricultural production and related businesses dominated rural economies , federal policies that strengthened and improved agriculture also tended to strengthen and improve the well - being of most of america's small communities and rural residents . as the power of this linkage has declined , many observers have felt that rural policy has been left fragmented and unfocused , comprising a patchwork of programs and initiatives rather than a coherent policy . agriculture remains the primary policy framework for congress's consideration of rural issues , and questions have been raised about whether current rural policies and programs are helping to create new economic capacity in rural america that will generate future competitive advantages . researchers and others who discuss conditions in "rural" america most often refer to conditions in nonmetropolitan areas . metropolitan ( metro ) and nonmetropolitan ( nonmetro ) areas are delineated by county . in june 2003 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) released the census 2000 version of metropolitan ( metro ) and nonmetropolitan ( nonmetro ) areas , a classification system often used to define urban and rural america . in this most recent update , nonmetro america comprises 2,052 counties , contains 75% of the nation's land , and is home to 17% ( 49 million ) of the u.s. population . in the middle of the 20 th century , nearly 40% of the rural population lived on farms , with about a third of the rural workforce laboring in production agriculture .
