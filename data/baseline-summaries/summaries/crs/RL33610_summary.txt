they are available to all members and to any majority or minority . some offices were abolished , while others were created . responsibilities were shifted , and accountability was increased . these three sources are discussed in detail in this section . the recodification of house rules was a recommendation of the joint committee on the organization of congress . a brief explanation is included here in this report since references to the numbers and clauses of rules in succeeding sections are to the recodified rules . with the speaker's approval , the rules committee established a task force on recodification at the committee's organizational meeting for the 105 th congress . house rules had last been comprehensively recodified in the 1880s . fifty - one rules were collapsed to twenty - eight , without substantive change but with deletion of obsolete provisions . the recodification sought to use consistent language , to cluster together like provisions , and to retain rules numbers long associated with certain procedures . the rules committee presented its recommendations to house leaders , chairs , and ranking minority members in october 1998 . the proposed recodification was adopted when the house adopted its rules for the 106 th congress on january 6 , 1999 . the parliamentarian's notes in the house rules and manual , attached to specific rules , clauses , or paragraphs , trace the recodification of specific provisions of house rules , in addition to changes to the text of the rules . therefore , citations appearing in the balance of this report are only to the recodified rules , and only to a clause of a rule at the time a change was made . cross references to house rules prior to recodification may be found in the parliamentarian's notes or through table 2 , and changes following recodification to the numbering of clauses , paragraphs , and subparagraphs may be found in the parliamentarian's notes . surveys and hearings conducted by the joint committee on the organization of congress showed that members and staff , in overwhelming numbers , ranked committee structure and other matters involving committees to be among their greatest concerns . the house had previously made extensive changes to committee organization or procedures or both in the legislative reorganization act of 1946 , the legislative reorganization act of 1970 , the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 , the committee reform amendments of 1974 , and a 1980 resolution realigning committee jurisdiction over energy . incremental changes to committee organization and procedures had been made in biennial rules resolutions , and , as noted above , decisions in the democratic - controlled house in the 103 rd congress eliminated four select committees . changes to the committee system made in rules resolutions in the 104 th congress and subsequently addressed most aspects of the committee system . the following section identifies changes made to the committee system on the opening day of each congress since the 104 th congress in resolutions adopting the rules of the house and establishing special orders , and pursuant to the speakers' announcements .
