so we split the difference. on the other hand , ssa suggests that the committee on economic security ( ces ) made the proposal of 65 as the retirement age due to the prevalence of private and state pension systems using 65 as the retirement age and the favorable actuarial outcomes for 65 as the retirement age . in 1983 , congress increased the fra as part of the social security amendments of 1983 , which made major changes to social security's financing and benefit structure to address the system's financial imbalance at the time . among other changes , the fra was increased gradually from 65 to 67 for workers born in 1938 or later . under the scheduled increases enacted in 1983 , the fra increases to 65 and 2 months for workers born in 1938 . the fra continues to increase by two months every birth year until the fra reaches 66 for workers born in 1943 to 1954 . starting with workers born in 1955 , the fra increases again in two - month increments until the fra reaches 67 for workers born in 1960 or later . the increase in the fra , one of many provisions in the 1983 amendments designed to improve the system's financial outlook , was based on the rationale that it would reflect increases in longevity and improvements in the health status of workers . the 1983 amendments did not change the early eligibility age of 62 ( discussed below ) ; however , the increase in the fra results in larger benefit reductions for workers who claim benefits between the age of 62 and the fra . table 1 shows the fra by worker's year of birth under current law . currently , the eea is 62 for workers and spouses ; this is the earliest age at which they can claim retirement benefits . benefits claimed between age 62 and the fra , however , are subject to a permanent reduction for "early retirement. when the original social security act was enacted in 1935 , the earliest age to receive retirement benefits was the fra ( age 65 ) . in 1956 , the eligibility age was lowered from 65 to 62 for female workers , wives , widows , and female dependent parents . this was to allow wives , who traditionally were younger than their husbands , to qualify for benefits at the same time as their husbands . benefits for female workers and wives were subject to reduction if claimed between the ages of 62 and 65 ; the reduction did not apply to benefits for widows and female dependent parents . in 1961 , the eligibility age was lowered from 65 to 62 for men as well . benefits for male workers and husbands were subject to reduction if claimed between the ages of 62 and 65 ; the reduction did not apply to widowers and male dependent parents . although the eligibility age was made consistent for male and female workers , an inconsistency remained in the calculation of benefits .
