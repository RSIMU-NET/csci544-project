this is down from 2.4 mb / d in 2008 . the decline is mostly attributed to lower global demand for oil ; production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , particularly from the persian gulf producing countries ; and piracy . more oil is also flowing to asia from the middle east , while more west african oil is going to europe and north america , and does not have to traverse the canal . 2010 data shows an increase in cargos , but is incomplete for the year . the last time the canal was closed , in 1967 until 1975 , approximately 60% of europe's oil supplies had been passing through the canal . currently , only about 15% is shipped through the canal . similar to the decrease in cargos through the canal , the sumed oil pipeline — which is owned through state companies by egypt ( 50% ) , saudi arabia ( 15% ) , the united arab emirates ( 15% ) , kuwait ( 15% ) , and qatar ( 5% ) — is operating below its capacity of 2.5 mb / d . in 2009 , approximately 1.1 mb / d moved through the pipeline , a decrease of about 50% compared to 2008 . the reduction resulted from many of the same causes as the canal's drop - off in oil transportation . in 2009 , 331 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of lng traversed the canal , which represents 4% of global lng trade and less than 1% of natural gas consumed globally . unlike oil , lng cargos through the suez canal have been steadily rising . between 2008 and 2009 , the volume of lng passing through the suez canal increased over 40% , more than doubling northbound cargos . data for the first 10 months of 2010 show a 66% increase in lng shipments through the canal compared to the 2009 total . the rise in lng cargos is mostly attributable to the large increase in qatar lng exports . nevertheless , there is ample supply of lng in the global market , and rerouting lng cargos to demand centers could be accomplished in a relatively short time frame . while egypt is a relatively small player in the global natural gas industry , it can have a larger impact on regional natural gas supply . egypt produces all the natural gas consumed in lebanon , almost all the natural gas consumed in jordan , and more than half the natural gas consumed in israel . on a world scale , egypt accounted for only 2.1% of global natural gas production and 2.1% of global natural gas trade in 2009 . egypt holds 77 trillion cubic feet or 1.2% of the world's proved gas reserves . egypt exports natural gas through two pipelines and two lng facilities . currently , the arab gas pipeline connects egypt to jordan , lebanon , and syria . there are plans to expand the pipeline further , enabling egypt to export natural gas through turkey to europe . in 2008 , egypt opened an export pipeline to israel .
