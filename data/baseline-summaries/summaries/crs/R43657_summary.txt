two payments are made under section 8003 . each of these types of payments is discussed briefly below . section 8002 section 8002 compensates leas for the federal ownership of certain property . to qualify for compensation , the federal government must have acquired the property , in general , after 1938 , and the assessed value of the land at the time it was acquired must have represented at least 10% of the assessed value of all an lea's real property . about 216 leas receive section 8002 payments annually . payments are usually used by leas for general operating expenses ( eg , teacher salaries , books , supplies , and utilities ) . for fy2014 , $66.8 million was appropriated for section 8002 , and payments to leas are expected to range from $150 to $5.0 million . section 8003 section 8003 compensates leas for enrolling "federally connected" children . these are children who reside with a parent who is a member of the armed forces living on or off federal property ; reside with a parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on federal property ; reside on indian lands ; reside in low - rent public housing ; or reside with a parent who is a civilian working or living on federal land . section 8003 ( b ) authorizes "basic support payments" for federally connected children . for fy2014 , the section 8003 ( b ) payments were funded at $1.151 billion , so $2.302 billion would need to be provided for the program in fy2015 under this funding scenario ( $1.151 for regular budget year appropriations and $1.151 billion for forward funding ) . in subsequent fiscal years , however , assuming the program remained forward funded ( and level - funded ) , the annual appropriation provided solely through forward funding would be $1.151 billion . the increase in discretionary appropriations required to forward fund the section 8003 ( b ) payments in fy2015 would be counted against any statutory or procedural limits on discretionary spending applicable to that fiscal year . in effect , this might require that the additional appropriations to forward fund the section 8003 ( b ) payments during this transition period be offset by reductions to another discretionary program . alternatively , this transition period could be addressed by enacting a provision specifying that a certain amount , such as the double funding needed to switch to forward funding , is not to be counted for the purposes of budget enforcement . in contrast to the regular budget year appropriations that are enacted to fund education activities for a school year that is already underway , advance appropriations are enacted prior to when that school year starts . for example , budget year appropriations to fund the 2015-2016 school year would be enacted in the fy2016 appropriations act and become available as of october 1 , 2015 . advance appropriations to fund the 2015-2016 school year , however , would be enacted one year in advance — in the appropriations act for the fiscal year starting october 1 , 2014 ( fy2015 ) — but not become available until october 1 , 2015 , one full fiscal year after the budget year .
