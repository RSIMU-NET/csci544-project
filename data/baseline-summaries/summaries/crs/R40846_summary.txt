co . , a provision in the north carolina constitution mandating "beneficent provision for the poor" was held to require state provision of free medical treatment to indigent sick persons . how should this duty be enforced ? the debate on these and other questions may be informed by a summary of the scope of the right to health care , particularly the right to access health care paid for by the government , under the u.s. constitution , and under interpretations of the u.s. supreme court . while the united states constitution and supreme court interpretations do not identify a constitutional right to health care at the government's expense , congress has enacted numerous statutes which establish and define statutory rights of individuals to receive medical services from the government . in addition , other statutes , such as title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 which prohibits discrimination under federally funded programs , affect the manner of delivery of services under federal grants . congress' authority to enact health care legislation derives from the enumerated powers set forth in article i , section 8 of the constitution . congress' power to tax and spend for the general welfare and its power to regulate interstate commerce have been the primary sources of constitutional authority for most health care legislation . on the state level , governmental obligations to provide health care services either generally or for particular groups of persons may be found in a number of state constitutions . thirteen state constitutions contain provisions which specifically refer to health . the constitutions of the states of alaska , hawaii , michigan , north carolina , new york , and wyoming have provisions which require the state to promote and protect the public health . for example , alaska's constitution provides that "[t]he legislature shall provide for the promotion and protection of public health. and wyoming's constitution states , "as the health and morality of the people are essential to their well - being , â€¦ it shall be the duty of the legislature to protect and promote these vital interests. other state constitutional provisions permit , and sometimes require , legislative action to fund health care services for specific activities or for certain groups , such as indigent persons . mississippi has a constitutional provision that authorizes laws for the care of the indigent sick in state hospitals . arkansas's constitution has a provision requiring the legislature to provide for the treatment of the insane . by and large , however , state constitutional provisions authorize , but do not require , the provision of health care services . some state courts have liberally construed state constitutional provisions mandating care of the poor to include the provision of health care services . for example , in graham v. reserve life ins . and the constitutionality of alabama's health care responsibility act , which imposed financial responsibility for the medical care of county indigents on counties , was upheld in part on the basis of alabama's constitutional provision requiring counties "to make adequate provisions for the maintenance of the poor.
