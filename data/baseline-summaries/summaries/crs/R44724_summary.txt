some of those who are eligible choose not to apply . there is some research on the factors that might cause an eligible individual to fail to apply for benefits . economists tend to look at the costs of applying for benefits — transportation to the welfare office and time spent in the office applying for benefits and meeting with caseworkers — as factors that , if they outweigh the actual benefit , could cause an eligible person to fail to apply . there are also factors such as individuals' reluctance to divulge personal information and the social stigma attached to receiving assistance that might divert an eligible individual from applying . further , work requirements could be seen as a deterrent to applying for benefits . those eligible for assistance might determine that participating in an activity for 20 or 30 hours per week ( the hour requirements for the federal tanf work participation standard ) for a relatively small benefit is not worth it . the time commitment entailed by a work requirement may also deter eligible persons who are engaged in sporadic or off - the - books work from applying . the size of the tanf cash assistance caseload is determined by both the size of the population eligible for assistance and the rate at which families "take up" that assistance . the take - up rate is the percentage of those eligible for assistance who actually receive it . table 1 shows the cash assistance caseload and selected indicators of child poverty and work among single mothers for selected years , 1995 to 2012 . the decline of the cash assistance caseload since the mid - 1990s can be divided into two eras: 1995 to 2000 and 2000 to 2012 . the period from 1995 to 2000 saw rapid declines in the cash assistance caseload . overall , there were 9.7 million fewer people receiving cash assistance in 2000 than in 1995 . over this period , the child poverty rate and the number of children in poverty ( before assistance income is counted ) also fell . the rate of employment of single mothers ( who headed most afdc families ) increased almost 10 percentage points , from 73.0% to 82.7% . after 2000 , the caseload continued to decline . however , the child poverty rate and number of children in poverty ( before assistance income is counted ) increased . the increase in child poverty occurred even before the onset of the 2007 to 2009 recession . moreover , the rate of employment for single mothers in 2007 was below the rate in 2000 . child poverty increased further during the 2007 to 2012 period , and the employment rate for single mothers fell . in 1995 , there were 15.2 million children ( 21.6% of all children ) living in families with pre - assistance money income below the poverty line ; in 2012 , the number stood at 15.8 million , which was again 21.6% of all children . in contrast , the number of children estimated as having received afdc during 1995 was 11.5 million ; the number of children who received tanf in 2012 was 4.1 million .
