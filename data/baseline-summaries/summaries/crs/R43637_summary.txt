some proposals would have increased the benefit . those payments were made from 1937 through 1939 . when monthly survivors benefits were added to the program in 1939 via the social security amendments of 1939 ( p.l . 76-379 ) , a limited version of the lump - sum death benefit was retained . it was paid only when no survivors benefits were paid on the basis of the deceased worker's earnings record . when made , the payment equaled six times the primary insurance amount ( pia ) . the payment was made to a family member or to an individual who helped pay for the funeral . in 1950 , eligibility for the payment was expanded to include cases where survivors benefits were also paid "so that survivors benefits need not be diverted for payment of burial expenses of an insured worker. the benefit was therefore paid in nearly every death of a social security - insured worker . the 1950 legislation ( p.l . 81-734 ) also sharply increased the pia ( and therefore increased regular monthly benefit levels ) . to maintain the lump - sum benefit steady at the level before 1950 , the formula was changed to equal three times the pia , rather than six times . the social security amendments of 1954 ( p.l . 83-761 ) kept the formula of three times the pia but capped the benefit at $255 , which was approximately three times the maximum pia payable under social security in 1952 . by 1974 , the minimum pia had reached $85 , or one - third of the $255 cap , so the lowest possible lump - sum benefit also reached $255 . as a result , the lump - sum death payment has been unindexed since 1973 , and nearly all lump - sum benefits have been $255 since ( because some payments are based on pias from earlier years , some payments were slightly lower ) . in 1974 , the average payment per worker was $254.64 , and payments have averaged $255 since 1982 . currently , the payment may be lower if the deceased was covered by a foreign system with which the united states has an agreement to integrate benefits , known as a totalization agreement . finally , in 1981 , the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 ( p.l . 97-35 ) restricted eligibility for the lump - sum payment to limited categories of survivors . that change reduced the number of payments made by nearly half , from 1.57 million in 1980 to about 808,000 in 1982 . if a surviving spouse is living with the worker at the time of death , the benefit is paid to the spouse . if the worker and the spouse were living apart , the spouse could still receive the lump - sum death payment if the spouse was already receiving benefits based on the worker's record or became eligible for survivors benefits upon the worker's death . if there is no eligible spouse , the benefit is paid to a child ( or children ) who is receiving or is eligible to receive monthly benefits on the worker's record .
