not all of the cfpb's powers become effective at the same time . some of the bureau's authorities took effect when the dodd - frank act was signed into law on july 21 , 2010 . as previously mentioned , while some of the bureau's authorities went into effect when the dodd - frank act was signed into law , the majority of the cfpb's authorities — including most that are provided under subtitle f — do not go into effect until the designated transfer date . the secretary , in exercising bureau powers within his interim authority , will be subject to the cfp act's general effective dates . generally speaking , subtitle f transfers certain consumer financial protection functions from seven "transferor agencies" to the bureau . another provision of subtitle c provides the bureau the rulemaking authority to require disclosures regarding consumer financial products and services , including the power to establish model disclosure forms . the general rulemaking provisions of subtitle b went into effect on the date of enactment , while the specific rulemaking authorities provided under subtitle c will go into effect on the designated transfer date . the bureau's enforcement and supervisory powers over smaller depository institutions are relatively limited ; they will leave the bureau largely playing a back - up role to those institutions' banking regulators . although the cfp act does not provide the bureau primary enforcement power over these institutions , it does establish a process by which the bureau may refer potential enforcement actions against smaller depository institutions to their banking regulators . also , the bureau , "on a sampling basis," may participate in examinations of these smaller depository institutions that are conducted by their banking regulators . the bureau generally will have access to examination reports prepared by the banking regulators of these smaller depository institutions . although the cfpb will have to rely on existing reports "to the fullest extent possible," it also will have the authority to require smaller depository institutions to create and submit reports directly to the bureau . 111-203 ) substantially overhauled the u.s. financial regulatory system . title x of the dodd - frank act , the consumer financial protection act ( cfp act ) , established the bureau of consumer financial protection ( cfpb or bureau ) within the federal reserve system . the cfp act alters the consumer financial protection landscape by consolidating regulatory authority and , to a lesser extent , supervisory and enforcement authority in one regulator — the cfpb . the bureau will have jurisdiction over an array of consumer financial products and services , including deposit taking , mortgage lending , credit card lending , loan servicing , check guaranteeing , the collection of consumer report data , debt collection , real estate settlement services , money transmitting , and financial data processing . the bureau will serve as the primary federal consumer financial supervisor of many of the institutions that offer these products and services . an examination of the powers provided to the bureau under subtitle f follows below . unlike the administrative powers of subsection ( b ) that expire on the designated transfer date , the secretary's authorities under subsection 1066 ( a ) do not expire until a director is appointed .
