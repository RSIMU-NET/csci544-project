the house bill , h.r . 2354 would have provided $25.5 billion for doe programs . the final bill , p.l . 112-74 , appropriated $25.7 billion . independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission . the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) requested $1.038 billion for fy2012 ( including $10.9 million for the inspector general's office ) , nearly the same as the fy2011 funding level . the house fy2012 energy and water bill would have provided an additional $10 million , while the senate appropriations committee approved the full request . the final bill also provided the full request of $1.038 billion , without the extra $10 million approved by the house . major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users . the nrc budget request included $279.5 million for new reactor activities , a $12.5 million increase from fy2010 , largely to handle new nuclear power plant license applications . until 2007 , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s . however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities and other generating companies to apply for licenses for 30 new reactors , although several license applicants have suspended work on their projects . nrc's proposed fy2012 budget included no funds for licensing doe's previously planned yucca mountain nuclear waste repository . because the obama administration wants to cancel the yucca mountain project and filed a motion to withdraw the license application on march 3 , 2010 , the nrc's fy2011 appropriation was used to close out its licensing activities . the fy2012 house bill included $20 million ( including $10 million added in a floor amendment ) for nrc "to continue the yucca mountain license application" and would have prohibited nrc funds from being used to halt the licensing process unless nrc approved doe's license withdrawal motion . no funding for yucca mountain licensing was included in the senate appropriations committee bill or in the final bill . in response to controversy over actions by nrc chairman gregory jaczko to halt the yucca mountain licensing process , the final bill included a provision ( ยง401 ) that prohibits the nrc chairman from terminating "any program , project , or activity" without a majority vote by the nrc commission . a majority commission vote would also be required to reprogram funds that were specifically included in the bill . for regulation of operating reactors , nrc's fy2012 budget request included $521.3 million , $20.5 million below the fy2010 level . those activities include reactor safety inspections , license renewals and modifications , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises . the fukushima accident , which occurred about a month after the fy2012 budget request was submitted , increased congressional and public concern about the safety of u.s. nuclear power plants .
