111-5 ) for futuregen 2.0 . furthermore , doe has obligated nearly $60 million but has expended $2 million from regular appropriations to futuregen 2.0 since fy2010 . together with the approximately $74 million expended on the project from arra funding ( discussed below ) , total expenditures for futuregen since its conception were between $110 and $120 million as of early 2014 . the futuregen industrial alliance estimated the total cost of the futuregen 2.0 program to be nearly $1.3 billion , with $730 million used toward retrofitting and repowering ameren corporation's power plant in meredosia , illinois , and $550 million used for the construction of a co 2 pipeline , storage site , and training and research center . in 2011 , they estimated that the project would create approximately 1,000 construction jobs and another 1,000 jobs for suppliers across the state . a 2013 report from the university of illinois predicted that the project could create an average of 620 permanent jobs for 20 years and approximately $12 billion of business volume by 2037 for the state of illinois . despite congressional and obama administration commitments to the futuregen 2.0 project , particularly the $1.0 billion appropriation from arra , questions remain as to whether or not futuregen 2.0 will succeed . doe obligated $44 million and expended $42 million between fy2005 and fy2010 toward the original project . under the obama administration , congress appropriated almost $1 billion in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l . after more than 10 years and two restructuring efforts since futuregen's inception , the project is still in its early development stages . although the futuregen 2.0 industrial alliance completed drilling a characterization well at the storage site in morgan county , il , and installed a service rig over the well for further geologic analysis , issues with the power plant itself have not yet been resolved . among the remaining challenges are securing private sector funding to meet increasing costs , purchasing the meredosia power plant from ameren , obtaining permission from the doe to retrofit the plant , performing the retrofit , and then meeting the goal of 90% capture of co 2 . in addition , the alliance is awaiting approval for a class vi well permit for the injection and sequestration wells . congressional consideration of ccs has focused on balancing competing national interests , such as fostering low - cost domestic sources of energy like coal versus reducing greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions in the atmosphere . legislative proposals during the 109 th and 110 th congresses focused on advancing carbon capture technologies that reduce co 2 emissions to mitigate ghg - induced global warming . congress began appropriating funds specifically for futuregen beginning in 2005 . previously , doe had allocated funds under its clean coal power initiative ( ccpi ) program . with the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 , congress appropriated approximately $1 billion for the futuregen 2.0 project . the revival of futuregen under the obama administration as futuregen 2.0 has sparked increased scrutiny of the future of integrated ccs technology on a commercially viable scale .
