the provision was not enacted . provisions to establish a system of worker registries and to change existing h - 2a - related requirements were likewise included in two h - 2a reform proposals introduced in the 106 th congress ( s. 1814 / h.r . in addition , s. 1814 / h.r . 4056 would have established a two - stage legalization program , under which farm workers satisfying specified work requirements could have obtained temporary resident status and then legal permanent resident ( lpr ) status . although formal congressional consideration was limited to a senate immigration subcommittee hearing , s. 1814 / h.r . 4056 became the basis of a bipartisan compromise on foreign agricultural workers . that agreement , however , fell apart at the end of the 106 th congress . 4548 , the other reform bill before the 106 th congress , differed from s. 1814 / h.r . 4056 in that it sought to establish a pilot h - 2c alien agricultural worker program to supplement , rather than replace , the h - 2a program . 4548 also did not include a legalization program . 4548 was reported by the house judiciary committee in october 2000 , but saw no further action . like s. 1814 / h.r . 4056 in the 106 th congress , key bills before the 107 th congress coupled significant h - 2a reform with legalization . 2736 would have streamlined the process of importing h - 2a workers , particularly for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements . with respect to legalization , both proposals would have allowed foreign agricultural workers who met specified work requirements to adjust to lpr status through a two - stage process like that in s. 1814 / h.r . the requirements for adjustment of status in s. 1313 / h.r . 2736 differed from those in s. 1161 , with the latter being more stringent . among the other major differences between the proposals , s. 1161 would have eased existing wage requirements , while s. 1313 / h.r . 2736 would have mandated a study of the wage issue . no action beyond committee referral occurred on either proposal . legislation in the 108 th congress bills to reform the h - 2a program , the h - 2b program , and the "h" visa category generally , as well as bills to establish new guest worker programs , were introduced in the 108 th congress . some of these bills would have enabled certain workers to obtain lpr status . no action beyond committee referral occurred on any of the bills . congressional committees held related hearings during the 108 th congress . the house agriculture committee held a hearing on the potential impact of recent guest worker proposals on the agricultural sector , and the house judiciary committee's subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims held a hearing on the impact of guest workers on u.s. workers . in the senate , the judiciary committee's subcommittee on immigration , border security , and citizenship held hearings on evaluating a guest worker proposal and on border security under a guest worker program .
