appendix c. sfops organization char . funds previously requested in these accounts would be consolidated into the iha account . the administration is requesting $7.73 billion in international security assistance for fy2021 , an increase of 4.3% from the fy2020 request and 14.3% below the fy2020-enacted level . the greatest cuts to security assistance accounts would be to peacekeeping operations ( pko , - 36.6% ) and international military education and training ( imet , - 27.4% ) ( figure 5 ) . the fy2021 request includes an increased investment in the u.s. development finance corporation ( dfc ) , established in 2019 to implement the build act . however , the administration would eliminate funding for the u.s. trade and development agencyâthe request includes $12.11 million for the agency's "orderly closeout"âand an 8.3% reduction from fy2020-enacted levels for the export - import bank of the united states' operations account . as in previous years , the administration assumes that all export promotion expenditures would be offset by collections . in the fy2021 request , the administration assumes $711.20 million and $496.00 million in offsetting collections from the export - import bank and the dfc , respectively . the administration organizes much of its country and regional assistance into six thematic priorities ( figure 6 ) . these priorities are also meant to reflect the broader foreign operations goals outlined in " foreign operations highlights . top country recipients under the fy2021 request remain consistent with prior year funding allocations . israel , egypt , and jordan would remain the top three recipients of foreign assistanceâthough egypt would move ahead of jordan when compared with fy2019 actual fundingâlargely due to the proposed levels of military aid for those three countries . other countries that the administration maintains are strategically significant , including afghanistan and ukraine , also remain top country recipients in the fy2021 request , as do several african countries that would receive high levels of global health and development aid ( table 8 ) . regionally , the middle east and africa would receive the largest shares of aid in the fy2021 requestâtogether comprising about 71.5% of total aid allocated by country or regionâconsistent with fy2019 year actuals ( figure 7 ) . proposed funding for europe and eurasia and , separately , the indo - pacific , come to 3.9% and 9.2% , respectively . notably , the distribution of assistance within regions vary significantly . for example , africa receives a majority of ghp funding ( 58.1% in fy2019 and a proposed 66.7% for fy2021 ) , but accounts for a small proportion of incle funding ( 5.2% in fy2019 and a proposed 4.1% for fy2021 ) . in comparison , the western hemisphere region accounts for a small percentage of ghp ( 2.5% in fy2019 and a proposed 2.2% for fy2021 ) and a large proportion of incle funds ( 37.7% in fy2019 and a proposed 44.8% for fy2021 ) . appendix a. sfops funding , by account appendix b .
