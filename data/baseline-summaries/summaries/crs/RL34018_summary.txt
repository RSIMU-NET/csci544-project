in contrast , h.r . 3989 , introduced by representative mchugh , represents a new proposal . under this program , utilities are given a specific allocation of permitted emissions ( allowances ) and may choose to use those allowances at their own facilities , or , if they do not use their full quota , to bank them for future use or to sell them to other utilities needing additional allowances . all five bills introduced in the 110 th congress provide for a tradeable allowance scheme to implement their emission caps on so 2 , nox , and co 2 . however , allowance allocation schemes in the bills differ , with s. 1201 and s. 1554 containing detailed provisions for allocating so 2 , nox , and co 2 allowances to various economic sectors and interests . in most cases , these interests ( or their trustees in the case of households and dislocated workers and communities ) would auction off ( or otherwise sell ) their allowances to the affected utilities and use the collected funds for their own purposes . the proposal has not been reintroduced in the 110 th congress . the second administration proposal initiates a new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program , similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h. w. bush and clinton administrations . s. 1201 , introduced by senator sanders , and s. 1554 , introduced by senator collins , are similar but revised versions of s. 150 , introduced in the 109 th congress . developed in response to the u.s. ratification of the 1992 unfccc , these previous plans projected u.s. compliance , or near compliance , with the unfccc goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary measures . the bush administration proposal does not make that claim , projecting only a 100 million metric ton reduction in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 . total emissions would continue to rise . instead , the plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy , reducing 2002 emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 . it proposes several voluntary initiatives , along with increased spending and tax incentives , to achieve this goal . the administration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about one - quarter of the objective , while three - quarters of the projected reduction is seen as occurring through existing efforts . in the 110 th congress , five bills have been introduced that would impose multi - pollutant controls on utilities . they are all four - pollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide . s. 1168 , introduced by senator alexander , and s. 1177 , introduced by senator carper , are revised versions of s. 2724 , introduced in the 109 th congress . all of these bills involve some form of emission caps , beginning in 2009-2012 time frame . s. 1168 , s. 1177 , and s. 1201 include a second phase beginning in 2013-2015 ; h.r . 3989 includes a multi - phase program for co 2 only .
