other examples include p.l . 109-267 which extended the iran - libya sanctions act , the iran nonproliferation amendments act ( p.l . 109-112 ) , which added syria to that act , and the north korea nonproliferation act of 2006 ( s. 3728 ) , which added north korea to the iran â€” syria nonproliferation act . in its oversight capacity , congress may wish to consider whether or not expanding ctr assistance could have a "snowball" effect , particularly if the united states insists on using its own resources rather than existing multinational inspectorates . costs of assistance are likely to be minimal the first one or two years , but these could escalate , depending on the objectives of the program . in the nuclear area , the nuclear programs of india , pakistan , israel , and north korea are far smaller than russia's and unlikely to incur the kinds of costs that the ctr program has thus far incurred . on the other hand , data are scarce on the state of nuclear materials in those countries , so it is difficult to determine the scope and time - frame of such a program . at a minimum , however , such a program is likely to be incrementally implemented . costs could be minimal if a quick - fix , low - technology , information - oriented approach is taken or they could be more substantial if a sophisticated , high - technology approach is taken that would incorporate cameras , encryption , remote monitoring , and other means . the same is true in the bw and cw areas ; the scope of the undertaking in russia greatly outweighs the combination of programs of relevant states . however , the management of multiple programs could present particular difficulties . in 1991 , the legislation that created the nunn - lugar program stipulated that u.s. assistance in destroying nuclear and other weapons may not be provided to the soviet union , any of its republics , or successor entities unless the president certifies to the congress that the proposed recipient is committed to: making a substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weapons ; forgo any military modernization that exceeds legitimate defense requirements or is designed to replace destroyed wmd ; forgo the use of fissile materials and other components from destroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons ; facilitate u.s. verification of weapons destruction that uses u.s. money ; comply with all relevant arms control agreements ; and observe internationally recognized human rights , including the protection of minorities . certifications , according to some administration officials , allow the united states to hold the recipient states' "feet to the fire," providing a source of leverage . in the view of others , however , they pose unnecessary and even dangerous delays in implementing ctr programs . in the fy2006 national defense authorization act ( p.l . 109-163 ) , section 1303 of title xiii extended the three - year authority to waive certification requirements indefinitely . section 1304 of s. 2766 , the senate's version of the fy2007 national defense authorization act , would have repealed all certification requirements .
