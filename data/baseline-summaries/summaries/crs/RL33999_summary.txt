the only other differences between h.r . 4986 were provisions added to the later bill that would make retroactive to january 1 , 2008 a 3.5% pay raise for military personnel and the reauthorization of various bonuses , including enlistment and reenlistment bonuses . according to press reports , white house officials have said the president will sign the revised defense bill , h.r . on november 13 , the president signed into law the conference report on the fy2008 defense appropriations bill ( h.r . 110-114 ) , which would provide $460.3 billion in new budget authority for activities of the department of defense . the house had approved the compromise version of the bill november 8 by a vote of 400-15 and the senate adopted it by voice vote the same day . in general , the appropriations bill funds only dod's base budget â€” its activities other than the conduct of ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan . the only exception to that rule is the conference report's inclusion of $11.6 billion to purchase mine - resistant , ambush - protected ( mrap ) vehicles , which are designed to better protect their occupants against land - mines than conventional vehicles . the conference report also includes a continuing resolution that would allow federal agencies to continue operating , through december 14 , 2007 , even if their regular appropriations bills for fy2008 have not been enacted . because none of the regular fy2008 appropriations bills had been enacted by october 1 , when the new fiscal year began , a continuing resolution ( h.j.res . 52 ) , passed by the house september 26 by a vote of 404-14 and by the senate september 27 by a vote of 94-1 , provided for continued funding the government through november 16 . funding for dod under that continuing resolution is based on the amount appropriated in the fy2007 dod appropriations act ( p.l . 109-289 ) , which funded both the dod base budget and a so - called bridge fund of $70 billion to pay for war costs in the opening months of the fiscal year . 52 also provided an additional $5.2 billion to purchase mrap vehicles . neither the house - passed nor the senate - passed versions of h.r . 3222 addressed the president's request to fund ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan in fy2008 , which will be dealt with in a separate bill . budget amendments in july and october increased the president's initial request for $141.7 billion to cover war - fighting costs in fy2008 to $189.3 billion . on november 14 , by a vote of 218-203 , the house passed h.r . 4156 , a bill that would provide $50 billion to cover war costs pending congressional action early next year on the balance of the president's request . the bill also would require dod to begin withdrawing u.s. forces from a combat role in iraq and would set a non - binding goal of removing u.s. forces in that country from all but a few supporting roles by december 2008 , for which reason the president said he would veto the bill .
