to this end , h.r . 2 addresses agriculture and food policy across 11 titles that cover commodity support programs , agricultural conservation , trade and international food aid , domestic nutrition assistance , credit , rural infrastructure and economic development , research and extension , forestry , horticulture , and a variety of other policies and initiatives . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projected that spending on mandatory programs under h.r . 2 would total $867 billion over the 10-year period fy2019-fy2028 , which equals the cost of extending the current 2014 farm bill for 10 years . the vote to approve h.r . 2 followed a failed vote of 198-213 on the same bill on may 18 , 2018 . the final passage vote on june 21 followed a vote of 233-191 approving a motion to reconsider , which was made after the unsuccessful vote on final passage of may 18 . the committee on agriculture marked up and ordered reported h.r . 2 on april 18 , 2018 . the house - passed version of h.r . 2 continues the tradition of multi - year farm bills that would establish policy for farm programs and nutrition assistance . 2 would supersede the current slate of farm programs and policies authorized by the 2014 farm bill , p.l . 113-79 , many of which will expire in 2018 unless congress acts to reauthorize them or to extend them . certain programs , such as crop insurance , are permanently authorized and would continue to operate in the absence of new farm legislation or an extension of the current farm bill . but if the current farm law were to expire , many other programs — such as commodity support programs that provide a safety net for producers of major agricultural commodities , such as corn and wheat , milk , sugar , and others — would be governed by so - called permanent laws , which do not expire and date from the late 1930s and 1940s . these permanent laws , including the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 ( p.l . 75-430 ) and agricultural act of 1949 ( p.l . 81-439 ) , emphasize supply controls to support price support regimes that would raise prices of these basic farm commodities well above existing market levels . congress has been active in establishing federal policy for the agricultural sector on an ongoing basis since the 1930s . over the years , as economic conditions and technology have evolved , congress has regularly revisited agricultural policy through periodic farm legislation . over these decades , the breadth of policy areas addressed through such farm bills has expanded beyond providing support for a limited number of agricultural commodities to include establishing programs and policies that address a spectrum of related areas , such as agricultural conservation , credit , rural development , domestic nutrition assistance , trade and international food aid , organic agriculture , and support for beginning and veteran farmers and ranchers , among others . on june 21 , 2018 , the house voted 213-211 to approve h.r .
