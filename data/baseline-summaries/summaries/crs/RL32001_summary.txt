848 noted above . the senate version of the pepfar reauthorization bill , s. 2731 ( biden ) , reported by the senate committee on foreign relations on april 15 , 2008 , would also authorize $50 billion over fy2009-fy2013 , to fight aids , tb , and malaria , but would not designate the additional 14 caribbean countries as focus countries . appropriations for hiv / aids assistance to the caribbean and central america are funded largely through the annual state department , foreign operations , and related agencies appropriations measure . for further information , see crs report rl33485 , u.s. international hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria spending: fy2004-fy2008 , by [author name scrubbed] . ( see table 1 ) . in the caribbean , usaid provides hiv / aids assistance through both bilateral and regional programs , and is an active member of the pan caribbean partnership against hiv / aids . nih has funded international research efforts worldwide focusing on such areas as vaccine research , prevention of disease transmission , research on women and aids , prevention and treatment of hiv infection in children , prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections , and capacity building and training of foreign scientists . an estimated 17,000 adults and children in the region became infected in 2007 . aids remains one of the leading cause of death among adults in the caribbean aged 15-44 years . the caribbean countries with the highest prevalence or infection rates in 2006 were haiti , the bahamas , belize , guyana , and trinidad and tobago , with rates between 2% and 4% ; and barbados , the dominican republic , jamaica , and suriname , with rates between 1% and 2% . haiti and the dominican republic account for three - quarters of the region's infected population . the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) notes that haiti's poverty , conflict , and unstable governance have contributed to the rapid spread of aids over the years . in both countries , however , there are indications that the epidemic could be reaching a turning point because of prevention efforts . nevertheless , trends in both countries suggest the need to protect against a resurgence of the epidemic . in haiti , there are been declining infection levels in port - au - prince and other cites , and the declines appear to be associated with some protective behavioral changes ( an increase in condom use and a drop in the number of sexual partners ) although aids mortality has also been a factor . in the dominican republic , where there has been a large increase in the use of condoms by commercial sex workers , the epidemic appears to have stabilized . however , workers on sugar cane plantations ( bateyes ) continue to have high prevalence rates , with rates up to 12% found among males aged 40-44 . in central america , honduras has the highest prevalence rate of 1.5% ( with aids related diseases the second leading cause of death in the country ) , while el salvador , guatemala , and panama have rates just under 1% .
