title i of h.r . 3204 , the proposed compounding quality act , attempts to address some of these issues . the act would , among other things: maintain fda authority to regulate drug compounding that goes beyond the scope of state - regulated practice of pharmacy ; establish a new category of compounding entity , termed "outsourcing facility," which would apply to entities that compound sterile drugs , volunteer to register with fda , and follow practice and reporting requirements ; require that the label of a drug from an outsourcing facility state "this is a compounded drug" ; dictate user fees to fund outsourcing facility registration and reporting ; advisory committee activities ; annual reports ; the issuing of regulations ; and a study by the government accountability office ( gao ) ; and direct enhanced communication among state boards of pharmacy and between those boards and the fda . to do so , title i would amend ffdca section 503a [21 usc 353a] on pharmacy compounding and add a proposed section 503b on outsourcing facilities as well as proposed sections 744j and 744k to give fda the authority to assess and use outsourcing facility fees . a drug may change hands many times from the point at which it leaves the manufacturer until it reaches the dispenser who provides the drug to a patient . each step along the way — involving the manufacturer , wholesale distributors , repackagers , third - party logistics providers , and dispensers — presents an opportunity for "contamination , diversion , counterfeiting , and other adulteration. members of congress , fda , and industry groups within the supply chain , among others , have looked for a mutually agreeable system to trace and verify the identity of a drug as it travels through the chain . one goal was the development of a national policy that would be more feasible and effective than a patchwork of varying state requirements .
