this section briefly describes the current cap . the cap governs agricultural policies and programs for the eu's 28 member countries . following the most recent reform completed in june 2013 , the overall cap budget has been set for the seven - year period 2014-2020 at â‚¬408.3 billion in 2015 prices ( or approximately $452.8 billion ) . the cap is now focused on three long - term priorities: 1 . promoting viable food production with a focus on agricultural income , agricultural productivity , and price stability ; 2 . promoting sustainable management of natural resources and climate action , with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions , biodiversity , soil , and water ; and 3 . promoting balanced territorial development , with a focus on rural employment , growth , and poverty in rural areas . the 2013 reform maintained the concept of two separate pillars for the cap but tightened the link between them by expanding direct payments to have seven potential components ( as described below ) . in addition , payments made under both pillars are subject to a common set of cross compliance requirements ( also described below ) . furthermore , the cap sets rules and regulations for how funds may be used between and within these two pillars . in addition to the cap framework , member states also generally implement supplementary measures funded at the national level that may target specific local or national objectives . the 2014 farm bill ( the agricultural act of 2014 ; p.l . 113-79 ) , signed into law by president obama on february 7 , 2014 , governs current u.s. farm policy . the farm bill is an omnibus , multi - year ( 2014-2018 ) piece of authorizing legislation that governs agricultural and food programs including traditional commodity programs as well as conservation , trade , rural development , nutrition , and other program areas . the 2014 farm bill reshaped the farm safety net for traditional program crops , most notably by eliminating decoupled direct payments ( valued at $5 billion per year for 1996-2013 ) and adding two new partially coupled payment programs: the price loss coverage ( plc ) and agriculture risk coverage ( arc ) programs . unlike the eu , where direct payments represent the largest share ( 71% ) of the projected cap budget for 2014-2020 ( table 5 ) , domestic nutrition programs comprise the largest share ( 80% ) of projected farm bill outlays over the five - year farm bill period 2014-2018 ( table 6 ) . the u.s. farm commodity safety net is comprised of three components . first are the traditional f arm commodity programs which represent the heart of u.s. farm policy by virtue of their long history ( dating back to the 1930s ) . support is based primarily on statutorily fixed prices , although arc uses a moving average of market prices . for crop years 2014-2018 , the marketing loan program establishes minimum prices for approximately two dozen commodities , including corn , soybeans , wheat , rice , and peanuts . in addition , producers with production histories for covered crops could choose between plc payments and arc payments .
