the interest rate is the baa bond rate . debt is weighted one - third . all of these factors suggest not including these tax benefits in marginal calculations . however , there is probably some marginal effect , and if the individual income tax rate on these passive forms of income is set to one half of its value to reflect the share of non - taxed investment returns , tax rates would be reduced substantially â€” by about eight percentage points without the lower rates ( particularly on dividends and capital gains ) enacted recently ; about six percentage points otherwise . the basic formula for calculating the effective tax rate is , where r is the pre - tax return , or internal discount rate for an investment with no taxes , and r is the after - tax discount rate that discounts all flows to the cost of the investment with taxes . if all mortgage interest deductions were allowed , but no property tax deductions , the tax rate would be zero because there is no tax on the imputed net rent . a slight positive or negative tax may arise because of the inability to deduct mortgage interest by non - itemizers and the ability to deduct property taxes by itemizers . the mathematical formulas and assumptions used to calculate tax rates , including depreciation methods and lives , investment credits , inflation rates , and statutory tax rates , as well as the tax rates themselves for 1953-1989 , can be found in [author name scrubbed] , the economic effects of taxing capital income , cambridge: mit press , 1994 , appendix b , pp . the statutory tax rates , interest and inflation rates for 1953-1989 are in table 2.1 , p. 20 . tax rates for 1990-2005 incorporate a number of assumptions and tax law changes . these include the increase in the tax life for structures from 31.5 to 39 years in 1993 , the lowering of the capital gains tax rate to 20% in 1997 , the introduction of bonus depreciation ( expensing of a share of investment ) at 30% for 2002 and 50% for 2003 and 2004 , and the reduction in the tax rate for capital gains and dividends from 20% and the regular tax rate respectively to 15% . individual and corporate statutory tax rates and inflation and interest rates are reported in table 2 for 1990-2005 . the pattern of change in individual tax rates is based on the rate reported for the nber simulation model , which can be found at http: / / www.nber.org / ~taxsim / mrates / mrates3.html , visited november 20 , 2003 . tax rates are assumed to continue at the current year's rate ; slightly lower rates would occur for 2001 and 2002 if the permanent long term rates enacted in 2001 were assumed , although rates might also rise due to real bracket creep as well . inflation rates are a 1 / 3 weight of the prior year and a two - thirds weight of the current year . column 4 presents the estimated rates for unincorporated business ( proprietorships and partnerships ) .
