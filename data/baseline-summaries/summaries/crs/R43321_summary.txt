the innovation act of 2013 , h.r . form 18 does not demand a specific level of particularity for these statements . courts have interpreted rule 8 to require complaints to include only "'a short and plain statement of the claim' that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests" rather than fully developed allegations at this stage of the pleadings . this approach is described as the "notice pleading" standard , emphasizing the primary purpose of complaints as notifying parties of the general issues of the case . a "patent troll" is a pejorative term for a "non - practicing entity" ( npe ) or a "patent assertion entity" ( pae ) . these entities are people or companies that do not develop , manufacture , or sell any product covered by the patents they own . the business model of a pae instead focuses on buying and asserting patents against companies that have already begun using and developing the patent , often without knowledge of the pae's ownership of the patent . critics of paes argue that these patent - holders extort the patent system through litigation by extracting licensing fees or damage awards from companies that cannot afford the cost of litigation . critics also argue that "patent trolling" deters innovation and discourages companies from seeking patents , and thus delivering new products to the market . however , defendants of paes view this practice as encouraging investment in undercapitalized projects . commentators have linked paes together with the current patent pleading requirements for a patent infringement claim . they argue that the minimal information required in a patent infringement complaint encourages paes to initiate "frivolous" lawsuits that otherwise would not survive the initial pleading stage under a more stringent standard . even though many of the pae infringement lawsuits are ultimately unsuccessful , the costly discovery stages of the lawsuit contribute to the financial burden carried by the defendants of these claims . moreover , with the threat of costly litigation , defendants are more likely to settle or to enter into an agreement to pay licensing fees . the 112 th congress passed the leahy - smith america invents act of 2011 ( aia ) , which sought to address the proliferation of paes . the debate leading to the aia demonstrated growing congressional concern over the high costs of litigation patent disputes initiated by paes and their enforcement of patents . the aia does not include specific reforms relating to patent pleadings and paes . however , section 34 of the aia instructs the government accountability office ( gao ) to study the costs , benefits , and consequences of litigation by "non - practicing entities" and "patent assertion entities. the gao report , released in august 2013 , analyzes the trends in patent infringement litigation and recommends changes to discovery , such as an e - discovery model to reduce costs , and additional oversight by the u.s. patent office in gathering data about patent enforcement . during the 113 th congress , congress has introduced several different legislative proposals relating to patent reform . the following bills specifically target patent troll litigation to curb their prevalence in court .
