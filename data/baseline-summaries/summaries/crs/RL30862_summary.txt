the provisions of s.res . — when the senate is considering a reconciliation bill or a reconciliation resolution pursuant to section 310 , ( whether that bill or resolution originated in the senate or the house ) or section 258c of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 upon a point of order being made by any senator against material extraneous to the instructions to a committee which is contained in any title or provision of the bill or resolution or offered as an amendment to the bill or resolution , and the point of order is sustained by the chair , any part of said title or provision that contains material extraneous to the instructions to said committee as defined in subsection ( b ) shall be deemed struck from the bill and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor . ( b ) extraneous provisions . — ( 1 ) ( a ) except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ) , a provision of a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution considered pursuant to section 310 shall be considered extraneous if such provision does not produce a change in outlays or revenues , including changes in outlays and revenues brought about by changes in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are required to be collected ( but a provision in which outlay decreases or revenue increases exactly offset outlay increases or revenue decreases shall not be considered extraneous by virtue of this subparagraph ) ; ( b ) any provision producing an increase in outlays or decrease in revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net effect of provisions reported by the committee reporting the title containing the provision is that the committee fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions ; ( c ) a provision that is not in the jurisdiction of the committee with jurisdiction over said title or provision shall be considered extraneous ; ( d ) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it produces changes in outlays or revenues which are merely incidental to the non - budgetary components of the provision ; ( e ) a provision shall be considered to be extraneous if it increases , or would increase , net outlays , or if it decreases , or would decrease , revenues during a fiscal year after the fiscal years covered by such reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution , and such increases or decreases are greater than outlay reductions or revenue increases resulting from other provisions in such title in such year ; and ( f ) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it violates section 310 ( g ) . i think it made them perhaps have a little less high esteem for some of us here in the senate... . in the final analysis , their leadership had to demand that some of these provisions subject to the byrd rule come out . during house consideration of the conference report , several democratic members criticized the byrd rule and discussed its impact on the legislation .
