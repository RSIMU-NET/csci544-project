in contrast , h.r . 6083 to the floor for further action . as a result , the 112 th congress failed to pass a new five - year farm bill . instead , atra extends the current 2008 farm bill until september 30 , 2013 , or , in the case of the farm commodity programs that are on a different calendar , through crop year 2013 . in the 113 th congress , both the senate - passed ( s. 954 ) and house - passed ( h.r . 2642 ) bills would extend most of the renewable energy provisions of title ix , with the exception of the rural energy self - sufficiency initiative , the forest biomass for energy program , the biofuels infrastructure study , and the renewable fertilizer study , which are either omitted or explicitly repealed by both bills . in addition , s. 954 omits the repowering assistance program , while h.r . 2642 adds a new reporting requirement on energy use and efficiency at usda facilities . funding for the next farm bill will be based on the baseline projection of the cost of the 2008 farm bill programs by the congressional budget office ( cbo ) during may 2013 , and on varying budgetary assumptions about whether programs will continue . the primary difference between the house and senate bills is in the source of funding ( table 3 ) . over their five - year reauthorization period ( fy2014-fy2018 ) , the senate bill contains a total of $900 million in new mandatory funding and authorizes $1.140 billion in appropriations for the various title ix programs . 2642 contains no mandatory funding for title ix programs , while authorizing $1.405 billion over the five years , subject to annual appropriations . in addition , the house bill eliminates all support for the collection , harvest , storage , and transportation ( chst ) component of bcap , severely limiting its potential effectiveness as an incentive to produce cellulosic feedstocks . available funding to write the next farm bill will be based on the baseline projections of the cost of current farm bill programs by the congressional budget office , and on varying budgetary assumptions about whether programs will continue . all 13 bioenergy provisions of title ix — with the exception of section 9010 , the feedstock flexibility program for bioenergy producers — received mandatory funding only for the life of the 2008 farm bill , fy2008 through fy2012 . although most of the title ix bioenergy programs have been reauthorized for fy2013 by the atra farm bill extension , they have received no new mandatory funding . instead , most bioenergy programs were given extended authority to make appropriations of varying amounts which makes them dependent on the annual appropriations process . as a result , usda bioenegy programs do not have a budgetary baseline beyond fy2012 . many analysts believe that lack of mandatory funding under the 2008 farm bill extension represents a severe setback for long - term development of bioenergy programs . see table 3 for a comparison of program funding under the house and senate 2013 farm bills .
