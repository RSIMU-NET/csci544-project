, norm ) . part 61 . generally class a and b wastes are buried no greater than 30 meters ( ~100 feet ) . class c waste must be buried at a greater depth to prevent an intruder from disturbing the waste after institutional controls have lapsed . the operation of a disposal facility was originally foreseen to last 20 to 40 years , after which it would be closed for stabilization period of 1 to 2 years , observed and maintained for 5 to 15 years , then transferred to active institutional control for 100 years . at the time of licensing , funds had to be guaranteed by the state or licensee for the facility's long term care after closure . at present , no disposal facility exists for greater than class c waste , though the doe is in the initial phase of a process to identify disposal options . the senate committee on energy and natural resources conducted a hearing in september 2004 to consider the potential shortage of low - level waste disposal sites . the gao had concluded in a 2004 report that no shortfall in disposal capacity appeared imminent , although the national low - level waste database that would be used to estimate the adequacy of future capacity was inaccurate . the gao recommended that the doe stop reporting the database information , and added that congress may wish to consider directing the nuclear regulatory commission to report when the disposal capacity situation changes enough to warrant congressional evaluation . mixed waste contains both concentrations of radioactive materials that satisfy the definition of low - level radioactive waste in the low - level radioactive waste policy act , and hazardous chemicals regulated under the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra , 42 u.s.c . in general , facilities that manage mixed waste are subject to rcra subtitle c ( hazardous waste ) requirements for hazardous waste implemented by epa ( 40 c.f.r . 124 and 260-270 ) or to comparable regulations implemented by states or territories that are authorized to implement rcra mixed waste authority . the rcra subtitle c program was primarily developed for the states' implementation with oversight by epa . naturally occurring source material uranium contains uranium isotopes in the approximate proportions of: u - 238 ( 99.3% ) , u - 235 ( 0.7% ) , and u - 234 ( trace amount ) by weight . source material uranium is radioactive , u - 235 contributing 2.2% of the activity , u - 238 48.6% , and u - 234 49.2% . depleted uranium is defined in 10 cfr 40.4 ( domestic licensing of source material ) as "the source material uranium in which the isotope u - 235 is less than 0.711 % of the total uranium present. it is a mixture of isotopes u - 234 , u - 235 , and u - 238 having an activity less than that of natural uranium . most of the doe depleted uranium hexafluoride inventory has between 0.2% and 0.4% u - 235 by weight . the former aec began operating uranium enrichment plants in 1945 to produce u - 235 enriched fuel for national defense and civilian nuclear reactors .
