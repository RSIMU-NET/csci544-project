figure 4 shows a chart for fy1948 through fy2018 . the availability of energy — especially gasoline and other liquid fuels — played a critical role in world war ii . another energy - related factor was the application of research and development ( r&d ) to the atomic bomb ( manhattan project ) and other military technologies . during the post - world war ii era , the federal government began to apply r&d to the peacetime development of energy sources to support economic growth . at that time , the primary r&d focus was on fossil fuels and new forms of energy derived from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion . the atomic energy act of 1946 established the atomic energy commission ( aec ) , which inherited all of the manhattan project's r&d activities and placed nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management under civilian control . a major focus of the aec was research on "atoms for peace," the use of nuclear energy for civilian electric power production . prompted by the oil embargo declared by the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries in 1973 , the federal energy administration was established in mid - 1974 . in early 1975 , the energy research and development administration ( erda ) was established , incorporating the aec and several energy programs that had been operating under the department of the interior and other federal agencies . the department of energy ( doe ) was established by law in 1977 , incorporating activities of the fea and erda . all of the energy r&d programs — fossil , nuclear , renewable , and energy efficiency — were brought under its administration . doe also undertook a small program in energy storage and electricity system r&d that supports the four main energy technology programs . from fy1948 through fy1977 , the majority of federal government support for energy r&d focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies . total spending on fossil energy technologies over that period amounted to about $17.1 billion , in constant fy2016 dollars . the federal government spent about $51.6 billion ( in constant fy2016 dollars ) during that period for nuclear energy r&d ( in all the tables and figures in this report , the "nuclear" category includes both fission and fusion ) . the energy crises of the 1970s spurred the federal government to expand its r&d programs to include renewable ( wind , solar , biomass , geothermal , hydro ) energy and energy efficiency technologies . comparatively modest efforts to support renewable energy and energy efficiency began during the early 1970s . since fy1978 , doe has been the main supplier of energy r&d funding compared to other federal agencies . in real ( constant dollar ) terms , funding support for all four of the main energy technologies skyrocketed during the 1970s to a combined peak in fy1979 at about $8.6 billion ( 2016 constant dollars ) . funding then dropped steadily , to about $2.0 billion ( 2016 dollars ) per year during the late 1990s . since then , funding has increased gradually — except that the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .
