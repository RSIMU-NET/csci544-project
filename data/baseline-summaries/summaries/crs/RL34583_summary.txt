these production forecasts reflect three factors . first , flood - related acreage losses appear to be substantially less than initially projected . second , nearly ideal growing conditions that have persisted across the corn belt since late june have contributed to sharp increases in usda's yield outlook for corn , thus , offsetting flood - related area losses . third , despite a 17.6% increase in planted acreage in 2008 , soybean production is flat due to a diminished yield outlookâlargely due to the lateness of the crop's planting and development , as well as dry conditions in the delta , the southeast , and the northern plains . usda's august crop production forecast appear to have calmed much of the market concern regarding crop losses due to flooding . however , a large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and , as of early august , remain substantially behind historical development rates . as of august 11 , usda estimates that 30% of corn had reached the dough stage of development compared with the 5-year average of 50% , while only 6% had dented compared with an average of 16% the past five years . similarly , 60% of soybean plants had set pods compared with the 5-year average of 75% . as a result , market analysts suggest that weather problems could still emergeâsuch as an early freezeâthat could lower yield and production prospects , especially in the more northerly regions where crop development remains behind normal . the potential weather - and flood - related production losses to this year's u.s. corn and soybean crops were unwelcome news to the market and , likely to contribute to higher commodity prices in june . because the united states plays a dominant role in global corn and soybean markets , u.s. price changes transmit directly to the international marketplace . in summary , good growing conditions during july and early august of 2008 appear to have moderated initial concerns over potential flood - related crop losses . however , a large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and , as of early august , remain substantially behind historical development rates . as a result , market analysts suggest that weather problems such as an early freeze could still emerge to lower yield and production prospects . most long - term forecasts project prices for feed grains and oilseedsâas well as those crops that compete for area with feed grains and oilseedsâto remain at significantly higher levels than experienced during the recent 1998-2006 period . the united states plays a critical role in global markets for both feed grains and oilseeds . however , a rough approximation of flood - damaged acres can be obtained by comparing the implied state - level abandonment rates from usda's august forecasts with the recent eight - year average abandonment rates . the united states is the world's leading producer and exporter of both corn and soybeans . in 2007 the united states had 42% and 63% shares , respectively , of world corn production and trade , and 32% and 41% shares of world soybean production and trade .
