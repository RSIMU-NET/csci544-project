for that period , total consumption was 19.4 tcf . it serves as a basic raw material for products such as fertilizers , plastics , antifreeze , pharmaceuticals , and fabrics . an important use of natural gas is in the production of chemicals , including methanol , ammonia , butane , ethane , propane , and acetic acid . the yearly deviation from average demand over the decade generally has been less than 4% . the industry stabilized in 2009 , with production capacity , total production , and imports at about the same levels as in 2008 . the annual production capacity and annual production data for 1999 and 2008 suggest that capacity utilization increased over that 10-year period . consolidation took place in the industry over the period , and it is likely that the remaining firms continued to operate only the more efficient facilities . the apparent stability of aggregate demand masks the shifting roles of the demand for natural gas between electric power generation and industrial users . the former increased by 32.6% over the decade , while the latter declined by 23.4% , which , when allowing for the initial differences in base consumption levels in 2000 , essentially cancel each other , resulting in relatively stable aggregate demand . data for natural gas delivered for consumption for the period 2000-2009 are presented in table 1 . eia natural gas consumption data for 2010 are available only for the first 10 months of 2010 . for comparison , consumption over a similar period in 2009 was 18.6 tcf , while in 2008 consumption was 19.0 tcf . these data suggest that the effects of lower gas prices coupled with reduced effects of the recession were increasing demand . for the first 10 months of 2010 industrial natural gas demand totaled 5.4 tcf , up from 5.0 tcf in 2009 , but still lower than the 5.6 tcf demand recorded for the first 10 months of 2008 . while natural gas use as a vehicle fuel has more than doubled from 2000 to 2009 , it remains only a fraction of 1% of total u.s. consumption , as illustrated by a comparison of the data in table 1 and table 2 . u.s. production of natural gas over the period 2000 to 2009 was relatively stable , averaging 19.2 tcf , with yearly deviations from average demand generally less than 7% . table 3 shows data for u.s. supply from domestic production and imports . domestic natural gas production during the first 10 months of 2010 was 17.8 tcf , compared to 17.2 tcf for a comparable period in 2009 and 16.7 tcf in 2008 . imports continued to decline in the first 10 months of 2010 as lower - cost domestic production continued to expand its market share . most imports of natural gas arrive in the united states from canada through pipelines . small quantities of natural gas are imported from trinidad and tobago and other sources in the form of liquefied natural gas ( lng ) . the sum of u.s. production and imports as shown in table 3 exceeds the total of natural gas delivered to u.s. consumers as shown in table 1 .
