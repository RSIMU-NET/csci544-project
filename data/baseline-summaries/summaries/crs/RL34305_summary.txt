three states have no motorcycle helmet law . six states have repealed their universal helmet laws since 1997 , though one , louisiana , reinstated its law in 2004 . congress's stance on universal helmet laws has varied over time . in 1966 , congress passed legislation to withhold a portion of a state's highway funding if the state had not adopted a universal helmet law by 1976 . at that time , no state had a motorcycle helmet law . by 1975 , 47 states had adopted such legislation . the motorcycle fatality rate per 10,000 motorcycles declined from 12.7 ( 1966 ) to 6.7 ( 1976 ) . in 1976 , congress repealed the penalty for failure to have a universal helmet law . other factors showed little or no change . for example , the rate of helmet use observed in motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes was virtually unchanged from 1995 ( 56% ) to 2004 ( 57% ) . other trends observed in the 1995-2004 crash data were that motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes were becoming older and riding more powerful motorcycles . the share of fatalities in which the motorcyclist was 40 years old or older rose from 25% ( 1995 ) to almost 50% ( 2004 ) , pushing the average age of motorcyclists involved in a fatal crash up 19% , from 32 ( 1995 ) to 38 ( 2004 ) . the share of fatal crashes involving motorcycles with engine displacements of 1,000 cubic centimeters ( cc ) or more rose from 30% ( 1995 ) to 41% ( 2004 ) , pushing the average engine displacement of motorcycles involved in fatal crashes up 21% , from 841 cc ( 1995 ) to 1,015 cc ( 2004 ) . congress has given dot the mission of reducing traffic deaths . as noted above , the number of passenger vehicle traffic deaths has declined over the past decade , while the number of motorcycle deaths has been increasing . nhtsa has found that motorcycle helmets are the single motorcycle safety measure whose effectiveness has been specifically proven , and that requiring riders to wear helmets is a relatively low cost measure which can be implemented by a state passing a law requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets and is relatively easy to enforce . nhtsa estimates that a motorcyclist without a helmet is three times as likely to die in a crash as a motorcyclist wearing a dot - compliant helmet , and among motorcyclists who survive a crash , those not wearing a helmet are three times as likely to suffer a brain injury as those wearing a dot - compliant helmet . nhtsa estimates that 728 of the 4,553 motorcyclists who were fatally injured in 2005 could have survived if all motorcyclists had been wearing helmets . moreover , an older person is more susceptible to incurring a brain injury from a blow to the head than is a younger person , so as the overall motorcycle rider population ages , the protective value of helmets for motorcyclists increases . the use of motorcycle helmets also has a significant economic impact . studies of motorcyclists injured in crashes find that the costs of crashes are much lower for motorcyclists wearing helmets .
