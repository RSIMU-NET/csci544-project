availability of the aca . the prevalence of the aca after 2014 is likely to cause some ssdi recipients to return to work for two reasons . first , the aca may reduce beneficiary reliance on ssdi as a path to medicare access . second , the aca may improve the health conditions of disabled - worker beneficiaries . efforts in cdrs . with increased program integrity funding in recent years , ssa has increased the number of full medical cdrs completed , and the backlog was reduced to about 64,000 cases at the end of fy2017 . between 2013 and 2017 , about 147,000 benefits were terminated after cdrs . the effect of cdrs on ssdi terminations will become relatively smaller , as the ssa eliminated the backlog by the end of fy2018 . the actual magnitude of the effect awaits further analysis . decline in the allowance rate . the total allowance rate at all adjudicative levels declined from 62% in 2001 to 48% in 2016 . while this decline may in part reflect the impact of the great recession ( since ssdi allowance rates typically fall during an economic downturn ) , the social security advisory board technical panel suspects that the declining initial allowance rate may be a result of the change in the ssdi adjudication process . in addition to the factors contributing to a decline in ssdi applications and awards , some others may have the opposite effect of pushing disability benefit receipt upward . some of those factors may include the increase in the fra , the growth in applications from low - wage workers , and higher incidence rates among young applicants resulting from an expansion of ssdi eligibility rules . but the effect of those factors was smaller than the ones that decreased new ssdi awards between 2011 and 2017 . the number of benefit terminations among disabled workers has been increasing from 2001 to 2017 ( see figure 2 ) , and the share of total disabled - worker beneficiaries who terminated benefits also increased from 8% to almost 10% . the following factors are likely to contribute to the increase in disability terminations . baby boomers reached fra . as the relatively large baby boomer population reaches its fra ( gradually increased from 65 to 66 ) between 2012 and 2031 , there is expected to be a growing proportion of disabled workers who terminate disability benefits due to the attainment of fra . avai lability of j obs . the unemployment rate was as high as 9.6% in 2010 and then gradually decreased every year to about 4.35% in 2017 . the opportunities for employment make working more attractive than disability benefits for people who could qualify for ssdi . if the unemployment rate were kept at 6.02% — the average level between 1985 and 2017 — the age - sex - adjusted incidence rate would have been 3.5% ( 0.35 per 1,000 disability - exposed population ) higher in 2016 . thus about 50,000 more disabled - worker benefits would have been awarded in that year . aging of lower - birth - rate cohorts .
