in some ways , tax expenditures resemble direct spending . they both have similar budgetary effects and provide incentives that alter the allocation of resources . the cbo analysis presented in figure 1 details the distribution of these tax expenditures by tax expenditure type and income group . overall , taxpayers in the top quintile claim 51% of the benefits of the tax expenditures included in the cbo analysis , with the remaining 49% going to taxpayers in the bottom four quintiles . the cbo analysis also allows for this information to be disaggregated by tax expenditure category . for all categories , except credits , the top quintile claims the plurality of the benefits . this skewness is most prominent for the preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividends ( where the top quintile receives 93% of the benefits ) and itemized deductions ( where the top quintile receives 81% of the benefits ) . in contrast , the top quintile receives just 3% of tax credits â€” with the bottom two quintiles receiving 66% of the benefits . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) chose to answer this question most recently by examining selected major individual tax expenditures according to quintiles of the income distribution . an alternative way to examine tax expenditures is to look for trends over an extended time period . scaling against total federal revenue allows for both the effects of the economy and changes in tax law to be observed , while scaling against gdp omits the effects brought on by changes in the tax code . in both cases , the relative amount of tax expenditures grew rapidly from 1974 through the mid - 1980s , before reverting to just less than the 1974 levels as a result of the tax reform act of 1986 ( tra86 , p.l . after tra86 , the amount of tax expenditures grew modestly scaled against gdp and was relatively flat against total revenue until the enactment of the 2001 / 2003 tax cuts . the period after the enactment of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 ( egtrra , p.l . 107-16 ) and the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 ( jgtrra , p.l . 108-27 ) is characterized by higher levels of tax expenditures , versus both gdp and total revenue . the recent divergence of the two measures is likely a result of tax stimulus measures reducing revenue collections ( leading to a higher scaled percentage ) . tax expenditures are sometimes described as "spending through the tax code. thus , the long - term trends in tax expenditures can also be viewed against the levels of federal spending . figure 3 compares the total value of tax expenditures to the levels of mandatory spending , defense discretionary spending , and non - defense discretionary spending since 1974 . unlike figure 2 , figure 3 is reported using current dollars ( not adjusted for inflation ) . as a result , comparisons using figure 3 should be made based upon the relative distance between the levels of tax expenditures and spending over the time period . for example , in 1974 the levels of tax expenditures and discretionary defense spending were roughly comparable .
