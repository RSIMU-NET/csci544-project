that is no longer the case . the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) projects that vmt will grow at an average of roughly 1.2% per year over the next 20 years . meanwhile , other policy changes are weakening the link between driving activity and motor fuel tax revenues . under rules issued in 2012 , new passenger cars and light trucks are expected to attain an average fuel economy of 41.0 miles per gallon in model year 2021 and 49.7 miles per gallon in model year 2025 . improved fuel economy is slowly reducing the average amount of fuel used per mile of travel . the expanding fleets of hybrid and electric vehicles , respectively , pay less or nothing by way of fuel taxes , raising equity issues that are likely to become more prominent as the electric / hybrid vehicle fleet expands . on april 2 , 2018 , the trump administration announced its intent to revise the corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) standards for the model years 2022-2025 . this change could slow the increase in the average fuel economy of the motor vehicle fleet . an increase in the existing fuel tax rates would provide immediate relief to the trust fund . as a rule of thumb , adding a penny to federal motor fuel taxes provides the trust fund with roughly $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion per year . the prospect of reduced motor fuel consumption , however , casts doubt on the ability of the motor fuel taxes to support increased surface transportation spending beyond the next decade , even with significant increases in tax rates . the first federal tax on gasoline ( 1 cent per gallon ) was imposed in 1932 , during the hoover administration , as a deficit - reduction measure following the depression - induced fall in general revenues . the rate was raised to help pay for world war ii ( to 1.5 cents per gallon ) and raised again during the korean war ( to 2 cents per gallon ) . the highway revenue act of 1956 ( p.l . 84-627 ) established the htf and raised the rate to 3 cents per gallon to pay for the construction of the interstate highway system . the federal - aid highway act of 1959 ( p.l . 86-342 ) raised the rate to 4 cents per gallon . the gasoline tax remained at 4 cents from october 1 , 1959 , until march 31 , 1983 . during this period , revenues grew automatically from year to year as fuel consumption grew along with increases in vehicle miles traveled . since 1983 lawmakers have passed legislation raising the tax rates on highway fuel use three times . although infrequent , these rate increases were quite large in a proportional sense . the gasoline tax was raised on april 1 , 1983 , from 4 to 9 cents per gallon , a 125% increase ; on september 1 , 1990 , from 9 to 14 cents ( not counting the additional 0.1 cent for lust ) , or 55% ; and on october 1 , 1993 , from 14 to 18.3 cents , or 31% .
