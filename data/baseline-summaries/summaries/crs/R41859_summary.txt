prior to p.l . 110-252 , 36 states had enacted state laws that calculate the maximum weekly uc benefit via automatic adjustments based on the average weekly wage in a state . therefore , if the average weekly wage declines in these states , they may experience automatic reductions in uc average weekly benefit amount , which are permitted under the "nonreduction" rule . for instance , in 2011 , new jersey and oklahoma appear to have met these conditions and to have experienced automatic reductions in their state uc weekly benefit amount . similarly , in 2012 , hawaii also seems to have met the necessary conditions to automatically reduce the state uc weekly benefit amount . 112-96 provided a specific exception to this uc "nonreduction" rule in the case of state legislation that was enacted before march 1 , 2012 . states that made changes to the regular uc benefit amount prior to march 1 , 2012 , were not subject to the "nonreduction" rule . in february 2013 , north carolina enacted legislation that included a provision to actively reduce uc weekly benefit amounts in the state . effective on or after july 1 , 2013 , this state law provision violated the "nonreduction" rule and , therefore , terminated the euc08 agreement between north carolina and the secretary of the u.s. department of labor . all tiers of euc08 ended in north carolina as of june 29 , 2013 . with the expiration of the euc08 program as of the week ending on or before january 1 , 2014 ( i.e. , december 28 , 2013 ; or december 29 , 2013 , in new york state ) , the "nonreduction" rule is no longer effective . any state uc benefit reductions also reduce weekly amounts for eb benefits ( and euc08 benefits when authorized ) , which are paid out in the same amount . only individuals filing new state uc claims after the effective date for reduced uc durations , however , would experience reductions in uc , euc08 ( when authorized ) , or eb benefits . the effect of collecting more taxes than are spent dampens demand in the economy . it also creates a surplus of funds , or a "cushion" of available funds , for the uc program to draw upon during a recession . in a recession , uc tax revenue falls and uc program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive uc benefits . the increased amount of uc payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of earnings losses by injecting additional funds into the economy . as a result of the most recent recession , december 2007-june 2009 , and its accompanying prolonged and high unemployment , states paid out large amounts of uc benefits: $75.3 billion in fy2009 and $63.0 billion in fy2010 versus $30.2 billion in fy2006 and $31.4 billion in fy2007 . this increase in state expenditures on uc benefits also led to large outstanding federal loans in many states .
