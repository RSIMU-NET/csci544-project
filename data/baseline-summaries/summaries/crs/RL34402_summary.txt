in addition , h.r . in the 111 th congress , the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of 2009 p.l . 111-5 increased the nmtc allocation for 2008 and 2009 , to $5 billion from $3.5 billion . this attention came to fruition with the enactment of p.l . 110-343 , which extended the nmtc program authorization one year , through the end of 2009 . this one - year extension was also proposed in h.r . 2075 and s. 1239 proposed to extend the nmtc through 2013 and would have authorized allocations of $3.5 billion , indexed for inflation , for each of the years . also introduced during the 110 th congress , h.r . 3907 proposed to make the nmtc permanent . for the additional 2008 allocation , the cdfi fund distributes the additional $1.5 billion in nmtcs to applicants of the original 2008 allocation round . also in the 111 th congress , the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-312 ) extended the nmtc authorization through 2011 at $3.5 billion per year . in the 112 th congress the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 ) extended the nmtc authorization for 2012 and 2013 at $3.5 billion per year . in the 113 th congress the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l . 113-295 ) extended the nmtc authorization for 2014 at $3.5 billion . in the 114 th congress the protecting americans from tax hikes ( path ) act ( division q of p.l . 114-113 ) extended the nmtc authorization through 2019 at $3.5 billion per year . the new markets tax credit program is set to expire at the end of 2019 . as congress debates reauthorization of the nmtc , the following policy considerations could be pertinent to any consideration of these bills . the nmtc is primarily intended to encourage private capital investment in eligible low - income communities . however , the source of the investment funds has implications for the effectiveness of the program in achieving its objective . from an economic perspective , the impact of the nmtc would be greatest in the case where the investment represents new investment in the u.s. economy that would not have occurred in the absence of the program . conversely , the impact of the nmtc is diminished to the extent the tax credit is applied to investment that would have otherwise occurred or been funded by a shift in investment from more productive alternatives . to date , only one study has empirically assessed the question of whether nmtc investment is funded through shifted investment or whether it represents new investment . the findings of the study suggest that corporate investment represented a shift in investment location . in contrast , the authors concluded that a portion of individual nmtc investment , roughly $641 million , represented new investment . although important , understanding the source of nmtc investments alone is not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of the nmtc . a comprehensive review of the program would require an accounting of both the social and economic costs and benefits of the nmtc , an undertaking which may pose considerable challenges .
