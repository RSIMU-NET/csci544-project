in the house report accompanying h.r . 3545 , the 100 th congress noted "to the extent activities that would otherwise be conducted in the corporate form , and earnings that would be subject to two levels of tax ( at the corporate and shareholder levels ) , the growth of publically traded partnerships engaged in such activities tends to jeopardize the corporate tax base. further , congress also observed that ptps had been used to avoid corporate taxes , noting that the intent of pre - 1987 tax law was "being circumvented by the growth in publically traded partnerships that are taking advantage of an unintended opportunity for disincorporation and elective integration of the corporate and shareholder levels of tax. when irc ยง 7704 was enacted , effectively subjecting most ptps and mlps to corporate taxation , existing ptps and mlps were allowed to continue operating as a partnership for 10 years . in 1997 , legislation was passed that allowed ptps and mlps that had been grandfathered and allowed to continue operating as partnerships an additional choice . instead of being forced to choose an alternative organizational form , grandfathered ptps and mlps were given the option of paying a 3.5% tax on gross income , as an alternative to corporate income taxes . legislative changes enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l . 108-357 ) potentially expanded the pool of capital able to invest in mlps . provisions in this legislation effectively changed rules related to ubit , which had previously made it unattractive for mutual funds to invest in mlps . specifically , the 2004 jobs act allowed partnership distributions to be considered qualifying income for mutual funds , thus allowing funds to invest in mlps without having to worry about ubit . this change effectively increased the potential pool of mlp investors . most recently , the definition of qualifying mlp income was expanded to include the transportation and storage of certain renewable and alternative fuels , including ethanol and biodiesel , and other activities involving industrial source carbon dioxide . this change was made as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-343 ) , at an estimated cost of $119 million over 10 years . the purpose of this change was to allow biofuels pipelines to receive the same tax treatment as petroleum pipelines . previously , the statutory definition of qualifying income had not been expanded since ยง 7704 was added to the internal revenue code in 1987 . as noted above , policies enacted in the 111 th congress were designed to support investment and growth in the renewable energy sector . these policies were consistent with the objectives of the obama administration , which has emphasized the importance of investments in clean energy technology , including resources and infrastructure . enhanced use of clean energy resources may be consistent with broader energy policy goals , environmental sustainability , and perhaps domestic energy security . enhanced investment in and deployment of renewable energy technologies may also have the potential for domestic job creation . during the 111 th congress , action was taken to address certain challenges in financing renewable energy projects .
