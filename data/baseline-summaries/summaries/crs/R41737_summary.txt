appendix a . community health center fund ppaca section 10503 established a community health center fund ( chcf ) to provide supplemental funding for health center operations and the national health service corps ( nhsc ) . the law provided annual appropriations to the chcf totaling $11 billion over the five - year period fy2011 through fy2015 . ppaca also included a provision the intent of which is that in order for the chcf funds to be used , regular appropriations for the health centers program and the nhsc must be maintained at least at the fy2008 funding level . 112-10 eliminated this requirement for fy2011 , thus allowing chcf funds to be used in fy2011 even though the regular appropriations for health centers and the nhsc for the current fiscal year have been cut well below the fy2008 level . table a - 1 summarizes the amounts appropriated to the chcf and the allocation of funds for each of the five fiscal years . ppaca section 10503 also included an appropriation of $1.5 billion , available for the period fy2011 through fy2015 , for health center construction and renovation . these funds are separate from the chcf and are not included in table a - 1 . appendix b . prevention and public health fund ppaca section 4002 established a prevention and public health fund ( pphf ) , appropriated in perpetuity , to be used to support prevention , wellness , and other public health - related programs and activities authorized under the public health service act ( phsa ) . ppaca appropriates to the pphf: $500 million for fy2010 ; $750 million for fy2011 ; $1 billion for fy2012 ; $1.25 billion for fy2013 ; $1.5 billion for fy2014 ; and $2 billion for fy2015 and each fiscal year thereafter . transfers from the pphf to specific hhs activities for fy2010 and fy2011 have been carried out by the hhs secretary and are summarized , along with the administration's proposed transfers for fy2012 , in table b - 1 . pphf transfers to phs agencies are also itemized in the funding tables presented earlier in this report . ppaca requires the secretary , when using pphf funds to augment existing programs and activities , to maintain at least the fy2008 funding level . fy2011 appropriations for the pphf became available on october 1 , 2010 , at the beginning of the fiscal year . fy2011 operating plans for the recipient agencies show how these funds have been and will continue to be used for this fiscal year . in some cases , pphf funds appear to be used to replace funds from regular appropriations . under current law , pphf funds are appropriated in perpetuity . as a result , the fy2012 amounts in the table reflect not the administration's request for the funds , but rather the administration's intended allocation and use of the funds . congress may by law ( including an appropriations law ) direct the secretary to expend the funds in a manner other than what is proposed , or take any other actions with respect to these funds . two of them are primarily research agencies .
