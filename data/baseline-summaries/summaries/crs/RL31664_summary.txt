at no time did congress reduce the benefit . as such , the claims that the government's contribution to sbp have been reduced are unreliable . nor do such claims rationalize the increase of benefits at age 62 for surviving spouses ( a change that arguably creates a superior benefit relative to those available to the survivors of other federal employees ) . it is noteworthy that after the sbp was introduced , the fy1973 cost to retirees was $36,145,000 with a fiscal year payment to families of only $5,700,000 . this is due to the relatively small number of participants who died shortly after signing up . ten years later , as more retirees signed up and more died , the fy1983 cost to retirees grew to $652,536,000 while the payment to families grew to $406,887,000 . in fy1993 , as participant deaths increased , the cost to retirees was $822,955,000 with payments to families reaching $1,177,185,000 . finally , in fy2005 , costs to retirees were reported to be $1,099,363,000 while payments to families surged to $2,253,728,000 . the rsfpp was replaced because it had a number of unpopular features that made it unattractive . the rsfpp could be expensive for the retiree ; the cost was approximately $0.23 of deducted retired pay per dollar of survivor benefits for a retired member age 45 who elected to provide coverage for a spouse who was 5 full years younger . the rsfpp was intended to be actuarially neutral in terms of costs — in other words , the cost of this program was fully paid for by its participants . the decision to elect rsfpp coverage had to be made by the prospective military retiree before his or her 18 th year of military service . furthermore , the methods used in computing the rsfpp's cost and benefit could change between the time at which the servicemember elected to provide coverage and the time at which the member actually retired . thus , the costs and benefits remained an unknown quantity , limiting the ability of the retiree to make future financial plans . during its 19-year history , participation in the rsfpp never exceeded more than 15% of eligible military retirees . it was expected — and has largely been proven — that the sbp would be a significant improvement over the rsfpp , in terms of participation rates , costs to the retiree , and benefits for the survivors . it also entails higher costs to taxpayers because the sbp costs are shared with the government in most cases . prior to 2004 , sbp benefits were either "offset" in part by the receipt of social security benefits earned as a result of the military members service ( aka the social security offset ) , or subjected to a two - tier benefit structure . both reduced sbp benefits when the recipient turned age 62 . many congressional constituents expressed confusion and dissatisfaction with these provisions . the fy2005 national defense authorization act contained language that made a substantial change in the computation of the sbp benefit for those age 62 and over . simply stated , this law phased out the two - tier and social security offset formulas discussed above .
