at the time p.l . 111-226 was enacted , cbo projected the savings from the snap benefit changes at $11.9 billion from fy2014 to fy2018 . 111-226 achieved these savings ( in section 203 ) by terminating the arra increase effective after march 31 , 2014 . on december 13 , 2010 , the healthy , hunger - free kids act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-296 ) was enacted . this law , which reauthorizes , revamps , and expands child nutrition programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( the wic program ) , includes as a partial offset for its costs a provision further reducing arra - based snap benefits by some $2.5 billion . the child nutrition / wic legislation achieved its savings ( in section 442 ) by moving up the date on which the arra - generated snap benefit increase will terminate â€” to october 31 , 2013 . the reductions will be higher as household size increases . the president's fy2014 budget proposed to delay the sunset of the arra benefit increase to march 31 , 2014 . this is the date that the arra increase was first scheduled to sunset , before the enactment of the child nutrition reauthorization legislation ( p.l . 111-296 , see below ) . according to administration cost estimates , extending the arra benefit increase for an additional five months of fy2014 would cost approximately $2.26 billion . the 113 th congress is developing a reauthorization of snap as part of the next farm bill . neither the house nor the senate conference farm bill proposals contain any changes to the arra increase and its sunset .
