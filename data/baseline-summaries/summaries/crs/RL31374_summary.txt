figure 1 . growth in nominal personal health expendituressource: congressional research service ( crs ) calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services , office of the actuary . figure 1 depicts growth in nominal personal health expenditures . three factors contribute to growth in nominal health spending: higher population , higher prices , and higher real per capita expenditures , which some experts label the "intensity" of care . real per capita expenditures indicate qualitative and quantitative increases in the amount of care received by individuals . figure 2 depicts the role of population , prices , and real per capita expenditures in nominal health expenditure growth . caution should be used when interpreting data on real health expenditures , however . real expenditures are estimated using price indexes for medical care goods and services , but such price indexes are imperfect . as a result of these imperfections , it is difficult to isolate prices and real per capita health expenditures from nominal health spending . spending on personal health care in 2005 increased relative to the overall economy . in 2005 , personal health care expenditures accounted for 13.3% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , up from 13.2% of gdp in 2003 and 2004 , 12.8% of gdp in 2002 and 12.2% of gdp in 2001 . these increases mark a departure from the experience of the previous nine years , when health spending as a percent of gdp was relatively constant . this amount represents a 6.9% increase over 2004 spending . the majority of health spending ( 84% ) went towards paying for health care goods and services provided directly to individuals . in 2005 , home health care was the fastest growing category of health expenditures , increasing 11.1% above 2004 expenditures ( see table 1 ) . however , growth rates of individual categories of services can be deceptive at indicating how much a particular category of medical care contributed to overall spending growth . as indicated in table 1 , the category with the largest dollar increase was hospital care . in 2005 , spending on hospital care was $44.7 billion higher than in 2004 , an increase of 7.9% . home health care expenditures were $4.7 billion higher in 2005 than they were in 2004 , an increase of 11.1% . thus , even though home health care increased more than hospital care in terms of percentage growth , hospital care grew more than home health care in dollar terms . these services were funded mostly by the federal government and out - of - pocket expenditures . that is , growth in hospital care contributed most to increased personal health care expenditures in 2005 . the $44.7 billion increase in hospital expenditures in 2005 accounted for 41% of the $110.1 billion increase in overall personal health care spending . figure 4 shows how much dollar growth in each category of personal health care contributed to total growth in personal health expenditures . much attention has been directed at spending on prescription drugs . the share of personal health expenditures devoted to prescription drugs has more than doubled since 1981 , when drugs accounted for only 5.4% of personal health expenditures .
