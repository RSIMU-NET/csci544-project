fy2013 qprs were due in december 2013 . discretionary ccdbg funds are subject to the annual appropriations process . the 1996 amendments to the ccdbg act authorized funding through fy2002 at an annual authorization level of $1 billion . actual appropriations have typically surpassed the authorized level , most recently reaching roughly $2.358 billion for fy2014 ( see table 1 ) . in years since fy2002 , appropriations have been made without an authorization level . meanwhile , the 1996 welfare reform law provided pre - appropriated mandatory ccdf funding to states from fy1997 to fy2002 . the annual amounts of mandatory funding were $1.967 billion in fy1997 ; $2.067 billion in fy1998 ; $2.167 billion in fy1999 ; $2.367 in fy2000 ; $2.567 billion in fy2001 ; and $2.717 billion in fy2002 . because these funds were directly appropriated by the welfare reform law , the mandatory ccdf funding does not generally go through the annual appropriations process . mandatory ccdf funding was provided through fy2005 ( at the fy2002 rate of $2.717 billion annually ) via a series of extensions ; welfare reauthorization legislation was debated in each of these years , without reaching fruition . finally , on february 8 , 2006 , a budget reconciliation bill ( s. 1932 , the deficit reduction act ) , which included mandatory child care funding provisions , was passed into law ( p.l . the law pre - appropriated $2.917 billion annually for each of fy2006-fy2010 . since fy2010 , mandatory funds have again been provided through a series of extensions , as discussed throughout this section . the remainder of this section provides a detailed funding history for fy2013-fy2015 , a summary of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ) , and a brief overview of other notable ccdf funding issues from fy1997 forward . table 1 shows the amounts provided in discretionary and mandatory funding for each of fy1997-fy2014 . in addition to amounts provided to states specifically for ccdf , states may also transfer up to 30% of their tanf block grant allotment to the ccdf . transferred funds must be spent according to the ccdbg act rules . the net transfer from the fy2013 tanf allotment to the ccdf totaled nearly $1.4 billion ( representing roughly 8% of the fy2013 tanf allotment ) . nothing precludes a state from using tanf funds for child care services without formally transferring them to the ccdf , in which case the ccdbg act rules do not necessarily apply . hhs has reported that in fy2013 , states spent about $1.1 billion in federal tanf money on child care within the tanf program . ( in addition , states reported spending $2.5 billion in fy2013 on child care through state tanf and separate state program ( ssp ) moe funds. ) the secretary must coordinate child care activities within hhs , and , to the extent practicable , with similar activities in other federal agencies . the secretary is also required to publish a list of child care standards every three years , and to provide technical assistance to states . the secretary must monitor state compliance with the statute and state plans , and must establish procedures for receiving and assessing complaints against a state .
