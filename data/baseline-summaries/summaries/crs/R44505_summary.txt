appendix a . community health center fund aca section 10503 established a community health center fund ( chcf ) to provide supplemental funding for community and other health centers and the national health service corps ( nhsc ) . the law provided annual appropriations to the chcf totaling $11 billion over the five - year period fy2011 through fy2015 . of that total , $9.5 billion was for health center operations and the remaining $1.5 billion was for the nhsc . the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra ) appropriated two more years of funding to the chcf . for both fy2016 and fy2017 , macra provided $3.6 billion for health center operations and $310 million for the nhsc . chcf funding has partially supplanted discretionary funding for the health center program and entirely replaced discretionary funding for the nhsc ( see table 7 ) . table a - 1 shows the amounts appropriated to the chcf for each fiscal year as well as the post - sequestration levels for fy2013-fy2015 . as discussed earlier in this report , the fy2016 chcf funding was not subject to sequestration . chcf funds are awarded to the various types of health centers that are supported by the federal health center program . those include community health centers and migrant health centers , as well as facilities that serve the homeless and residents of public housing . sequestration of chcf funding for community health centers and migrant health centers is capped at 2% , whereas chcf funding for the other types of facilities ( i.e. , health centers for the homeless and for public housing residents ) and for the nhsc is fully sequestrable at the applicable rate for nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending ( see table 2 ) . appendix b . prevention and public health fund ( pphf ) aca section 4002 established the prevention and public health fund ( pphf ) , to be administered by the hhs secretary , and provided it with a permanent annual appropriation . under the aca as originally enacted , pphf's annual appropriation would increase from $500 million for fy2010 to $2 billion for fy2015 and each subsequent fiscal year . however , the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 amended the aca by reducing the pphf appropriation from fy2013 through fy2021 as part of a package of offsets to help cover the costs of the law . the pphf annual appropriation is now $1 billion through fy2017 , and thereafter will increase in increments to $2 billion for fy2022 and each subsequent fiscal year . the hhs secretary is instructed to transfer amounts from the pphf to agencies for prevention , wellness , and public health activities . the funds are available to the secretary at the beginning of each fiscal year . the administration's annual budget sets out the intended distribution and use of pphf funds for that fiscal year . the secretary determined the distribution of pphf funds for fy2010 through fy2013 . for fy2014 through fy2016 , provisions in appropriations acts explicitly directed the distribution of pphf funds , prohibiting the secretary from making further transfers .
