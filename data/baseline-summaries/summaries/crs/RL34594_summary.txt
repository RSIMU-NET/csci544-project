this includes the program crop commodities , dairy , and sugar . the average over the period was $11.1 billion per year . from 1981-1990 , the average annual outlay was $11.4 billion ; from 1991-2002 , the average was $10.6 billion , and from 2003 to 2007 ( roughly the years of the 2002 farm bill ) , the average was $11.7 billion . the cbo forecast for the 2008-2017 period is about $7.4 billion annually , well below the historical averages due to the record high commodity prices at the time that the 2008 farm bill was enacted . compared to the baseline of continuing the provisions of the 2002 farm bill , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) cost estimate ( score ) of the new provisions in title i of the farm bill is a five - year savings of $1.726 billion and a 10-year savings of $1.658 billion . an important consideration for the farm commodity programs is how they are classified for trade purposes . as a member of the world trade organization ( wto ) , the united states made agricultural policy commitments under the wto's agreement on agriculture . all wto members agree to submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the wto , and these outlays are subject to specific limits . for the united states , its total spending limit for programs that are considered to be trade distorting is $19.1 billion per year . other types of payments are not subject to limits if they are "decoupled" or not considered to be trade distorting . because spending on the farm commodity programs is a combination of fixed decoupled payments and market - driven counter - cyclical payments , outlays may be highly variable from year to year . figure 2 shows that , from 1981 to 2007 , commodity program outlays ( including dairy and sugar , but excluding disaster payments ) have ranged from a low of $3.3 billion in 1981 to a high of $27 billion in 2000 . it also discusses the important policy developments in the new law compared to prior law . for more details on the legislative history of the farm bill and a side - by - side summary of its provisions and changes , see crs report rl34696 , the 2008 farm bill: major provisions and legislative action , by [author name scrubbed] et al . the farm commodity price and income support provisions in the 2008 farm bill include three primary types of payments: direct payments unrelated to production or prices ; counter - cyclical payments which are triggered when ( a ) prices are below statutorily - determined target prices , or ( b ) revenue for a commodity falls below a historical guaranteed level , and marketing assistance loans that offer interim financing and , if prices fall below loan prices set in statute , additional income support , sometimes paid as loan deficiency payments ( ldp ) . the first two types of payments are subject to payment limits on the size of payments . all three types of payments may be subject to income eligibility limits , depending on the size of farm and non - farm income .
