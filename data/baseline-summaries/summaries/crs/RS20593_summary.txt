the 2010 data are provided as an appendix to this report . these data are from estates from decedents who died before 2010 and those estates that chose to file using the pre - egtrra law . data from returns filed in 2009 include the returns of many decedents who died in 2008 . the biggest difference between 2008 and 2009 is the exemption amount , which was $2 million in 2008 and rose to $3.5 million in 2009 . for 2011 and 2012 , the exemption amount is $5 million ( $10 million for married decedents ) . on december 17 , 2010 , the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-312 ) reinstated the estate tax beginning with 2010 decedents and sunsets after 2012 . executors of estates of decedents who died in 2010 , however , may also choose to file under the egtrra laws in place before passage of p.l . the new law sets the estate tax exemption level at $5 million per decedent in 2010 ( indexed for inflation ) and establishes a top marginal tax rate of 35% . any unused exemption amount is transferrable to a surviving spouse , yielding an effective exemption amount of $10 million for married decedents . the joint committee on taxation estimates the temporary estate tax modifications to reduce revenue by approximately $136.7 billion over 10 years . the number of decedents that will be affected by the estate tax will rise significantly in 2013 , as the law will return to the pre - egtrra parameters . the estate and gift tax minimum filing requirement is $5,120,000 for deaths occurring in 2012 . generally , estates valued below the threshold are not required to file a return . estates valued over the threshold amount calculate their tax liability based upon the entire ( or gross ) value of the estate inclusive of the $5,120,000 . deductions from the gross estate value , such as bequests to a surviving spouse ( the marital deduction ) , state estate and inheritance taxes , and donations to charitable organizations , are then subtracted from the gross estate value . the tentative tax liability is determined by the progressive rate schedule provided for in the tax code . the next step in the calculation of estate tax liability , and perhaps the most important , is the applicable credit . the applicable credit is set such that an estate has the equivalent of a $5,120,000 exemption ( for deaths occurring in 2012 the amount is $1,772,800 , see table 1 below ) . in many cases , the marital deduction combined with the deduction for charitable contributions can eliminate all estate tax liability . before 2005 , estates were allowed to claim a credit for state death taxes paid . egtrra , however , gradually repealed the credit for state death taxes , eliminating it in 2005 and replacing it with a deduction for taxes paid . many states have relied on the federal credit for their estate tax and will need to modify their tax laws to continue collecting their estate and inheritance taxes .
