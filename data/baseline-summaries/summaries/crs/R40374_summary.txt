not all types are available in all locations . prior to the passage of mma , enrollment in private plans fluctuated . since the passage of the mma , overall enrollment in private plans has been steadily increasing . in 2009 , approximately 10.4 million , or 23% , of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a ma plan , and all medicare beneficiaries have access to at least one private plan . despite these successes , reforming the payment methodology for private plans remains a key issue among policymakers . according to the medicare payment advisory commission ( medpac ) , medicare is expected to pay private plans an average of 14% more per beneficiary in 2009 than it does for beneficiaries enrolled in the original medicare program . a comparable analysis for 2008 showed that medicare was expected to pay private plans an average of 13% more per beneficiary in 2008 than it did for beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare . based on the 2008 analysis , the greater expected payments to plans relative to spending in original medicare varies by plan type ; payments to hmos are approximately 112% of original medicare , while payments to pffs plans are 117% of original medicare . since ma payments are based , in part , on historical payment rates , this 13% difference is linked to the 1997 bba legislation , which created payment floors to attract private plans to certain counties , particularly rural counties . these floors , which exceeded ffs spending levels in many areas , continue to be used in the calculation of ma payment rates today . ma plans use these payments to provide extra benefits to enrollees , but the value of these benefits vary across plan types and across counties . from 1987 to the early 1990s , many risk plans terminated existing contracts , decreasing the number of available contracts from 161 in 1987 to 93 in 1991 . the number of medicare risk plans began increasing again in 1992 , more than tripling from 110 in 1993 to 346 in 1998 . with the implementation of the m+c program in 1999 , m+c organizations withdrew from the medicare program or reduced the size of their service area . as shown in figure 1 , the number of contracts dropped from a high of 346 in 1998 to a low of 146 in march 2003 . with the passage of the mma in 2003 , the trend began to reverse . the number of ma contracts more than doubled between 2005 and 2006 . this increase coincides with the start of the part d prescription drug program and may reflect an overall increased interest in private plan participation in medicare at that time . there were 600 ma coordinated care and pffs contracts in 2008 , increasing to 623 in 2009 . organizations withdrawing from the program or reducing their service area between 1998 and 2004 cited several reasons for leaving the program: inadequate payments , increasing regulatory burden , and difficulty developing or maintaining provider networks . the withdrawals may have reflected strategic business decisions that transcended payment issues . other factors may have contributed to withdrawals , such as low enrollment and market competition .
