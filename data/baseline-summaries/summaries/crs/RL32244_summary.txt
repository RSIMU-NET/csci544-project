some of the regulations have been enjoined . the agency also considered related policy changes , but it appears that policy changes are no longer being considered . the previous revision of grazing regulations culminated in comprehensive changes effective august 21 , 1995 . the 1995 changes were the result of a several - year process of evaluating ideas and shaping alternatives , and occurred in the midst of a decades - long dispute over the ownership , management , and use of federal rangelands . the 1995 changes were highly controversial , with criticism from many ranching interests that those new rules weakened grazing privileges and would reduce livestock grazing on federal lands , and from environmental organizations that the changes did not go far enough in protecting public lands . part 4100 ) . supporters saw the changes as improving resource and range management and broadening participation in public land decisionmaking . congress considered many of the 1995 changes as part of legislative proposals or committee oversight . congress also has examined the development of the 2006 regulatory changes and related policy options through committee oversight . among the changes made in 1995 , many of which were reexamined by blm during the development of the 2006 regulatory changes , are those that: separated grazing preference from permitted use , so that a permittee's preference for receiving a grazing permit was not tied to a specific amount of grazing based on historic levels ( described as animal unit months , or aums ) ; allowed permittees up to three years of nonuse of their permits ; authorized suspending or canceling a permit if a permittee is convicted of violating certain state or federal environmental laws ; eliminated the express requirement that a permittee be engaged in the livestock business ; replaced the term affected interest with interested public ; allowed conservation use for the term of a grazing permit , thereby excluding livestock grazing from all or a portion of an allotment ; required title of permanent structural improvements to be held in the name of the united states ; required that water rights for livestock grazing be held in the name of the united states , to the extent allowed by state law ; imposed a surcharge on a permittee who allows livestock not owned by the permittee or the permittee's children to graze on public land ; eliminated grazing advisory boards and replaced them with the broader interest resource advisory councils ; and adopted rangeland management standards called fundamentals of rangeland health . in issuing these changes , the secretary of the interior dropped the most contentious proposal — to increase the grazing fee — due to the rancor this issue generated . however , dissatisfaction with the 1995 changes among ranching interests led to a lawsuit ultimately decided by the u.s. supreme court . the regulations , challenged on their face , were upheld by the courts as not exceeding the authority of the secretary , with one exception . the court struck down the rule pertaining to conservation use for the term of a permit on the grounds that a grazing permit was for grazing and the secretary could more appropriately accomplish conservation use through the land use planning process .
