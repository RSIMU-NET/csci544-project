nonetheless , there are many parallels . crs report rl33872 , arctic national wildlife refuge ( anwr ) : new directions in the 110 th congress , by [author name scrubbed] , [author name scrubbed] , and [author name scrubbed] . many of these issues have been of interest to congress and the nation for decades . the bureau of land management ( blm ) in the department of the interior ( doi ) and the forest service ( fs ) in the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) manage 449 million acres of land , more than two - thirds of the land owned by the federal government and one - fifth of the total u.s. land area . the blm manages 255.8 million acres of land , predominantly in the west . the fs administers 192.8 million acres of federal land , also concentrated in the west . the blm and fs have similar management responsibilities for their lands , and many key issues affect both agencies' lands . thus , merging the two agencies often is proposed . by law , blm and fs lands are to be administered for multiple uses , although slightly different uses are specified for each agency . in practice , the land uses considered by the agencies include recreation , range , timber , minerals , watershed , wildlife and fish , and conservation . blm and fs lands also are required to be managed for sustained yield — a high level of resource outputs in perpetuity — without impairing the productivity of the lands . however , each agency also has unique emphases and functions . for instance , most rangelands are managed by the blm , and the blm administers mineral development on all federal lands . most federal forests are managed by the fs , and only the fs has a cooperative program to assist nonfederal forest landowners . moreover , development of the two agencies has differed , and historically they have focused on different issues . crs report rl34273 , federal land ownership: current acquisition and disposal authorities , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl30755 , forest fire / wildfire protection , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl32244 , grazing regulations: changes by the bureau of land management , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl34461 , interior , environment , and related agencies: fy2009 appropriations , by [author name scrubbed] et al . crs report rs21967 , land exchanges: bureau of land management process and issues , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl33014 , leasing and permitting for oil and gas development on federal public domain lands , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl33908 , mining on federal lands: hardrock minerals , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl30647 , national forest system roadless area initiatives , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rl33806 , natural resources policy: management , institutions , and issues , by [author name scrubbed] , [author name scrubbed] , and [author name scrubbed] . crs report rs22928 , oil development on federal lands and the outer continental shelf , by [author name scrubbed] .
