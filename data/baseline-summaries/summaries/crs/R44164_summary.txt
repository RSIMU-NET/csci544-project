the effort factor is the same for all leas in a given state . the equity factor for each state is determined based on variations in appe among the leas in the state . all four formulas have state minimum grant provisions . minimum grant amounts for each formula are calculated in part or wholly based on a percentage of the level of appropriations provided to each formula . this percentage is higher under the targeted grant and efig formulas than it is under the basic and concentration grant formulas . the efig formula includes two factors used to determine state level grants that are not included in any of the other three formulas â€” the effort factor and the equity factor . table 1 provides a summary of these components or "factors. under title i - a , funds are allocated to leas via state educational agencies ( seas ) using four different allocation formulas specified in statute: basic grants , concentration grants , targeted grants , and education finance incentive grants ( efig ) . annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year's title i - a appropriation to be allocated to leas and states under each of these formulas . in fy2016 , about 43% of title i - a appropriations will be allocated through the basic grants formula , 9% through the concentration grants formula , and 24% through each of the targeted grants and efig formulas . once funds reach leas , the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly . for each formula , a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a "formula child count," consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school - age children in poor families , by an "expenditure factor" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public k - 12 education . in some formulas , additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor . these maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula , taking into account a variety of state and lea minimum grant and "hold harmless" provisions . for efig , the minimum and maximum thresholds for state appe relative to national appe are 85% and 115% , respectively . under both percentage weighting and number weighting , a weighted formula child count is produced and the higher of the two weighted counts is used to determine lea grant amounts . in general , leas must have a minimum number of formula children and / or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific title i - a formula . some leas may qualify for a grant under only one formula , while other leas may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas . as discussed previously , under title i - a funds are allocated to leas via seas under four different formulas . under the basic , concentration , and targeted grant formulas , funds are initially calculated at the lea level , and state total grants are the total of allocations for leas in the state , adjusted to apply state minimum grant provisions .
