what are members tweeting about ? the use of twitter by members of congress is an evolving phenomenon . as members continue to embrace new technologies , their use of twitter and other forms of social media may increase . these mediums allow members to communicate directly with constituents ( and others ) in a potentially interactive way that is not possible through mail or e - mail . for members and their staff , the ability to collect and transmit real time information from constituents could be influential for policy or voting decisions . however , electronic communications have raised some concerns . existing law and chamber regulations on the use of communication media such as the united states postal service have proven difficult to adapt to the new electronic technologies . in addition , electronic media could provide members with the ability to easily communicate information traditionally sent to the district ( or state ) with non - constituents or non - u.s. residents . this report examines member use of one specific new electronic communication medium: twitter . after providing an overview and background of twitter , the report analyzes patterns of member use of twitter during two one - week periods in july and august 2009 . the rise of such electronic communication has altered the traditional patterns of communication between members and constituents . although virtually all members continue to use traditional modes of constituent communication , use of new communications technology is increasing . for example , prior to 1995 , there was virtually no e - mail traffic between members and constituents . in 2008 , almost 200 million e - mails were sent to the house of representatives , and a similar number were sent from house computers . member official websites , blogs , youtube channels , and facebook pages — all non - existent several years ago — also receive significant traffic . conversely , the amount of postal mail sent to congress has dropped by more than 50% during the same time period . in addition , electronic technology has reduced the marginal cost of constituent communications ; unlike postal letters , members can reach large numbers of constituents for a fixed cost . member use of electronic communications has raised several concerns . some of these concerns are similar to those associated with traditional modes of constituent communications , such as the potential electoral advantage that the franking privilege may confer on incumbent members . other issues , such as the use of third - party communication software platforms , are unique to the new electronic mediums . in addition , existing law and chamber regulations on the use of communication media , such as the united states postal service , have proven difficult to apply directly to the new electronic technologies . created in 2006 by developer jack dorsey as a tool to keep in touch with friends , twitter is a web - based social networking service that allows users to send and read short messages . also considered a micro - blogging site , twitter users send "tweets" of up to 140 characters . these tweets are displayed on an author's twitter home page and on the pages of people subscribed to his or her rss feed .
