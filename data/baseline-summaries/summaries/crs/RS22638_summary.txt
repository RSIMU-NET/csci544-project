although h.r . 1746 would have no direct effect on the bad arolsen archives , some assert that improved access to the archives may reveal documentation relating to unpaid holocaust - era insurance policies . on the other hand , while the evidence is by no means conclusive , its officials and some historians indicate it is unlikely that the archives contain definitive evidence of such policies . beginning in the late 1990s , the u.s . icrc officials acknowledge that this represented an unacceptable breach of the organization's mission . holocaust memorial museum ( holocaust museum ) , holocaust survivor organizations , and others began to pressure international commission members to open the its archives to historical research . according to the state department , the united states and several other commission member states advocated opening the archives as early as 1998 . however , then - its director biedermann and a number of member states reportedly blocked passage of the proposal , arguing that the release of such sensitive personal information represented a violation of individual privacy rights . in may 2006 , after more than five years of debate , and in response to increasing public and political pressure , the international commission of the its unanimously agreed to amend the 1955 bonn accords to open the its archives to researchers and make digital copies of archived materials available to designated institutions in commission member states . to address continuing concerns regarding individual privacy rights , the commission agreed that access to digital files would be guided by the respective privacy laws of those states . in november 2007 , france and greece became the final two commission member states to ratify the may 2006 agreement to open the archives , paving the way both for the digitization and transfer of archived materials , and for historians and members of the public to visit the archives . experts estimate that roughly one quarter of the materials relate to jews persecuted by the regime . after the 1954 repeal of the occupation statute in germany , an international commission of nine member states ( belgium , the federal republic of germany , france , israel , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , the united kingdom , and the united states ) charged the its with continuing its mission as a missing persons tracing service and caretaker of the archives in bad arolsen under the neutral auspices of the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) . in the so - called bonn accords of 1955 , the international commission established the oversight and administrative structure under which its continues to function today: a swiss delegate of the icrc , accountable both to the icrc and the eleven - member international commission , oversees its's day - to - day operations and reports to the commission at its annual meetings ; germany has provided and continues to provide its's operating budget . after the may 2006 agreement to open the archives , both the house and senate passed resolutions urging international commission member states to expedite approval of the agreement . its officials traditionally administered the service based on an understanding that its was established to act primarily as a tracing service for victims of nazi war crimes .
