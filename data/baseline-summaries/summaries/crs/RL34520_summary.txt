, pure tradeable permits ) . s. 2191 leans toward the quantity ( total emissions ) side of the equation ; s. 1766 leans toward the price side of the equation . these have generally followed one of three tracks . the first model is adage: a computable general equilibrium ( cge ) model developed by rti international . the s. 1766 and s. 2191 cases employing the reference basecase are designated epa / adage - ref in this report , while the cases employing the high technology basecase are designated epa / adage - tech . the second model is igem: a cge model developed by dale jorgenson associates . the cases employing the reference basecase are designated epa / igem - ref in this report , while the cases employing the high technology basecase are designated epa / igem - tech . the third model is ipm: a dynamic , deterministic linear programming model of the u.s. electric power sector developed by icf resources . the cases employing the ipm model are designated epa / ipm in this report . a second analysis has been conducted by the energy information administration ( eia ) . the report is entitled energy market and economic impacts of s. 2191 , the lieberman - warner climate security act of 2007 ( april 2008 ) and included an updated analysis of s. 1766 . the analysis employs eia's nems model: a macroeconomic forecasting model with extensive energy technology detail . in addition to conducting a "core" analysis of s. 2191 using its preliminary 2008 annual energy outlook ( aeo ) baseline , eia also conducts some useful sensitivity analysis that focuses on the upside risk of increased energy prices under s. 2191 . however , eia did not update the sensitivity analysis it had previously conducted on s. 1766 . the core s. 2191 analysis and the updated s. 1766 analysis are designated eia / nems in this report . s. 1766 and s. 2191 represent different answers to the choice between controlling the price and the quantity of emissions under a market - based control strategy . two studies have been completed that compare s. 1766 and s. 2191 under the same baseline conditions . the most comprehensive analysis has been conducted by the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) . the reports are entitled epa analysis of the low carbon economy act of 2007: s. 1766 in the 110 th congress ( january 15 , 2008 ) , and epa analysis of the lieberman - warner climate security act of 2008: s. 2191 in 110 th congress ( march 14 , 2008 ) . the analyses employ a suite of models and basecases , along with some useful sensitivity analysis . this report will focus on three of the models and two basecases . in general , market - based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level ( quantity ) or compliance costs ( price ) , allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable .
