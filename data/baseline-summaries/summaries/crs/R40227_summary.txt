these cases were resolved on average in 21 days . this data , however , can be somewhat misleading . much of the impact a protest can have on a program's schedule occurs outside of the period between when a protest is filed and the case is closed by gao . agency actions to address the complaint in a protest — either through voluntary action or because a protest was sustained — can delay contract awards for weeks or months , costing millions of dollars and delaying delivery of goods and services . the next - generation jammer technology development contract was reportedly delayed by six months when gao sustained a protest and recommended that the navy re - evaluate proposals . the number of bid protest cases against dod has increased from approximately 600 in fy2001 to 1,200 in fy2014 , an increase of 100% ( see figure 9 ) . most protests against dod were dismissed , withdrawn by the protester , or resolved prior to gao issuing an opinion . gao issued an opinion on 23% of protests . in cases where gao issued an opinion , protests were sustained 11% of the time . from fy2001 to fy2014 , on average 4% of protests filed against dod were sustained by gao ( see table a - 1 for protests filed and sustained , by service ) . just as the number of protests filed against dod has increased , the number — and value — of contract actions signed by dod has also increased ( see figure 10 ) . according to the federal procurement data system , between fy2001 and fy2014 , after adjusting for inflation , the value of total dod contract obligations increased 45% compared to an increase of 100% in the number of protests filed in the same period . in recent years , the percentage of protests sustained against dod has decreased ( see figure 11 ) . from fy2001-fy2008 , gao sustained on average more than 5% of all protests filed ; from fy2009-fy2014 , gao sustained approximately 2% of all protests filed . dod procurements are less likely to be protested than those of the rest of government . from fy2008 to fy2014 , on average , dod accounted for almost 70% of total government contract obligations but about55% of total protests against the federal government ( see figure 12 ) . protests against dod are also sustained at a lower rate than the rest of government . from fy2008-fy2014 , 2.5% of all protests against dod were sustained by gao , compared to over 5.0% of all protests against federal civilian agencies . protests against civilian agencies are also growing at a faster rate than protests against dod . from fy2001-fy2014 , the number of dod procurements that were protested increased 170% ( from 421 to 1,138 ) compared to an increase of 260% ( from 279-997 ) for civilian agencies ( see table 1 ) . a dismissal or denial allows the agency to proceed with the challenged procurement . a sustained decision , in contrast , generally disrupts the procurement because gao will issue recommendations to the agency about the challenged procurement — such as re - competing the contract or amending the existing solicitation .
