table 1 . excise tax rates on tires under the surfacetransportation assistance act of 1982 source: h.rept . 97-987 , pp . included in the tax reform act of 1984 ( 17 ) were minorrefund provisions for tire stock and tread rubber floor stock . these provisionsadjusted for taxes previously paid on dealer stock that had not yet been sold . from1982 through the end of 2004 , excise tax rates were not changed but various tax actswhich have extended the interstate highway system have also extended the tire excisetaxes . an indirect change occurred to the federal tire excise tax under the taxpayerrelief act of 1997 . the modification made by the act was in response to disputesoccurring during tax audits . there were no rate changes in 1943 . however , therevenue act of 1943 ( 8 ) redefined rubber to include synthetic and substitute rubber and later the rates were codified in theinternal revenue code of 1954 . ( 9 ) the federal - aid highway act of 1956 ( 10 ) provided for a significant expansion of the federal - aid highwayprogram and authorized federal funding over a longer period of time so as to permit long - rangeplanning . it was considered necessary to authorize the entire interstate highway program to assureorderly planning and completion of this network of highways throughout the united states asefficiently and as economically as possible . in the case of tire taxes , the act raised certain rates andexpanded the rate structure by prescribing different rates for different tire types . tires for highwayvehicles were taxed at 8 cents per pound , other tires at 5 cents per pound , inner tubes at 9 cents perpound , and tread rubber at 3 cents per pound . from that time forward , proceeds from tire excisetaxes have been transferred to the highway trust fund established by that act . the act provided fora rate reduction in 1972 , which was rescheduled because the interstate highway system was stillunder construction . in 1960 , an act called excise tax: laminated tires ( 11 ) provided a lower tax rateof 1 cent per pound for laminated tires which "consist wholly of scrap rubber" and "not of the typeused on highway vehicles. congress recognized that the very heavy weight of laminated tiresdisadvantaged this new small industry since the tax represented nearly 20% of the retail cost of thetire . the excise tax rates on tires were once again changed in 1961 . ( 12 ) this time the federal - aidhighway act of 1961 ( 13 ) provided excise tax rate increases to 10 cents per pound for highway vehicle tires ( up 2 cents perpound ) ; 10 cents per pound for inner tubes ( up 1 cent per pound ) ; and 5 cents per pound of treadrubber ( up 2 cents per pound ) . rates of 5 cents per pound for other than laminated and 1 cent forlaminated tires were left intact without change . again , rate reductions were scheduled for 1972 . three subsequent public laws ( p.l . 95-599 ) ( 14 ) postponed the scheduledrate reductions first from 1972 to 1977 , then from 1977 to 1979 , and finally from 1979 to 1984 .
