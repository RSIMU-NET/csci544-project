appendix a . estimates of u.s . large scale injection and geologic sequestration of co 2 projects in the united states appendix c. comparison of class ii and class vi well . storage capacity forâ co 2 appendix b . the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact , p.l . all of the projects operate through collaborations among doe , industry , and local research institutions . five other projects that injected co 2 were implemented through the rcsp program . the projects included sequestration into various underground formations and storage associated with eor with volumes of co 2 injected and stored ranging from a few hundred tons to over 1 million tons ( considered commercial - scale ) . the rcsp program is currently in the development phase , which doe defines as large - scale field testing of high volumes of co 2 storage . these projects have completed injection and are now in the post - injection monitoring phase . all of the existing rcsp projects are scheduled to end by july 2022 , but doe is in the process of selecting additional projects for the program . in the united states , while numerous large - scale storage r&d projects are ongoing , none of the projects injecting co 2 solely for geologic sequestration are operating in a commercial capacity . worldwide , public - private partnerships have implemented several co 2 geologic sequestration projects in diverse regions . there are two active projects , both in norway , where facilities at the sleipner gas field in the north sea and snohvit in the barents sea conduct offshore sequestration under the norwegian continental shelf . chevron's gorgon injection project , a natural gas production facility in australia , plans to begin sequestering co 2 in 2020 and store a total of 100 million tons of co 2 . canada , japan and algeria have carried out smaller - scale ccs projects with sequestration in saline reservoirs . this section provides an overview of the federal framework for regulating underground injection of co 2 for both geologic sequestration and eor . for several decades the federal government has funded efforts to explore the feasibility of mitigating the release of greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) while burning fossil fuels as a source of energy . carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) âthe process of capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) at its source , such as a coal - fired power plant , and storing it underground instead of releasing into the atmosphereâhas been proposed as a technological solution for mitigating emissions while using fossil energy . federal policies on ccs have received support in recent congresses , including support for research and development ( r&d ) and expansion of tax credits for carbon storage . the u.s. fourth national climate assessment , released in 2018 , states that "the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the united states and are projected to intensify in the futureâbut the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. this report focuses on federal policy regarding the underground carbon storage stage of ccs .
