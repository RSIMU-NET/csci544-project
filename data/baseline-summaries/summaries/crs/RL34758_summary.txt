this report does not offer an exhaustive overview of these authorities . rather , this section discusses some of the major authorities establishing the nrf , legislation that shaped the development of the nrf , and legislation tied to congressional oversight . in response to directives from congress and the president , the bush administration issued the nrf to establish a new approach to coordinate federal and nonfederal entities in times of emergencies and major disasters . the nrf does appear to respond to some of the challenges identified by congress and others . the document is more concise , has less jargon , and has made an attempt to clarify roles and responsibilities . with the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-296 ) and sections 15 and 16 of the homeland security presidential directive 5 ( hereafter hspd - 5 ) , congress and president bush directed dhs to consolidate these plans and create a single , overarching , integrated , and coordinated national response plan , and to develop a national incident management system ( nims ) . these efforts culminated in the initial national response plan ( nrp ) on october 10 , 2003 , followed by the release of nims on march 1 , 2004 . in august 2005 , hurricane katrina made landfall , followed shortly by hurricanes rita and wilma . a number of studies on the responses to these hurricanes found shortcomings in the nrp itself and its implementation . dhs made the decision to revise the nrp partially based on these reports . the revision of the nrp was also due to mandates in the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( p.l . 109-295 , hereafter the post - katrina act ) . in january 2008 , dhs issued the nrf , which took effect in march 2008 . since that time , the nrf has been the nation's core response document , providing a structure for the response to such disasters as the 2008 midwest floods and california wildfires , as well as hurricanes gustav and ike . this report reviews selected statutory provisions related to the nrf and provides an overview of the document . it discusses some of the reasons the bush administration revised the nrp , as well as some controversial aspects of the review process . the report also summarizes selected pending legislation concerning national response planning and concludes with a discussion of issues over which congress might consider exercising oversight . authority for the creation of the nrf emanates from numerous sources . fema has described the nrf as being guided by 15 "principal emergency authorities," 48 other statutory authorities and regulations , 17 executive orders , and 20 presidential directives . additionally , anecdotal reports following gustav and ike indicate the coordination of emergency activities among federal , state , and local governments has improved . on the other hand , parts of the nrf may have retained some of the problems associated with the nrp . the nrf still contains the pfo arrangement , terrorism and natural disasters are not given equal treatment , and nonfederal stakeholder input appears to be lacking .
