many types of asset management companies exist . further , the different types of asset management companies are subject to different regulatory requirements . this section highlights major types of asset management companies , including public funds , private funds , and other forms of asset management . the asset management industry operates in a complex system with many components , including different types of funds and various intermediaries . this section explains the operation of a typical public fund as well as other prominent actors supporting the fund and the efficient operations of the industry . the asset management industry's legislative history is relatively long and complex . the current regulatory regime governing the asset management industry was not a comprehensive design from inception , but rather developed through many iterations of adjustments and expansions . therefore , the asset management industry is overseen by a somewhat fragmented regulatory regime with areas of disconnect between business practices and the legal definitions describing them . congress created the sec during the great depression to restore public confidence in the u.s. capital markets . early policymaking in the 1930s focused on full disclosure , with the specific intention that publicly traded companies tell the whole truth about any material issues pertaining to their securities and the risks associated with investing in them . however , congress realized that the disclosure - based approach alone was not enough to deter fraudulent and abusive activities in the asset management industry , which flourished in the 1920s and 1930s . congress thus directed the sec to conduct a 1â½ - year study of the issue in the public utility holding company act of 1935 . the sec took four years , resulting in a four - part study with six additional supplemental reports . based on the sec research and subsequent hearings , in 1940 , congress introduced two new laws to govern the asset management industryâthe investment company act of 1940 and the investment advisers act of 1940 . these statutes and regulations required those who manage and distribute funds to treat investors fairly and honestly . the textbox below describes the individual laws , which generally apply to the asset management industry as follows: asset management companies must comply with the investment company act of 1940 or gain exemption from its requirements . funds' portfolio managers or investment advisers generally must register with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 . crs report r45308 , jobs and investor confidence act ( house - amended s. 488 ) : capital markets provisions , coordinated by eva su . crs report r43413 , costs of government interventions in response to the financial crisis: a retrospective , by baird webel and marc labonte . the funds themselves are securities , and thus subject to federal securities regulation in relation to securities offering and trading , including the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 . crs in focus if11062 , introduction to financial services: capital markets , by eva su . crs in focus if11278 , accredited investor definition and private securities markets , by eva su . crs in focus if10747 , private securities offerings: background and legislation , by eva su .
