however , h.r . liquidity: h.r . 2309 would provide more immediate liquidity to the usps than s. 1789 , as s. 1789 would require the usps to use some of the fers refund for buyouts . long - term revenues: s. 1789 advances two proposals to incrementally improve the usps's long - term revenues while h.r . 2309 provides one . long - term costs: h.r . 2309 would attempt to achieve major cost reductions by authorizing the usps to cut 12 delivery days , mandating postal facility closures to save $3 billion annually , and enacting changes to curb employee compensation growth . 109-435 ; 120 stat . 3198 ) on december 20 , 2006 . the paea was the first broad revision of the 1970 statute that replaced the u.s. post office , a federal agency dependent upon appropriations , with the u.s . postal service ( usps ) , a self - supporting , independent agency of the executive branch . the usps is expected to operate like a business , but it must do so within various statutory confines and serve various public purposes . the 112 th congress is considering additional major postal reforms , including reductions in service , expansion of the usps's authority to provide products and services , and alterations to the postal employees pension and healthcare plans . the proximate cause for the recent efforts at postal reform is the usps's troubled financial condition . after running modest profits from fy2004 through fy2006 , the usps lost $25.4 billion between fy2007 and fy2011 . were it not for congressional action to reduce a statutorily required payment to the usps's retirees health benefits fund ( rhbf ) , the usps would have lost an additional $9.5 billion . the current year has brought further losses . in the first half of fy2012 , the usps had an operating loss of $6.4 billion , which included a $6.1 billion charge for payments due to the rhbf in fy2012 . as the usps's finances have deteriorated , its ability to absorb operating losses has been diminished . since fy2005 , the usps's debt has risen to $13 billion from $0 , $2 billion below its maximum statutory borrowing authority ( 39 u.s.c . ( see figure 1 . ) this is the result of mail volume falling 20.9% , to 167.9 billion pieces ( fy2011 ) from 212.2 billion pieces ( fy2007 ) . concurrently , the usps's operating expenses have declined but nonetheless exceed the agency's revenues . ( see figure 2 . ) these deficits are particularly problematic because congress designed the usps to be self - supporting ( p.l . 91-375 ; 84 stat . most federal agencies rely on annual appropriations ; since 1971 , the usps has largely covered its expenses through the sales of postal services . the usps , an "independent agency of the executive branch," does go through the appropriations process each year . however , the approximately $100 million it receives in annual appropriations is only to reimburse the usps for the costs it bears to provide free mailing privileges to blind persons and overseas voters . to help stem its losses , the usps has taken a number of steps .
