both the share of elderly households with any debt and the median and average levels of debt have increased . household debt includes mortgages , auto loans , student loans , and credit cards , as well as other debt products . although household debt rose over the past three decades for elderly households overall and on average , the oldest americans experienced the largest increase in debt . rising debt among certain elderly households , however , has shown signs of an increase in debt burden . for example , the debt - to - asset ratio among households headed by individuals aged 80 and older increased by 5 percentage points between 1989 and 2016 , and the ratio among elderly households with middle asset levels increased by more than 10 percentage points during the same time . therefore , in addition to retirement income and saving adequacy , debt management may also be an important determinant of retirement security . rising debt might be more problematic for persons aged 80 and older because they might be more vulnerable to income risks , as they are more likely to have lower or no earnings ( as they phase out of the labor force ) , exhaust existing retirement resources , have reduced purchasing power in certain defined benefit pensions , and incur higher medical expenses . in addition , older americans now hold historically high levels of housing debt , which might make them more vulnerable to housing market swings than previous cohorts of retirees . the scf data show that americans' debt experiences have generally conformed to life - cycle theories' predictions . during 1989 to 2016 , the share of households who held any debt and the median and average level of household debts were highest among those headed by americans aged 35 to 54 and lower among younger and older ages . in the past three decades , debt among households headed by individuals aged 65 and older grew faster than that among households headed by those aged 64 and younger . in 2016 , average household debt increased from $59,134 in 1989 to $110,204 ( in 2016 dollars ) for households whose head was between the ages of 20 and 64 , an increase of 86% , whereas the average household debt grew from $11,278 to $53,269 ( in 2016 dollars ) for households headed by those aged 65 and older , an increase of 3 72% . the average household debt nearly doubled for households in age groups younger than age 60 , but it increased by about 4 times for the age groups 60-64 , 65-69 , and 70-74 ; by about 7 times for the age group 75-79 ; and by more than 10 times for the age group 80 and older ( see figure 1 ) . from 1989 to 2016 , debt increased among households whose head was aged 65 and older . first , americans aged 65 and older represent a large and growing proportion of the u.s. population . over the next 20 years , the share of the u.s. population aged 65 and older is expected to increase from about 17% to 22% .
