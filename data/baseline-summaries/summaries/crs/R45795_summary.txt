invasion . although apparently far from current consideration because of the potential risks and costs , a u.s. invasion of iran to oust its regime is among the options . press reports in may 2019 indicated that the administration was considering adding more than 100,000 military forces to the gulf to deter iran from any attacks . such an option , if exercised , might be interpreted as potentially enhancing the u.s. ability to conduct ground attacks inside iran , although military experts have indicated that a u.s. invasion and / or occupation of iran would require many more u.s. forces than those cited . iran's population is about 80 million , and its armed forces collectively number about 525,000 , including 350,000 regular military and 125,000 irgc forces . there has been significant antigovernment unrest in iran over the past 10 years , but there is no indication that there is substantial support inside iran for a u.s. invasion to change iran's regime . members of congress have responded in different ways to tensions with iran and to related questions of authorization for the use of military force . various instances of increased u.s. - iran tensions in the past year have prompted some members to express concern about or support for potential military operations against iran . these episodes include the june 2019 attacks against tankers in the gulf of oman and iran's shoot down of a u.s. military drone ; the september 2019 attacks on saudi oil facilities at abqaiq and khurais ; and the buildup of u.s. forces in the region in response to iranian activities . throughout this period , congress passed legislation with provisions specifying that authorization for the use of force against iran is not granted . for instance , section 1284 of the fy2020 ndaa ( p.l . 116-92 , december 2019 ) states that "nothing in this act , or any amendment made by this act , may be construed to authorize the use of military force , including the use of military force against iran or any other country. similarly , section 9024 of division a of h.r . 1158 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2020 , ( p.l . 116-89 , december 2019 ) states that "nothing in this act may be construed as authorizing the use of force against iran. however , congress has not prohibited the use of funds for operations against iran , despite the introduction of several standalone measures that would do so , such as the prevention of unconstitutional war with iran act of 2019 ( h.r . 2354 / s. 1039 ) .while the house did pass legislation that included a prohibition on funding for the use of force against iran , including section 1229 of h.r . 2500 , the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fy2020 , the senate rejected by a 50-40 vote an amendment ( s.amdt . 883 ) that would have added similar text to its version of the fy2020 ndaa , and the house - passed language was not included in conference text of the bill .
