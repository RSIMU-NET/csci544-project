( a ) findings. — congress makes the following findings: ( 1 ) securing and maintaining access to affordable and plentiful sources of energy is a vital national security interest for the united states . therefore , the conferees direct the secretary to submit a report , not later than september 1 , 2007 , to the committees on armed services of the senate and the house of representatives on the status of implementation by the department of the requirements contained in the following: ( 1 ) energy policy act of 2005 ( public law 109 – 58 ) ; ( 2 ) energy policy act of 1992 ( public law 102 – 486 ) ; ( 3 ) executive order 13123 ; ( 4 ) executive order 13149 ; and ( 5 ) other regulations or directions relating to the department's consumption of petroleum - based fuels . furthermore , the conferees are concerned that although flexible fuel vehicles ( ffvs ) are being introduced into the department's vehicle inventory , little reduction in petroleum - based fuel is being realized because operators continue to fuel the ffvs with gasoline rather than e85 ( 85 percent ethanol with 15 percent gasoline ) or m85 ( 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline ) . therefore , the conferees direct the secretary to include in the report an analysis of the reduction of petroleum - based fuels since introduction of ffvs into the inventory and an assessment of how the department might increase the consumption of e85 or m85 in ffvs .
