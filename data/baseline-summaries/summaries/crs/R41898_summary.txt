this stereotype is outdated . of more than 291,000 manufacturing establishments counted by the census bureau in march 2016 , only 886 employed more than 1,000 workers ( see table 6 ) . this is up from the modern low of 795 in 2010 , but remains far below the level of the 1990s . those very large factories , the ones most prominent in public discussion of manufacturing , collectively employ 1.8 million workers , 16% of the manufacturing workforce and slightly more than 1% of the u.s. labor force . as the number of factories in all size classes declined , mean employment in u.s. manufacturing establishments fell from 46.3 workers in 1998 to 36.2 in 2010 . since then , the number of factories in all size classes above 100 employees has edged higher , and mean employment size has risen to 39.6 workers . the decline in the number of large factories was widespread across the manufacturing sector , with the exception of the food processing industry . four industries — chemicals , computers and electronic products , machinery , and transportation equipment — accounted for more than half the decline in the number of factories with more than 1,000 workers between 1998 and 2010 . more recently , however , the number of such large factories has increased in several industries , notably food , chemicals , and transportation equipment manufacturing ( see table 7 ) , suggesting that existing plants have added workers as business conditions have improved . among the factories with more than 1,000 workers , average employment size has held steady around 2,050 workers since 2004 after several years of decline . approximately 16% of manufacturing workers were employed in plants with more than 1,000 workers in 2016 , down from 19% in 1998 but up from the low of 14.9% in 2012 ( table 8 ) . the employment dynamics of the factory sector differ importantly from those in the rest of the economy . in other economic sectors , notably services , business start - ups and shutdowns account for a large proportion of job creation and job destruction . in manufacturing , by contrast , employment change appears to be driven largely by the expansion and contraction of existing firms , with entrepreneurship and failure playing lesser roles . this may be due to obvious financial factors: the large amounts of capital needed for manufacturing equipment may serve as a deterrent to opening a factory , and the highly specialized nature of manufacturing capital may make it difficult for owners to recover their investment if an establishment shuts down entirely rather than reducing the scope of its production activities . the dynamics of employment change in manufacturing can be seen in two different government databases . the bureau of labor statistics' business employment dynamics database , which is based on firms' unemployment insurance filings , offers a quarterly estimate of gross employment gains attributable to the opening of new establishments and to the expansion of existing ones , and of the gross job losses attributable to the contraction or closure of establishments .
