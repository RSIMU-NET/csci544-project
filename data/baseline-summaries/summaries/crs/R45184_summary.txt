this report focuses on the teen birth rate . from 1991 onward , the teen birth rate declined except in two years , 2006 and 2007 . the rate dropped by 72% from 1991 ( 61.8 ) to 2018 ( 17.4 ) . in other words , about 6% of teens aged 15 to 19 gave birth in 1991 compared to less than 2% in 2018 . in nearly each year from 1991 through the recent period , the teen birth rate decreased for all racial and ethnic groups ; however , the rates declined more for certain groups compared to others . from 2007 to 2018 , birth rates fell by 55% for non - hispanic white teens , 40% for non - hispanic american indian / alaska native teens , 58% for non - hispanic black teens , 73% for non - hispanic asian / pacific islander teens , and 65% for hispanic teens . while the birth rates for two groups ( non - hispanic black and hispanic ) had a greater decline than the rate for white teens , their birth rates remained higher . in 2018 , the birth rate for teens aged 15 to 19 varied considerably by state and territory . the state with the lowest reported rate was massachusetts ( 7.2 ) ; the state with the highest reported rate was arkansas ( 30.4 ) . figure 3 shows a map with 2018 teen births rates in four data categories for the 50 states , the district of columbia , and three of the territories . eighteen states had rates of less than 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19: california , colorado , connecticut , maine , maryland , massachusetts , minnesota , new hampshire , new jersey , new york , oregon , pennsylvania , rhode island , utah , vermont , virginia , washington , and wisconsin . ten states had the highest teen birth rates ( 25 or higher ) : alabama , arkansas , kentucky , louisiana , mississippi , new mexico , oklahoma , tennessee , texas , and west virginia . the rates for the territories ranged from 19.3 in puerto rico to 34.4 in guam . from 2007 ( when the birth rate last ticked up ) to 2018 , the teen birth rate decreased in each state or territory by between 19% and 67% . teen birth rates have also declined in rural areas over time but remain relatively higher than rates in urban areas . while the u.s. teen birth rate has decreased over time , it has been higher than that of most other industrialized countries . for comparison , the u.s. teen birth rate of 18.8 was about 50% higher than the rate of the united kingdom , 12.6 , in 2017 ( based on the most recent international data available ) . the reasons for the high teen birth rate in the united states relative to other industrial countries have not been fully explored . economic conditions and income inequality within and between countries may play a role .
