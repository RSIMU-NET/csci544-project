many of these objectives were incorporated in provisions of awia 2018 . similarly , wrrda 2014 and wiin in 2016 addressed water infrastructure programs administered by epa . awia 2018 included numerous provisions involving epa - administered water quality infrastructure programs and other authorities . most of these provisions occurred in title v , but other titles also featured epa - relevant provisions ( eg , section 3702 proposed to amend and reauthorize epa's long island sound programs ) . title v of awia 2018 would have amended the cwa to ( 1 ) reauthorize the appropriation of grants for municipal sewer overflow projects and to make stormwater management projects eligible for these grants ; ( 2 ) authorize a technical assistance program for small - and medium - sized wastewater treatment works ; and ( 3 ) formally authorize epa's integrated planning initiative , which is intended to help municipalities comply with multiple cwa wastewater discharge mandates . awia 2018 would have further amended the cwa to require certain epa offices to promote the use and coordinate the integration of green infrastructure into permitting , planning , research , funding guidance , and other activities , among other provisions . section 3308 of awia 2018 proposed to amend the cwa to codify in statute the existing epa regulations on water transfers . it would have defined water transfer as "an activity that conveys or connects waters of the united states without subjecting the water to intervening industrial , municipal , or commercial use. it would also have specified that discharges from water transfers do not require a cwa permit , with the exception of pollutants introduced by the water transfer activity itself to the water being transferred . wrrda 2014 included wifia , which authorized epa and usace to provide credit assistance for an array of water infrastructure projects , including projects to build and upgrade wastewater and drinking water treatment systems â€” and , specifically , projects eligible to receive assistance under the clean water state revolving fund ( cwsrf ) and drinking water state revolving fund ( dwsrf ) programs . regarding sdwa authorities , title v of awia 2018 would have made several changes to the act's dwsrf provisions , including making permanent the requirement that projects receiving dwsrf assistance must use iron and steel products produced in the united states . among other sdwa amendments , awia 2018 would have ( 1 ) expressly authorized epa's watersense program , and ( 2 ) revised the sdwa grant program for testing for lead in school and childcare - program drinking water . additionally , awia 2018 included several wifia amendments . title v would have removed wifia's designation as a pilot program and added a new section to wifia regarding loans to state cwsrf and dwsrf finance authorities . although state srf financing authorities are currently eligible to receive wifia assistance , these provisions would have authorized epa to provide secured loans at subsidized interest rates for states meeting certain conditions . unlike other wifia assistance , this section also would have allowed the use of federal assistance to support 100% of project costs , and it would have waived application fees .
