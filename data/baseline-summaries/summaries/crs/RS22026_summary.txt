or in immigration regulations . the section also does not stipulate what specific characteristics would designate an area as one of high illegal entry . this subsection has not been amended . section 102 ( b ) âbefore its amendment in the secure fence act of 2006 ( p.l . 109-367 ) âmandated that the ag construct a barrier in the border area near san diego . specifically , â§102 ( b ) directed the ag to construct a three - tiered barrier along the 14 miles of the international land border of the united states , starting at the pacific ocean and extending eastward . section 102 ( b ) ensured that the ag would build a barrier , pursuant to his broader authority in â§102 ( a ) , near the san diego area . other non - amended provisions in â§102 ( b ) provide authority for the acquisition of necessary easements , require that certain safety features be incorporated into the design of the fence , and authorize an appropriation not to exceed $12 million . section 102 ( c ) âbefore its amendment in the real id act as part of p.l . 109-13 âwaived the endangered species act ( esa ) of 1973 ( 16 u.s.c . â§â§1531 et seq . ) and the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) of 1969 ( 42 u.s.c . â§â§4321 et seq .

 ) , to the extent the ag determined necessary , in order to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers authorized to be constructed under â§102 . the waiver authority in this provision appears to apply both to barriers that may be constructed in the vicinity of the border under â§102 ( a ) and to the barrier that is to be constructed near the san diego area under â§102 ( b ) . apprehension statistics have long been used as a performance measure by the usbp . however , the number of apprehensions may be a misleading statistic for several reasons , including the data's focus on events rather than people and the absence of reliable estimates for how many aliens successfully evade capture . these factors aside , however , apprehensions data remain the best way to gain a glimpse into the reality facing usbp agents and the trends in unauthorized migration along the border . as figure 1 shows , apprehensions remained stable during the early 1990s in the san diego sector despite the construction of the "primary" fence in 1993 . after the iirira's mandate for increased enforcement along the southwest border in 1996 , including construction of the triple - fence , apprehensions dropped rapidly in the san diego sector in the late 1990sâfrom 480,000 in fy1996 to 100,000 in fy2002 . the reduction in apprehensions was even more marked in the areas where fencing was constructed within san diego sector . the usbp's imperial beach and chula vista stations saw their apprehensions decline from 321,560 in fy1993 to 19,035 in fy2004âa reduction of 94% over the 12 year period .
