appendix a . budget enforcement activities the framework for budget enforcement under the congressional budget process has both statutory and procedural elements . the statutory elements include the discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester derived from the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l . 112-25 ) and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( bbedca ; p.l . the procedural elements are primarily associated with the budget resolution and limit both total discretionary spending and spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee . readers should note that the statutory budget enforcement requirements that apply to fy2019 discretionary spending under the bca were altered the prior fiscal year by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l . 115-123 ) , which was enacted on february 9 , 2018 . this law increased the defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for fy2018 and fy2019 , and extended mandatory spending sequestration through fy2027 . budget control act and sequestration the bca provides budget process mechanisms to reduce mandatory spending and further reduce discretionary spending over an extended period . for mandatory spending , reductions are to occur through sequestration in each of fiscal years between fy2013-fy2027 . for discretionary spending , reductions occurred through sequestration in fy2013 , but are to be achieved through lower discretionary spending limits for each of the fiscal years between fy2014-fy2021 . the bca does not require a sequester of discretionary spending in fy2014-fy2021 unless one or both of the statutory discretionary spending limits ( defense and nondefense ) is breached . only discretionary spending subject to a given spending limit is affected by a breach of that limit , and the lhhs bill only includes funding in the nondefense category . fy2019 on february 12 , 2018 , concurrent with the release of the president's budget , president trump issued the required fy2019 sequestration order , calling for nonexempt mandatory spending to be reduced on october 1 , 2018 . budget resolution and 302 ( b ) suballocations the procedural elements of budget enforcement generally stem from requirements under the congressional budget act of 1974 ( p.l . 93-44 ) that are associated with the adoption of an annual budget resolution . through this process , the appropriations committee in each chamber receives a procedural limit on the total amount of discretionary budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year , referred to as a 302 ( a ) allocation . the appropriations committee subsequently divides this allocation among its 12 subcommittees . these subcommittee - level spending limits are referred to as 302 ( b ) suballocations . the 302 ( b ) suballocations restrict the amount of budget authority available to each subcommittee for the agencies , projects , and activities under its jurisdiction , effectively acting as a cap on each of the 12 regular appropriations bills . enforcement of the 302 ( a ) allocation and 302 ( b ) suballocations occurs through points of order . for the fy2019 appropriations cycle , the house and the senate did not adopt a budget resolution .
