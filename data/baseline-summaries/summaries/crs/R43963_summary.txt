unlike h.r . 1806 specifies funding levels for major science research programs ( such as ascr and fes ) . these amounts are included in table 5 , along with fy2015 enacted and fy2016 requested funding levels ( for comparison ) . 2028 as passed by the house . funding levels for the office of science were among several factors cited in the statement . as amended and reported by the senate committee on appropriations , h.r . 2028 would provide $5.144 billion for the science account in fy2016 . this amount is $73 million ( 1% ) more than the fy2015 enacted funding level , $196 million ( - 4% ) less than the fy2016 administration request , and $44 million ( 1% ) more than the house - passed funding level . 114-54 ( herein referred to as the "senate report" or "senate recommendation" ) accompanied h.r . 2028 when it was reported from the senate committee on appropriations . 114-54 specifies funding for certain science programs and activities . by dollar amount , the largest increase ( over fy2015 ) in the senate recommendation is for basic energy sciences ( $111 million ) ; by percentage , the largest increase is for advanced scientific computing research ( 15% ) . the largest decrease — by both amount and percentage — would go to fusion energy sciences ( $197 million , - 42% ) . the senate appropriations committee recommends u.s. withdrawal from the international fusion energy project known as iter . the following sections highlight selected fy2016 initiatives , programs , and activities within science research programs , as well as their fy2016 budget and appropriations status . these sections are not intended to provide a comprehensive view of each account , but rather focus mostly on large changes or on activities emphasized in house and senate appropriations committee reports . table 3 shows office of science current dollar appropriations from fy2010 to fy2014 , as well as fy2015 enacted appropriations and the fy2016 request . the office of science subtotal ( not including transfers from other accounts , or the use or rescission of prior - year balances ) increased by $241 million ( 5% ) between fy2010 and fy2014 . most of the increase — $222 million or 92% — went to ascr , bes , and fes . funding for high energy physics was reduced by about - 2% during this period . appropriations authorizations to the office of science , which were last enacted in the america competes reauthorization act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-358 ) , expired in fy2013 . members of the 114th congress have introduced measures to reauthorize provisions from p.l . 111-358 , including provisions that authorize appropriations to the office of science . an analysis of these bills may be found in crs report r43880 , the america competes acts: an overview , by [author name scrubbed] . table 4 summarizes funding levels for the office of science under selected proposed reauthorization measures from the 114 th congress . it also provides selected historical funding data .
