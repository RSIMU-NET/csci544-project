â§551 et seq. ) generally requires federal agencies to publish their proposed rules ( also called regulations ) in the federal register , to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on those proposed rules , and to publish a final rule at least 30 days before its effective date . the apa does not , however , specify how agencies are to develop their proposed rules or who should participate in that process . consequently , agencies sometimes develop rules without discussing relevant issues with all affected interests , and there may be little or no opportunity for an informal exchange of views among affected parties or between those parties and the rulemaking agency either before or after the proposed rule is published . negotiated rulemaking ( sometimes referred to as regulatory negotiation or "reg - neg" ) is a supplement to the traditional apa rulemaking process in which agency representatives and representatives of affected parties work together to develop what can ultimately become the text of a proposed rule . in this approach , negotiators try to reach consensus by evaluating their priorities and making tradeoffs , with the end result being a draft rule that is mutually acceptable . negotiated rulemaking has been encouraged ( although not usually required ) by both congressional and executive branch actions , and has received bipartisan support as a way to involve affected parties in rulemaking before agencies have developed their proposals . some questions have been raised , however , regarding whether the approach actually speeds rulemaking or reduces litigation . the development of negotiated rulemaking is traceable to dissatisfaction with what some viewed as the formal , complex , and adversarial nature of traditional rulemaking procedures . for example , in 1982 , administrative law expert philip j. harterâan early advocate of negotiated rulemakingâsaid a "malaise" had settled over the federal rulemaking process because of the defensive and arms - length manner in which agencies and affected parties interacted . he suggested a different approach in which differences were acknowledged and resolved through face - to - face negotiations , and laid out a series of principles that could make those negotiations successful . also in 1982 , the administrative conference of the united states ( acus ) recommended that agencies consider using negotiated rulemaking as a way to develop proposed rules , published criteria for determining when negotiated rulemaking was likely to be successful , and suggested specific procedures to be followed when implementing the approach . for example , acus said agencies should use "conveners" to determine whether negotiated rulemaking is appropriate and to identify affected interests . acus also recommended that congress pass legislation explicitly authorizing agencies to use negotiated rulemaking , but giving them substantial flexibility to adapt negotiation methods . in 1983 , the federal aviation administration became the first federal agency to try negotiated rulemaking ( regarding flight and rest time requirements for domestic airline pilots ) , followed by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the occupational health and safety administration . in 1985 , acus recommended refinements to the procedures based on these agencies' experience with the approach .
