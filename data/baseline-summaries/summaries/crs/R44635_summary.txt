ssns . the scaled - up figure of 55 ssns , which happens to equal a figure shown in certain navy force structure plans prior to 2005 , was increased to 59 in the notional plan to create a figure equal to the combined total of 4 ssgns and 55 ssns shown in the navy's 2002-2004 plan for a fleet of 375 ships . aircraft carriers . the scaled - up figure of 13 carriers was reduced to 12 because navy force structure plans for fleets of between 300 and 400 ships since 1993 have not shown more than 12 carriers . cruisers and destroyers . the scaled - up figure of 100 cruisers and destroyers ( i.e. , large surface combatants ) was left unchanged . frigates and lcss . the scaled - up figure of 59 frigates and lcss ( i.e. , small surface combatants ) was reduced to 56 , which is the number of lcss in the navy's 2002-2004 plan for a 375-ship fleet . in addition , navy plans for crewing and operating lcss call for organizing lcss into four - ship divisions , and 56 is evenly divisible by four . navy force structure plans from 2006 through 2012 included a total of 55 lcss . amphibious ships . the scaled - up figure of 39 ships was reduced to 38 , a number that navy and marine corps officials have testified would be able to meet the requirement for having enough amphibious lift for the assault echelons of 2.0 marine expeditionary brigades ( mebs ) with less risk than the currently planned 34-ship amphibious force . mine warfare ships . the scaled up figure of 0 mine warfare ships was left unchanged . as under the current 308-ship plan , missions now carried out by mine warfare ships would in the future be performed instead by lcss equipped with the lcs mine warfare mission package . combat logistics force ( clf ) ships and support ships ( including expeditionary fast transports [epfs] ) . the scaled - up figures for these two categories were left unchanged . appendix b . additional ships needed in 30-year shipbuilding plan this appendix discusses in further detail the additional ships added to the 30-year shipbuilding plan that are shown in the final column of table 3 . ssns â€” notional objective of 59 industrial - base capacity permitting , an ssn force of 59 boats could be achieved by inserting 12 additional ssns into the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , for a total procurement of 56 ssns rather than 44 during the 30-year period . a notional profile could insert these 12 additional ssns into the 12 years ( fy2021 , fy2024 , and fy2026-fy2035 ) where the current plan would procure 1 ssn rather than 2 . ( these are the 12 years when the 12 columbia class [ohio replacement] ssbns are to be procured. ) under this profile , the ssn force would reach a minimum of 43 boats around fy2028-fy2029 and then grow to 59 boats in fy2041 .
