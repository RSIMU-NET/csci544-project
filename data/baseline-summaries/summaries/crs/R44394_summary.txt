however , the improvement has not been continuous . the fatality rate dropped rapidly , from around 5.5 per 100 million vmt to around 3.2 , in the first decade of federal oversight . as the fatality rate has become lower , reductions in that rate have necessarily become more modest: over the past 20 years it dropped from around 1.8 to 1.1 . however , some of the change in accident and fatality rates over the past several decades is attributable to factors beyond the scope of federal highway safety policies . there are four basic tools available to government to improve traffic safety: engineering , education , enforcement , and emergency response . these tools may be used , in different ways , to achieve three traffic safety goals: reducing the number of crashes ; reducing the severity of crashes ; and improving medical care for people injured in crashes . as indicated in table 6 , each of these tools is better suited to achieving some goals than others . federal policy efforts fall primarily into the categories of engineering and enforcement . driver education and emergency response to traffic incidents are handled largely by state and local governments with little federal involvement or funding . federal involvement in education and enforcement of safe driving practices has come through funding for state activities . as behavior of passenger car drivers is largely under the authority of states , not of the federal government , congress is not able to mandate driver behavior . given the potential safety impact of the new collision - avoidance technologies and the lag in the spread of such technologies , an analysis of the costs and benefits of a program to encourage drivers to replace older cars with new cars equipped with these technologies may be worthwhile . recent experience with the consumer assistance to recycle and save act of 2009 ( which created the so - called "cash for clunkers" program paying vehicle owners to scrap old cars and purchase new , more fuel - efficient ones ) can help inform the prospects of such a proposal . instead , it has had to rely on both carrots ( incentive grants ) and sticks ( penalties that reduce federal transportation funding ) to influence state governments to adopt and enforce traffic safety measures affecting driver behavior . in recent years , congress has largely restricted itself to using incentives rather than penalties to influence state enforcement efforts . although u.s. highway safety statistics have steadily improved , there is room for further improvement . since 2010 the reductions in u.s. fatality and injury rates have stalled , and preliminary estimates indicate that traffic deaths increased by 9% in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 , while vmt increased by less than 3% . also , while the u.s. highway safety record was once the world's best , in recent years the highway safety performance of several other industrialized nations has surpassed that of the united states . there are several policy actions congress could consider that are recommended by safety advocates as being relatively low - cost but effective interventions .
