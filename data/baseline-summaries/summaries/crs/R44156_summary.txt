such efforts have been unsuccessful . for the domestic market , some in congress have begun encouraging usda to purchase more peanut butter for domestic food programs and for international food aid as a way to increase peanut usage . in fy2015 , usda purchased 37.5 million pounds of processed peanut products ( for distribution through domestic feeding channels ) and another 39.1 million pounds in fy2016 . arguments for and against the peanut support programs are the same as for u.s. farm programs in general . proponents argue that an income safety net is needed to help producers deal with the substantial price volatility associated with commodity markets . they say a marketing assistance loan program is needed to provide greater marketing options for producers who are at a distinct market - power disadvantage when dealing with a small number of powerful buyers . and in peanut's particular case , proponents argue that farm program support is needed to help offset the substantial market volatility that has emerged since the elimination of the peanut quota system . in contrast , critics argue that market signals are sufficient to allocate resources within the sector , and that subsidies distort resources away from more efficient uses . some critics argue that farm subsidies actually keep small , inefficient operators in business and that , in the absence of subsidies , the inefficient operators would not be competitive and the land would be maintained and operated by more efficient , technologically savvy operators who would get better yields and returns from the same acreage . others argue further that funds allocated to farm support would have greater returns if spent in other sectors . sufficient storage capacity might also be an issue if stocks increase substantially . following the 2002 buyout of the peanut quota program , federal peanut income support payments ( including storage payments and the buyout ) averaged over $300 million per year through 2007 . this includes peanut storage payments of $79 million per year from 1996 to 2007 ( the last year of eligibility ) ( figure 8 ) . from 2008 through 2015 , federal peanut program outlays have averaged about $90 million . however , recent long - term budget projections suggest that federal peanut program outlays could become much larger in the future . in february 2016 , usda projected peanut program costs of $503.6 million in fy2016 , $870 million in fy2017 , and at least $910 million through fy2025 . this included substantial peanut storage and handling costs ( related to marketing loan forfeitures ) that were projected to rise from $31.2 million in fy2017 to $52 million in fy2021 . more recently , in august 2016 , cbo projected ccc program outlays for peanuts at $413 million for fy2016 , and averaging $548 million through the remainder of the 2014 farm bill period . however , cbo projections do not include costs associated with loan forfeiture but are limited to plc , arc , and marketing assistance loan benefits . as a point of reference , the annual market value of u.s. peanut production has traditionally been in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion , depending on crop size .
