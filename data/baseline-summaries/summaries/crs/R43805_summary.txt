the tax filer must have earned income . the tax filer must meet certain residency requirements . the tax filer's children must meet relationship , residency , and age requirements to be considered qualifying children for the credit . childless workers who claim the credit must be between ages 25 and 64 . ( this age requirement does not apply to eitc claimants with qualifying children. ) the tax filer's investment income must be below a certain amount . the tax filer must not be disallowed the credit due to prior fraud or reckless disregard of the rules when they previously claimed the eitc . beginning in 1990 and more substantially in 1993 , the credit formula was revised such that the credit amount varied based on earned income and , to a certain extent , the number of qualifying children . this essentially increased the credit by family size . in addition , for the first time in 1993 , congress made workers without qualifying children eligible for the eitc , although the credit was smaller than the credit for claimants with qualifying children . the growth in the total amount of eitc claimed in the late 1980s to the mid - 1990s was due to increases not only in participation , but also in the average credit received by tax filers . figure 5 shows the average eitc claimed for 1975 to 2015 , in inflation - adjusted ( 2015 ) dollars . before the 1986 tax reform act ( p.l . 99-514 ) , eitc thresholds were not indexed for inflation , and the average credit lost value each year . however , the 1986 act increased the monetary parameters of the credit for prior inflation and adjusted the threshold amounts and maximum credits annually for inflation in future years . the credit formula was also revised in 1990 and then again in 1993 such that the amount of the credit depended to a certain extent on family size . the eitc was first enacted in 1975 as a temporary measure meant to encourage economic growth in the face of the 1974 recession and rising food and energy prices . it was also originally intended to "assist in encouraging people to obtain employment , reducing the unemployment rate , and reducing the welfare rolls. over time the list of eitc objectives has grown to include poverty reduction . today the eitc is the largest need - tested , cash benefit antipoverty program . this section first provides a historical overview of the growth of the eitc for tax years 1975 to 2015 ; it then examines information on eitc participation for 2015 . when originally enacted by the tax reduction act of 1975 ( p.l . 94-12 ) , the eitc was a temporary refundable tax credit in effect for 1975 . for that year , 6.2 million tax filers claimed the eitc and the total eitc amount claimed was $1.25 billion ( in constant 2015 dollars , this equals $5.5 billion ) . the credit was extended several more times on a temporary basis and made permanent by the revenue act of 1978 ( p.l . legislation enacted in 1986 ( p.l . 111-5 ) increased the amount of the credit by changing the credit formula .
