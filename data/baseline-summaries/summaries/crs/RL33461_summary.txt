mixed waste . chemically hazardous waste that includes radioactive material . high - level , low - level , and tru waste , and radioactive byproduct material , often falls under the designation of mixed waste . such waste poses complicated institutional problems , because the radioactive portion is regulated by doe or nrc under the atomic energy act , while the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and states regulate the nonradioactive elements under the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) . disposal of spent fuel and high - level waste is a federal responsibility , while states are authorized to develop disposal facilities for commercial low - level waste . the obama administration halted development of the yucca mountain repository after fy2010 , although yucca mountain remains the sole candidate site for civilian highly radioactive waste disposal under current law . the economics of reprocessing vs . direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel . managing spent nuclear fuel: strategy alternatives and policy implications . 71 p p . http: / / www.rand.org / content / dam / rand / pubs / monographs / 2010 / rand_mg970.pdf . university of illinois . used fuel disposition campaign: disposal research and development roadmap , march 2011 , http: / / energy.gov / sites / prod / files / ufd_disposal_r%26d_roadmap_rev_0.1.pdf . u.s. nuclear regulatory commission . safety evaluation report related to disposal of high - level radioactive wastes in a geologic repository at yucca mountain , nevada , volume 3: repository safety after permanent closure , nureg - 1949 , v3 , ml14288a121 , october 16 , 2014 , 781 pp . voegele , michael d. and donald l. vieth , waste of a mountain: how yucca mountain was selected , stu died , and dumped . nye county press , 2016 . 920 pp .
