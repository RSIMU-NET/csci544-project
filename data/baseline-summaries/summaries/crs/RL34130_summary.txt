the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . 9005 ) ; a new program to incentivize production of cellulosic ethanol feedstock ( sec . 9011 ) ; studies of the market and environmental impacts of increased biofuels use ( sec . 15322 ) ; expansion of the existing bio - based marketing program to encourage federal procurement of bio - based products ( sec . 9002 ) ; expansion of the federal bio - products certification program ( sec . 9002 ) ; support for rural energy efficiency and self - sufficiency ( sec . 9007 ) ; reauthorization of biofuels research programs ( sec . 109-58 ) and was more recently expanded in eisa . ethanol's profitability depends on both petroleum and corn prices . when petroleum prices rise , so does demand for ethanol as a substitute , which in turn increases both the demand for and price of corn . the "food versus fuel" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate as food price inflation accelerated both in the u.s. and globally â€” highlighting some of the potential problems associated with replacing even a small share of the nation's gasoline consumption with corn - based ethanol . several of the federal programs that currently support renewable energy production in general , and agriculture - based energy production in particular , are outside the purview of the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and have legislative origins outside of the farm bill . for example , the rfs , which mandates the inclusion of an increasing volume of biofuels in the national fuel supply , originated with the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . similarly , several of the federal tax credits available to biofuel blenders were initially contained in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l . more recently , the tax credits were extended in the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . 110-246 ) significantly expands both the number and type of programs to support biofuels production and use . like the 2002 farm bill ( p.l . 107-171 ) , it contains a distinct energy title ( title ix ) that covers a wide range of energy and agricultural topics with extensive attention to biofuels , including corn starch - based ethanol , cellulosic ethanol , and biodiesel . research provisions relating to renewable energy are found in title vii and tax and trade provisions are found in title xv . the enacted 2008 farm bill keeps the structure of title ix as it was in the senate - passed version of the farm bill . title ix serves as a substitute amendment to the 2002 farm bill title ix and consists of 3 sections . the first section , 9001 , contains 13 new provisions which effectively replace the provisions of the 2002 bill . sections 9002 and 9003 direct studies and reports on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer , respectively . see appendix for a side - by - side comparison of previous law with the energy provisions of the 2008 farm bill . key biofuels - related provisions in the enacted 2008 farm bill include establishment of a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit ( sec .
