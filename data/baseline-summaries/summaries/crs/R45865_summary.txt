, as amended . specifically , the president has authorized usda to provide up to $16 billion in new funding for the 2019 initiative . this new funding authority is in addition to the $12 billion in funding authority that was announced for the previous 2018 trade aid package . the 2019 trade aid package is to be implemented using the same three trade assistance programs that were used under the 2018 trade aid packageâa market facilitation program ( mfp ) , a food purchase and distribution program ( fpdp ) , and an agricultural trade promotion ( atp ) programâbut at generally higher funding levels ( table 1 ) , except for atp . 714 et seq .

 ) also similar to the 2018 initiative , the 2019 trade aid package funding authority corresponds with usda's estimate of the trade damage to the u.s. agricultural sector from retaliatory tariffsâimposed on u.s. agricultural goods in response to previous u.s. trade actionsâand other trade disruptions in 2019 . the 2019 programs are intended to assist agricultural producers while the administration works to resolve the ongoing trade disputes with certain foreign nations , most notably china . this report describes the new trade aid package authorized for 2019 , including its constituent parts , and identifies distinguishing differences from the 2018 trade aid package . an appendix provides additional details on usda's implementation of the fpdp and atp programs and on the evolution of usda's formulation of the mfp payment rates under the 2018 and 2019 mfp programs . under the 2019 trade aid package , usda is to use up to $16 billion to fund three programs to assist producers of affected commodities in 2019: 1 . a market facilitation program , administered by usda's farm service agency ( fsa ) , to provide up to $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers of usda - specified eligible commodities ( described below ) . a food purchase and distribution program , administered through usda's agricultural marketing service ( ams ) , to use $1.4 billion to purchase surplus commodities affected by trade retaliation , such as fruits , vegetables , some processed foods , beef , pork , lamb , poultry , and milk for distribution by the food and nutrition service to food banks , schools , and other outlets serving low - income individuals . an agricultural trade promotion program , administered by usda's foreign agriculture service ( fas ) , to use $100 million to assist in developing new export markets on behalf of u.s. agricultural producers . some important differences between the 2018 and 2019 trade aid packages include the following: the 2019 package includes an expanded funding commitment of up to $16 billion versus $12 billion under the previous package . the 2019 package includes an expanded list of eligible commodities ( 41 eligible commodities in 2019 versus 9 in 2018 ) . the mfp payment formula for 2019 is modified for non - specialty crops ( field crops ) to be a single county payment rate rather than commodity - specific rates . this is done to minimize influencing producer crop choices and avoid large payment - rate discrepancies across commodities .
