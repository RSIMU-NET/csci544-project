there is no matching requirement for nsip funds . in fy2014 , of the total $814.7 million appropriated for the title iii nutrition services program , $438.2 million was for congregate nutrition ( 54% ) , $216.4 million for home - delivered nutrition ( 27% ) , and $160.1 million for nutrition services incentive grants ( 19% ) ( table 1 ) . funding for nutrition services represents 64% of fy2014 funding for title iii ( $1.281 billion ) ; title iii also funds a wide array of social services , family caregiver support activities , and disease prevention and health promotion services for older individuals . when adjusted for inflation , the total amount of funding appropriated for oaa nutrition services has decreased substantially over the past two decades ( $814.7 million for fy2014 compared to $1,052.4 million in fy1990 ) . this decline in relative funding has been experienced by the congregate meals and nsip programs , while funding levels for the home - delivered meals programs have increased over the same time period . in constant 2014 dollars , the total appropriation for congregate meals , home - delivered meals , and nsip fell from $1,052.4 million in 1990 to $814.7 million in 2014 , a decline of $237.7 million , or 23% . the amount appropriated for congregate meals fell from $644.7 million to $438.2 million , a decline of $206.5 million , or 32% . the amount appropriated for nsip fell from $262.9 million to $160.1 million , a decline of $102.8 million , or 39% . only the amount appropriated for home - delivered meals increased in real terms from 1990 to 2014 , rising from $144.7 million to $216.4 million , an increase of $71.7 million , or 50% . overall , this reduction in purchasing power has affected the number of meals served , which declined by 21.1 million meals ( or 8.6% ) from fy1990 to fy2011 , the most recent year for which data are available . over this same time period , the number of individuals age 60 and older has increased substantially from just under 42 million in1990 to about 62 million in 2013 , an increase of almost 50% . another way to look at the decline in purchasing power compared to the potential increase in demand for services is to compare per person spending in constant 2013 dollars , which has declined by about half during this time period . in 1990 , total federal funding for nutrition services was about $25 per older individual , as compared to just over $12 per older individual in 2013 . it is important to note that oaa funding is not the only source of funding that state agencies use to provide nutrition services to older individuals . states rely on other funding sources , such as funding from other federal programs ( eg , social services block grant , medicaid home - and community - based services ) , state and local governments , private sources , and clients . the following describes these programs in greater detail . in fy2011 , more than 223 million meals were provided to older adults ( see table 2 ) .
