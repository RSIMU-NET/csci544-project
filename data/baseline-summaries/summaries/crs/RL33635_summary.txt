under the provisions in h.r . 1998 / s. 1186 , the president could conceivably have withheld funds for 100 days or longer . introduced on february 27 , 2007 ; referred to the judiciary committee . the definition in h.r . 4890 as introduced referred to revenue - losing measures affecting 100 or fewer beneficiaries , as did the line item veto act of 1996 . the bill as introduced , however , would have allowed the president to identify the provisions by default , whereas the 1996 law assigned the duty to the joint committee on taxation . supporters of the substitute version suggested that it would treat targeted tax benefits comparably to earmarks in appropriations bills . in his budget submission for fy2008 transmitted on february 5 , 2007 , president bush once again called for enactment of a line item veto mechanism , such as the administration's proposal from march 2006 , that "would withstand constitutional challenge. expedited rescission bills were also introduced in the house in the 110 th congress ( see below ) . on the same day as the cloture motion on the gregg line item veto proposal failed in the senate , representative paul ryan , ranking republican on the house budget committee , along with 83 cosponsors , introduced h.r . 689 , the legislative line item veto act of 2007 . 689 was nearly identical to h.r . 4890 as passed by the house in the 109 th congress . on april 23 , 2007 , companion bills titled the congressional accountability and line - item veto act were introduced as h.r . 1998 by representative paul ryan , and as s. 1186 by senator russell feingold . in his introductory remarks , senator feingold sought to differentiate this measure from previous bills , noting the following: there have been a number of so - called line - item veto proposals offered in the past several years . but the measure congressman ryan and i propose today is unique in that it specifically targets the very items that every line - item veto proponent cites when promoting a particular measure , namely earmarks . when president bush asked for this kind of authority , the examples he gave when citing wasteful spending he wanted to target were congressional earmarks . the universe of items subject to rescission or cancellation by the president in s. 1186 showed noteworthy differences from those contained in the 109 th congress bills , as passed by the house ( h.r . 4890 ) and reported in the senate ( s. 3521 , title i ) . instead of allowing the president to propose rescission of any amount of discretionary spending in appropriations acts , et al .
