these proposals were not enacted into law . with the advent of the islamic state crisis and the u.s. military response , many proposals affecting the 2001 aumf introduced late in the 113 th congress and early in the 114 th congress have been included in proposals for a new authorization for use of military force against the islamic state or are otherwise related to that crisis . current proposals specifically concerning the 2001 aumf include the following: on february 2 , 2015 , representative adam schiff introduced the authorization for use of military force against isil resolution ( h.j.res . the resolution would repeal the 2001 aumf three years after the resolution's enactment . on february 10 , 2015 , representative barbara lee introduced the comprehensive solution to isil resolution ( h.j.res . 30 ) , which would repeal the 2001 aumf as well as the 2002 aumf . repeal would become effective 60 days after enactment . senator ben cardin introduced the sunset of the 2001 authorization for use of military force act ( s. 526 ) on february 12 , 2015 . the bill would repeal the 2001 aumf three years upon enactment . on march 4 , 2015 , representative barbara lee introduced the repeal of the authorization for use of military force ( h.r . 1303 ) , which would repeal the 2001 aumf 180 days after enactment . past enacted legislation concerning the 2001 aumf has generally confirmed executive branch claims of authority under the 2001 aumf , such as provisions included in the 2006 and 2009 acts related to military commissions , and the national defense authorization act , fiscal year 2012 ( ndaa 2012 ; p.l . some of the key arguments being made in support of or against these options are considered below . over the past few congresses , a number of legislative proposals contained provisions to sunset or repeal the 2001 aumf , or to limit the use of appropriated funds to carry out the 2001 aumf's provisions . section 1021 of the ndaa 2012 includes the term "associated forces" with regard to detentions of terrorist suspects ; some claim that term has been effectively adopted into the authorities of the 2001 aumf to justify broader authority for military action against loosely affiliated groups . some members of congress have espoused this approach as well . more recently , however , these stated administration goals for the reform or repeal of the 2001 aumf have been thrown into doubt by statements from the president and administration officials in connection with u.s. military operations conducted against forces of the islamic state and the khorasan group of al qaeda in iraq and syria . the president has also maintained that he will oppose any attempt to legislate wider executive branch war - making authority . instead , the administration has proposed modernizing the counterterrorism authorities of the 2001 aumf to precisely authorize the president to meet the current challenges posed by terrorist groups and networks around the world . the president , in his august 2014 notifications to congress , indicated that his powers as commander in chief and chief executive under article ii of the constitution gave him authority to undertake deployments and airstrikes in iraq against is forces .
