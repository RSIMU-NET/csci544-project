it mayalso , as in h.r . it was originally introduced as h.r . 3135 by representativesensenbrenner , chairman of the house committee on the judiciary , one week after the kelo decision . it was reported in greatly expanded form as h.r . 4128 and passed the house376-38 on november 3 , 2005 . this report also examines a bill amendment introduced by senator bond , like h.r . 4128 a federal - money - restricting provision . this change effected by the bond amendment is enhanced in importance if the firstparagraph is construed broadly to trigger a funds cut - off when eminent domain is used for other thana public use anywhere in the jurisdiction , rather than solely as part of the project in question . the final paragraph of the bond amendment calls for a gao study "on the nationwide useof eminent domain ...." by its literal terms , this mandate is of expansive scope: it includes federal,state , and local condemnations , and is not limited to , or even specially focused on , the kelo issueof condemnation for economic development . senator bond's statement on introducing theamendment , however , does suggest such a constrained focus for the report , dwelling as it doesexclusively on kelo and similar circumstances . ( 43 ) similarly , the senator's statement implies that report coverageof inverse condemnation , literally included in the term "eminent domain," was not intended . the bond amendment was added onthe senate floor to h.r . 3058 , the transportation , treasury , housing and urbandevelopment , the judiciary , the district of columbia , and independent agencies appropriations actfor fy2006 . 3058 was enacted november 30 , 2005 , as p.l . 109-115 , with the bondamendment as section 726 . other bills and resolutions responding to the kelo decision are not treated here , eitherbecause they have been eclipsed by h.r . 4128 , have seen little activity , or arenonbinding resolutions . these include s. 1313 ( restricting federal funds ) , s. 1704 ( restricting federal funds ) , s. 1883 ( creating an office of propertyrights ombudsperson ) , s. 1895 ( restricting federal funds and eliminating tax benefitsfor private parties acquiring property ) , h.j.res . 60 ( amending the constitution ) , h.res . 340 ( expressing disagreement with the majority opinion in kelo ; passed houseon june 30 , 2005 by 365-33 ) , h.r . 3083 and 3087 ( each identical to s. 1313 ) , h.r . 3315 ( restricting federal funds ) , h.r . 3631 ( restricting federalassistance ) , h.r . 3405 ( restricting federal funds ) , and h.r . 4088 ( restricting federal funds ) . the bond amendment to the transportation , treasury , housing and urban development,the judiciary , the district of columbia , and independent agencies appropriations act for fy2006is now enacted law: p.l . 109-115 , section 726 .
