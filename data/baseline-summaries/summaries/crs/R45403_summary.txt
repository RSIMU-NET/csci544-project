today , china has each of these elements . how has the failure rate and failure speed of projects changed ? how quickly are resources redeployed to new potential opportunities ? for example , is dod pursuing multiple lines of inquiry simultaneously with some projects failing and resources being quickly reallocated accordingly ? is the usd ( r&e ) effectively leveraging and coordinating rdt&e activities and investments across dod and with other federal agencies ? is the dod rdt&e strategic plan being effectively implemented ? is dod addressing and advancing identified technological goals and needs in areas deemed critical for the future military ( eg , artificial intelligence , hypersonics , directed energy ) ? has dod increased collaboration and partnership with leading - edge technology companies that have not historically been a part of dod's innovation ecosystem ? is dod effectively using other transaction authority to increase its innovative capacity and access technologies outside of the agency's traditional contractor base ? is dod using special hiring authorities appropriately and effectively in recruiting and retaining outstanding scientific and engineering talent ? how systemic are the changes in the dod culture of innovation ? what signs of change and innovation are being observed in core elements of dod outside of special offices such as the defense innovation unit ( diu ) , the strategic capabilities office ( sco ) , or the rapid capabilities offices within the military services ? as the global r&d landscape continues to evolve , congress may conduct hearings to stay apprised of the competitive positions of near - peer nations ( and firms ) in key fields of science and technology ; the science , technology , and innovation policies of those countries ; and new and emerging models for technology development and innovation . stevenson - wydler technology innovation act of 1980 ( p.l . 96-480 ) the stevenson - wydler technology innovation act of 1980 articulated a clear and strong linkage between u.s. economic performance and technological leadership , stating "technology and industrial innovation are central to the economic , environmental , and social well - being of citizens of the united states... . increased industrial and technological innovation would reduce trade deficits , stabilize the dollar , increase productivity gains , increase employment , and stabilize prices. the act expressed concern about potential u.s. decline , noting that "industrial and technological innovation in the united states may be lagging when compared to historical patterns and other industrialized nations. further , the act asserted the need for a comprehensive national policy to enhance technological innovation for commercial and public purposes , including a strong national policy supporting domestic technology transfer and utilization of the science and technology resources of the federal government . among its provisions , the act sought to improve technology transfer from federal laboratories to industry by requiring federal laboratories to take an active role in technical cooperation , expanding the dissemination of information about research activities and results , and establishing offices of research and technology applications at major federal laboratories to coordinate and promote technology transfer .
