480 food aid . military assistance to the region amounted to less than $60 million during the 1990s . since fy2000 , u.s. aid to the caribbean region ( including fy2006 aid estimates ) has amounted to almost $1.6 billion , because of increased hiv / aids assistance to the region ( especially to guyana and haiti ) , disaster and reconstruction assistance in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms in 2004 , and increased support for the interim government in haiti following the departure of president jean - bertrand aristide from power . haiti accounted for some 51% of assistance to the caribbean region during this period . as in the 1990s , the bulk of assistance to the region consisted of economic assistance . with regard to hurricane disaster assistance , congress appropriated $100 million in october 2004 in emergency assistance for caribbean nations ( p.l . 108-324 ) , with $42 million for grenada , $38 million for haiti , $18 million for jamaica , and $2 million for other countries affected by the storms . overall assistance to the caribbean amounted to $393 million in fy2005 and an estimated $306 million in fy2006 ( see table 5 ) . for fy2007 , the administration has requested about $322 million in assistance for the caribbean , with about $198 million or almost 62% of the total for haiti , $35 million for the dominican republic , $31 million for guyana , and almost $17 million for jamaica . assistance to the small nations of the eastern caribbean ( antigua and barbuda , barbados dominica , grenada , st. kitts and nevis , st. lucia , and st. vincent and the grenadines ) is provided through usaid's caribbean regional program , which also funds some region - wide projects ; for fy2007 , the administration requested $11.6 million for the program . the eastern caribbean would also receive about $1.5 million in military assistance and $3.2 million to support a peace corps presence . the request of $3 million for the "third border initiative" ( tbi ) would fund regional projects for the 14-nation caribbean community ( caricom ) plus the dominican republic that focus on improving travel and border security in the region , disaster preparedness , and greater business competitiveness . a request of $4 million for operation enduring friendship , a military assistance program , would support efforts to increase maritime security in the dominican republic , honduras , panama , the bahamas , and jamaica . ( see tables 5 and 6 ) . looking ahead to future years , several caribbean nations are potential recipients for millennium challenge account ( mca ) assistance , an initiative to target foreign assistance to countries with strong records of performance in the areas of governance , economic policy , and investment in people . although haiti and guyana have been candidate countries potentially eligible for mca funds since fy2004 ( because of low per capita income levels ) , neither country has been approved to participate in the program because they have not met mca performance criteria . guyana , however , was designated an mca threshold country for fy2005 and fy2006 and could be approved in future years for mca funding .
