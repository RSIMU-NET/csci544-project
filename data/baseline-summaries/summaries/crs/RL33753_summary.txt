appendix a . criticism of deepwater management in 2007 overall management of program many observers in 2007 believed the problems experienced in the three deepwater cutter acquisition efforts were the product of broader problems in the coast guard's overall management of the deepwater program . reports and testimony in 2007 and prior years from the dhs ig and gao , as well as a february 2007 dau "quick look study" requested by the coast guard expressed serious concerns about the coast guard's overall management of the deepwater program . some observers expressed the view that using a private - sector lsi to implement the deepwater program made a complex program more complex , and set the stage for waste , fraud , and abuse by effectively outsourcing oversight of the program to the private sector and by creating a conflict of interest for the private sector in executing the program . other observers , including gao and the dau , expressed the view that using a private - sector lsi is a basically valid approach , but that the contract the coast guard used to implement the approach for the deepwater program was flawed in various ways , undermining the coast guard's ability to assess contractor performance , control costs , ensure accountability , and conduct general oversight of the program . observers raised various issues about the deepwater contract . among other things , they expressed concern that the contract was an indefinite delivery , indefinite quantity ( id / iq ) contract , which , they said , can be an inappropriate kind of contract for a program like the deepwater program . observers also expressed concern that the contract transferred too much authority to the private - sector lsi for defining performance specifications , for subsequently modifying them , and for making technical judgements ; permitted the private - sector lsi to certify that certain performance goals had been met â€” so - called self - certification , which , critics argue , can equate to no meaningful certification ; provided the coast guard with insufficient authority over the private - sector lsi for resolving technical disputes between the coast guard and the private - sector lsi ; was vaguely worded with regard to certain operational requirements and technical specifications , reducing the coast guard's ability to assess performance and ensure that the program would achieve coast guard goals ; permitted the firms making up the private - sector lsi to make little use of competition between suppliers in selecting products to be used in the deepwater program , to tailor requirements to fit their own products , and consequently to rely too much on their own products , as opposed to products available from other manufacturers ; permitted the private - sector lsi's performance during the first five - year period to be scored in a way that did not sufficiently take into account recent problems in the cutter acquisition efforts ; permitted award fees and incentive fees ( i.e. , bonuses ) to be paid to the private - sector lsi on the basis of "attitude and effort" rather than successful outcomes ; and lacked sufficient penalties and exit clauses .
