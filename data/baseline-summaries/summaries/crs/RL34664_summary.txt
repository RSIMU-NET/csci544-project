4213 that was offered by senator reid . the law only affects those people who would have qualified for the credit if they had completed their purchase before july 1 , 2010 . this means that before may 1 , 2010 , they must have entered into a binding contract to purchase a residence and that contract must have called for closing before july 1 , 2010 . those who had such contracts , but were unable to close on the sales by june 30 , 2010 , are allowed to close before october 1 , 2010 , and treat the purchase as if it had occurred before july 1 , 2010 . the new law modifies a provision of the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-92 ) that extended the eligible dates of purchase to include purchases before may 1 , 2010 , as well as those that were under a binding contract on that date if the contract provided for closing the sale before july 1 , 2010 , and the sale was completed before that date . previously , there had been no exception that allowed closing after the statutory deadline for the purchase . the credit was created in 2008 as part of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-289 ) in response to the housing crisis in 2007 and 2008 . as originally enacted , the credit was available only for purchases made after april 8 , 2008 , and before july 1 , 2009 . the credit also had two characteristics that made it unlike most other tax credits â€” it was refundable , and it was repayable ; however , the repayment requirement was subject to certain exceptions . the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ) modified the first - time homebuyer tax credit for those taxpayers purchasing principal residences in 2009 , increasing the amount of the credit , extending the eligible purchase dates through november 30 , 2009 , and generally eliminating the repayment provision for purchases after 2008 . in addition to extending the eligible dates of purchase and allowing an additional two months in which to complete the purchase , the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 expanded the statutory definition of "first - time homebuyer" by introducing an exception for those who have owned and used the same residence as their principal residence for any period of five consecutive years during the eight - year period that ends on the date they purchase a subsequent property to use as their principal residence . these "long - time residents" generally are treated as first - time residents ; however , their credit is capped at $6,500 . 111-92 also raised the income limitation for all qualifying purchases , making more buyers eligible to claim the full credit . however , the law imposed new restrictions on qualifying for the credit . for purchases after november 6 , 2009 , property costing more than $800,000 is no longer eligible for the credit . eligible purchasers must be at least 18 years old and cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's tax return .
