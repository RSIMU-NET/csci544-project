embraer . the embraer 190 e - jet has 98-114 seats , while the larger embraer 195 e - jet has 108-122 seats . the first delivery of the e - 190 was made in 2005 and the e - 195 in 2006 . both planes are comparable to small mainline jets and , together with the embraer 170 / 175 e - jets , were designed specifically to fill what embraer executives believed to be a gap in the 70-120 seat jet market . the embraer e - jets represented a sharp departure from the rjs on which embraer had built its reputation . embraer used the e190 and e195 to beat bombardier to market with a product that upstaged regional jets of comparable size . by the end of 2010 , 266 e - 190s had been delivered to low - cost carriers , u.s. legacy airlines , and foreign airlines , with a firm order backlog of 157 planes . during the same period , 61 e - 195s were delivered , with a firm backlog of 41 planes . embraer's chief competitor , bombardier , delivered its first 100-seat crj - 1000 regional jet ( a stretched crj - 900 ) in december 2010 . as of january 2011 , bombardier had delivered 9 crj - 1000s and had firm orders for another 40 . whether the bombardier cseries will lead embraer to develop a larger plane is uncertain at this point . nevertheless , some have speculated that embraer could develop a new plane in response to bombardier's challenge to embraer's e - jet series . comac c919 . the comac c919 is frequently compared to the airbus a320 , possibly because airbus has been assembling a320s and a319s in china since 2008 , in partnership with avic . it is not clear whether regional jets will remain a focus for comac , because most forecasts do not anticipate much growth in the chinese rj market . large regional jet . one regional aircraft , the japanese mitsubishi regional jet ( dubbed the "mrj" ) ( a 70-90 seat plane ) , appears to be primarily aimed at the bombardier / embraer rj duopoly . the decision by airbus and boeing to put new high efficiency engines on their planes will provide airlines with upgraded products that have a reputation for dependability . although bombardier , comac , and irkut are building narrow - bodies that represent a more radical departure from the 737 and a320 , their programs are inherently riskier and have not yet demonstrated that the promised benefits can be delivered . many airlines may decide to stay with aircraft that they know . it is too soon to know whether the newcomers will succeed . bombardier and embraer have established themselves as successful aircraft manufacturers and the chinese appear to be determined to build a civil aviation industry that competes directly with boeing and airbus . whether the russians will succeed in building civil aircraft capable of competing in international markets remains to be seen . the superjet 100 has a capacity of 86-103 passengers , depending on its seating configuration .
