the statutory debt limit applies to almost all federal debt . the committees on appropriations have special responsibilities regarding discretionary spending , and authorizing committees are generally responsible for mandatory program spending decisions , while committees on the budget are tasked with drafting an overall budgetary framework that specifies aggregate levels for federal spending and taxation . while those committees often incorporate views of other committees and members , measures involving the debt limit often provide individual members not belonging to those committees with a separate instrument to influence federal fiscal policy . during the four years ( fy1998-fy2001 ) the government ran surpluses , federal debt held by intergovernmental accounts grew by $855 billion and debt held by the public fell by almost $450 billion . since fy2001 , however , debt held by the public has grown due to persistent and substantial budget deficits . debt held in government accounts also has grown , in large part because social security payroll taxes have exceeded payments of beneficiaries . table 1 shows components of debt in current dollars and as percentages of gross domestic product ( gdp ) since fy1996 . figure 1 shows the components of federal debt as shares of gross domestic product ( gdp ) from fy1940 through fy2014 , along with administration projections through fy2019 . table 2 provides information on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014 . federal debt held by government accounts has grown steadily since 1982 , in part due to increases in social security taxes passed following recommendations of the 1983 greenspan commission , and reflecting the transition of the baby boom generation into its peak earnings years . debt held by the public , which changes in response to total surpluses or deficits , grew as a share of gdp through the mid - 1990s . after fy1992 , deficits shrank , and from fy1998 through fy2001 the federal government ran surpluses . those surpluses , along with rapid gdp growth , reduced debt held by the public as a percentage of gdp . when large deficits returned and gdp growth slowed in the early 2000s , debt held by the public as a share of gdp again increased . the 2011 debt limit episode was longer and more contentious compared to those that preceded it . the 2011 episode was resolved by passage of the budget control act of 2011 , which reinstated statutory caps on discretionary spending and created other means of constraining federal spending . this section provides a brief summary of debt limit policy developments after 2011 . a more extensive analysis of recent debt limit developments since 2012 can be found in crs report r43389 , the debt limit since 2011 , by [author name scrubbed] . from fy1998 through fy2001 , the federal government ran budget surpluses that reduced its debt . in early 2001 , the 10-year budget forecasts projected large and growing surpluses , indicating rapid reduction in debt held by the public . some experts had even expressed concern about consequences of retiring all federal debt held by the public . had such projections been fulfilled , the debt limit issue would have been mooted for the rest of the decade .
