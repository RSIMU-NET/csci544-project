b . the fy2000 military personnel total is inflated to fy2005 prices usingdepartment of defense "deflators," which count military pay raises asinflation . a calculation using different deflators , such as the consumer priceindex , would show a different amount: see figure 2 above . though substantial , these increases are not as large those in the first five yearsof the reagan administration . between fy1980 and fy1985 , the defense budgetgrew by 48% , an average annual increase of 8.1% . moreover , even when funding foroperations in iraq and afghanistan is included , military spending remains relativelylow as a percentage of gdp . the fy2004 budget , including costs of iraq andafghanistan is about 4% of gdp , substantially higher than in fy2000 , but wellbelow what it was in the mid - 1980s , when the cold war was still going on ( see figure c - 1 ) . figure c - 1 . national defense outlays % of gdp , fy1947-fy2009 advocates of higher military spending sometimes point to the long - termdecline in defense as a share of the economy to argue that the nation can easily affordmore . one counter - argument , or at least part of a counter - argument , is that the trendin defense spending is part of a broader long - term trend in the federal budget , inwhich both defense and non - defense discretionary spending have declined whilemandatory programs have grown . as figure c - 2 shows , total federal spending hasbeen remarkably stable at about 20% of gdp over the past 40 years . so to increasedefense substantially as a share of the economy would require either an increase intotal federal spending as a share of gdp or offsetting reductions elsewhere . figure c - 2 . federal outlays % of gdp , fy1962-fy2009 after fy2005 , the administration defense plan , again not includingwar - related supplementals , calls for fairly modest increases in the defense budgetaveraging a bit over 2% per year above inflation . table c - 2 shows the trend . table c - 2 . administration projections for thenational defense budget function , fy2005-fy2009 ( budget authority in billions of current and constantfy2005 dollars ) source: crs calculations using deflators from department of defense comptroller . table 1a . status of fy2005 defense appropriations , h.r.4613 note: in floor action , the senate substituted its version of the bill , s. 2559 , into h.r . table 1b . the full committeemarked up the bill on june 16 and reported h.r . 4613 on june 18 ( h.rept . the full house debated and passed the bill by a vote of 403-17 on june 22 . 4200 ) was announced . the house approved the conferencereport ( by a vote of 359-14 ) on october 8 , and the senate approved it ( by unanimous consent ) onoctober 9 . the president signed the bill into law ( p.l . 108-375 ) on october 28 . 4613 , asamended , by a vote of 98-0 . a conference report was filed on july 20 , 2004 ( h.rept . 108-622 ) andapproved both in the house and in the senate on july 22 .
