dry . based on data for dry years between 1962 and 2003 , estimated average annual reductions in contract water supplies for like years could be 136 taf ( steiner 2005 , see figure a - 8 ) or 181 taf ( bor 2006 ) , which could represent an average reduction of 18% or 25% of annual contract water supplies . the steiner 2005 data in table a - 2 shows that the variation in the volume of the reduction and the significance of the reduction as a percentage of water supply would vary for dry years , from 9 taf to 238 taf and from 2% to 33% . critical high . there was only one critical high year between 1962 and 2003 — 1976 ; based on the limited available data , estimated contract water supplies reductions could be 71 taf ( bor 2006 ) or 108 taf ( steiner 2005 , see figure a - 8 ) , which could represent 12% or 17% of annual water supplies . in critical high years , class i water might be reduced on average by 12% to 17% . generally no class ii water is supplied in critical high years with or without the restoration flows called for in the settlement . therefore , for critical high years , generally there is no expected reduction in class ii water resulting from the settlement . ( see figure a - 8 ) . some critical high years without the settlement could have § 215 water according to steiner 2005 ; these § 215 deliveries generally would not be made under the settlement . steiner 2005 modeled 1976 to have 11 taf of § 215 water without the settlement , and no § 215 water with the settlement . critical low . no restoration releases are to be made in critical low years , thus there generally would be no changes to friant division water supplies under the settlement ( see figures a - 3 , a - 4 , and a - 8 ) . to summarize , within each water year type , variation could exist in the quantity and percent reduction in friant division water supplies for different contract types ( see table a - 2 and figure a - 8 ) . it is unknown whether reclamation would try to ( or could ) limit this annual variation . appendix a . analysis of existing water supply impacts data introduction to the analysis and summary of results the settlement would use san joaquin river water , which in recent history has been diverted and delivered to friant division contractors for off - stream uses , to maintain in - stream flows in the san joaquin river for fish restoration . the settlement would reduce friant water deliveries to water districts absent offsetting measures . that is , the settlement would redistribute a portion of the annual water supply away from agricultural and municipal water districts to achieve the restoration flows ( based on hydrographs ) agreed to under the settlement . in a given year , how much less water would be available for off - stream uses in the friant division service area would depend largely on how much water would be released for fish restoration .
