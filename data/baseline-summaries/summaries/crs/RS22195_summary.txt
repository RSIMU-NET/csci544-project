the social security amendments of 1972 , p.l . 92-603 , extended medicare to persons with disabilities who had been entitled to social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) benefits for at least 24 consecutive months . more than 43% of disabled beneficiaries were between the ages 55 and 64 . more men ( 53.3% ) than women ( 46.7% ) received this benefit and the vast majority ( 73.5% ) were white . the provision required the waiting period to begin with the first month of ssdi entitlement , which is five months after the onset of the disability . costs varied substantially by diagnostic group and by whether the person died or recovered during the waiting period . on average , beneficiaries who died during the waiting period were estimated to cost $25,864 , whereas those who recovered were estimated to cost $1,506 . according to research based on new ssdi beneficiaries in 1995 who qualified upon their own work record , 11.8% died within the waiting period , 2.1% recovered , and 86.1% became entitled to medicare . the study estimated hypothetical medicare costs for the first 24 months of ssdi entitlement to be $10,055 in 2000 dollars per person . one research study suggested that eliminating the 24-month medicare waiting period would cost $5.3 billion while another study estimated the cost at $8.7 billion . the differences in the estimates are because: ( 1 ) the $5.3 billion used 2000 dollars while the $8.7 billion is in 2002 dollars: ( 2 ) the $5.3 billion estimate is for only ssdi beneficiaries that qualified under their own work record while the $8.7 billion estimate includes disabled adult children and disabled widow ( er ) s ; and ( 3 ) each used substantially different estimation methodologies . neither of these estimates include the cost of the prescription drug benefit that started in january 2006 . in 2002 , approximately 40% of ssdi beneficiaries in the medicare waiting period were enrolled in medicaid . one study estimated that the federal government would save $2.5 billion in medicaid if the 24-month waiting period was eliminated ; however , these federal medicaid savings would more than be offset by the aforementioned cost increases to the medicare program . table 1 shows the number and percentage of persons under 65 years old who received medicare in july 2005 due to disabling conditions . in 2006 , just over 7 million beneficiaries under the age of 65 received medicare on account of disability status . additionally , the states would realize $1.8 billion in medicaid savings if the waiting period was eliminated . the two - year waiting period applies and starts when an individual turns 18 or when he or she is determined to be disabled if it is after age 18 . a spouse or child may be eligible for medicare , based on a worker's record , if the spouse or child is on continuing dialysis for esrd or has a kidney transplant , even if no other family member participates in the medicare program . ssdi beneficiaries are also eligible for voluntary prescription drug benefits ( part d ) .
