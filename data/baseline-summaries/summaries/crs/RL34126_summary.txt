the 2002 farm bill ( p.l . section 6011 amends the current interest rate schedule for water and waste water loans by setting rates to a proportion of a municipal bond index . section 6006 reauthorizes the rural water and wastewater circuit rider program , which provides technical assistance to rural water systems . funding is authorized at $25 million annually ( fy2008-2012 ) . how can federal policies better assist entrepreneurial efforts in rural communities ? how might the biofuels emphasis in the upcoming farm bill be connected to rural development programs ? more than 88 programs administered by 16 different federal agencies target rural economic development . the rural development policy act of 1980 ( p.l . 96-355 ) , however , named usda as the lead federal agency for rural development . usda administers most of the existing rural development programs and has the highest average of program funds going directly to rural counties ( approximately 50% ) . three agencies are responsible for usda's rural development mission area: the rural housing service ( rhs ) , the rural business - cooperative service ( rbs ) , and the rural utilities service ( rus ) . an office of community development provides community development support through rural development's field offices . it is important to note that most loan and grant programs administered by usda rural development are funded through annual ( discretionary ) appropriations . the rural development title of omnibus farm bills does not address every program administered by the three usda mission agencies . many of these programs are "permanently" authorized , often through amendments to the consolidated farm and rural development act of 1972 ( the conact , p.l . 87-128 ) or the rural electrification act of 1936 and are funded through annual appropriations . the 1996 farm bill ( p.l . 104-127 ) authorized the first provision in the rural development title funded by mandatory spending , the fund for rural america , which expired in 2002 . 107-171 ) authorized six new programs supported through mandatory spending . mandatory funding for most of these programs , however , was largely blocked by appropriators between 2002 and 2007 . several of the programs were funded instead through discretionary appropriations , although in amounts less than the original authorization . the 2008 farm bill has several provisions supported by mandatory spending , although in lesser amounts than were proposed in the house and senate - passed versions of the farm bill . several programs authorized in the 2002 farm bill are reauthorized in the two bills . the appendix provides a complete side - by - side comparison of current law with the provisions in the house and senate bills and the enacted bill . unlike the 2002 farm bill , the rural development provisions of p.l . 110-246 contain only three programs with mandatory funding: value - added product grants ( $15 million ) ; the microenterprise assistance program ( $15 million ) ; and a one - time funding of pending water and waste water projects ( $120 million ) . several programs that were authorized to receive mandatory funding in the 2002 farm bill were reauthorized in p.l .
