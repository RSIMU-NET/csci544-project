transparency . information about certain parts of the small refinery exemption process is limited . for example , it is unclear who is applying for an exemption , what specific information is included in an sre application , or how an application is evaluated . further , it is not clear if the same criteria to evaluate an application are used consistently year - to - year . lastly , epa does not regularly announce when it has issued an sre . the statute does not require epa to share such information publicly . epa considers an sre application to contain confidential business information as it includes proprietary information which if disclosed could cause harm to the applicant . epa states that it "treats both the names of individual petitioners and epa's decisions on those individual petitions as confidential business information ( cbi ) under foia exemption 4 ( 5 u.s.c . â§â 522 ( b ) ( 4 ) ) pending a final cbi determination by the office of general counsel. with such transparency issues , it could be difficult for congress to conduct oversight of epa's authority to grant small refinery exemptions . application and decision timeline . small refinery exemptions are not applied for or granted on a schedule . a small refinery may petition the epa for an exemption at any time . in theory , once an exemption is issued for a certain year , the small refinery is no longer obligated to meet its rvo for that year . in actuality , the small refinery may not be able to receive the benefit of the exemption for the year it was granted ( eg , if an sre is granted after the end of a compliance period and the small refinery has already complied with its obligation ) . instead , in some cases the small refinery has been credited the rins it retired to demonstrate compliance with the year that was exempted , and it may use those rins in a future year . also , it is not clear what information must be submitted to epa for the agency to consider a petition "complete"âwhich would start the 90-day timeline for epa to make a decision . the current application and decision timeline for small refinery exemptions may contribute to an ultimate annual volume requirement that may not match what was announced in a final rule . inclusion of sres in annual standards . the statute requires the epa administrator to adjust the percentage standards ( i.e. , annual volume amounts ) for a given year by accounting for renewable fuel from the previous calendar year by small refineries that received an exemption . epa accounts for volumes attributable to exempt small refineries in its formula for calculating the annual percentage standards . epa complies with this provision through the rin trading program . because sre petitions can be submitted at any time , epa has two time periods during which it may address sres in annual standard calculations: prior to a final rule being issued and after a final rule has been issued . epa reports in its annual rulemaking if it has approved any sres prior to issuing a final rule and adjusted its calculation accordingly .
