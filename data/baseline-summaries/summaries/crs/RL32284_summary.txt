that commitment has led to some successes . more than three million families are able to obtain safe and decent housing through the program , at a cost to the family that is considered affordable . however , these successes come at a high cost to the federal government . given current budget deficit levels , congress has begun to reevaluate whether the cost of the section 8 programs , particularly the voucher program , are worth their benefits . proposals to reform the program abound , and whether the current section 8 programs are maintained largely in their current form , changed substantially , or eliminated altogether are questions currently facing congress . the 1974 act and the creation of section 8 effectively ended the nixon moratorium . in 1978 , the moderate rehabilitation component of the program was added , but it has not been funded since 1989 . in 1983 , the new construction and substantial rehabilitation portions of the program were repealed , and a new component — section 8 vouchers — was added . in 1998 , existing housing certificates were merged with and converted to vouchers . today's section 8 program is really two programs , which , combined , serve almost 3.5 million households . the combined section 8 programs are the largest direct housing assistance program for low - income families . with a combined fy2013 budget of $27 billion , they reflect a major commitment of federal resources . the most rapid cost increases have been seen in the voucher program . partly out of concern about cost increases , and partly in response to the administrative complexity of the current program , there have been calls for reform of the voucher program and its funding each year since 2002 . in response , congress has enacted changes to the way that it funds the voucher program and the way that phas receive their funding . congress has considered program reforms , but has not enacted them . in order to understand why the program has become so expensive and why reforms are being considered , it is first important to understand the mechanics of the program and its history . this paper will provide an overview of the section 8 programs and their history . for more information , see crs report rl33929 , the section 8 voucher renewal funding formula: changes in appropriations acts ; crs report rl34002 , section 8 housing choice voucher program: issues and reform proposals ; and crs report r41182 , preservation of hud - assisted housing , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . the section 8 program is named for section 8 of the united states housing act of 1937 . the original program , established by the housing and community development act of 1974 ( p.l . 93-383 ) , consisted of three parts: new construction , substantial rehabilitation , and existing housing certificates . the rental assistance programs authorized under section 8 of the united states housing act of 1937 ( 42 u.s.c .
