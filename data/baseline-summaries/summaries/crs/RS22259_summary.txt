the same is true in most if not all of the states . 3199 as reported by the house judiciary committee amended section 1001 of the usa patriot act by directing periodic review of the exercise of the authority under section 3144 . in its original form section 1001 instructs the justice department inspector general to designate an official who is ( 1 ) to receive and review complaints of alleged justice department civil rights and civil liberties violations , ( 2 ) to widely advertise his availability to receive such complaints , and ( 3 ) to report to the house and senate judiciary committees twice a year on implementation of that requirement , p.l . 107 - 56 , 115 stat . section 12 amended section 1001 to impose additional responsibilities upon the inspector general's designee , i.e. , ( 1 ) to "review detentions of persons under section 3144 of title 18 , united states code , including their length , conditions of access to counsel , frequency of access to counsel , offense at issue , and frequency of appearances before a grand jury," ( 2 ) to advertise his availability to receive information concerning such activity , and ( 3 ) to report twice a year on implementation to the judiciary committees on implementation of this requirement . although subject to intermittent criticism , it has been so at least from the beginning of the republic . the supreme court has never squarely considered the constitutionality of the federal statute or any of its predecessors , but it has observed in passing that , "[t]he duty to disclose knowledge of crime ... is so vital that one known to be innocent may be detained in the absence of bail , as a material witness" and that , "[t]he constitutionality of this [federal material witness] statute apparently has never been doubted. in spite of the concerns of some that the authority can be used as a means to jail a suspect while authorities seek to discover probable cause sufficient to support a criminal accusation or as a preventive detention measure , the lower courts have denied that the federal material witness statute can be used as a substitute for a criminal arrest warrant . particularly in the early stages of an investigation , however , an individual's proximity to a crime may make him both a legitimate witness and a legitimate suspect . the case law and statistical information suggest that the federal statute is used with surprising regularity and most often in the prosecution of immigration offenses involving material witnesses who are foreign nationals . critics , however , contend that since september 11 , 2001 , seventy individuals , mostly muslims , have been arrested and detained in abuse of the statute's authority . an arrest warrant for a witness with evidence material to a federal criminal proceeding may be issued by federal or state judges or magistrates . the statute applies to potential grand jury witnesses as well as to potential trial witnesses . section 3144 on its face authorizes arrest at the behest of any party to a criminal proceeding . in the case of criminal trial , both the government and the defendants may call upon the benefits of section 3144 .
