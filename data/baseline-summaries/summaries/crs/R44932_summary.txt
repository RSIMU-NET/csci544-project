the number of active permits averaged 6,601 . as with the number of permittees , the number of active permits decreased steadily over the 11-year period , as shown in figure 3 . as noted above , fs administers grazing in terms of hd - mos , defined as the time in months that livestock spend on fs land . columns 3 and 4 of table 2 provide data on hd - mos . figure 4 illustrates the changes in the numbers of hd - mos under permit and hd - mos authorized from fy2002 to fy2016 . as shown in column 3 of table 2 , the number of hd - mos under permit — the maximum number that could have been authorized for use — was 18.4% less in fy2016 than in fy2002 . this was the largest change in the fs data categories examined . there was a high of 10.1 million hd - mos under permit in fy2002 and a low of 8.2 million in fy2006 , a difference of nearly 1.9 million . the average number of hd - mos under permit was 8.7 million annually . there was significant annual variation in the data , particularly during the first four years of the 15-year period , as shown in figure 4 . the number of hd - mos that were actually authorized and billed for was 1.1% higher in fy2016 than in fy2002 ( see column 4 of table 2 ) . over the 15 years , hd - mos ranged from a high of 7.3 million in fy2010 to a low of 5.1 million in fy2009 , a difference of 2.2 million . although the average was 6.5 million per year , the number of hd - mos authorized varied widely over the period , as shown in figure 4 . during the first several years ( fy2002-fy2009 ) , the figures averaged 6.1 million annually . since fy2010 , the average has increased to 6.9 million annually . there are similarities in the blm and fs livestock data over the 15-year period examined . for instance , both agencies had more grazing permits than livestock operators or permittees , because some operators and permittees held more than one permit . the average number of operators annually was 15,755 . during the 15-year period , the highest number of operators was 16,416 in fy2006 , the only year in which the figure exceeded 16,000 . there was a difference of 954 between this high year and the lowest level of 15,462 in fy2005 . as shown in table 1 , column 2 , the number of permits and leases held by livestock operators was 1.7% lower in fy2016 than in fy2002 . during the 15-year period , the greatest number of permits and leases was 18,142 in fy2002 . there was a difference of 448 between that high year and the lowest year during the period — fy2011 — when there were 17,694 permits and leases . the average number of permits and leases was 17,852 annually . figure 1 illustrates the changes in the numbers of blm livestock operators and grazing permits and leases from fy2002 to fy2016 .
