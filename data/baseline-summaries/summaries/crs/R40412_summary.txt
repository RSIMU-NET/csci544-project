1 were identical . the enacted law ( ยง1101 ) would extend the placed - in - service date for wind facilities for three years , through the end of 2012 . for other qualifying resource facilities ( closed - loop biomass , open - loop biomass , geothermal , small irrigation , incremental hydropower , landfill gas , municipal waste , and marine / hydrokinetic ) , the ptc would be extended through the end of 2013 . the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) estimates the cost at $13.1 billion over 10 years . the renewable energy industry found that current market conditions have created an uncertain future tax position for potential investors in ptc - supported projects , making financing difficult . as a temporary alternative to the ptc , the house proposed ( sec . 1602 ) that ptc - eligible facilities that are placed in service in 2009 and 2010 would be allowed to choose a 30% investment tax credit ( itc ) in place of the production credit . the senate provision ( sec . 1102 ) was identical , except that it would set the same expiration dates as those set for the ptc ( sec . 1101 ) , namely , a four - year period ( through the end of 2012 ) for wind facilities and a five - year period ( through the end of 2013 ) for other renewable energy facilities . the law follows the senate proposal . jct estimates the cost at $285 million over 10 years . [note: subtitle g has a provision regarding a temporary program for grants in place of the ptc and itc programs. under previous law , the itc had to be reduced if the qualifying property was also financed with industrial development bonds ( idbs ) or with any other federal , state , or local subsidized financing program . the house proposed ( sec . 1603b ) to repeal that limit on the itc , allowing businesses and individuals to qualify for the full itc even if the property is financed with idbs or other subsidized financing . the senate provision ( sec . 1103b ) was identical to the house proposal , as is the law ( ยง1103b ) . the jct cost estimate is included as part of the estimated cost of the next provision . under previous law , businesses were allowed to claim a 30% tax credit for qualified small wind - energy property ( capped at $4,000 ) and individuals were allowed to claim a 30% tax credit for qualified solar water - heating property ( capped at $2,000 ) , qualified small wind - energy property ( capped $4,000 ) , and qualified geothermal heat pumps ( capped at $2,000 ) . the house ( sec , 1603a ) proposed to repeal all of the dollar caps . the senate provision ( sec . 1103a ) was identical , as is the law ( ยง1103a ) . jct estimates the cost at $604 million over 10 years . the house provision ( sec . 1611 ) , senate provision ( sec . 1111 ) , and conference provision ( ยง1111 ) are identical .
