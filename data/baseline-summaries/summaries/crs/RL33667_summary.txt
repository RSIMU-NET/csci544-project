the bill specifically addressed road examinations and surveys . in his signing statement president jackson declared that the road in question , which was to reach from detroit to chicago , should not extend beyond the territory of michigan . a subsequently issued house report criticized jackson's action , characterizing it as in effect constituting a line item veto . likewise , a signing statement issued by president tyler in 1842 expressing doubts about the constitutionality of a bill regarding the apportionment of congressional districts was characterized by a select committee of the house as "a defacement of the public records and archives. perhaps sensitized by this rebuke , presidents polk and pierce apologized for the issuance of signing statements , noting that such action departed from the traditional practice of notifying congress of the approval of a bill via an oral message from the president's private secretary . this conception of a signing statement as an unusual instrument was again noted by president grant in 1875 , when he declared that his use of a signing statement was an "unusual method of conveying the notice of approval. signing statements remained comparatively rare through the end of the 19 th century , but had become common instruments by 1950 . president truman , for instance , issued nearly 16 signing statements per year , on average , with the figure steadily increasing up to the modern day . concurrent with the rise in the number of statements issued , the use of signing statements to voice constitutional objections to acts of congress has become increasingly prevalent over the past 60 years . this type of executive action began in earnest during the reagan administration , as one aspect of a comprehensive strategy employed by the reagan administration to assert aggressively the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency . as has been illustrated , there is a long history of presidential issuance of signing statements . these statements provide "one way in which a president may indicate his intent to refuse to enforce a provision of a congressionally enacted law that he believes to be unconstitutional. however , there is little evident support for the notion that objections or concerns raised in a signing statement may be given substantive legal effect . as one commentator has suggested: "where the president has played a major role in drafting or supporting a particular statutory provision , presidential statements should be granted interpretive significance... . when the president opposed the provision being interpreted , however , his signing statements ... lack persuasive authority. this observation is buttressed by the analysis of the district court in dacosta v. nixon , which stated that a bill , when passed by congress and approved by the president , "establishe[s] 'the policy of the united states' to the exclusion of any different executive or administrative policy , and ha[s] binding force and effect on every officer of the government , no matter what their private judgments of that policy , and illegalize[s] the pursuit of an inconsistent executive or administration policy . no executive statement denying efficacy to legislation could have either validity or effect. irrespective of this maxim , presidents have repeatedly declared their intention to disregard laws that they view as unconstitutional .
