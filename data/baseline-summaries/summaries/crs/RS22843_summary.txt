here is an example of how the provider tax arrangements operated in the 1980s . in this example , a state with a 60% fmap imposes a provider tax on all nursing homes in the state , and the state collects $10 million in tax revenue through this provider tax . the state then increases medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes , which means nursing homes with medicaid enrollees receive an additional $8 million . with these medicaid expenditures , the state draws down $4.8 million ( 60% of $8 million ) in federal medicaid matching funds . in this example , the state was able to increase medicaid payment rates to nursing homes without the use of any state general funds , and the state is left with $6.8 million to use for other medicaid or non - medicaid purposes . in sfy2016 , 49 states and the district of columbia are using at least one provider tax to help finance medicaid . while federal requirements allow states to impose taxes on 19 classes of providers , the classes of providers that are most often taxed include nursing facilities , hospitals , and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities ( icf / id ) . detail regarding the types of provider taxes used by each state is provided in table a - 1 of the appendix . limiting or eliminating states' use of provider taxes in financing medicaid has been identified as a way to reduce federal medicaid spending . a few years ago , there were a few proposals to limit or eliminate states' use of provider taxes , but provider tax proposals had not been discussed in the past couple years . however , recently , the house energy and commerce committee marked up a bill ( h.r . 4725 ) that includes a medicaid provider tax provision . proposals to limit states' ability to use provider taxes in financing the state share of medicaid expenditures usually focus on lowering the threshold for provider taxes , which would decrease federal medicaid payments to states . this would effectively shift more of the medicaid program's growing costs to the states . as a result , states would have to weigh the impact of maintaining current medicaid reimbursement and / or service levels against other state priorities for spending . they could choose to constrain medicaid expenditures by reducing provider payment rates , limiting benefit packages , or restricting eligibility . these types of programmatic changes could also affect access to and the quality of medical care for medicaid enrollees . for example , if states reduced the medicaid reimbursement rates to providers , such as hospitals , physician , and nursing homes , these providers may be less willing to accept medicaid patients . below are short descriptions of the past proposals impacting medicaid provider taxes and the most recent proposal to limits states' use of provider taxes . the president's fy2013 budget proposal included a provision to phase down the medicaid provider tax threshold from the current level of 6% to 3.5% from fy2015 to fy2017 . the president's budget estimated that this proposal would reduce federal medicaid expenditures by $21.8 billion from fy2015 through fy2022 .
