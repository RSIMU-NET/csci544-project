double - dip recessions are rare . there are only two modern examples of a double - dip recession for the united states: the recession of 1937-1938 and the recession of 1981-1982 . they both have the common attribute of resulting from a change in economic policy . however , in the first case , recession was an unintended consequence of the policy change ; in the second case , recession was an intended consequence of the policy change . both point to the importance of policy persistence in overcoming difficult economic circumstances . for the u.s. economy , the annual rate of growth of real gdp in the early years of recovery from a recession has typically been above its long - term trend rate of growth ( real gdp advancing at a 2.5% to 3.0% annual rate ) . historically , there has been what is termed a "snap back" relationship between the severity of the recession and the strength of the subsequent recovery . in other words , a sharp contraction is followed by a robust recovery tracing out a v - shaped pattern of growth . having deferred spending during the contraction , households and businesses have typically increased purchases quickly as economic conditions improved . excess capacity and high unemployment generated during the recession typically means that for the near term the normal supply constraints do not apply , allowing the economy to grow faster than its long - term trend . the more slack , the greater the possibility for above normal growth . as the recovery matures and the economy approaches full employment and high rates of capacity utilization , growth slows to the economy's trend rate of growth that is governed by growth of the labor force and productivity . prior to the recent recession , the three sharpest contractions , as measured by the cumulative fall of real gdp , occurred in the recessions of 1981-1982 , 1973-1975 , and 1957-1958 . in 1981-1982 , the cumulative decline of real gdp was 2.7% and the increase in the first year of recovery was 7.7% ; in 1973-1975 , the cumulative decline was 2.8% and the subsequent increase was 6.1% ; in 1957-1958 , the cumulative decline was 3.7% and subsequent increase was 9.5% . the current recovery has not followed this pattern , however . the contraction was sharp , but recovery has been slow and uneven . over an 18-month contraction , real gdp fell 5.1% , a post - war record . in the recovery's first year , real gdp growth averaged 3.3% , slow in comparison to other post - war recoveries , but fast enough to slowly reduce the unemployment rate . in the recovery's second year , growth decelerated to a much slower 1.6% average rate , a pace too slow to prevent the unemployment rate from rising . as the recovery entered its third year in the third quarter of 2011 , growth of real gdp occurred at a relatively weak 2.0% annual rate .
