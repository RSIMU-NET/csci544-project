reductions have not been uniform among programs . the largest mandatory program , the crp , has not been limited in any way by appropriators since the 2002 farm bill was enacted . the second - largest program , eqip , has absorbed the largest reductions from authorized levels , totaling $396 million between fy2003 and fy2006 . funding for a third program , the csp , has been amended four times since 2002 . as initially enacted , it was the first true conservation entitlement program ; that is , any individual who met the eligibility requirements would be accepted into the program . congress has capped csp and then repeatedly reduced the cap to fund other activities , usually disaster assistance . more generally , the table shows that reductions have varied from year to year and program to program since 2002 . at one extreme , the watershed rehabilitation program has received no mandatory funding in any year ( it is one of the five conservation programs authorized to receive discretionary appropriations as well , and those have been provided ) , and at the other extreme , the crp has not been limited in any way . congress has concurred with the administration request some years for some programs . starting in fy2003 , the requested reductions in mandatory funding below the authorized levels ( shown in the table ) , are as follows: in fy2003 , the request was submitted before the farm bill was enacted , and did not include any requests to reduce funding levels . some advocates viewed this change in funding as a major achievement in the 1996 farm bill . amounts authorized for these programs at the time may seem modest when compared with today's levels . programs funded with mandatory funding , and their authorized levels under the 1996 law , included the following: conservation reserve program ( a maximum of 36.4 million acres at any time through fy2002 , with no dollar amount specified ) ; wetland reserve program ( a maximum of 975,000 acres at any time through fy2002 , with no dollar amount specified ) ; environmental quality incentives program ( $130 million in fy1996 , and $200 million annually thereafter through fy2002 ) ; wildlife habitat incentives program ( a total of $50 million between fy1996 and fy2002 ) ; farmland protection program ( a total of $35 million with no time span specified ) ; and conservation farm option ( $7.5 million in fy1997 , increasing each year to a high of $62.5 million in fy2002 ) . the 2002 farm bill greatly expanded mandatory funding for conservation , authorizing the annual funding levels shown in table 1 . mandatory funding was provided both for expiring programs that were reauthorized and for new programs created in the legislation . the increase in authorized funding levels was widely endorsed for many reasons . in each year since fy2002 , annual agriculture appropriations acts have capped funding for some of the mandatory conservation programs below authorized levels . the programs that are limited and the amounts of the limitations change from year to year .
