however , the difference is small . jct estimates that in 2010 , the tax expenditures for qualified hydropower under the ptc are less than $50 million . during 2010 , two awards totaling $88,000 were paid to hydropower facilities under the section 1603 grant program . hydropower has also received less in creb financing than was awarded to solar and wind technologies . during 2010 , the tax expenditure for crebs was an estimated $0.1 billion across all technologies . the majority of energy produced comes from fossil fuels . despite recent reductions in incentives for biofuels , a large share of federal financial incentives for fuels not related to electricity production continued to go to biofuels in 2013 . lower effective tax rates on capital investment can promote investment in certain sectors . the remainder of this section summarizes the results of a 2010 study analyzing energy - related tax incentives and investment . this study uses the 2007 tax code to evaluate its impact on the inventive to invest in different types of energy capital . as was the case with the eia study presented earlier , the effective tax rate analysis here does not incorporate energy tax policy changes under arra . nonetheless , this analysis highlights the incentives for investment created by provisions in the tax code related to energy investment and production . what is an "effective" tax rate the effective tax rates measures the impact of the tax system on investment decisions . in the context of this report , an effective tax rate is defined as . in this equation , is the real before - tax return on the marginal investment and r is the real return paid to investors after taxes . assume that investors require an after - tax rate of return of 6% for a given investment . however , this type of analysis does not indicate whether the distribution of federal financial support across various energy resources is consistent with energy policy goals . coal continues to be the largest fuel source for electricity and receives a relatively small share of federal financial support . in 2013 , 39.0% of generation was from coal , while coal received 6.0% of federal financial incentives . in 2010 , 44.9% of generation was from coal , while coal received 10.0% of the total federal financial support for electricity production . in 2007 , 47.6% of generation was from coal , while 12.7% of total federal financial support for electricity was provided to coal . the shares of electricity produced using natural gas and petroleum liquids has been trending up in recent years , increasing from 22.5% in 2007 , to 25.0% in 2010 , to 28.0% in 2013 . the share of federal financial support for electricity produced using natural gas and petroleum liquids was 3.4% in 2007 , 5.5% in 2010 , and 4.0% in 2013 . the share of electricity produced using nuclear has remained stable between 2007 and 2013 , ranging between 19.4% and 19.6% . between 2010 and 2013 , the estimated share of federal financial support decreased substantially . the share of federal financial assistance for electricity going to nuclear decreased from 21.0% to 10.0% between 2010 and 2013 .
