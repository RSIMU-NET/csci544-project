the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied . it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables . total farm debt is forecast to rise to $409.5 billion in 2018 ( +4.8% ) ( table a - 3 ) . in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities . the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2018 at 13.5% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 26 ) . farm household wealth is derived from a variety of sources . a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its balance sheet of assets and debt . thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of other stakeholders in farming — including landlords and contractors — and because farm operator households often have nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy . average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $111,321 in 2018 ( table a - 2 ) , down 1.9% from 2017 and well below the record of $134,164 in 2014 . about 17% ( $18,637 ) of total farm household income is from farm production activities , and the remaining 83% ( $92,684 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) . the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 27 ) . since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 28 and figure 29 ) . in 2017 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $113,495 was about 27% higher than the average u.s. household income of $89,632 ( table a - 2 ) . usda monthly farm prices received charts the following set of four charts ( figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 ) presents usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commodities — corn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens . the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons . usda farm income data tables three tables at the end of this report ( table a - 1 to table a - 3 ) present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of u.s. agriculture . in addition , table a - 4 presents the annual average farm price received for several major commodities , including the usda forecast for the 2018-2019 marketing year .
