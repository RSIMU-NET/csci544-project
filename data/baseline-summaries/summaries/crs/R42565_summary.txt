authorized by p.l . 106-554 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2001 ( appendix h: the new markets venture capital program act of 2000 ) , the nmvc program is designed to promote economic development and the creation of wealth and job opportunities in low - income geographic areas and among individuals living in such areas by encouraging developmental venture capital investments in smaller enterprises primarily located in such areas ; and address the unmet equity investment needs of small enterprises located in low - income geographic areas . modeled on the sba's small business investment company ( sbic ) program , sba - selected , privately owned and managed nmvc companies provide funding and operational assistance to small businesses . to do so , they use private capital the nmvc company has raised ( called regulatory capital ) and up to 150% of that amount ( called leverage ) from the sale of sba - guaranteed 10-year debentures , or loan obligations , to third parties , subject to the availability of funds . because the sba guarantees the debenture , the sba is able to obtain favorable interest rates . nmvc companies are responsible for meeting the terms and conditions set forth in the debenture . at least 80% of the investments must be in small businesses located in a low - income area , as defined in the statute . specialized small business investment companies ( ssbics ) established under the sbic program are also eligible for nmvc operational assistance grants , which are awarded on a dollar - to - dollar matching basis . six nmvc companies participated in the program . the nmvc program was appropriated $21.952 million in fy2001 to support up to $150 million in sba - guaranteed debentures and up to $30 million for operational assistance grants for fy2001 through fy2006 . the funds were provided in a lump sum in fy2001 and were to remain available until expended . the sba subsequently provided $72.0 million in leverage to nmvc companies in fy2002 and fy2003 ( $12.5 million in fy2002 and $59.5 million in fy2003 ) and $14.4 million for operational assistance grants ( $3.75 million in fy2002 and $10.65 million in fy2003 ) . in 2003 , the unobligated balances of $10.5 million for nmvc debenture subsidies and $13.75 million for operational assistance grants were rescinded . the program continued to operate , with the number and amount of financing declining in recent years as the program's initial investments expired and nmvc companies increasingly engaged only in additional follow - on financings with the small businesses in their portfolios . the nmvc program's active unpaid principal balance ( which is comprised of the sba guaranteed portion and the unguaranteed portion of the nmvc companies' unpaid principal balance ) peaked at $698 million in fy2008 , and then fell each year thereafter until reaching $0 in fy2018 . no bills have been introduced since the 112 th congress concerning the nmvc program . however , more than 30 bills were introduced in previous congresses to either expand or amend the program . many of these bills would have increased the program's funding ( a list and summary of bills introduced by congress to provide the program additional funding appears in the appendix ) .
