other protections . the cftc also requested comments on a range of other potentially significant changes , such as the type and quality of data that ats or hft market participants , if required to register with the cftc , would possibly provide to the commission . in comment letters on the proposal , the mercatus center , a think tank , expressed criticism of the cftc's release , commenting that the self - interest of derivative market participants to help ensure stable markets should generally be sufficient motivation for them to adopt a range of effective risk - control protocols . mercatus also expressed the concern that "if risk control and system testing methods are standardized by regulatory intervention , they essentially become fixed and modifications will generally require either new regulations or exemptions. other commenters engaged in hft had more technical concerns with the cftc release . for instance , the proprietary trading firm citadel commented that if any mandatory minimum "resting periods" for order executions were imposed , that would harm market liquidity by exposing liquidity providers to greater risks and leading to wider bid - ask spreads . the chicago federal reserve bank challenged the belief in the voluntary adoption of risk controls as a solution . in comments to the cftc , it observed , "[m]any industry and regulatory groups have devised best practices for hft . nevertheless , many firms do not fully implement these best practices because they are not required to do so . we believe it would be beneficial for the commission [cftc] to work with the industry to define best practices for hft and to communicate penalties for non - compliance with those best practices. in congressional testimony on may 13 , 2014 , a cftc official noted that the agency had received 43 public comments to the concept release and that commenters had widely divergent opinions regarding the need to regulate hft more closely . for instance , commenters disagreed on the need for the cftc to create a regulatory definition of hft , with just over half of the parties who commented opposed to a definition and the remainder in favor . at the same hearing , mit academic and former cftc chief economist andrei kirilenko noted that the hft industry is highly concentrated and dominated by a small number of fast , opaque firms ( often not registered with federal regulators ) that earned high and persistent returns . he advocated that the cftc create a broad new category of "automated brokers and traders," which would include all active proprietary traders . these traders would be required to register with the cftc and maintain records and an audit trail that regulators could examine in case of a mini - flash crash or technological malfunction , he proposed . kirilenko also urged regulators to examine the root causes of the high level of concentration in the hft industry to determine whether such concentration was in fact benign and why market forces were not eroding it . he suggested that automated exchanges be required to publish data on system latencies â€” in other words , how long of a delay exists before market information reaches participants .
