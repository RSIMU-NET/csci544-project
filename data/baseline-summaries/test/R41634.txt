there are two forms in which limitations are regularly proposed . the first form places a total ban on the use of funds for a certain purpose by stipulating that none of the funds in the account or bill can be used for such purpose . this type of limitation has been allowed under house and senate rules , even when the funds have been authorized by law for that particular activity . this report should be read with several caveats in mind . first , it does not take account of every ruling that has been made and does not address every contingency that might arise . second , unanimous consent agreements in the senate and special rules in the house can be used to set aside each chamber's respective rules and customary procedures relating to both limitations and legislation on appropriations measures . third , the house and senate parliamentarians are the advisers to the presiding officers on what constitutes a proper limitation within the appropriations context . although this report may provide useful background information , it should not be considered a substitute for consultation with the parliamentarian and his or her associates on specific procedural problems and opportunities . the rules of the house and senate with respect to limitations are enforced during floor consideration of general appropriations measures . although these rules generally encourage the separation between policy and money decisions in the area of appropriations , the procedural approach of each chamber differs in three significant ways with respect to the consideration of limitations and the exclusion of legislative provisions . the first area of contrast is the extent to which legislative provisions are allowed as committee or floor amendments . the second area of contrast is whether chamber rules designate a separate set of procedures for the consideration of limitation amendments . the third area of contrast relates to the allowability of legislative provisions within conference reports . the second form , sometimes referred to as a "not to exceed" limitation , provides that the use of funds is not to exceed a specific amount or percentage of total funds . according to house practice , "a negative restriction on the use of funds above a certain amount in an appropriation bill is in order as a limitation . as long as a limitation on the use of funds restricts the expenditure of federal funds carried in the bill without changing existing law , the limitation is in order. although the rules of the house and senate encourage money and policy decisions to remain separate , proper limitations in appropriations measures can affect policy by stipulating for what purposes federal funds cannot be used or by placing a maximum limit on spending in certain areas . limitations have been previously allowed that prohibit funding for specific activities , a class of recipients , and earmarks . "not to exceed" limitations that establish funding ceilings for certain activities or total funding amounts have also previously been determined by the presiding officer to be in order , as have limitations that restrict the availability of funds for transfer . the precedents of the house and senate distinguish between the limitations and legislative provisions based upon both structure and substance .
