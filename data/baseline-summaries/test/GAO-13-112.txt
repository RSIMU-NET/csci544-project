allocation of risks . less prefunding now increases the risk that later some party ( ies ) could be called upon to pick up a greater share of the costs if usps could not make its payments or pay off its unfunded liability . another risk is that the level of employee pay and benefits may not be sustainable and could be reduced . as stated earlier , opm's oig reported that the exact consequences of these risks are unclear.consistent allocation of costs for pay and benefits earned during employees' work years could provide greater benefit security to employees , retirees , and beneficiaries . another consideration with regard to the timing of prefunding payments is whether congress wishes to continue requiring fixed prefunding contributions that are significantly in excess , through 2016 , of actuarially - determined amounts . the house bill largely retains this current law approach , while the senate bill and the administration approach would produce a more consistent funding pattern . the senate bill targets an 80 percent funding level while the other approaches target a 100 percent funding level . the senate committee report accompanying the senate bill stated that the committee set an 80 percent target - funding level on the presumption that usps , if necessary , had additional assets it could draw upon to meet its liabilities . as previously stated , usps's oig report stated that usps's extensive real estate holdings could provide collateral for the remaining unfunded liability , but we would note that in the event of usps's being unable to fund its liabilities , usps might have other debts and obligations in addition to an unfunded retiree health benefit liability for which any available real estate would be needed . if an 80 percent funding target level were selected because of concerns about usps's ability to achieve a 100 percent target level within a particular time frame , an additional option could be to build in a schedule to achieve 100 percent funding in a subsequent time period after the 80 percent level is achieved . as discussed earlier , the issuance of sffas 33 had the effect of creating a divergence between the actuarial assumptions used in determining usps's funding requirements for psrhbf and those used in determining its funding requirements for csrs and fers . another consideration is whether congress desires more uniform funding assumptions across these programs . as noted , the funding assumptions for psrhbf under current law , which are retained in the house bill and administration approach , are now , post - sffas 33 , based on 10-year historical averages . assumptions that are based on historical averages can potentially diverge significantly from either current economic circumstances or from the current long - term economic outlook . the assumption criteria in sffas 33 were designed to accomplish financial reporting objectives rather than funding objectives . we also reviewed the prefunding requirements for other organizations that offer retiree health benefits to their employees: private sector entities , state and local governments , and other federal entities . although other federal , state and local , and private sector entities generally are not required to prefund retiree health care benefits , a few do prefund at limited percentages of their total liability .
