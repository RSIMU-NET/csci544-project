each stage is described in detail here . appendix ii provides a list of core elements arranged by their respective eammf stages . as a result , the enterprise architecture should be an integral input into the execution of each of these management disciplines . enterprise architecture quality measurement: don has fully satisfied the element associated with measuring and reporting the quality of its enterprise architecture products ; air force has partially satisfied this element ; and army has yet to satisfy the element . specifically , the quality of don enterprise architecture products is assessed by a working group in accordance with a set of defined criteria and submitted for final approval to an enterprise architecture approval board . air force demonstrated that both its enterprise - level and subordinate architectures are subject to quality reviews that address completeness , usability , consistency , and accuracy and are reported to the appropriate officials . however , the assessments were not based on quality standards defined in an approved enterprise architecture methodology . in addition , although army's network architecture segment documentation states that quality control measures are to be used to determine quality , reuse , compliance , and risk , related measurements have not yet been defined . further , according to army officials , the quality of its other segment architecture products is not measured and reported . realizing an enterprise architecture's value depends in large part on the quality of the products or artifacts that compose it . accordingly , measuring and reporting the quality of enterprise architecture products relative to defined and consistently applied quality standards helps ensure that the enterprise architecture program will ultimately achieve its intended purpose . enterprise architecture results and outcomes: none of the military departments has partially or fully satisfied the element associated with measuring and reporting enterprise architecture results and outcomes , although all three have reported that they expect to realize future benefits from their respective architecture programs . for example , air force reported that it expects to achieve improved alignment between its business operations and it as well as improved data integration within 2 to 5 years , and don reported that it expects increased infrastructure consolidation and increased use of enterprise licenses within 2 to 5 years . what this suggests is that the real value to the military departments from developing and using enterprise architectures has yet to be realized . our framework recognizes that a key to realizing this potential is effectively managing department and agency enterprise architecture programs . however , knowing whether benefits and results are in fact being achieved requires having associated measures and metrics . in this regard , it is important for the military departments to measure and report enterprise architecture results and outcomes . examples of results and outcomes to be measured include costs avoided by eliminating duplicative investments or by reusing common services and applications and improved mission performance through re - engineered business processes and modernized supporting systems . agencies that achieve maturity stage 4 have a foundational set of enterprise - level and subordinate enterprise architecture products that provide a meaningful basis for informing selected investments and building greater enterprise architecture scope , content , use , and results .
