( see app . i for an excerpt of the announcement that describes the newly proposed decision - making process. ) in addition to proposing demonstration projects that provide work incentives and supports to help people with disabilities return to work , ssa has proposed significant changes to both the process of adjudicating disability claims and the structure and management of the agency's quality management system to improve the timeliness , accuracy , and consistency of the disability decision - making process . i realized that designing an approach to fully address the central and important issues raised by the president required a focus on two over - arching operational goals: ( 1 ) to make the right decision as early in the process as possible ; and ( 2 ) to foster return to work at all stages of the process . i also decided to focus on improvements that could be effectuated by regulation and to ensure that no ssa employee would be adversely affected by my approach . my reference to ssa employees includes state disability determination service employees and administrative law judges ( aljs ) . as i developed my approach for improvement , i met with and talked to many people — ssa employees and other interested organizations , individually and in small and large groups — to listen to their concerns about the current process at both the initial and appeals levels and their recommendations for improvement . i became convinced that improvements must be looked at from a system - wide perspective and , to be successful , perspectives from all parts of the system must be considered . i believe an open and collaborative process is critically important to the development of disability process improvements . most recently , the social security advisory board issued a report prepared by outside experts making recommendations for process change . my approach for changing the disability process was developed after a careful review of these discussions and written recommendations . as we move ahead , i look forward to working within the administration and with congress , as well as interested organizations and advocacy groups . i would now like to highlight some of the major and recurring recommendations made by these various parties . the need for additional resources to eliminate the backlog and reduce the lengthy processing time was a common theme . this important issue is being addressed through my service delivery plan , starting with the president's fy 2004 budget submission which is currently before congress . another important and often heard concern was the necessity of improving the quality of the administrative record . ddss expressed concerns about receiving incomplete applications from the field office ; aljs expressed concerns about the quality of the adjudicated record they receive and emphasized the extensive pre - hearing work required to thoroughly and adequately present the case for their consideration . in addition , the number of remands by the appeals council and the federal courts make clear the need for fully documenting the administrative hearing record . applying policy consistently in terms of: 1 ) the dds decision and alj decision ; 2 ) variations among state ddss ; and 3 ) variations among individual aljs — was of great concern .
