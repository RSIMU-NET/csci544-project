sba is not required to request the reports from agencies . in contrast , officials at 2 agencies told us that they submitted their methodology reports late because each of their agencies requires an approved spend plan before officials can calculate extramural r&d obligations and provide them in the methodology report , and those plans were not approved in enough time to submit the methodology reports on time . as we found in our september 2013 report , the late submission of the methodology reports makes it difficult for sba to promptly analyze these methodologies and provide agencies with timely feedback to assist them in accurately calculating their spending requirements . agencies are not explicitly required to state that they have no exclusions . however , without such information sba cannot determine whether agencies are accurately reporting whether they have exclusions to their extramural r&d calculations . according to the programs' policy directives , funding for the pilot program cannot replace current agency administrative funding . sba's policy directives require each agency to submit a work plan to sba that includes , among other information , a prioritized list of initiatives , the estimated amounts to be spent on each initiative , and the expected results to be achieved . the policy directives require sba to evaluate the work plan and provide initial comments within 15 calendar days of receipt of the plan . if sba does not provide initial comments within 30 calendar days of receipt of the plan , the work plan is deemed approved . in our april 2015 report , we found that sba requested that agencies submit data on the total amount spent on the administrative pilot program , but did not request that agencies submit information on how they used the funds . in that report , we recommended that sba request that agencies participating in the administrative pilot program provide data on the use of the funds , rather than a total cost for all the activities under the pilot . sba generally agreed with our recommendation and , in fiscal year 2014 , requested that agencies provide additional information on how they spent administrative pilot program funds . sba is required to use the information from the agencies to report on the pilot program to congress . agencies participating in the administrative pilot program used funds towards six goals developed by sba in consultation with agency officials , as shown in table 3 . under the administrative pilot program , some goals received more attention than others based on our review of the funds spent on each goal . in particular , all seven of the agencies that participated in the administrative pilot program spent funds to increase outreach to underserved communities . for example , officials at one agency told us that they spent approximately $1 million under the administrative pilot program to expand assistance , through budget support and proposal review , among other assistance , to women - owned small businesses , minority - owned small businesses , and small businesses from states that are underrepresented in the sbir and sttr programs . according to agency officials , their efforts resulted in 43 applications from companies that received such assistance .
