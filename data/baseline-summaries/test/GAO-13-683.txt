united states . second , those not eligible for the visa waiver program and not otherwise exempt from the visa requirement must obtain a visa from a u.s. consular office overseas . upon arriving at a port of entry , nonimmigrants must undergo inspection by cbp officers , who determine whether or not they may be admitted into the united states . if cbp determines a nonimmigrant is admissible , he or she is granted an authorized period of admission . this period may be for a specific length of time , which cbp designates by assigning a specific “admit until” date , or for as long as the nonimmigrant maintains a particular status . for example , in general , foreign students are eligible to remain in the united states for “duration of status,” meaning as long as they are enrolled in and attending a qualified education program or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies . an overstay is a nonimmigrant who is legally admitted to the united states for an authorized period but remains in the country illegally after that period expired without obtaining an extension of stay or a change of status or meeting other specific conditions , such as claiming asylum . this includes a nonimmigrant admitted for duration of status who fails to maintain that status , such as a student who is no longer pursuing a full course of study at an approved educational institution or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies . in - country overstays refer to nonimmigrants who have exceeded their authorized periods of admission and remain in the united states without lawful status , while out - of - country overstays refer to individuals who have departed the united states but who , on the basis of arrival and departure information , stayed beyond their authorized periods of admission . federal law establishes consequences for foreign nationals who overstay their authorized periods of admission . as a result , dhs closed approximately 863,000 records for individuals who had departed , were in status , or had adjusted status , and removed them from the backlog by conducting additional automated checks . see 8 u.s.c . in april 2011 , we reported on dhs's actions to identify and take actions to address overstays and made recommendations to the department to strengthen those efforts . dhs concurred with our recommendations and has taken or is taking steps to address them , as discussed later in this report . in addition , we have issued a number of reports since 2004 on dhs's collection of biometric data from nonimmigrants upon their entry into the united states , as well as the department's efforts to collect biometric data to track their exit from the country . relying on some of this work conducted from 2007 through 2010 , we made recommendations to dhs to improve planning for and implementation of a biometric exit system . dhs generally concurred with our recommendations in these reports and has taken action to address a number of them , as also discussed later in this report .
