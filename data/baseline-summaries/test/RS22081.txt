awards . in order to receive compensation , a claimant would have to show , by a preponderance of the evidence , that the claimant suffers from an eligible disease or condition . in addition , claimants would be required to demonstrate a minimum exposure to asbestos . claimants would be compensated according to the tiered compensation scheme outlined in the bill . this scheme would set medical criteria and awards for nine levels of asbestos - related injury , with awards ranging from medical monitoring for claimants in level i ( asbestos - related non - malignant disease and five years occupational exposure to asbestos ) to $1.1 million for claimants in level ix ( mesothelioma ) . the bill would also allow claimants suffering from asbestos - related injuries that cannot fit into one of the nine levels to seek compensation for their "exceptional medical claims. one of the more controversial aspects of the effort to reach a legislative solution to the asbestos problem has been the question of smoking . levels vii and viii of the tiered compensation scheme both deal with lung cancer , and some have expressed concern that smoking may have contributed to many of these claimants' conditions . as a result , the awards in levels vii and viii are pegged to each claimant's smoking history , in that non - smokers would get higher awards than ex - smokers , who would get higher awards than smokers . the administrator would be required to provide to the claimant a proposed decision within ninety days of the filing of the claim . if unsatisfied with the proposed decision , the claimant would be entitled to seek review by a "representative of the administrator," so long as the request is made within ninety days of the issuance of the proposed decision . after a review , or if no review is requested within ninety days , the administrator would issue a final decision . a claimant would then have ninety days to seek judicial review of the final decision in the u.s. court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant resides . under the bill , a claimant would receive his or her award in structured payments over a three - to - four year period . the amount of the award would have to be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation and most prior awards made pursuant to the administrative scheme . "collateral source compensation," however would include only compensation paid by defendants , insurers of defendants , and compensation trusts pursuant to judgments and settlements ; it apparently would not include payments from disability insurance , health insurance , medicare / medicaid , etc . another sticking point in the debate over previous asbestos bills has been the effect any legislative resolution would have on so - called "mixed dust" ( i.e. , silica and asbestos ) claims . some have expressed concern that , if these claims are not included in the legislation ( and therefore removed from the courts ) , asbestos claimants could avoid the administrative process by re - filing their claims in court as mixed dust claims .
