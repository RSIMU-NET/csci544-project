all of these plans were assessed an afc more than once . again , terminated plans provide a stark illustration of weaknesses in the rules' ability to ensure sufficient funding . bethlehem steel's plan was assessed an afc of $181 million in 2002 , but the company made no cash contribution that year , just as it had not in 2000 or 2001 , years in which the plan was not assessed an afc . when the plan terminated in late 2002 , its assets covered less than half of the $7 billion in promised benefits . ltv steel , which terminated its pension plan for hourly employees in 2002 with assets of $1.6 billion below the value of benefits , had its plan assessed an afc each year from 2000 to 2002 , but for only $2 million , $73 million , and $79 million , or no more than 5 percent of the eventual funding shortfall . despite these afc assessments , ltv steel made no cash contributions to this plan from 2000 to 2002 . both plans were able to apply existing credits instead of cash to fully satisfy minimum funding requirements . the recent funding experiences of large plans , especially those sponsored by financially weak firms , illustrate the limited effectiveness of certain current funding rules and represent a potentially large implicit financial risk to pbgc . the financial health of a plan sponsor may be key to plan funding decisions because sponsors must make funding and contribution decisions in the context of overall business operations . from 1995 to 2002 , on average , 9 percent of the largest 100 plans were sponsored by a firm with a speculative grade credit rating , suggesting financial weakness and poor creditworthiness . financial strength of plan sponsors' business operations has been a key determinant of risk to pbgc . financially weak sponsors of large , underfunded plans are , by the nature of the insurance offered by pbgc , likely to cause the most financial burden to pbgc and other premium payers . for instance , pbgc typically trustees a plan when a covered sponsor is unable to financially support the plan , such as in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency . current funding rules , coupled with the presence of pbgc insurance , may create incentives for financially distressed plan sponsors to avoid or postpone contributions and increase benefits . many of the minimum funding rules are designed so that sponsors of ongoing plans may smooth contributions over a number of years . sponsors that are in financial distress , however , may have a more limited time horizon and place other financial priorities above “funding up” their pension plans . suppose then that this $1 million purchases assets that lose all of their value by the following year . even though the plan no longer had this $1 million in assets , the sponsor could still use that credit balance ( plus interest on the credit balance ) to reduce this year's contribution to the plan . because of amortization rules , the sponsor would have to report only a portion of that lost $1 million in asset value as a plan charge the following year .
