mtsa specifically includes these costs . tsa officials said that for later rounds of grants during fiscal year 2004 , they would discuss potential changes in the port security grant program with the coast guard and marad . these potential changes would include requiring that all grant proposals be designed to meet mtsa port security grant requirements . the officials said , however , that before making any changes , they would look for specific directions accompanying currently pending appropriations for fiscal year 2004 . timetables were often daunting . for example , one of the coast guard's responsibilities was to develop six interim final rules implementing mtsa's operational provisions in sufficient time to receive public comment and to issue a final rule by november 25 , 2003 . adding to the difficulty has been the need to implement mtsa against the backdrop of the most extensive federal reorganization in over a half - century . most of the agencies with mtsa responsibilities were reorganized into the department of homeland security in march 2003 , less than 5 months after mtsa enactment . among the 22 agencies in the new department were some relatively new organizations , such as tsa . other more longstanding agencies , including the coast guard , u.s. customs service , and immigration and naturalization service , were transferred from a variety of executive departments . this vast recombination of organizational cultures introduced new chains of command and reporting responsibilities . mtsa implementation also involved coordination with other executive agencies , including the departments of state , transportation , and justice . since the passage of mtsa in 2002 the responsible agencies — primarily the coast guard , tsa , and bcbp in dhs , along with marad in the department of transportation — have made strides in implementing the act's security provisions . mtsa called for actions in 46 key areas we identified . thus far , we have received information from the responsible agencies on 43 of these areas . of the 43 areas , work is done in 2 ( issuing interim rules and developing training for maritime security personnel ) , and under way in 40 others . these agencies also reported that cooperation and coordination has been extensive throughout the course of their activities . a major achievement has been the coast guard's publication on july 1 , 2003 , of six interim rules on the provisions where it had lead responsibility . the rules set requirements for many of the provisions delegated to the coast guard under mtsa . the rules , which included sections on national maritime security initiatives , area maritime security , vessel security , facility security , outer continental shelf facility security , and automatic identification systems , were published approximately 8 months after mtsa was enacted . doing so kept the coast guard on schedule for meeting mtsa's requirement to receive public comment and issue the final rules by the end of november 2003 . the rules provided a comprehensive description of industry - related maritime security requirements and the cost - benefit assessments of the entire set of rules . the coast guard plans to publish the final rules before november 25 , 2003 , after receiving and acting on comments to the interim rules .
