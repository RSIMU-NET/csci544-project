the cleanup costs can be considerable . epa estimates that the average cost to clean up a site on the national priorities list ( npl ) , its list of highly contaminated sites , is $26 million . although most brownfields are not highly contaminated , cities , lenders , and developers cite the possibility that the liability provisions in cercla could be applied to these properties as a major barrier to redeveloping them . under cercla , the responsible parties are strictly liable for cleanup costs — they can be compelled to perform cleanups — and can be subject to “joint and several” liability . under strict liability , a responsible party is liable regardless of whether the party is at fault . under joint and several liability , each party can be held responsible for the entire cost of the cleanup . most states have similar liability laws and develop their own lists of the sites needing cleaning up . epa defines brownfields as “abandoned , idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.” when industries choose to avoid such potential problems by locating on uncontaminated sites rather than on brownfields , they may seek suburban “greenfields.” although these sites may require building additional infrastructure , such as access roads and sewer systems , that brownfield sites would not , the developers may still view greenfields as more cost - effective than the sites requiring a cleanup . when the developers choose greenfields over brownfields , city residents lose employment opportunities , city governments lose tax revenue , and the new development contributes to urban sprawl . several legislative proposals that would address brownfield issues , including s. 1285 , have been introduced . also , the president recently proposed tax incentives for those who voluntarily clean up brownfield properties . besides these proposals , other executive agencies have provided funds for brownfield redevelopment . epa issued a “brownfields action agenda” in 1995 , which , among other things , provides 50 grants to local governments to fund a wide variety of 2-year demonstration projects that address brownfield problems . it has also removed nearly 28,000 sites from its list of potential npl sites , thereby potentially stimulating redevelopment at these sites by reducing the possibility of superfund liability . additionally , epa clarified its enforcement policies toward lenders , property purchasers , and certain property owners to alleviate their concerns and facilitate their involvement in the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields . the abandoned or idled industrial sites that could be classified as brownfields probably number in the tens of thousands , totaling hundreds of thousands of acres , but no official nationwide count exists . some of the research and advocacy organizations involved in urban issues have developed estimates , and municipalities have also estimated the potential number of brownfield sites , or acreage , within their borders . however , any estimate of the number of brownfields is likely to be imprecise because the cities and others measuring the number of brownfields often use different techniques and definitions .
