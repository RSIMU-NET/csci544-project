the most frequently cited factor was ease of use . for example , some said they preferred a telephone hotline to a web - based application ; others said the opposite . one carrier and one driver said they would use a self - reporting system if they thought they were traveling a route where an inspection was likely . another carrier said it might use a self - reporting system if it afforded them increased flexibility to wait to repair low risk equipment problems at a less expensive repair facility , such as the carrier's own maintenance facility . representatives from five of six industry and safety associations we interviewed said they would be unlikely to support a self - reporting system as outlined above . industry and safety representatives cited reasons such as an administrative burden for drivers and carriers , and potentially negative safety impacts , as described below . representatives from one industry association noted that a self - reporting system should allow drivers to simply record an equipment problem in their driver vehicle inspection report ( dvir ) when they notice the problem . if by chance a driver was pulled over subsequent to recording in the dvir , the driver could show the record to the inspector and not receive a violation for that equipment problem . however , as discussed above , for fmcsa to ensure that self - reported equipment problems were repaired , fmcsa would first have to receive a record of a violation . then , after receiving certification of the accompanying repair , fmcsa would ensure that the violation was not included in the calculation of the carrier's vehicle maintenance basic percentile . associations were selected for their work in the motor carrier and highway safety arenas . carriers were selected for diversity in fleet size and haul distance . as described above , fmcsa regulations require drivers to conduct a pre - trip and end - of - day inspection of their vehicle and to ensure that any identified issues are repaired before driving . carriers and drivers we interviewed said that if they identify an equipment problem en route , that is , after their pre - trip inspection , they work with their carrier to determine when and where to repair the problem . many carriers and drivers we interviewed said they would continue to identify and repair equipment problems the same way and with the same speed under a system for self - reporting equipment problems . more generally , the majority of carriers and drivers we interviewed stated that any safety impacts of a self - reporting system — positive or negative — would be minimal . for example , three drivers thought a self - reporting system could potentially yield some safety benefits if it incentivized drivers to do more thorough pre - trip or en route inspections . this could lead to better identification and quicker repair of equipment problems . on the other hand , three carriers and two other drivers we interviewed thought a self - reporting system could potentially yield some negative safety impacts if it incentivized some drivers to delay or avoid making repairs for problems they had self - reported .
