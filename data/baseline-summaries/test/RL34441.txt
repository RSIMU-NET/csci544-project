another option is a video conference with ma . in august 2005 , co - chairs of the house taiwan caucus had written to ma as the new kmt chairman , in part to invite him to visit . in 2007 , the house passed h.con.res . 136 to support visits by taiwan's officials . work with ma's transition team in ensuring a smooth power transition , as was done for chen's transition team in 2000 . discuss the substance of ma's inauguration address , including his policy intentions in dealing with the prc and taiwan's security , to convey critical near - term and long - term u.s. interests . send a senior delegation to attend ma's inauguration . ( representative james leach , then chairman of the house international relations subcommittee on asia and the pacific , was the u.s. representative at chen's second inauguration in 2004. ) congress could invite and host ma . a third approach to take ( either before or after ma's inauguration ) with comprehensive or certain options would strengthen u.s. - taiwan relations in military , political , or economic security . however , careful consideration could include the question of whether such steps would seriously risk other u.s. priorities that require prc cooperation . chen is effectively weakened and concentrating on the transition . while u.s. officials list many goals to pursue with beijing , they are often at a loss when asked to identify objectives in the relationship with taipei . chen's departure could change this u.s. stance . accept taiwan's formal letter of request for u.s. consideration of whether to sell new f - 16c / d fighters . the removal of chen as a factor in negative u.s. - taiwan and prc - taiwan relations presents a fresh situation for acceptance of the letter . in october 2007 , the house passed h.res . 676 to urge the president to consider security assistance "based solely" upon the legitimate defense needs of taiwan ( citing section 3 ( b ) of the taiwan relations act ( tra ) , p.l . on march 19 , 2008 , the co - chairs of the senate taiwan caucus , senators tim johnson and james inhofe wrote a letter to defense secretary robert gates , offering their "assistance" in his receipt of taiwan's request . reach out to moderate , pro - u.s. elements of the kmt . ma ying - jeou as well as some of his defense and foreign policy advisors are english speakers with familiar ties to the united states . ma was educated at harvard university , and his daughters are studying at u.s. universities . u.s. efforts might bolster the long - term influence of such pro - u.s. leaders in the kmt over the influence of pro - prc ones . u.s. efforts are more likely to succeed if undertaken early , while ma enjoys the initial "honeymoon" period and before the prc can influence its allies in the kmt . president - elect ma and kmt interlocutors give pro - u.s. assurances . as president , ma is expected to be less provocative towards beijing than chen .
