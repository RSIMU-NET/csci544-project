enhance secondary markets . industry stakeholders we contacted and panelists on our expert panel generally believed that modifying the rules governing secondary markets could lead to more efficient use of spectrum . for example , some panelists on our expert panel said that fcc should increase its involvement in the secondary market . these panelists thought that increased oversight could help to both ensure transparency in the secondary market and also promote the use of the secondary market . additionally , a few panelists said that adoption of a “two - sided” auction would support the efficient use of spectrum . with a two - sided auction , fcc would offer unassigned spectrum , and existing licensees could make available the spectrum usage rights they currently hold . reexamine existing small business incentives . the opinions of panelists on our expert panel and industry stakeholders with whom we spoke varied greatly regarding the need for and success of fcc's efforts to promote economic opportunities for small businesses . for example , some panelists and industry stakeholders do not support incentive programs for small businesses . these panelists and industry stakeholders cited several reasons for not supporting these incentives , including ( 1 ) the wireless industry is not a small business industry ; ( 2 ) while the policy may have been well intended , the current program is flawed ; or ( 3 ) such incentives create inefficiencies in the market . other industry stakeholders suggested alternative programs to support small businesses . these suggestions included ( 1 ) having licenses cover smaller geographic areas , ( 2 ) using auctions set aside exclusively for small and rural businesses , and ( 3 ) providing better lease options for small and rural businesses . finally , some industry stakeholders with whom we spoke have benefited from the small business incentive programs , such as bidding credits , and believe that these incentives have been an effective means to promote small business participation in wireless markets . panelists on our expert panel suggested a reexamination of the use and distribution of spectrum to ensure the most efficient and effective use of this important resource . one panelist noted that the government should have a good understanding of how much of the spectrum is being used . lack of financial incentives . if federal government users can obtain any needed funding for spectrum - related fees through the budgetary process , market - based mechanisms are not likely to be effective . however , imposing fees will make the cost visible to agency managers , thus providing them information they need if they are to manage spectrum use more efficiently . whether more efficient spectrum use actually occurs will depend in part on whether agencies receive appropriations for the full amount of the fees or only for some portion . if agencies do not receive appropriations for the full amount , some pressure will be created , but it will not be as strong as the private sector's profit motive . as we reported in december 2005 , industry stakeholders and panelists on our expert panel offered a number of options for improving spectrum management .
