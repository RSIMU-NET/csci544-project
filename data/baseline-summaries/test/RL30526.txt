the final column presents the most recent update amounts . a complete list of acronyms used in this report is included the appendix . this report is updated to reflect the most recent legislative changes to the program and payment updates available through january 2013 . provisions in the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l . 112-25 , bca ) impact medicare payments in 2013 . the bca established a joint select committee on deficit reduction and tasked it with providing to congress by november 23 , 2011 recommendations on ways to reduce the deficit over the subsequent 10 years . when the committee did not provide the recommendations , this triggered a government - wide sequestration process to reduce federal spending beginning in 2013 . part d provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage . in general , the total payment received by a provider for covered services provided to a medicare beneficiary is composed of two parts: a program payment from medicare plus any beneficiary cost - sharing that is required . ( the required beneficiary out - of - pocket payment may be paid by other insurance , if any. ) medicare has established specific rules governing its program payments for all covered services as well as for beneficiary cost sharing as described below . because of its rapid growth , both in terms of aggregate dollars and as a share of the federal budget , the medicare program has been a major focus of legislative attention , as outlined below . with a few exceptions , savings in program spending have been achieved largely through reductions in the updates to provider payments , primarily hospitals , physicians , and ma plans . however , even when payments are frozen ( as has been the case in some years with payments to acute care hospitals , inpatient rehabilitation facilities , long term care hospitals , and with the physician fee schedule ) , medicare spending continues to increase each year as the number of beneficiaries increases , and the number and complexity of services becomes greater . the patient protection and affordable care act ( p.l . 111-148 as amended , aca ) , is estimated to achieve substantial program savings through , permanent reductions in the maximum amount paid to ma plans , and reductions in the annual updates to medicare's fee - for - service ( ffs ) providers ( other than physicians' services ) , among other provisions . provider - specific sequestration adjustments are not reflected in the tables that follow because they are temporary adjustments to payment systems . in addition , the temporary payroll tax cut continuation act of 2011 ( tptcca , p.l . 112-78 ) , the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 ( mctrjca , p.l . 112-96 ) , and the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 ) extended certain time - limited payment adjustments to specified medicare providers . this report provides a guide to medicare payment rules by type of benefit . the information is presented through a series of tables , each representing a provider type , such as physicians , or medicare advantage plans .
