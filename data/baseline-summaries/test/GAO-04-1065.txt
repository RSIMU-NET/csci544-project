in addition to p.l . 480 , food aid is provided through three smaller programs administered by usda's foreign agricultural service: food for progress , section 416 ( b ) , and the mcgovern - dole international food for education and child nutrition program . the cargo preference and maritime security programs both provide incentives to retain privately owned u.s. - flag ships and their u.s. - citizen mariners for commercial and national defense purposes . cargo preference makes available a protected market that provides the economic incentive for vessel owners to pay the higher costs associated with the u.s. flag and employ u.s. - citizen crews . how are the cargo preference and maritime security programs designed to meet their objectives and who participates in them ? what are the nature and extent of msf and non - msf carrier participation and competition in the food aid program ? how would establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation on msf vessels be expected to affect msf , other u.s. - flag ships , the cargo preference food aid program , and the ports servicing these ships ? to answer these questions , we gathered and analyzed food aid shipment data for fiscal years 1999 to 2003 from the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , the department of agriculture ( usda ) , and the maritime administration ( marad ) , as well as msf and cargo preference vessel data from marad and military contingency participation data from marad and the department of defense ( dod ) . we conducted interviews and obtained financial data for fiscal years 2001 to 2003 from representatives of 15 carriers that transported the majority of cargo preference food aid , including 5 msf and 10 non - msf carriers . we also conducted interviews with representatives of eight ports through which a major share of food aid shipments were shipped . consistent with the terms of our mandate , we analyzed the potential impact of daily tonnage limits on msf vessels of 2,500 , 5,000 , and 7,500 tons . while our analysis provides a range of impact estimates based on data in recent years and several additional assumptions , if future market conditions differ from those reflected in this recent data , impacts may differ from those illustrated by our analysis . through electronic data testing , verification of data against other sources , and interviews with agency officials managing the data , we found the data to be sufficiently reliable and appropriate for our purposes . we conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . ( see app . i for details about our scope and methodology. ) u.s. - flag fleet participants in cargo preference food aid shipments comprise two general categories of carriers: charter service and liner service . the cargo preference and maritime security programs are intended to support both as part of the u.s. - flag fleet . these programs are administered by marad , while the food aid programs are administered by usaid and usda . vessels in the privately owned u.s. - flag fleet engaged in international commerce can be placed into two general categories: charter service and liner service .
