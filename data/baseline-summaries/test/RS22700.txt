ibid . in apparent anticipation of its decision to overrule dr . miles ( notwithstanding the doctrine of precedent known as stare decisis , which counsels that prior judicial precedents generally should not be upset ) , the opinion devoted a number of pages to presentation of its justifications . after acknowledging that "we do not write on a clean slate , for the decision in dr . but enacting major legislation premised upon the existence of that rule constitutes important public reliance upon that rule . and doing so aware of the relevant arguments constitutes even stronger reliance upon the court's keeping the rule , at least in the absence of some significant change in respect to those arguments . finally , the dissent argued , "every relevant factor ... mention[ed]" by justice scalia ( a member of the court's majority here ) , concurring in the judgment of an earlier case decided this term , federal election comm'n v. wisconsin right to life , inc.
