ii ) . officials noted that in some cases gaps in services resulted in diagnosis or treatment delays that exacerbated the severity of a patient's condition and created a need for more intensive treatment . for example , tribal health board members at one facility described the case of an elderly woman who had complained of back pain and was diagnosed with cancer only when one of her legs broke . tribal representatives at another facility cited the example of a young man whose lung condition was only properly diagnosed when , after months of treatment for pneumonia , he went to an emergency room and was found to have a tumor that killed him 3 weeks later . officials also noted that as a result of gaps in such specialty services as orthopedics and behavioral health care , some native americans were living with painful and debilitating conditions . service gaps not only varied among facilities , but also varied over time for particular facilities , depending on the demand for contract care . facility officials said that demand for contract care could affect where they drew the line between services that met medical priority criteria and those that did not . in addition to reimbursements , contributions from tribes were a key source of funding for services , as 8 of the 13 facilities we visited reported obtaining tribal contributions . at 6 facilities , tribes supplemented care by providing funds for contract care , pharmaceuticals , and other operating costs . other facilities benefited from onetime contributions . for example , two tribes used their own funds or obtained grants to build new facilities with additional examination and treatment space that allowed the facilities to offer more services . in addition to direct contributions of funds , some tribes obtained other funds to supplement ihs resources for services such as substance abuse treatment . officials from 3 of the 8 federally operated facilities reported that tribes did not provide additional funding for services . facilities reported having implemented at least one of six strategies to increase the availability of services funded by ihs . the strategies most commonly used by the 13 facilities we visited included bringing specialists on site to deliver services , improving efforts to obtain reimbursements , and implementing prevention and wellness programs ( see table 6 for the strategies and the number of facilities that reported using them ) . facilities implemented these strategies in different ways . for example , to improve efforts to obtain reimbursements , four facilities had staff available to help patients apply for eligibility or reimbursement from other programs for which they were eligible . others negotiated with state medicaid offices in order to be able to bill for services ( see table 7 for a description of how facilities implemented the six strategies ) . some of the strategies were not available to , or effective for , every facility . for example , in one area that we visited , the area officials reported that facilities were not able to use contract care funds to bring in specialists unless they could provide assurances that they would be able to pay for all emergent and acutely urgent care with remaining funds .
