( see fig . given the risk of catastrophic medical expenses , a focus group of current and future medicare beneficiaries convened by medpac indicated that an annual cap is the cost - sharing design feature they were most interested in seeing added to the medicare benefit . annual caps are a common design feature of private plans , as most are required to have an annual cap , including those participating in ma . specifically , since 2011 , cms has required most ma plans to have an annual cap of $6,700 or less and grants them additional flexibility in their cost - sharing design if they voluntarily set their cap at or below $3,400 . the mandatory and voluntary caps for certain ma plans that provide both in - and out - of - network coverage are the same ( $6,700 and $3,400 ) for in - network services , and 1.5 times higher ( $10,000 and $5,100 ) for combined in - and out - of - network services . in addition to these implications of the cost - sharing design itself , the american academy of actuaries and others have noted that the complexity and the possibility of unlimited responsibilities increases demand for supplemental insurance , which can lead to added costs for beneficiaries and the medicare program . it is uncommon for beneficiaries enrolled in private health insurance to have supplemental coverage . by insulating beneficiaries from some or all cost - sharing responsibilities ( and not just catastrophic costs ) , supplemental insurance further reduces the incentives for beneficiaries to evaluate the need for discretionary care . in part because of these reduced incentives , we previously estimated that both beneficiaries' average total out - of - pocket costs and average medicare program spending were higher for medicare ffs beneficiaries with medigap than those with ffs only . a uniform coinsurance would simplify the cost - sharing design , provide beneficiaries insight into the total cost of each service , and introduce cost - sharing for certain potentially discretionary services , such as home health services . however , as noted by the medicare payment advisory commission and congressional budget office , uniform coinsurance also has drawbacks , such as a fixed percentage of an unknown bill being harder for beneficiaries to understand and predict than copayments . other proposals have emphasized the need to set cost - sharing based on the value of services , and have suggested moving medicare toward a value - based insurance design in which per - service cost - sharing would vary based on the clinical value of the service to an individual beneficiary . while a value - based design would specifically target cost - sharing to promote prudent use of health care services , implementing it is challenging in practice and would be more complicated for beneficiaries to understand and for cms to administer , though cms is testing the feasibility of value - based insurance design in ma . a second design trade - off centers on how to set the level of the deductible and the annual cap . we also calculated how these changes were related to whether a beneficiary reached the cap at least once .
