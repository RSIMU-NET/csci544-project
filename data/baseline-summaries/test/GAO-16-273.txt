project closeout . gsa officials told us this step includes updating as - built drawings and filing them in project records . officials from the u.s . postal service also said unforeseen site conditions are prevalent and most often appeared in paving projects , in underground storage tanks that were leaking , and in roof replacements with deteriorated decking . the industry stakeholders we interviewed identified the main types of unforeseen site conditions as: environmental hazards ( such as asbestos and lead - based paint ) , and conditions being different than in building drawings or items not located where they were expected to be . stakeholders also told us impacts of unforeseen site conditions are generally cost increases and schedule delays but the impacts can vary depending on the project . for example , one industry stakeholder told us typical impacts include costs , increased time and schedule delays , as well as the need for greater resources to mitigate impacts . another stakeholder told us the impacts of unforeseen site conditions depend on how prepared the property owner is to address the condition and what was and was not planned for . gsa has also reported that unforeseen site conditions are common in repair and alteration projects . as noted earlier in this report , in 2001 the gsa office of inspector general examined 45 prospectus - level repair and alteration projects and found that in 10 projects completed in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 unforeseen site conditions accounted for about 43 percent of the cost growth in these projects . officials in four of the five gsa regional offices we contacted described unforeseen site conditions as very prevalent and officials in one regional office said they were somewhat to very prevalent . officials in this office went on to indicate that unexpected asbestos , lead , and mold can be found anytime during construction . the gsa officials identified hazardous materials as being one of the main types of unforeseen site conditions found . although industry stakeholders and gsa told us unforeseen site conditions are common in repair and alteration projects , data on the overall extent and impacts of unforeseen site conditions are limited . for example , as discussed in more detail below , gsa officials told us that the agency tracks but does not analyze project change orders to determine whether they resulted from unforeseen site conditions . most of the projects we reviewed had unforeseen site conditions . specifically , unforeseen site conditions were encountered in 11 out of the 18 repair and alteration projects , including two of the three prospectus projects and nine of the 15 rwa projects ( see table 1 ) . as shown in table 1 , the types of unforeseen site conditions varied . for example , in one prospectus project we reviewed — a project to , among other things , build a pavilion at the daniel p. moynihan u.s . courthouse in new york city — gsa discovered that the existing wall in the plaza area was reinforced concrete rather than a standard concrete masonry unit , which was what the building drawings indicated .
