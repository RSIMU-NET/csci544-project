both departments concurred with our recommendations . further , since that time , va has established a performance architecture program that has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome - oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas , and it also has begun to establish baseline measurements . we intend to continue monitoring the departments' efforts to determine how these metrics define and measure the results achieved by interoperability between the departments . va has moved forward with modernizing vista despite concerns that doing so is potentially duplicative with dod's acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system . specifically , va took this course of action even though it has many health care business needs in common with dod . for example , in may 2010 , both departments issued a report on medical it to congressional committees that identified 10 areas — inpatient documentation , outpatient documentation , pharmacy , laboratory , order entry and management , scheduling , imaging and radiology , third - party billing , registration , and data sharing — in which the departments have common business needs . further , the results of a 2008 consultant's study pointed out that over 97 percent of inpatient requirements for electronic health record systems are common to both departments . we also issued several prior reports regarding the plans for separate systems , in which we noted that the two departments did not substantiate their claims that va's vista modernization , together with dod's acquisition of a new system , would be achieved faster and at less cost than developing a single , joint electronic health record system . moreover , we noted that the departments' plans to modernize their two separate systems were duplicative and stressed that their decisions to do so should be justified by comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches . we recommended that va and dod develop cost and schedule estimates that would include all elements of their approach ( i.e. , to modernize both departments' health information systems and establish interoperability between them ) and compare them with estimates of the cost and schedule for developing a single , integrated system . if the planned approach for separate systems was projected to cost more or take longer , we recommended that the departments provide a rationale for pursuing such an approach . in addition , va's continued operation of two of the oldest legacy it systems in the federal government raises concern about the extent to which the department continues to spend funds on it systems that are no longer effective or cost beneficial . while we recognize that va has initiated steps to mitigate the it management weaknesses we have identified , sustained management attention and organizational commitment will be essential to ensuring that the transformation is successful and that the weaknesses are fully addressed . chairman roe , ranking member walz , and members of the committee , this completes my prepared statement . i would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have . if you or your staffs have any questions about this testimony , please contact david a. powner at ( 202 ) 512-9286 or pownerd@gao.gov .
