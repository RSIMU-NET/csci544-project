how should the research be prioritized ? how can the federal ehs research investment be better accounted for ? how can ehs research results and best practices be shared more broadly ? can voluntary programs effectively provide needed information about industrial nanotechnology production activities ? are existing laws , regulations , guidelines , and regulatory structures adequate ? should agencies be more aggressive in their use of regulatory authority to collect more information from companies about the nanotechnology and nanotechnology - enabled products they manufacture ? is there sufficient coordination among federal regulatory agencies ? how can efforts to develop common nomenclature and standards be improved ? what types of international engagement on nanotechnology research and regulatory issues could best foster responsible development of nanotechnology and ensure confidence in supply chains ? congress' approach to each of these issues may have a substantial effect on u.s. leadership in nanotechnology r&d and commercialization , the realization of the potential societal benefits of nanotechnology , public health and safety , the environment , and the public policy decisions and investments made by other nations . five bills introduced in the 111 th congress contained provisions that sought to address nanotechnology ehs concerns . the following section summarizes selected ehs - related provisions of these bills . the provisions of title i , subtitle a of h.r . 5116 ( 111 th congress ) , the national nanotechnology initiative amendments act of 2010 , are nearly identical to h.r . 554 ( see " h.r . 554 â€” national nanotechnology initiative amendments act of 2009" below ) . 5116 changes the name of the act from the "national nanotechnology initiative amendments act of 2009," to "national nanotechnology initiative amendments act of 2010," and removes the term "interdisciplinary" from a provision establishing "green nanotechnology" research centers . 554 ( 111 th congress ) , the national nanotechnology initiative amendments act of 2009 , was introduced on january 15 , 2009 , and referred to the house committee on science and technology . on february 11 , 2009 , the bill was brought to the floor on a motion to suspend the rules and passed by voice vote . the bill was received in the senate and referred to the committee on commerce , science , and transportation . this act would revise the 21 st century nanotechnology research and development act in a variety of ways , several of which specifically address nanotechnology ehs concerns .
