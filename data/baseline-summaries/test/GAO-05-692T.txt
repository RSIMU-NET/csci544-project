sec agreed with this recommendation . we also pointed out that while sec examiners planned to review cco annual reports as part of examinations , the agency has not established a process to receive and review such reports on an ongoing basis . without such a process , sec is not in the best position possible to monitor the industry and identify emerging trends . sec agreed with our recommendation to determine how to best utilize their annual compliance reports , and any material findings cited in those reports . the penalties that sec has obtained in enforcement cases related to market timing and late trading violations are among the highest in the agency's history and generally consistent with civil penalties obtained in cases involving similarly egregious corporate misconduct . additionally , sec appears to have followed its penalty - setting process consistently in setting penalties in the cases we reviewed . federal and state prosecutors we contacted said that several factors complicate bringing criminal actions for market timing violations whereas late trading violations are more straightforward to prosecute . we also found certain weaknesses in sec's overall procedures for referring securities cases to other agencies for potential criminal violations and ensuring that departing sec employees comply with conflict - of - interest laws and regulations . sec agreed to implement our recommendations to strengthen these processes . since nysoag announced its discovery of the trading abuses in the mutual fund industry in september 2003 , sec has brought 14 enforcement actions against investment advisers primarily for market timing abuses and 10 enforcement actions against broker - dealer , brokerage - advisory , and financial services firms for market timing abuses and late trading . we evaluated these rules using standards for internal controls in the federal government . i will discuss late trading issues and nasd oversight activities to a lesser degree . more specifically , my testimony covers ( 1 ) the reasons that sec did not detect the market timing abuses at an earlier stage and lessons learned from the agency not doing so , ( 2 ) the steps sec has taken to strengthen its oversight of the mutual fund industry and strengthen industry business practices , and ( 3 ) enforcement actions taken by sec and criminal prosecutors in response to these abuses and sec management procedures related to the making of criminal referrals and ensuring staff independence from the mutual fund industry . sec did not examine for market timing abuses or test company controls in that area , largely because the agency had competing examination priorities and believed that companies had financial incentives to control frequent trading . lessons learned from sec not having detected these abuses earlier can be useful to the agency in administering its examination program going forward . sec staff have stated that given the number of mutual fund companies , the breadth of their operations , and limited examination resources , sec's examinations were limited in scope . examiners focused on discrete areas that staff viewed as representing the highest risks of presenting compliance problems that could impact investors . sec staff stated that before september 2003 , they considered funds' portfolio trading ( i.e.
