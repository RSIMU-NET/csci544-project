advisory opinion no . 1 , "on the role of a member of the house of representatives in communicating with executive and independent agencies," provides , in part , as follows: representations this committee is of the opinion that a member of the house of representatives , either on his own initiative or at the request of a petitioner , may properly communicate with an executive or independent agency on any matter to: request information or a status report ; urge prompt consideration ; arrange for interviews or appointments ; express judgment ; call for reconsideration of an administrative response which he believes is not supported by established law , federal regulation , or legislative intent ; perform any other service of a similar nature in this area compatible with the criteria hereinafter expressed in this advisory opinion . principles to be observed the overall public interest , naturally , is primary to any individual matter and should be so considered . they are given in response to work done or expected to be done . they do not express or create overriding obligations , that is , there is no absolute obligation on the part of the contributor to recognize past work by the candidate , and there is no absolute obligation on the part of the candidate to do the work the contributor expects . absence of absolute obligation creates one difference between contributions and bribes . it has been theorized that there may be some incidental "reciprocity" expected between donor and recipient in our political process . legislators in congress , unlike judges , have a specific constituency which they represent and on whom , in return , they rely for the donation of funds to their campaigns . judge noonan argued that to some extent , campaign contributions , or at least large ones , may be a kind of "access" payment to our representative which is expressly permitted in practice in our system of private funding of campaigns for elective office: campaign contributions may be considered a subspecies of a larger class â€“ access payments .

"i simply want to be sure he will listen to my side of the case. the access payment in fact and function , if not in hairsplitting theory , is a payment to establish reciprocity . * * * ...[t]he access buyer is paying not only for attention but for favorable attention . the payment is close to what would be called a bribe if made to a judge ; but access to and favorable attention by , a legislator has not generally been regarded in the same way as an approach to a judge . the hypotheticals show that a legislator is not in the position of a judge . the judge's office is modeled on the paradigm of the transcendent judge of the bible and a sharp line distinguishes him from the litigants before him . the legislator , on the contrary , is his constituent's representative .... a certain identity of interest is expected to exist between constituent and legislator... .
