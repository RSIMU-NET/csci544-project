minimum fee . commercial and noncommercial webcasters will pay an annual , nonrefundable minimum fee of $500 for each calendar year or part thereof . this rate structure does not make special provision for "small" webcasters , who were addressed in the swsa by reference to revenues . the standard for establishing rates , set forth by statute , is known as the "willing buyer / willing seller" standard . the determination is informed by the "webcaster i" initial royalty proceedings of the carp . in essence , both the previous carp and the current copyright royalty board attempt to implement the statutorily mandated standard to reach a royalty rate . explaining its interpretation of the governing language , the crb wrote the following: webcaster i clarified the relationship of the statutory factors to the willing buyer / willing seller standard . the standard requires a determination of the rates that a willing buyer and willing seller would agree upon in the marketplace . in making this determination , the two factors in section 114 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( b ) ( i ) and ( ii ) must be considered , but neither factor defines the standard . they do not constitute additional standards , nor should they be used to adjust the rates determined by the willing buyer / willing seller standard . the statutory factors are merely to be considered , along with other relevant factors , to determine the rates under the willing buyer / willing seller standard . the board considered the proposals of representatives for "small" webcasters that rates be structured as a percentage of revenue , but ultimately rejected them: in short , among the parties on both sides who have proposed rates covering commercial webcasters , only small commercial webcasters propose a fee structure based solely on revenue . however , in making their proposal , this group of five webcasters clearly is unconcerned with the actual structure of the fee , except to the extent that a revenue - based fee structure — especially one in which the percent of revenue fee is a single digit number ( i.e. , 5% ) — can protect them against the possibility that their costs would ever exceed their revenues.... small commercial webcasters' focus on the amount of the fee , rather than how it should be structured , is further underlined by the absence of evidence submitted by this group to identify a basis for applying a pure revenue - based structure to them . while , at times , they suggest that their situation as small commercial webcasters requires this type of structure , there is no evidence in the record about how the copyright royalty judges would delineate between small webcasters and large webcasters . and , in a substantive footnote , the board expressed its view that it lacks statutory authority to carve out royalty rate niches for the emergent business models promoted by small commercial webcasters: it must be emphasized that , in reaching a determination , the copyright royalty judges cannot guarantee a profitable business to every market entrant . indeed , the normal free market processes typically weed out those entities that have poor business models or are inefficient .
