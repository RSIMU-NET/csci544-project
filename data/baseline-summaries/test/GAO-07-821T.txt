train with first responders . based on our survey , we estimate that 27 percent of all school districts with emergency management plans have never trained with any first responders on how to implement the plans , in accordance with federally recommended practices . the reasons why school districts are not training with first responders are not readily apparent . as we have previously reported , involving first responder groups in training and exercise programs can better familiarize first responders with and prepare first responders for their roles in an emergency as well as assess the effectiveness of a school or district emergency plan . train with community partners . school districts report training with community partners — such as local government and local public health entities — on activities to prepare for an emergency with similar frequency . specifically , we estimate that 29 percent of all school districts train with community partners . as with first responders , the reasons for the lack of training with community partners are not readily apparent . in our work on hurricane katrina , we reported that involving local community partners in exercise programs and training could help prepare community partners and enhance their understanding of their roles in an emergency as well as help assess the effectiveness of a school district's emergency plan . without such training , school districts and their community partners may not fully understand their roles and responsibilities and could be at risk of not responding effectively during a school emergency . in planning for emergencies , many school districts face challenges resulting from competing priorities , a lack of equipment , and limited expertise ; some school districts experience difficulties in communicating and coordinating with first responders and parents , but most do not have such challenges with students . school district officials who responded to our survey reported difficulty in following the recommended practice of allocating time to emergency management planning , given the higher priority and competing demand on their time for educating students and carrying out other administrative responsibilities . based on our survey of school districts , we estimate that in 70 percent of all districts , officials consider competing priorities to be a challenge to planning for emergencies . in an estimated 62 percent of districts , officials cited a lack of equipment and expertise as impediments to emergency planning . for example , officials in one massachusetts school district we visited reported that they do not have adequate locks on some of the doors to school buildings to implement a lockdown procedure . in a north carolina district we visited , officials said a lack of two - way radios for staff in the elementary schools hinders their ability to communicate with one another and with first responders during an emergency . as demonstrated in these school districts , the lack of equipment would prevent districts from implementing the procedures in their plans and hinder communication among district staff and with first responders during emergencies . in addition to not having sufficient equipment , school district officials we spoke with described a shortage of expertise in both planning for and managing emergencies . these officials said their districts lacked specialized personnel and training with which to develop needed expertise .
