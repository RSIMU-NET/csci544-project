renewable . airwaves used to broadcast any transmission can be reused after the broadcast is completed . technology dependent . most natural resources can be harvested manually , albeit inefficiently . spectrum is in the atmosphere and is usable because technology has been developed to exploit the properties of electromagnetic waves for sound , data and video transmission . a national asset with international rules and regulations . for example , most domestic uses of spectrum are assigned bands of operation through the international telecommunications union , an agency of the united nations ; satellites for broadcasting are governed by international treaty . administered . to avoid interference from competing broadcast transmissions , frequency assignments are managed by recognized authorities . administrative decisions as to how to allocate spectrum ( for example , the number of channels to assign with a license ) influence its commercial potential and the supply of spectrum for commercial and public use . the development and implementation of better wireless communications technologies are critical to maximizing the efficiency of spectrum resources . spectrum management policies ideally should take into account the impact of new technology , orâsince it is difficult to predict the development paths of new technologiesâallow for flexibility and accommodation in spectrum allocation . although flexibility may be desirable in policy - making , most existing wireless technologies are inflexibly constructed to work on a limited range of specific frequencies . relocation from one part of the spectrum to another can require costly equipment changes . therefore , reallocation of spectrum to new uses is often expensive as well as technically and administratively difficult . additionally , some uses of spectrum are governed by international regulations . because two or more signal transmissions over the same frequency in the same location at the same time could cause interference ( a distortion of the signals ) , the fcc , over many years , has developed and refined a system of exclusive licenses for users of specific frequencies . in the recent past , the fcc has granted licenses using a process known as "comparative hearings" ( also known as "beauty contests" ) , and has used lotteries to distribute spectrum licenses . after years of debate over the idea of using competitive bidding ( i.e. , auctions ) to assign spectrum licenses , the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 ( p.l . 103-66 ) added section 309 ( j ) to the communications act , authorizing the fcc to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services . additional provisions concerning auctions were included in the balanced budget act of 1997 , the auction reform act of 2002 , the commercial spectrum enhancement act , and the deficit reduction act of 2005âall discussed below . the main category of services for which licenses may be auctioned are called commercial mobile radio services ( cmrs ) , which include advanced wireless services ( aws ) , personal communications service ( pcs ) , cellular , and most specialized mobile radio services ( smr ) with some exceptions , cmrs providers are regulated as common carriers to ensure regulatory parity among similar services that will compete against one another for subscribers .
