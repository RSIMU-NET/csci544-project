( see pp . we consistently have said that good cost accounting is critical to linking resources to results / outcomes . for example , in our recent testimony on performance budgeting we said that the integration of reliable cost accounting data into budget debates needs to become a key part of the performance budgeting agenda . nrc uses operating plans to set milestones , track progress , and make adjustments to improve program outcomes . this is — and was so described in our interviews at nrc — an important part of pbpm . the footnote was modified to clarify that this report neither observed nor evaluated reported safety problems in the davis - besse power plant . ( see p . implementation of pbpm is a work in progress . pbpm was created by nrc to improve program and service performance by integrating nrc's strategic planning and budgeting processes . this section describes how components of the process were designed to operate , while the next section ( “planning and performance information influences resource allocation decisions in various ways” ) explains how performance information informs resource decisions in those offices that have implemented pbpm and its techniques . nrc has gradually introduced pbpm techniques across the agency and has allowed offices some flexibility during implementation of the process . nrc began implementation in its larger program and mission support offices . as nrc has gained experience , it is examining ways to extend the process to the smaller program and mission support offices and to more fully standardize pbpm techniques across the agency . nrc designed pbpm as an integrated process that functions most effectively when information from one component is used to inform decisions in other components . figure 2 shows how the four components interact over a budget cycle . for example , one official noted that research leading to safer reactor design takes many years to bear fruit . agency officials said linking outcomes to resources is also difficult because achieving many agency goals depends on the actions of others not directly under nrc's control . nrc's strategic plan states that achieving its strategic goals requires the collective efforts of nrc , licensees , and the agreement states . yet , as one nrc official noted , neither nrc nor stakeholder representatives could identify how much each contributes to achieving nrc strategic goals . for example , the strategic direction setting in component 1 relies in part on the assessment elements in component 4 . the effectiveness review element in component 2 relies on performance goals developed during strategic direction setting . for example , nrr discovered that the may 2000 operating plan report showed plant license renewal applications and associated staff years well below annual expected target levels that year . nrr was thus able to shift resources to other priorities . an nrr official said this example showed nrr the importance of monthly monitoring of the budget assumptions prior to the beginning of the fiscal year . furthermore , in another example , nrr management officials also reviewed the fiscal year 2002 first quarter operating plan report and found that the workload impact from the september 11 attacks would prevent nrr from achieving annual licensing action targets .
