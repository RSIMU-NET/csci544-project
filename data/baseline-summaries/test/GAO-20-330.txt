detention facility . our analyses of ice data found that of the over 4,600 detentions of pregnant women , 78 percent of detentions of pregnant women were initially detained at an ihsc - staffed facility . see appendix ii for more details on these data . according to ice officials , pregnant women may first learn about their pregnancy when a test is performed during their intake into a detention facility . these over 4,600 detentions of pregnant women resulted in approximately 50,300 detention days with more than 66 percent of total detention days spent at ihsc - staffed facilities ( see app . specifically , we matched ice health service corps ( ihsc ) records for pregnant women detained during calendar years 2016 through 2018 with individual - level detention dataset the ice integrated decision support ( iids ) database to determine the total number of detentions of pregnant women , as well as the length of detention , facility location , case category status , arresting agency , gestation of pregnancy , when the pregnancy test was conducted , and whether there is an associated criminal conviction ( criminality ) . to conduct our analyses , we matched pregnancy data to the iids detention data using alien number and excluded additional records we were unable to match . because individuals may have multiple detentions , we compared the admission or book - in date from each data source with the book - in dates from the iids detention data , and excluded additional records with dates more than 30 days apart . ice collected data for 1,437 pregnant detainees in 2016 ; 1,170 in 2017 ; and 2,126 in 2018 . we excluded 60 of the unique pregnant detainee records for 2016 ; 20 for 2017 ; and 32 for 2018 because we were unable to match these records to the iids individual - level detention data using alien number and book - in date combinations . according to ice officials , this may be due to data entry errors . as a result , our analyses are based on over 4,600 detainee records we were able to match: 1,377 for 2016 ; 1,150 for 2017 ; and 2,094 for 2018 . in general , this was our study population , unless otherwise noted in the report . we also merged the detention data with data from ice's weekly facility list report , as of february 2019 , to determine who owned and operated the facility , whether it was staffed by ihsc officials , and in what state the facility was located . further , we merged additional ihsc data with our study population to determine the number of obstetrician - gynecologist referrals and numbers that were assigned certain special needs , such as a special diet , lower bunk , no heavy lifting , and limitations on the use of restraints . we also obtained and analyzed data from ice's segregation review management system to determine if any of the pregnant women had been segregated . finally , we analyzed ice ihsc data on pregnancy outcomes â€” abortions , births , stillbirths , and miscarriages .
