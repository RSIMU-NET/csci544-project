changes. ) for example , ora 1980 and hcfa's 1989 home health guideline changes have essentially transformed the home health benefit from one focused on patients needing short - term posthospital care to one that serves chronic , long - term care patients as well . finally , beneficiary advocacy groups have expressed concern about potential harmful effects of this system on patients' freedom of choice and how the quality and appropriateness of care could be ensured . in conclusion , it is clear from the dramatic cost growth for snf , home health , and rehabilitation facility care that the current medicare payment mechanisms for the providers need to be revised . as more details concerning the administration's or others' proposals for revising those systems become available , we would be glad to work with the committee and others to help sort out the potential implications of suggested revisions . this concludes my prepared remarks , and i will be happy to answer any questions . for more information on this testimony , please call william scanlon on ( 202 ) 512-7114 or thomas dowdal , senior assistant director , on ( 202 ) 512-6588 . other major contributors include patricia davis , roger hultgren , and sally kaplan . the first copy of each gao report and testimony is free . additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . visa and mastercard credit cards are accepted , also . orders for 100 or more copies to be mailed to a single address are discounted 25 percent . u.s. general accounting office p.o . box 6015 gaithersburg , md 20884-6015 room 1100 700 4th st. nw ( corner of 4th and g sts . nw ) u.s. general accounting office washington , dc orders may also be placed by calling ( 202 ) 512-6000 or by using fax number ( 301 ) 258-4066 , or tdd ( 301 ) 413-0006 . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . to receive facsimile copies of the daily list or any list from the past 30 days , please call ( 202 ) 512-6000 using a touchtone phone . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists . in general , this and other research has shown that patients in the rehabilitation facilities are more homogeneous than those in snfs or home health care . because the goals for the care are also more homogeneous and defined , an episode may be a reasonable choice for a unit of service . again , the per - episode payment should be structured to reduce the incentives for premature discharge , and adequate review mechanisms to prevent such discharges and other quality problems would be needed . as with snfs and home health care , we have concerns about the reliability of hcfa's databases for rate - setting purposes for rehabilitation hospitals because of the low levels of utilization review and cost - report auditing .
