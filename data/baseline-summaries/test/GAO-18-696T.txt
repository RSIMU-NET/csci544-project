both departments agreed with this recommendation . we later reported in january 2009 that va and dod had continued to take steps to set up the interagency program office . for example , the departments had developed descriptions for key positions within the office . in addition , the departments had developed a document that depicted the interagency program office's organizational structure ; they also had approved a program office charter to describe , among other things , the mission and functions of the office . however , we pointed out that va and dod had not yet fully executed their plan to set up the office . for example , among other activities , they had not filled key positions for the director and deputy director , or for 22 of 30 other positions identified for the office . our report stressed that , in the continued absence of a fully established interagency program office , the departments would remain ineffectively positioned to assure that interoperable electronic health records and capabilities would be achieved by the required date . thus , we recommended that the departments develop results - oriented performance goals and measures to be used as the basis for reporting interoperability progress . va and dod agreed with our recommendation . nevertheless , in a subsequent july 2009 report , we noted that the interagency program office was not effectively positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the implementation of fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities between va and dod . while the departments had made progress in setting up the office by hiring additional staff , they continued to fill key leadership positions on an interim basis . further , while the office had begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter , it was not yet fulfilling key it management responsibilities in the areas of performance measurement ( as we previously recommended ) , project planning , and scheduling , which were essential to establishing the office as a single point of accountability for the departments' interoperability efforts . thus , we recommended that the departments improve the management of their interoperability efforts by developing a project plan and a complete and detailed integrated master schedule . va and dod stated that they agreed with this recommendation . in our january 2010 final report in response to the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , we noted that va and dod officials believed they had satisfied the act's september 30 , 2009 , requirement for full interoperability by meeting specific interoperability - related objectives that the departments had established . these objectives included: refine social history data , share physical exam data , and demonstrate initial document scanning between the departments . additionally , the departments had made progress in setting up their interagency program office by hiring additional staff , including a permanent director . in addition , consistent with our recommendations in the three previously mentioned reports , the office had begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter in the areas of scheduling , planning , and performance measurement . nevertheless , the office's efforts in these areas did not fully satisfy the recommendations and were incomplete .
