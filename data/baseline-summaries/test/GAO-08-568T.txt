i highlight some of these in my testimony . nevertheless , estimating or quantifying the financial impact of fraudulent , wasteful , or abusive practices is not always feasible or practicable . however , the inability to do so should not detract from the need to improve management and accountability over our efforts in iraq . several entities and u.s. agencies have played important roles in u.s. efforts to rebuild and stabilize iraq . from may 2003 through june 2004 , the coalition provisional authority ( cpa ) was responsible for overseeing , directing , and coordinating rebuilding efforts . after its dissolution , the secretary of state assumed responsibilities for the supervision and general direction of reconstruction efforts in iraq . dod , including the u.s. army corps of engineers , and united states agency for international development ( usaid ) have had responsibility for managing and overseeing specific reconstruction projects . contractors have largely carried out reconstruction efforts in iraq . for example , in early 2004 , the cpa , through various military organizations , awarded seven contracts to help provide overall direction , coordination , and oversight of 12 large design - build contractors . in turn , these 12 design - build contractors were responsible for the design and execution of construction activities in various sectors such as electricity , oil , and public works and water . in addition , dod has made extensive use of contractors to support its deployed forces . the scale of contractor support dod relies on today in locations such iraq and elsewhere amounts to billions of dollars worth of goods and services each year , underscoring the need to effectively manage and oversee contractor efforts . contractors provide interpretation , intelligence analysis , and security services , as well as weapon systems maintenance and base operations support . the significance of such contracts is illustrated by the fact that the army reported obligations of over $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2007 on its single - largest support contract , the logistics civil augmentation program ( logcap ) . the collective effort of military , civilian , and contractor personnel in iraq has been complicated by the country's security environment . the cpa's original reconstruction plan was premised on the assumption that a permissive security environment would enable the united states to restore iraq's essential services to prewar levels . the cpa also assumed that the iraqi government and the international community would help finance iraq's development and that iraqi oil revenues could help pay for reconstruction costs . none of these assumptions has materialized . in february 2007 , we reported that the security situation was continuing to deteriorate , impeding the management and execution of reconstruction efforts . as shown in figure 1 , the security situation generally deteriorated through the summer of 2007 , with the number of attacks increasing to about 180 per day in june 2007 . however , since then , the number of enemy - initiated attacks has decreased by about two - thirds , to the levels of early 2005 .
