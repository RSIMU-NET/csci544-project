the broadcasters oppose those proposals . to foster the long - standing goal of localism , in most situations cable and satellite operators are restricted from retransmitting to their subscribers the signals of distant television stations if the same network programming is provided by a local station . but some counties around the country are assigned to local markets for which all the television stations are actually located across the state border , so that they do not receive news , sports , and other programming pertaining to their state . there has been a long , unsettled debate about how to better serve these "orphan counties" that is likely to arise again as congress addresses reauthorization of these statutory provisions . for further information crs report r41274 , how the satellite television extension and localism act ( stela ) updated copyright and carriage rules for the retransmission of broadcast television signals , by [author name scrubbed] . crs report r42722 , online video distributors and the current statutory and regulatory framework: issues for congress , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] . wireless broadband , with its rich array of services and content , requires new spectrum capacity to accommodate growth . spectrum capacity is necessary to deliver mobile broadband to consumers and businesses and also to support the communications needs of industries that use fixed wireless broadband to transmit large quantities of information quickly and reliably . electromagnetic spectrum , commonly referred to as radio frequency spectrum or wireless spectrum , refers to the properties in air that transmit electric signals and , with applied technology , can deliver voice , text , and video communications . access to radio frequency spectrum is controlled by assigning rights to specific license holders or to certain classes of users . the assignment of spectrum rights does not convey ownership . radio frequency spectrum is managed by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) for commercial and other non - federal uses and by the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) for federal government use . although radio frequency spectrum ( air ) is abundant , usable spectrum is currently limited by the constraints of applied technology . spectrum policy therefore includes making decisions about how radio frequencies will be allocated , who will have access to them , and how technology may enhance service and increase capacity and accessibility . spectrum policy issues that may be addressed in the 113 th congress include assuring that new capacity is made available for wireless broadband . congress may also choose to explore emerging technologies that promise to enhance broadband capacity and spur innovation . the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-96 ) , signed february 22 , 2012 , contained provisions in title vi to increase the availability of spectrum for commercial use .
