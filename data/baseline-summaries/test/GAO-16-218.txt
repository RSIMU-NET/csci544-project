projects . nnsa's management of projects is governed by doe order 413.3b ( doe's project management order ) . the order applies to capital asset projects above a certain cost threshold . it provides management direction for nnsa and other doe offices , with the goal of delivering projects within the original performance baseline that are fully capable of meeting mission performance and other requirements , such as environmental , safety , and health standards . the order specifies requirements that must be met , along with the documentation necessary , to move a project past major milestones . it provides requirements regarding cost estimating ( and , in some cases , the preparation of an independent cost estimate ) , technology readiness assessments , independent project reviews , and the use of earned value management systems , among other requirements . as we have previously found , doe's project management order applies to programs only in conjunction with a program's acquisition of capital assets . the b61-12 lep's program managers have developed a management approach that was then used to inform a new nnsa policy that applies to nnsa defense program management . in addition , nnsa and dod have identified some potential management challenges in the program ; the new management approach and policy may help nnsa address these challenges , but it is too soon to evaluate the likelihood that they will adversely affect the program . the b61-12 lep's program managers have developed , documented , and are using program management practices and tools for the lep to help identify and avoid cost and schedule overruns and technical issues . guides . guides provide information on how to implement the requirements contained in orders . they are a nonmandatory means for complying with these requirements and cannot be made mandatory by reference in other doe directives . the national nuclear security administration act , through which congress established the nnsa , also gives the nnsa administrator the authority to establish nnsa - specific policies , unless disapproved by the secretary of energy . according to b61-12 program officials , the b61-12 program management team uses nnsa business practices to assess technology and manufacturing readiness levels for the lep . the officials told us that all weapon components are maturing as planned with respect to their technology or manufacturing readiness . officials also told us that they were conservatively applying nnsa business practices and noted that some components that have been in use for years may be assessed at lower readiness levels to account for other design changes in the b61-12 . in addition , nnsa is in the process of planning for a technology readiness review later in 2015 by a group of sandia national laboratories experts that are not otherwise part of the b61-12 lep . we have found in previous work that such independent peer reviews can identify important technology issues . these practices include the use of earned value management systems , integrated master schedules , and risk management systems . air force responsibilities and the tail kit assembly . according to an nnsa official , even with the increase in federal staff , nnsa needs two to three times more personnel in the federal program manager's office to ensure sufficient federal management and oversight .
