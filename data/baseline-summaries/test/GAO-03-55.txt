we have made this change . dod and nasa concurred with our findings and had no further comment . their comments appear in appendix i and appendix ii , respectively . hhs concurred with our findings , but provided technical comments , including clarifying that it views acquisition as critical to mission success , although acquisition is not a primary function of the agency . there are clear reasons for this . about 90 percent of nasa's funds , for example , is spent on contracts for projects such as the international space station and the space shuttle . doe contracts out about 94 percent of its budget . va purchases goods and services , such as medical supplies , pharmaceuticals , and information technology . and gsa's primary function is to assist federal agencies in procuring goods and services . recognizing the importance of acquisition to their missions , va , gsa , and doe are all developing or have developed strategic plans specifically targeted at strengthening their acquisition workforce . nasa is developing an overall workforce plan that will include the acquisition workforce . va and gsa have defined the objectives for their future acquisition workforces . gsa has also established the competencies that workforce will need and has begun its gap analysis . doe has studied its acquisition workforce , identified competencies and gaps , and is now implementing actions it believes are needed to strengthen the acquisition workforce . nasa is in the process of identifying the competencies its workforce possesses . all four of these agencies have also developed training and career development programs that are aimed at ensuring their acquisition workforces have the skills to accomplish the agencies' missions . treasury and hhs view acquisition as critical to mission success . however , unlike gsa , for example , acquisition is not a primary function of these agencies . each agency spends less than 25 percent of its budget on acquisitions . nevertheless , treasury and hhs have undertaken initiatives such as training , career development , and intern programs to ensure that their acquisition workforces have the necessary skills and training to accomplish their missions . tables 2 and 3 highlight progress being made by the agencies we studied . detailed information on each agency's efforts is provided at the end of this section . major challenges facing the agencies we reviewed were difficulty in forecasting their missions in the future because of shifting priorities and budgets and difficulty in predicting the characteristics that the future workforce will need . also , acquisition rules and regulations are changing , making it difficult for agencies to predict what will be required of their acquisition workforce in years to come . officials at doe said that given the dynamic nature of the agency's mission focus and budget direction , forecasting the future represented a formidable challenge . officials at hhs also noted that improving the focus on the agency's mission and the skills sets needed to accomplish the mission was their biggest challenge . officials at va told us that they are still trying to determine how the department would be conducting its acquisitions in the future , and therefore they could not yet predict the kind of acquisition workforce va would need .
