specifically , we spoke with representatives from the u.s . we will also provide copies to others on request . in addition , the report will be available at no charge at gao's web site at http: / / www.gao.gov . questions about this report should be directed to me at ( 202 ) 512-3841 . other key contributors to this report are listed in appendix ii . this report provides information about ( 1 ) oil and gas construction activities for which permits have been obtained under phase i and ( 2 ) oil and gas construction activities that are likely to be affected by phase ii and its financial and environmental implications . to address the number of oil and gas activities for which permits have been obtained under phase i , we limited our analysis to three of the top five natural gas producing states and three of the top six crude oil producing states in 2003 , according to available data from the energy information administration . figure 3 illustrates the layout of this area . sites a , b , and c each disturbed approximately 3.5 acres of land and were connected by pipeline to an existing pipeline located about a mile from this site . according to industry officials , site a was financed , drilled , deemed a productive well , shut - in and the area stabilized prior to subsequent wells being drilled . the company did not decide to drill exploratory well b until a was identified as profitable . once it drilled well b and found it to be profitable , the company drilled a well on site c between well a and b . prior to well c being drilled , a different company agreed to construct a pipeline to connect this site with an existing pipeline . the industry officials estimated the pipeline disturbed less than 5 acres and said it was stabilized prior to starting construction on site c. the total acres disturbed by these sites exceeded 5 acres ; individually the sites disturbed less than 5 acres of land . neither the drilling company nor the pipeline company constructing these activities obtained a permit under phase i , although each of the four activities would require permitting under phase ii after the postponement period passes and small oil and gas sites are required to comply with the phase ii rules . epa's phase i rule requires that activities disturbing 5 acres or more of land — as well as smaller construction activities that are part of a common plan of development that disturbs 5 acres or more — obtain permit coverage . epa guidance defines a common plan of development as a contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct construction activities occur under a single plan . as this definition relates to oil and gas activities , epa guidance considers lease roads , pipeline activities , and drilling pads to be a single “common” activity if they are under construction at the same time — provided there is an interconnecting road , pipeline or utility project , or if the activities are within one - fourth mile of each other .
