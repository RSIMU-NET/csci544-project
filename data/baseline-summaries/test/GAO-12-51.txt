such growth . under the deficit reduction act of 2005 , cms was required to adjust risk scores for ma beneficiaries in 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 to take into account differences in treatment and diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs providers to the extent that the impact of such differences on risk scores could be identified . cms did not adjust ma risk scores in 2008 or 2009 . however , for 2010 , cms estimated that 3.41 percent of ma beneficiary risk scores were attributable to differences in diagnostic coding over the previous 3 years and reduced ma beneficiaries' 2010 risk scores by 3.41 percent . this adjustment , intended to ensure that individuals with identical health conditions and other characteristics have the same risk score regardless of whether they were in an ma plan or ffs , resulted in an estimated $2.7 billion in savings to medicare . the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 ( hcera ) required cms to continue adjusting risk scores for coding differences until cms implements risk adjustment using ma diagnostic , cost , and use data . cms reduced 2011 ma beneficiary risk scores by 3.41 percent , the same amount that the agency estimated and used for 2010 , and will use for 2012 . in addition , hcera required cms to reduce ma risk scores by at least 1.3 percent more than the 2010 adjustment ( a total of 4.71 percent ) in 2014 and that the annual minimum percentage reduction gradually increase to not less than 5.70 percent in 2019 and subsequent years . the accuracy of the adjustments to risk scores can have important consequences for both medicare spending and ma plans . if cms does not accurately estimate the effect on ma beneficiary risk scores of coding differences between ma plans and medicare ffs , then payments to ma plans will not accurately reflect the health status of ma beneficiaries . for example , if the adjustment to account for differences in coding is too small , then ma payments would be set too high and plans would be overpaid due to differences in coding patterns . in contrast , if the adjustment is larger than the actual impact of coding differences on risk scores , then payments to ma plans would be set too low and ma plans would be underpaid for the beneficiaries they served . you asked us to analyze differences in diagnostic coding practices between ma and medicare ffs and review cms's methodology for quantifying differences in coding practices and associated payment adjustments . this report ( 1 ) determines the extent to which differences , if any , in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs affected risk scores and payments to ma plans in 2010 ; and ( 2 ) evaluates cms's methodology for estimating the percentage of ma beneficiary risk scores in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 that was attributable to differences in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs .
