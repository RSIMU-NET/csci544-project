for a more comprehensive comparison between h.r . 2454 and s. 1733 , see crs report r40896 , climate change: comparison of the cap - and - trade provisions in h.r . 2454 and s. 1733 , by [author name scrubbed] , [author name scrubbed] , and [author name scrubbed] . 594 , introduced january 15 , 2009 , by representative stark , would impose a carbon - content tax on fossil fuels starting at $10 / ton and increasing by $10 every year . the tax would apply to fossil fuels as they enter the u.s. economy ( i.e. , at the production or importation level ) . the bill does not specify how the tax revenues would be applied . 1337 , introduced march 5 , 2009 , by representative larson , would impose a carbon - content tax on fossil fuels starting at $15 / ton . the tax would increase by $10 each year , but if identified emission targets ( established by epa , based on reaching 80% below 2005 emissions by 2050 ) are not met , the tax would increase by $15 in that year . the tax revenues would be used to support ( 1 ) a payroll tax rebate ; ( 2 ) affected industry transition assistance ; and ( 3 ) clean energy technology . the vast majority of the revenue would support the payroll tax rebate . the proposal also would impose a carbon equivalency fee on imported carbon - intensive goods . 1666 , introduced march 23 , 2009 , by representative doggett , would establish a cap - and - trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from covered sources from 6.2 billion metric tons in 2012 to 253 million in 2050 . the program would be administered through the department of the treasury and 100% of the allowances would be auctioned . in order to mitigate price volatility in the early years of the program , the bill would establish a climate program oversight and coordination board to set targets for allowance prices and manage quarterly auctions to maintain a smooth allowance price path . the managed price program would run from 2012 through 2019 , and , depending on a review , revisions would be made for 2020 and beyond . if the price path resulted in excess emissions from the expectations set out in the bill , those emissions would be made up through additional reduction in the years 2020 through 2030 . auction revenues would be put in an auction revenue trust fund at treasury , but no specific purpose is delineated in the bill for them . largely similar to h.r . 2454 , s. 1733 would establish an economy - wide ghg cap - and - trade program , while addressing other energy - related matters through numerous energy policy provisions .
