see table 21 . enacted fy2010 funding for wildfire preparedness — equipment , training , baseline personnel , fire prevention , and fire detection — totaled $965.5 million , $5.0 million more than the administration's request . the declaration may be issued if the fire covers at least 300 acres or threatens lives , property , or resources , among other criteria . the conferees stated their intent that the money in the flame funds , together with appropriations through the wildland fire management accounts , should fully fund suppression needs and prevent borrowing funds from other programs . they directed the secretaries to develop new methods of estimating fire suppression funding needs as part of their fy2011 budget requests . the interior appropriations law included $474.0 million ( $413.0 million for the fs and $61.0 million for doi ) for the flame funds . this would supplement the fs and doi fire suppression funding in the law , which totaled $1.38 billion ( $997.5 million for the fs and $383.8 million for doi ) . thus , fy2010 appropriations for wildfire suppression totaled $1.86 billion ( $1.41 billion for the fs and $444.8 million for doi ) . the total wildfire suppression funding in the house - passed bill and the administration's request matched the enacted level , $1.86 billion , but differed in structure . the administration and the house included $1.50 billion for wildfire suppression ( $1.13 billion for the fs and $369.8 million for doi ) , and $357.0 million for a proposed wildland fire suppression contingency reserve fund ( comprising $282.0 million for the fs and $75.0 million for doi ) . the senate also had approved $1.86 billion , but structured the funding differently still . the senate had provided $664.3 million for wildfire suppression ( $369.5 million for the fs and $294.8 million for doi ) , $357.0 in wildland fire suppression reserve funds ( $282.0 million for the fs and $75.0 million for doi ) , and $834.0 million for a new flame fund ( with no allocation between the fs and doi ) . other wildland fire operations include an array of activities — burned area rehabilitation , biomass fuels reduction , research , and assistance to states and private entities . for fy2010 , the interior appropriations law provided $751.9 million for other operations , $20.1 million ( 3% ) more than the senate , $69.4 million ( 8% ) less than the house , and $72.7 million ( 11% ) more than the administration's request . the lwcf is used for three purposes . first , the four principal federal land management agencies — bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , national park service , and forest service — draw primarily on the lwcf to acquire lands . second , the lwcf funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the nps , sometimes referred to as stateside funding . third , congress has appropriated money from the lwcf to fund some related activities , with programs varying from year to year . from fy1965 through fy2009 , about $32 billion was credited to the lwcf . roughly $15 billion of that amount has been appropriated .
