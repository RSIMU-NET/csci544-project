costs . since 2006 , costs associated with operating , maintaining , and repairing gsa's owned facilities have risen faster than inflation . gsa's annual operating costs , representing the direct costs of operating its facilities ( including utilities , janitorial services , and routine maintenance ) have risen by about 6 percent total in constant dollars from 2006 to 2011 , though year to year these costs are volatile and can vary significantly . gsa officials stated that reasons for the increase in operating costs include general inflation in utilities , maintenance , and administrative costs . furthermore , gsa estimates that construction costs have increased since 2005 . we found that from october 2005 to september 2011 , for example , construction costs rose by nearly 20 percent , or by nearly twice the general rate of inflation , eroding the value of fbf resources generated to fund capital repairs and construction . gsa officials also noted that , with decreased obligational authority , the growing amount and cost of leased space in its portfolio have reduced the proportion of obligational authority available to fund repairs and alterations that could potentially reduce operating costs in its owned portfolio . from 2006 through 2011 , obligational authority for the acquisition of leased space increased from $3.9 billion ( 49 percent of obligational authority ) to $4.8 billion ( 62 percent ) as the amount of leased space increased from 172 million to 193 million square feet . revenue . since 2006 , revenue growth has not kept pace with inflation . specifically , the revenue from gsa's owned portfolio adjusted for inflation has decreased by 2 percent . gsa officials said that revenue generated by its owned assets is highly dependent upon the fair annual rent appraisal of the asset which , in turn , is based on the value of rental charges at comparable private sector properties . gsa officials noted that from 2006 to 2011 , increased commercial office vacancies contributed to soft rental markets and minimal growth in rental rates . according to these officials , changes in revenue primarily reflect the downward pressure on gsa's rental rates caused by market conditions . at the same time , obligational authority for repairs and alterations has decreased from $1.1 billion ( 14 percent of obligational authority ) in 2006 to $341 million ( 4 percent ) in 2011 . while the fbf as a whole has generated positive funds from operations , portions of gsa's inventory operate at a loss . for example , within its owned portfolio , about 30 percent of gsa's assets lose money in a given year . in fiscal year 2011 , the loss from these assets was $170 million , and gsa has incurred a similar loss on that portion of its portfolio each year from 2006 to 2010 . these assets tended to be older and smaller than other assets in the owned portfolio.losses are attributable to about 200 assets , each of which lost more than $100,000 in 2011 . gsa officials noted that in some cases , operating an asset at a loss can be more cost effective in the short term than the cost of acquiring new space , moving an agency , and disposing of the asset .
