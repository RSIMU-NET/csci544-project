women are currently not required to register for the selective service . federal regulations state , " no person who is not required by selective service law or the proclamation of the president to register shall be registered. all of those required to register would be considered "available for service" in the case of an emergency mobilization unless they were reclassified by the sss . the selective service system is an independent federal agency within the executive branch with headquarters located in arlington , va . the agency is currently maintained as an active standby organization . for those permitted to serve in a nonmilitary capacity , the sss would be responsible for placing these "alternative service workers" with alternate employers and tracking completion of 24 months of their required service . although congress has amended the mssa a number of times , some of its main tenets — the preservation of a peacetime selective service agency and a registration requirement — have remained much the same since the mid - 20 th century . the future of the selective service system is a concern for many in congress . the registration requirements and associated penalties affect young men in every congressional district . at the same time , some see the preservation of the sss as an important component of national security and emergency preparedness . others have suggested that the mssa is no longer necessary and should be repealed . individuals are not allowed to register beyond their 26 th birthday . the statutory missions of the sss are to maintain a complete registration and classification structure capable of immediate operation in the event of a national emergency ( including a structure for registration and classification of persons qualified for practice or employment in a health care occupation essential to the maintenance of the armed forces ) , and personnel adequate to reinstitute immediately the full operation of the system , including military reservists who are trained to operate such system and who can be ordered to active duty for such purpose in the event of a national emergency . if the sss were activated with the authority to induct individuals , the agency would be responsible for ( 1 ) holding a national draft lottery , ( 2 ) contacting registrants who are selected via the lottery , ( 3 ) arranging transportation for selectees to military entrance processing stations ( meps ) for testing and evaluation of fitness to serve , and ( 4 ) activating a classification structure that would include area offices , local offices , and appeal boards . local boards would also evaluate claims for exemption , postponement , or deferments . those classified as conscientious objectors would be required to serve in a noncombatant or nonmilitary capacity . this report does not discuss the state of the all - volunteer force or whether it is adequate to meet our nation's current or future manpower needs . in addition , it will not provide an analysis of other options for military manpower resourcing such as universal military service or universal military training . it also does not discuss the history of the draft and draft planning for health service workers .
