1 for the location of the 12 fhlbanks ) . the 12 fhlbanks , along with the office of finance ( which issues debt on behalf of the fhlbanks ) , comprise the fhlbank system . the members of each fhlbank must buy stock in the fhlbank as a prerequisite for obtaining advances and other fhlbank services . fhlbank system assets consist of advances and investments , such as money market funds and mortgage - backed securities ( see table 1 ) . in addition , fhlbank assets consist of acquired mortgages that the fhlbanks purchase from their members under the mortgage partnership finance ( mpf ) program or mortgage purchase program ( mpp ) . the fhlbank - purchased mortgages consist of both conventional mortgages and federally insured and guaranteed mortgages . the fhlbank system raises funds in the capital markets partially on the strength of its ties to the federal government . however , as part of its oversight efforts , fhfb collects data on fhlbank collateral practices that have questionable value in their current format . in addition , fhfb does not collect data necessary to fully assess competition within the fhlbank system , such as data on the advance terms that holding company subsidiaries may receive from different fhlbanks . such data would also help fhfb assess the potential risks associated with multidistrict membership . fhfb carries out its oversight responsibilities through , among other means , annual examinations and off - site monitoring . during the examination process , fhfb examiners review a range of activities at each fhlbank , such as its asset and liability management , collateral management practices , and compliance with relevant laws and regulations . off - site monitoring is typically carried out by fhfb headquarters staff and involves the review of financial data that provides information and insights into the safety and soundness of the fhlbanks . regular off - site monitoring between annual examinations is important because the fhlbanks' financial conditions and risks can change significantly in a short period . off - site monitoring can help target examination reviews towards emerging risks at a particular fhlbank or across the system . in reviewing advance pricing term compliance , fhfb examiners are responsible for determining whether the fhlbanks price their advances above the cost of issuing debt , the fhlbank's member products policy clearly outlines the standards and criteria for differential pricing , and the fhlbanks apply these standards and criteria consistently and without discrimination to all members . in reviewing collateral compliance , fhfb examination teams look at the policies the fhlbanks use to conduct their collateral verification site visits and the agreements they use to perfect their liens . officials from one large thrift holding company with whom we spoke said that there are balance sheet management hurdles associated with the sale of assets from one subsidiary to another . for example , the officials said that asset sales may involve “de - pledging” assets pledged as collateral to secure advances at one fhlbank and pledge them to another fhlbank . subsidiaries meeting the sister bank requirements must also ensure that the sale of assets meets bank regulatory agency capital requirements .
