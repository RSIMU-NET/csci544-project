usda has not approved a vaccine for hpai . according to usda , current ai vaccines are only effective about 60% of the time in chickens . effectiveness in turkeys is still being evaluated . the southeast poultry research lab ( seprl ) , part of usda's agricultural research service ( ars ) , develops and evaluates ai vaccines . according to testimony by dr. david swayne of seprl before the senate agriculture committee , for the next several months the lab will be working on vaccines and vaccination protocols for use in the fall . the challenge for vaccine development is finding one that will be effective against circulating h5 strains , recognizing that the strains change over time . the experience of countries using vaccines for h5n1 strains ( 99% of h5n1 vaccines are used in china , egypt , vietnam , and indonesia ) shows that vaccines fail , effectiveness diminishes over time , and resistance develops . also , some producers believed that some aphis contractors ( aphis has employed 3,000 ) were not well trained and provided incorrect information . aphis indicated that it plans to address communication issues in the future by assigning one aphis employee to work with each producer dealing with an outbreak from the start to finish of the process . also , aphis plans to embed an aphis employee with each contractor team . the use of vaccines negatively affects exports of poultry products . according to aphis , some trading partners have stated that if the united states adopts a vaccination policy , they would immediately ban shipments of u.s. poultry products . the trading partners would conduct risk assessments of u.s. vaccination policy before allowing shipments to resume . aphis is already engaging with other countries to mitigate impacts on trade if the usda changes its policy . in order to address the trade issue , seprl is engaged in research to distinguish whether immunity in a bird is due to infection or vaccination . this concept has been demonstrated experimentally but is less successful in the field . the poultry industry is divided over whether or not vaccines should be used to fight hpai outbreaks . the united egg producers ( uep ) position is one of caution about vaccine use , in part due to trade issues , and also because the three - vaccine regime in a laying hen would mean increased contact with the birds in the houses . handling hens during production could cause a decrease in egg output . other witnesses from the turkey and egg sectors were ready to adopt vaccines as a tool to use against hpai . usda's june 2015 epidemiological report identified pathways for the transmission of hpai . besides wild birds shedding the ai virus , aphis found that hpai may have been spread through lax biosecurity measures . these include sharing of equipment and employees between infected and non - infected farms , the inadequate cleaning of vehicles moving between farms , and the presence of rodents or small wild birds inside poultry barns . aphis also found that environmental factors could play a role as the hpai virus was found in air samples that could be transmitted by wind to other farms .
