such a requirement invited litigation about what was or was not contemplated by the parties . any congressional recognition of an expedited dispute resolution system at the time the faa was drafted would be undermined by this additional litigation . in 2001 , the court confirmed that the faa also covers employment agreements that require arbitration to resolve work - related disputes . in circuit city stores , inc. v. adams , the court held in a 5-4 opinion authored by justice kennedy that an employment application that included a mandatory arbitration provision was not excluded from the faa's coverage pursuant to the statute's exemption clause . section 1 of the faa provides that it will not apply to "contracts of employment of seamen , railroad employees , or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. the court concluded that the section 1 exemption clause should be given a narrow construction , and interpreted it to apply only to contracts with seamen , railroad employees , and other transportation employees . according to the court , a reading of the phrase "any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce" to exclude all employment contracts from the faa's coverage would undermine the statute's specific enumeration of the "seamen" and "railroad employees" categories . the court observed: construing the residual phrase to exclude all employment contracts fails to give independent effect to the statute's enumeration of the specific categories of workers which precedes it ; there would be no need for congress to use the phrases "seamen" and "railroad employees" if those same classes of workers were subsumed within the meaning of the "engaged in ... commerce" residual clause . the court also noted that the faa's exclusion of contracts involving seamen and rail employees was reasonable given the adoption of federal legislation , such as the shipping commissioners act of 1872 and the transportation act of 1920 , that provided for the arbitration of their disputes . in light of these laws , the court opined that the exclusion would allow "established or developing statutory dispute resolution schemes" to remain undisturbed . during the late 1990s , major companies began to restrict the availability of classwide arbitration in their consumer and employment - related mandatory arbitration agreements . in 1999 , for example , ten major banks that issue credit cards reportedly formed a group to promote the use of class arbitration waivers . the increased use of such waivers has been criticized by some who contend that they have undermined challenges to practices such as predatory lending and wage theft . others emphasize , however , that class arbitration waivers do not prohibit individual actions , and that employment disputes , in particular , are generally individualized and otherwise not appropriate for class or collective action . the court has considered the enforcement of arbitration agreements that include class or collective action waivers in some of its most recent cases . as noted , in concepcion , the court concluded that an arbitration agreement that allowed only individual arbitration to resolve disputes was enforceable and not covered by the faa's saving clause .
