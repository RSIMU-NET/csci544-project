the followingsection briefly describes some of these programs . in november 1991 , congress allocated $400 million in department of defense funds to help the former soviet republics secure their nuclear weapons . the funds were to provide russia,ukraine , belarus , and kazakhstan assistance in 1 ) the transportation , storage , safeguarding anddestruction of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and the dismantlement of missiles andlaunchers ; 2 ) the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; and , 3 ) theprevention of diversion of weapons - related scientific expertise . although some members havequestioned the benefits and administration ctr program , congress has consistently supported itscentral objectives , allocating between $300 and $475 million each year since the program'sinception . during its first decade , the ctr program allocated most of its funds to projects that were designed to help russia , ukraine , belarus , and kazakhstan eliminate strategic offensive nuclearweapons limited by the start treaty . it has also helped improve the safety and security of nuclearwarheads in transit and in storage . the program has also provided funding to help russia build afacility to dispose of its chemical weapons ; this project has proven far more controversial incongress than projects aimed at the elimination of strategic offensive nuclear weapons . forexample , congress denied funding for this project in fy2000 and fy2001 . the bush administration conducted a wide - ranging review of u.s. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in russia during its first year in office . many analysts expected thisreview to lead to reductions in funding and the elimination of some projects . the administration,however , concluded that the programs did serve u.s. national security interests ; it identified severalefforts that would receive added funding . at the same , time , though , the administration altered thestated objectives of the program . past legislation had stated that the ctr program should providerussia , ukraine , belarus , and kazakhstan assistance in the transportation , storage , safeguarding anddestruction of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and the dismantlement of missiles andlaunchers , the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; and the prevention ofdiversion of weapons - related scientific expertise . the program's new objectives are to dismantleweapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure in the former soviet union ; consolidate and secure weapons of mass destruction and related technologies and materials ; increasetransparency and encourage higher standards of conduct , and support defense and militarycooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation . although these new objectives may notalter ctr priorities in the near - term , the potential exists for significant changes in the future . inparticular , funding may shift away from the transportation , storage , and elimination of nuclearweapons towards efforts to secure and eliminate chemical and biological weapons . furthermore , the new emphasis on encouraging "higher standards of conduct" confirms that administration's added interest in conditioning u.s. assistance on policies and activities pursuedby the recipient nations . this focus was evident in bush administration policies in early 2002 whenthe administration stated that it would not certify that russia was committed to its arms controlobligations under the chemical weapons and biological weapons conventions .
