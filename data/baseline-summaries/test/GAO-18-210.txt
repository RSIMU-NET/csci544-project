( recommendation 3 ) . these systems and their functions are described in table 2 . health care providers submit medicare fee - for - service claims to the macs . the claims are reviewed to check if the claim is in a valid format , if the requestor is valid , and whether it is a duplicate . in addition , macs process claims in the fiscal intermediary shared systems , multi - carrier system , vips medicare system , and common working file . processing includes adjudicating claims , checking whether the services are covered by medicare , and determining the price that should be paid to the provider for the service . the links between external entities and cms systems can take several different paths . figure 3 shows how these entities are connected to cms systems in order to obtain and use medicare beneficiary data . researchers use medicare beneficiary data to study how healthcare services are provided to beneficiaries . examples of research entities include universities and colleges , non - profit research institutes , and policy research organizations . cms offers researchers a broad range of data on the medicare program to support research on current and future spending , past and present enrollment , and claims , which can benefit the public through improved delivery of healthcare services . research performed using this data may also assist cms in monitoring , managing , and improving medicare programs and services to beneficiaries . to obtain medicare data from cms , researchers must apply for access to a specific dataset , such as the carrier file which includes claims for services provided by physicians and other non - institutional providers . in the application , the researcher provides information explaining how the data are to be used and stored , and cms reviews and approves ( or denies ) the application . the researcher then enters a data use agreement with cms for access to specific sets of medicare beneficiary data , which are to be used only for stated research objectives . the data use agreement specifies which beneficiary data can be accessed , for what purpose , the duration of access , and data protection and confidentiality requirements . unless the agreement authorizes the release of the data in accordance with cms policy , it is not to be released by the researcher . as of october 2017 , 195 research entities had received medicare data . researchers access medicare beneficiary data in one of two ways . to gain access from their computers , they connect to cms's chronic conditions warehouse / virtual research data center ( ccw / vrdc ) through a cms - provided secure network connection . within the ccw / vrdc , researchers are given access to an individually tailored computing environment containing only copies of the specific sets of beneficiary data they have been authorized to use . researchers can then conduct their analysis on the data using software tools provided by cms within this secure environment . researchers can also access data by having it shipped to them in encrypted form through the u.s. mail . once it has been received , researchers decrypt the data and load it into their own information systems for analysis .
