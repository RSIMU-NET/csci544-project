this matched the fy2015 level . the committee continued to fund firefighter assistance under its own account , and declined the administration's request to place firefighter assistance under the state and local programs account . section 552 of the reported bill continued to grant fema waiver authority from certain safer requirements . since fy2009 , waiver authority in annual appropriations bills has allowed safer grants to be used to retain firefighters , and has allowed dhs to waive cost - sharing and other requirements . in the accompanying report , the committee directed fema to work with stakeholders and present a recommendation to the committee no later than the submission of the fy2017 budget on the feasibility of removing these waivers in future appropriations . the committee also stated its expectation that funding for rural fire departments remain consistent with their previous five - year history , and directed fema to brief the committee if there is a fluctuation . the house appropriations committee bill provided $680 million in firefighter assistance , including $340 million for afg and $340 million for safer . this matched the fy2015 level as well as the senate appropriations committee level . as did the senate - reported bill , the house - reported bill continued to fund firefighter assistance under its own separate account . however , unlike the senate - reported bill and the administration's budget proposal , the house bill did not provide for safer waiver authority in fy2016 . under current law ( fire grant reauthorization act of 2012 , title xviii of p.l . 112-239 ) , fema has permanent authority to grant safer waivers , but only in cases of demonstrated economic hardship . division f of p.l . 114-113 included the requested authorization to use fees collected to support fps operations , and a requirement for submission of a strategic human capital plan . the explanatory statement did not contradict or amend the house report's requirement for the omb certification that collected fees would fully fund fps operations . the disaster relief fund ( drf ) is the main account used to fund a wide variety of programs , grants , and other forms of emergency and disaster assistance to states , local governments , certain nonprofit entities , and families and individuals affected by disasters . the drf is a no - year account â€” unused funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next fiscal year . the administration generally requests funding for the drf based on what fema plans to spend on all past declared catastrophic events , plus the 10-year average for non - catastrophic events , and a reserve to prevent shortfalls . funding currently provided to the drf can be broken out into two categories . this reduction is not explained in the explanatory statement . the omnibus provided $2 million for a three - year strategic plan that would guide future vulnerability assessments and the regional resiliency assessment program . it also appropriated an additional $4 million to expedite the development of a new critical infrastructure database ( as part of the sector management and governance ppa ) . the omnibus appropriated $819 million for cybersecurity programs , slightly more than what was requested .
