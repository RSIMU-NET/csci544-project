appointees were not included in the dataset twice . further , if an appointee left the administration prior to the plum book 's publication , then they do not appear in the data . political appointees included in the dataset represented 15 cabinet departments and were paid at the gs - 13 level or higherâa pay rate generally considered to have supervisory authority in the executive branch . table 2 lists the cabinet departments included in this study and the number of employees from that cabinet department included in the dataset . for most individuals and industries , data on both pregovernment and postgovernment service is not readily obtainable from public sources . therefore , this report uses official lobbying disclosure act ( lda ) data on registered lobbyists to gain insight into the revolving door phenomenon . administered by the clerk of the house of representatives and the secretary of the senate , lda registration data are required by law to be published online . the lda database includes all registration and disclosure statements for lobbyists and is searchable by name , lobbying firm , or lobbying client . since the plum book provides the names of former executive branch officials , the lda database was searched to match pregovernment and postgovernment service of individuals registered as lobbyists . appointees were classified as lobbyists if they were registered under lda at any time before or after their government service , regardless of the duration of their registration . these data , which reflect a subset of people who move between employment in the private sector and government in either direction , are the focus of this report's analysis . in every administration , individuals move between the public and private sectors . in recent years , there has been greater focus on potential additional restrictions that might be placed on individuals entering and exiting government through the introduction of legislation to amend current revolving door restrictions and the issuance of executive orders to temporarily increase the "cooling off" period for executive branch appointees . current law compartmentalizes the revolving door by placing distinctive postemployment restrictions on different types of government employees . for example , restrictions on government officials engaged in contracting do not necessarily apply to nonprocurement or noncontracting employees . such varying restrictions were enacted because "the present complexity and size of executive departments require occasional separate treatment of certain departmental agencies and bureaus . it would be patently unfair in some cases to apply the one year no contact prohibition to certain employees for the purpose of an entire departmentâwhen , in reality , the agency in which he worked was separate and distinct from the larger entity. in past congresses , legislation has been introduced to lengthen revolving door "cooling off" periods . those measures often propose extending "cooling off" periods to as few as two years to instituting a lifetime ban . if enacted , increased restrictions could serve to diminish the interaction between former government officials and government agencies and could reduce the appeal of leaving the government for a private - sector position .
