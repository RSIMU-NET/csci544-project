provided . we then categorized the remaining activities into three broad types: ( 1 ) activities related to conventional carbon mitigation efforts that are directly applicable to a proposed geoengineering approach , although not designated as such ; ( 2 ) activities related to improving basic scientific understanding of earth systems , processes , or technologies that could be applied generally to geoengineering ; and ( 3 ) activities designed specifically to address a proposed geoengineering approach that does not overlap with a conventional carbon mitigation strategy . we sent the results of our analysis and categorization of agency - reported activities to each agency for their review and verification in july 2010 . specifically , we asked agency officials to ensure that the data were complete and accurate , and that our categorization of the data was appropriate . each agency verified our analysis . in addition , we met with officials and staff from interagency bodies coordinating federal responses to climate change , including the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , council on environmental quality ( ceq ) , and usgcrp , as well as the department of energy ( doe ) , which coordinates the climate change technology program â€” a multiagency research and development program for climate change technology . we assessed the reliability of the data and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report . , ( 5 ) water desalinization project using solar energy , ( 6 ) internationally collaborating with china to foster emissions mitigation research , ( 7 ) developing technology to facilitate the conversion of methane gas to liquid fuel , and five activities to develop technologies related to biofuels . based on their description , we determined that these 12 activities did not appear relevant to identified cdr or srm approaches . each expert from the initial list based on the three criteria noted above . based on this process , we selected the 8 highest scoring experts and contacted them for interviews . we selected 8 experts because the scoring process created a natural break between the 8 highest scoring experts and the remaining experts . to assess potential conflicts of interest , we asked each expert to submit a conflict of interest form . in 2006 , the parties to the london protocol agreed to amend the protocol to include , in certain circumstances , co streams for sequestration in sub - seabed geological formations in the protocol's list of wastes and other matter that could be dumped . under the amendment , co stream consists overwhelmingly of co ( 3 ) no wastes or other matter are added for the purpose of disposing of those wastes or other matter . the parties also developed specific guidelines for countries to use when assessing whether applications for disposal of streams into sub - seabed geological formations is consistent with the protocol . in late 2009 , the parties to the london protocol adopted an amendment to allow the export of co streams for disposal in certain circumstances . the parties are developing specific guidance for these exports and issues related to the management of transboundary movement of co sequestration in sub - seabed geological formations .
