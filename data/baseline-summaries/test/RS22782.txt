the rate of return was 13.4% in fy2017 . the trust's annual rates of return have generally compared favorably to its benchmarks . railroad retirement benefits are divided into two tiers . tier i benefits are generally computed using the social security benefit formula , on the basis of earnings covered by either the railroad retirement or social security programs . in some cases , rrb tier i benefits can be higher than comparable social security benefits . for example , rrb beneficiaries may receive unreduced tier i retirement benefits as early as aged 60 if they have at least 30 years of railroad service ; social security beneficiaries may receive unreduced retirement benefits only when they reach their full retirement ages , currently rising from aged 65 to 67 . rrb tier ii benefits are similar to private pension benefits and are based only on railroad work . the tier i railroad retirement benefit that is equivalent to social security benefits is mainly finance by tier i payroll taxes ( typically the same rate as the 12.4% social security payroll tax ) and social security's financial interchange transfers . tier ii benefits , tier i benefits in excess of social security benefits , and supplemental annuities are mainly financed by tier ii payroll taxes ( currently 13.1% on employers and 4.9% on employees ) and transfers from the national railroad retirement investment trust ( nrrit ; hereinafter , the trust ) . beginning in 2002 , tier ii tax revenues in excess of obligatory benefits and associated administrative costs have been transferred from the railroad retirement accounts to the trust , which is invested in private stocks , bonds , and other investments . prior to the railroad retirement and survivors' improvement act of 2001 ( rrsia ; p.l . 107-90 ) , surplus railroad retirement assets could be invested only in u.s. government securities â€” just as the social security trust funds must be invested . the rrsia established the trust to manage and invest assets in the railroad retirement account in much the same way that the assets of private - sector retirement plans are invested . the rrb also receives transfers from the trust , as needed , to pay railroad retirement and survivor benefits . assets in the social security equivalent benefits account , which are used for rrb tier i benefits that are equivalent to social security benefits , continue to be invested solely in u.s. government bonds , as required by law . since february 2002 when railroad retirement funds were first invested through the trust , a total of $21.3 billion has been transferred to the trust from the rrb , and $21.1 billion in earnings have been transferred from the trust to the rrb to pay railroad benefits and administrative expenses . from its inception to the end of fy2017 , the trust has earned a total of $26.3 billion . at the end of fy2017 , the market value of the trust's managed assets was $26.5 billion . to date , the trust's average annual performance slightly exceeds expectations expressed by the rrsia's drafters , which had assumed that trust investments would earn an average annual rate of return of 8.0% .
