social policies . some social policies , such as medicare and medicaid , are oriented to health improvements . both programs were designed to increase access to health care for vulnerable populations , the elderly and the poor , with the ultimate goal of improving health for these groups . other social policies , such as social security , affect income , and may affect health and well - being through that channel . finally , some social policies may affect health by changing the access that people have to already - established resources . what program changes are required to ensure the continued viability of such programs as the number of beneficiaries increases ? what will be the federal government's role in an environment of competing demands for limited resources ? as seen in table 1 and appendix b table b - 1 , life expectancy at birth increased dramatically over the past century in the united statesâfrom 49.2 years ( the average for 1900-1902 ) to 77.5 years in 2003 , the most recent year for which official data have been released by the centers for disease control ( cdc ) / national center for health statistics ( nchs ) . gains in longevity were fastest in the first half of the 20 th century . these advances were largely attributed to "an enormous scientific breakthroughâthe germ theory of disease" which led to the eradication and control of numerous infectious and parasitic diseases , especially among infants and children . the new theory led to an entirely new approach to preventative medicine , practiced both by departments of public health and by individuals . beginning in the 1940s , the control of infectious diseases was also aided by the increasing distribution and usage of antibiotics , including penicillin and sulfa drugs . since mid - century , advances in life expectancy have largely been attributable to improvements in the prevention and control of the chronic diseases of adulthood . in particular , death rates from two of the three major causes of death in 1950âdiseases of the heart ( i.e. , coronary heart disease , hypertensive heart disease , and rheumatic heart disease ) and cerebrovascular diseases ( stroke ) âhave fallen by approximately 60% and 70% , respectively , on an age - adjusted basis since 1950 ( see table 2 ) , improvements that the cdc has characterized as "one of the most important public health achievements of the 20 th century. the cdc attributes the declines in diseases of the heart and cerebrovascular diseases to a combination of medical advances , including âdiscoveries in diagnosing and treating heart disease and stroke ; âdevelopment of effective medications for treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia ; âgreater numbers of specialists and health - care providers focusing on cardiovascular diseases ; âan increase in emergency medical services for heart attack and stroke ; and âan increase in coronary - care units . changes in individually controlled behaviors , including âdeclines in cigarette smoking ; âdecreases in mean blood pressure levels ; âan increase in persons with hypertension who have the condition treated and controlled ; âa decrease in mean blood cholesterol levels ; and âchanges in the american diet ( reductions in the consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol ) .
