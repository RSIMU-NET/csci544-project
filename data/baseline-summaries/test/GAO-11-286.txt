( see app . i for additional information on our scope and methodology. ) the following are examples of some of the limitations of fda's oversight approach of reviewing records and other documentation of foreign processors as required by haccp and limited effectiveness of its foreign country assessments . as described in fda's inspection reports for three chilean salmon processing facilities in 2008 , fda's review of their records during the inspectors' visits to these facilities revealed that , contrary to haccp regulations , they had received fish farm products that had been treated with oxolinic acid , flumequine , or emamectin benzoate — drugs unapproved for use in aquaculture in the united states . according to fda documents , the agency placed all three facilities on an import alert for failing to comply with haccp . fda removed one of these facilities from the import alert 14 days later and the other two facilities several weeks later after they made changes to their respective haccp plans . fda , however , could not provide documents detailing the changes these facilities made in order for fda to remove them from the import alert . we visited the european commission ( brussels , belgium ) and its inspection office — the food and veterinary office ( grange , ireland ) — to gain a better understanding of its programs and oversight controls for seafood imports . during the visit , we met with officials from the belgian and irish governments to learn about their drug residue testing programs for seafood imports . in addition , we visited a government laboratory in ghent , belgium , and rinville , ireland , each to learn about the analytical methods available to detect drug residues in seafood products . we also visited the port of antwerp ( antwerp , belgium ) , the largest port of entry for seafood products in the eu , to learn about oversight controls for seafood imports . we visited the port of new york / newark in newark , new jersey , the largest port of entry for seafood products on the east coast , and met with customs and border protection to learn about its activities related to ensuring the safety of seafood imports . we also visited a cold storage facility — in close vicinity to the new york / newark port and where fsis inspectors are stationed — to learn about the measures fsis uses to ensure the safety of imported meat and poultry products . during the same trip , we visited fda's northeast laboratory in jamaica , new york , and a customs and border protection's laboratory in newark to learn about the analytical methods available to detect drug residues in seafood products . we visited fda's and nmfs' laboratories that specialize in seafood research — fda's gulf coast seafood laboratory ( dauphin island , alabama ) and nmfs's national seafood inspection laboratory ( pascagoula , mississippi ) — to learn about the research the agencies are conducting on drug residues in seafood products .
