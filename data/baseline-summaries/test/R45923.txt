accident investigation . the coast guard employs 158 accident investigatorsâ120 military and 38 civilianâwho conduct casualty investigations of u.s. - and foreign - flag vessels to detect and correct safety hazards , prepare investigation reports , analyze trends , and recommend enforcement action . these two assignments fall under the coast guard's prevention policy workforce headed by the assistant commandant for prevention policy , a rear admiral . reporting to the assistant commandant is the director of inspections and compliance , a captain , who oversees the office of commercial vessel compliance and the office of investigations and casualty analysis , among other safety - related offices . the prevention policy workforce is especially critical for the commercial u.s. - flag fleet because a majority of this fleet is much older than the 15 to 20 years of age at which ships in the worldwide oceangoing fleet are typically scrapped . about 60% of the 217 ships in the dry - cargo u.s. - flag commercial fleet and 53% of u.s. - flag offshore supply vessels ( which service oil rigs ) are older than 20 years ; the el faro had been in service for 40 years . some 72% of the 1,497 vessels in the u.s. - flag passenger and ferry fleet are over 20 years old . in general , older vessels require more frequent inspection ; the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) raised questions about the quality of the coast guard's inspections in its investigation of the el faro sinking , after which the coast guard revoked the safety certificate for another vessel of the same design and similar age , forcing its removal from service . generally , inspections of vessels carrying passengers or hazardous cargo , and inspections of older vessels , are more frequent than inspections of general - cargo vessels and newer vessels . vessels transporting cargo or passengers domestically ( from one u.s. point to another u.s. point ) must be u.s. - built , as required by the jones act . the cost of u.s. - built vessels , particularly deep - draft ships , can be multiples of world prices , which may retard vessel replacement . u.s. - flag vessels on international voyages need not be u.s. - built , and this fleet is younger than the jones act fleet . congress's request for information about the coast guard's inspection staff comes at a time when the number of vessels requiring inspection is increasing by about 50% because towing vessels have been added to the list . congress has been increasing the agency's role in fishing vessel safety as well , putting additional demands on the safety workforce . adding to the coast guard's safety responsibilities is the construction of several liquefied natural gas ( lng ) export terminals , whose siting , operations , and security are partly or entirely under coast guard jurisdiction , as well as the increasing use of lng as ship fuel . the coast guard repeatedly has made statements in recent decades laying out its plans to improve the quality of its inspection workforce .
