the house passed h.r . 1 , a full - year continuing appropriation , on february 19 , 2011 . the bill would have set new fy2011 full - year appropriations amounts for each of the military construction and family housing accounts , as indicated in table a - 1 and table a - 2 in the appendix . nevertheless , the bill failed passage in the senate . a second full - year continuing appropriation , including funding for military construction , was introduced to the house on april 11 as division b of h.r . 1473 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 . military construction appropriations levels in that bill are also included in this report's tables . with the exception of new construction projects , dod may be assumed to be obligating funds in each account at a rate commensurate with its fy2010 appropriation . when a final appropriation for fy2011 is enacted , the various defense agencies and military departments will have to adjust their spending rates to end the fiscal year without exceeding their newly enacted budget authority . the president submitted his fy2012 appropriation request for military construction and family housing to congress on february 14 , 2011 . the overall level of funding represents a 26.2% ( $5.2 billion ) reduction below the combined title i ( military construction ) and title iv ( overseas contingency operations construction ) amount requested for fy2011 . the major portion of that reduction ( 40.2% ) comes from the $2.1 billion less in brac 2005 funding needed to support the first post - implementation year of that program . the president's fy2012 request is less than one - quarter of the amount needed during the last year of brac construction and movement . much of the rest of the reduction ( $1.6 billion ) can be found in the reduced request for active component military construction , primarily drawn from the navy and marine corps account ( $1.4 billion ) . the president also requested no funds for the overseas contingency operations construction account . this represented $1.3 billion in his fy2011 request . even though the base budget request includes $80 million in construction for afghanistan , this would mark a substantial reduction in construction activity in the area of the most intense u.s. military operations . as members of congress and the defense committees consider additional continuing appropriations for fy2011 and the president's request for fy2012 , a number of questions may suggest themselves: to what extent does the delay in a fiscal year appropriation disrupt executive branch planning and commitment of construction funds ? can dod or the military departments efficiently obligate construction funds under a continuing appropriation ? how , and to what extent , will limits on government debt impact both the timing and the number of military construction projects that can be undertaken ? what are the possible secondary effects of a government operations shutdown should the continuing appropriations expire ? does the prohibition on congressionally directed spending ( "earmarks" ) limit congress's ability to exercise its constitutional power to "raise and support armies" and "provide and maintain a navy," and if so , how and to what extent ?
