iii. ) amtrak predicated the growth strategy on the acquisition of significant new revenue from hauling mail and express cargo and estimated that it would result in $65.6 million in net revenue through fiscal year 2002 . in february 2000 , amtrak announced to congress that it was going to implement the 15 routes in the network growth strategy . amtrak has been unsuccessful in implementing its network growth strategy . about 2 years after announcing the network growth strategy , amtrak has cancelled 9 of the 15 planned route actions without implementing them . amtrak implemented three route actions , although it cancelled one of these in september 2001 . finally , amtrak plans to proceed with 3 other route actions , although their implementation will be at least 1 or 2 years later than originally planned . ( see table 1. ) according to amtrak , the capital funds for one of the projects in planning ( silver service restructuring in florida ) were frozen on february 1 , 2002 , in a company - wide effort to reduce use of cash . ( in all , amtrak cancelled nine routes without implementing them . some routes were cancelled for more than one reason. ) amtrak told us that it cancelled six of the network growth strategy routes before they were implemented , in part , because it overestimated expected increases to mail and express revenue under the network growth strategy . amtrak estimated that this expected increase would improve amtrak's bottom line by $65.6 million through fiscal year 2002 . specifically , it estimated that mail and express revenues would exceed costs by $68.2 million , offsetting a loss of $2.6 million from expanded passenger operations . most of the revenue increase was expected to come from new express business . this expanded mail and express traffic did not materialize and amtrak's revised plans have reduced expected network growth strategy - associated mail and express revenue by about half — from $271 million to $139 million ( a $132 million reduction ) . amtrak said that there were several reasons why this overestimation occurred . the current president of amtrak's mail and express unit told us that amtrak expected to substantially expand its route system to generate this revenue and to begin running longer trains mostly filled with express traffic . however , he said that at the time amtrak made its mail and express revenue estimates , it gave little thought to whether such an expansion was feasible — that is , whether amtrak could likely capture this business or whether freight railroads that own the tracks would agree to amtrak's expansion plans . according to amtrak , it did not have a rigorous approach to estimating expected express business . amtrak officials told us that , until recently , amtrak estimated express revenue largely on the basis of an analysis of a database of commodities being shipped nationally . amtrak estimated the portion of this business that it thought it could obtain . an amtrak official said that it now focuses more on determining existing customers' shipping needs , assessing these needs in light of current economic trends , and evaluating amtrak's ability to meet these needs given existing train capacity .
