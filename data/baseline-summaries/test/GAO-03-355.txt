we did not test the reliability of the data . we used the computerized records to compare on - hand and on - order inventories to requirements on an item - by - item basis to determine if items had sufficient inventory available to satisfy requirements . dod reported that its secondary inventory was valued at $63.3 billion in its september 30 , 2001 , supply system inventory report . for our analyses , we used inventory stratification files and reports . we did not revalue the inventory that needs to be repaired to recognize the repair cost , and we did not value inventory that is to be disposed of at salvage prices . as a result , demand for the $275,000 hub increased from 31 a year in 1999 to 74 a year in 2001 . changes in stock , overhaul , or operational policies resulted in requirements increases of $126 million for 36 items . for example , repair cycle requirements for a radio transmitter modulator increased from 10 in september 1999 to 22 in september 2001 . the increase was a result of the navy requiring that the transmitter modulator , valued at $136,000 each , be operational 100 percent of the time . previously , ships were permitted to operate in a degraded status with the modulator not operational . source and repair issues for 29 items resulted in requirements increases of $137 million . a wide variety of reasons fell into this category , including entering requirements for an item that would no longer be available to provide support for a weapon system for its remaining life , difficulties in identifying a commercial source for an item , unavailability of material needed to manufacture items , and increased time needed to repair or buy an item . for example , economic order quantity requirements for a data module used in a submarine control panel increased from 75 in september 1999 to 410 in september 2001 . the item manager explained that the manufacturing source of supply for the data module was being lost , and the requirement was increased to protect the 419 on - hand modules from being subject to disposal . in august 2002 , the navy had 229 of the $10,000 modules on hand . uncertainty of demand , lead time , and the rate at which items wear out for 22 items resulted in safety level requirements increasing by $72 million . safety level requirements are intended to compensate for unplanned increases in demand , lead times , and the rate at which items wear out . for example , the safety level requirement for an inertial navigational unit used on several aircraft such as the av - 8b , the f - 14d , and several versions of the f - 18 increased from 2 in september 1999 to 15 in september 2001 . the increased requirement was the result of demands for the $170,000 unit increasing from 155 to 205 a year . requirements increases , valued at $98 million , were not valid for seven items . the reasons for the invalid requirements included overstating the 2001 requirement , understating the 1999 requirement , and inappropriately recording nonrecurring requirements .
