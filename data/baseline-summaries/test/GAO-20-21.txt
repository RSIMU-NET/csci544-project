( recommendation 3 ) . we provided a draft of this report to the department of labor ( dol ) for review and comment . dol concluded that these entities were insured . however , the insurers had not properly reported the federal black lung endorsement on new policies or subsequent renewals , in addition to other reporting issues . one of these six operators also had , inadvertently , not maintained adequate commercial coverage for its mining operations in texas , and had not self - insured those operations . in this instance , the operator obtained an excess loss policy that only pays claims once they exceed a high threshold and , therefore , is not sufficient by itself to secure the payment of the operator's benefit liabilities . dol data does not include information on excess loss policies and , while the data ncci provides on standard workers' compensation policies with federal black lung endorsements lists operators' addresses , they do not provide the specific states for which endorsements apply . designing processes to achieve agency objectives and respond to risks is a principle of effective internal controls . without a process to monitor operator compliance with program insurance requirements , dol risks not identifying a lapse or cancellation of operator coverage . this could result in the trust fund having to assume responsibility for paying benefits that would otherwise have been paid by an insurer . the coal tax rate has varied over the years . specifically , we interviewed dol and ncci officials on how policy data is obtained , processed , stored , and shared ; reviewed documentation including a data dictionary and users guide ; reviewed dol's procedures and error checks for validating that the ncci data conforms to established parameters ; and reviewed the data for obvious errors , outliers , or missing information and for logical connections between policy and endorsement data . we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report . however , we concluded that the beneficiary data we reviewed in an attempt to determine the extent to which the trust fund paid benefits during fiscal year 2018 on behalf of uninsured operators were not sufficiently complete and consistently recorded . thus , we were unable to assess the effect on the trust fund of dol not monitoring coal operator compliance with commercial insurance requirements . this condition and its causes are further described in the report , which form the basis for one of our recommendations . we also examined workers' compensation insurance practices in four states — kentucky , pennsylvania , west virginia , and wyoming — to identify relevant practices that could inform dol's administration of coal operator insurance at the federal level . such practices may be informative because both workers' compensation and federal black lung disability payments generally support workers with conditions , such as black lung , that were contracted as a result of their employment . workers' compensation is generally mandated by state law and employers are typically required to purchase workers' compensation insurance to secure these liabilities , or may self - insure .
