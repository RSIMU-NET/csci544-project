no further action has been taken . the bill would make numerous changes to the way that the public buildings service ( pbs ) — the office within gsa responsible for real property management — constructs and leases space , reports on the size and cost of gsa's portfolio , and tracks administrative expenses , such as travel and conference costs . the provisions that relate specifically to the prospectus approval process are discussed below . while gsa may be commonly referred to as "the government's landlord," it only controls approximately 422 million square feet in buildings , which represents about 12.6% of the government's 3.354 billion total building square footage . there may be oversight provisions that would be useful if they applied to all federal landholding agencies , or at least the 24 large agencies commonly referred to as the chief financial officer act ( cfo act ) agencies , which control 3.302 billion square feet in federal buildings . there are several committees that are considering real property reform bills which share some of the core objectives of h.r . 2612 — reducing inventory , increasing transparency , and controlling costs — but which would apply to a broader range of federal landholders . particular provisions that do not appear in these government - wide real property reform bills but that committees might consider incorporating could include the required offset of new space , zero - based space - justification , and additional cost - escalation warnings . by the same token , there may be provisions in active legislation which , if enacted , could provide mechanisms for implementing provisions of h.r . several bills propose increased public reporting of agency real - property data or providing public access to gsa's federal real property profile , an existing database which contains a great deal of information about owned and leased properties government - wide . a publicly accessible , government - wide real - property database , if established , might be able to incorporate additional information as proposed in h.r . 2612 , such as lease data , as well as data that are not specifically required by h.r . 2612 or other reform bills but which might be a valuable cost - assessment tool — an alternative analysis of all proposed leases which would compare the cost of leasing versus owning new space over a 20- or 30-year period . under authorities provided in 40 u.s.c . § 3307 , gsa establishes annual prospectus thresholds for four different types of real property activities . a description of each threshold is provided in table 1 below . gsa has the authority to adjust these thresholds each year in order "to reflect a percentage increase or decrease in construction costs during the prior calendar year. gsa adjusts the thresholds based on the building cost index of the engineering news - record , an industry trade journal published by mcgraw - hill . as noted , for each project that meets or exceeds the appropriate threshold , gsa must submit a prospectus to the authorizing committees . each committee must pass a resolution approving the prospectus before the project is authorized to receive appropriations .
