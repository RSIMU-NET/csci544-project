( app . i describes the three classes. ) generally , under igra , indian tribes may establish class iii gaming , such as roulette , craps , slot machines , and blackjack , on indian lands as long as the proposed gaming is not prohibited in the state . igra requires that tribes sign written agreements , or compacts , with the states if the proposed gaming meets the definition of class iii gaming operations ( hereafter referred to as tribal casinos ) . officials at the ngcb and casino officials we interviewed told us that they strongly believe that the prohibited transactions specifically prevent and act as a deterrent to money laundering , even though they have no evidence to measure the effectiveness of the prohibitions . according to testimony by an irs official in 1993 , money laundering has occurred in casinos in a variety of ways , including the exchanging of large amounts of cash for casino checks and small denomination bills for larger bills . these types of transactions involving amounts over $2,500 are prohibited in nevada under regulation 6a . irs officials in the districts we visited had different opinions about prohibited transactions . irs officials from the criminal investigation and examination divisions in the new orleans district said that prohibiting certain transactions , as nevada does , would be a deterrent to money launderers . the irs gaming industry specialist in nevada told us that prohibiting certain transactions , as regulation 6a does , is a strong deterrent to money laundering . further , an irs oversight review of nevada casinos by the las vegas district in february 1992 noted that prohibiting certain transactions is one of the strengths of the nevada system . irs examination division officials told us that each of its current 63 districts has a coordinator responsible for ( 1 ) identifying nonbank financial institutions , ( 2 ) selecting / targeting for review institutions with a high potential for noncompliance , and ( 3 ) scheduling compliance reviews . according to the irs bsa compliance check handbook , when selecting institutions for a compliance review , the coordinator is to consider achieving a balanced coverage of the different types of nonbank financial institutions , including casinos . in addition , the focus should be on institutions with a high volume of cash transactions or with abnormal cash activity . the irs examination division prepares a comprehensive currency and banking quarterly report that includes the total number ( or inventory ) of casinos subject to bsa requirements and the number of compliance reviews completed . in 1990 , a senate appropriations committee report required that irs submit this information to the committee so that it could track irs compliance efforts at nonbank financial institutions , including casinos . in december 1991 , irs reported an inventory of 146 bsa casinos with gagrs in excess of $1 million each . in december 1994 , the number of bsa casinos reported had increased to 337 . meanwhile , between october 1991 and december 1994 , irs had completed 24 bsa compliance reviews at casinos .
