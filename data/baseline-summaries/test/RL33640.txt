this question is addressed in other crs reports . it found that the united states was likely to spend $355 billion over the next 10 years on its nuclear weapons enterprise . this total included $56 billion for command , control , communications , and early warning activities and $59 billion for additional costs based on historical cost growth of similar programs . neither of these categories had been included in the administration's estimate in 2010 . when cbo considered the same categories as the administration , it estimated 10-year spending of $241 billion , a number close to the estimate provided by the administration . cbo updated its estimate in january 2015 , and reported that it calculated that the united states would spend $348 billion between 2015 and 2024 ; excluding command and control and cost growth , the total that was comparable to the administration's 2010 estimate was now $247 billion . cbo updated its report again in february 2017 , estimating that the united states would spend $400 billion on nuclear weapons between 2017 and 2026 . congress also mandated that the dod and doe provide 10-year cost estimates of the expected costs of nuclear weapons programs , and that gao evaluate the cost estimates . in july 2017 , gao released its review of the dod and doe combined report for fy2017 . the combined report estimates that the costs of sustaining and modernizing nuclear delivery systems , the nuclear command and control system , the nuclear stockpile , and the nuclear security enterprise will total $342 billion between fy2017 and fy2026 . both the cbo studies and the dod / doe reports indicate that the united states is on track to spend , on average , $35-$40 billion per year as it sustains and modernizes its nuclear weapons programs . this indicates that the united states could spend at least $1-$1.2 trillion on nuclear weapons programs and modernization over the next 30 years . this estimate is consistent with others that have been presented by organizations outside government . for example , in january 2014 , analysts at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies estimated that the united states might spend $1 trillion , or an average of just over $30 billion per year , over the next 30 years , to modernize its nuclear enterprise . in addition , in a briefing prepared in may 2013 , the air force estimated that the investments in nuclear modernization programs would peak in between 2025 and 2035 , at approximately $30 billion per year . while there appears to be a broad base of agreement about the magnitude of the costs that the united states is likely to incur as it modernizes its nuclear arsenal , there has been less agreement about whether the united states can , or should , proceed with all of these programs . many analysts have noted that , with the passage of the budget control act in 2011 , the amount of funding available for defense spending would be nearly $1 trillion lower than expected when the obama administration first outlined the nuclear modernization program . in this environment , rising costs for nuclear weapons programs could to cut into funding for other pentagon priorities .
