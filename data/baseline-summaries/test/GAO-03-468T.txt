sec agreed with the thrust of our recommendations . the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks had a devastating effect on the u.s. financial markets with significant loss of life , extensive physical damage , and considerable disruption to the financial district in new york . damage from the collapse of the world trade center buildings caused dust and debris to blanket a wide area of lower manhattan , led to severe access restrictions to portions of lower manhattan for days , and destroyed substantial portions of the telecommunications and power infrastructure that served the area . telecommunications service in lower manhattan was lost for many customers when debris from the collapse of one the world trade center buildings struck a major verizon central switching office that served approximately 34,000 business and residences . the human impact was especially devastating because about 70 percent of the civilians killed in the attacks worked in the financial services industry , and physical access to the area was severely curtailed through september 13 , 2001 . without clearly identifying strategies for recovery , determining the sound practices needed to implement these strategies , and identifying the organizations that could conduct trading under these strategies , the risk that markets may not be able to resume trading in a fair and orderly fashion and without excessive delays is increased . goals and strategies for resuming trading activities could be based on likely disaster scenarios and could identify the organizations that are able to conduct trading in the event that other organizations could not recover within a reasonable time . goals and strategies , along with guidance on business continuity planning practices , and more effective oversight would ( 1 ) provide market participants with the information they need to make better decisions about improving their operations , ( 2 ) help regulators develop sound criteria for oversight , and ( 3 ) assure investors that trading on u.s. markets could resume smoothly and in a timely manner . sec has begun developing a strategy for resuming stock trading for some exchanges , but the plan is not yet complete . for example , sec has asked the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) and nasdaq to take steps to ensure that their information systems can conduct transactions in the securities that the other organizations normally trade . however , under this strategy nyse does not plan to trade all nasdaq securities , and neither exchange has fully tested its own or its members' abilities to trade the other exchanges' securities . given the increased threats demonstrated by the september 11 attacks and the need to assure that key financial market organizations are following sound practices , securities and banking regulators' oversight programs are important mechanisms to assure that u.s. financial markets are resilient . sec oversees the key clearing organizations and exchanges through its automation review policy ( arp ) program . the arp program — which also may be used to oversee adherence to the white paper's sound practices — currently faces several limitations . sec did not implement this arp program by rule but instead expected exchanges and clearing organizations to comply with various information technology and operations practices voluntarily .
