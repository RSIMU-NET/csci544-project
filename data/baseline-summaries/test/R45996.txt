appendix a . prior year procurement by service appendix b . development timelines . congress may be concerned about the development timeline of pgms compared with development timelines of adversary a2 / ad capabilities . china and russia have developed sophisticated systems over the past 10 years , while dod has developed relatively few systems . some analysts argue that these systems can exceed dod munitions capabilities ( such as range and speed ) . for instance , in 2017 a u.s. ally used a $3 million patriot missile to engage a $300 quadcopter drone . emerging factors that may affect pgm programs . another potential issue for congress is how dod's programs for developing and procuring pgms might be affected by emerging factors such as the u.s. withdrawal from the intermediate nuclear force ( inf ) treaty ; new u.s. military operational concepts for countering chinese a2 / ad forces in the indo - pacific region , such as the army's new multi - domain operations ( mdo ) operational concept and the marine corps' new expeditionary advanced base operations ( eabo ) concept , both of which possibly feature the potential use of such weapons from island locations in the pacific as a way of countering china's a2 / ad forces ; and emerging technologies such as hypersonics and artificial intelligence ( ai ) . prior year procurement by progra . can and , if so , should dod develop new systems and at a pace that can match or exceed that of chinese or russian weapons systems ? affordability and cost - effectiveness . congress may also be concerned about the affordability of dod's plans for procuring various pgms in large numbers , and the cost - effectiveness of pgms relative to other potential means of accomplishing certain dod missions , particularly in a context of finite dod resources and competing dod program priorities . supply chain security . another potential issue for congress concerns supply chain security , meaning whether u.s. pgms incorporate components , materials , or software of foreign origin . supply chain security could affect wartime reliability of these weapons as well as the ability of the u.s. industrial base to build replacement pgms in a timely manner during an extended - duration , high - intensity conflict . defense industrial base production capacity . another potential issue for congress concerns the defense industrial base's capacity for building pgms , particularly for meeting increased demands for such weapons during an extended - duration , high - intensity conflict . planned procurement quantities and stockpile assessment . one potential issue for congress is whether dod's desired quantities of standoff munitions are appropriate . current operations have demonstrated a large demand for all types of pgms . a potential high - intensity conflict would potentially require large stockpiles of all types of weapons . several of these types of munitionsâparticularly jassm , lrasm , and aargmâare being procured in relatively small quantities , given their potential use rates in a high - intensity conflict scenario , along with the time it would take for replacement spent munitions once initial inventories are exhausted .
