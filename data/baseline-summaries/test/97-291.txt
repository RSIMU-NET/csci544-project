as discussed below , h.r . 254 ( p.l.108-215 ) ,enacted in april 2004 , authorizes several operational reforms to the nadb . the resulting study concluded that it was premature to assess any environmental effects ofnafta anddifficult to determine whether further environmental degradation at the u.s. - mexico border was due to nafta orother economicdevelopment and events . more recent studies have attributed increased border pollution and other environmentalimpacts to nafta,although the studies generally identify a number of other contributing factors . a march 2001 naaec study , north american tradeand transportation corridors: environmental impacts and mitigation , concluded that air pollution fromincreased freight traffic innafta transportation corridors is significant and could double or quadruple by 2020 . ( 3 ) relatedly , the number of assembly factoriesin mexico near the border grew from 2,114 in 1993 to 3,182 in 2003 , while employment at these plants more thandoubled to 1.07million . ( 4 ) a report by epa in 2000 , protectingthe environment of the u.s. - mexico border area , noted that the concentration ofindustry and people at the border was exacerbating pollution and health problems , and that many border citiesexpected to experienceserious water constraints by 2005 . a naaec committee recently completed a ten - year review of the environmentalside agreement,and concluded that the naaec has facilitated trinational environmental cooperation and capacity building overall,and specificallyhas fostered environmental progress in mexico . in the 107th congress , the environment - related provisions of nafta and its side accord received attention during consideration oftrade promotion authority legislation and the u.s. - jordan free trade agreement ( fta ) ; both adapted environmentalprovisions fromthe naaec and nafta . ( 5 ) some in congressexpressed particular concern regarding the effect that nafta - like investmentprovisions may have on domestic environmental protection efforts , because various investors have challengedenvironmentalmeasures as constituting a form of expropriation under the nafta investment chapter . ( 6 ) also in the 107th congress , the housepassed h.r . 5400 to authorize changes in nadb and becc operations , with a goal of increasing theseinstitutions'effectiveness . in the 108th congress , efforts to reform the becc and nadb continued , and in april 2004 , the president signed into law p.l.108-215 ( h.r . this law authorizes the president to agree to a change in the nadb'scharter topermit the bank to make below - market - rate loans and a limited amount of grants in order to increase the numberof projects theseinstitutions support . it directs the u.s. members of the nadb board of directors generally to oppose projectproposals if grantsaccount for more than 50% of the project financing or if a project is not financed in part by loans . the law alsoauthorizes extendingthe operational area of the becc / nadb on the mexican side of the border from 100 kilometers to 300 kilometers.it requires anannual report to congress , and includes a sense of the congress relating to u.s. support for water conservationprojects . in otherlegislation , the conference report to h.r . 6 , the energy bill ( section 146 ) would amend naftaimplementinglegislation to direct u.s. nadb board members to encourage the bank to finance infrastructure projects related toclean energy andenergy conservation .
