this selection of states is not generalizable to all states . we also reviewed aggregated financial data that lpi insurers report annually to state regulators to compare premiums and claims data for lpi to that of borrower - purchased insurance , but we determined that the data were unreliable for our purposes . finally , we obtained and reviewed policy - and servicer - level lpi data collected through an interagency data call to understand characteristics of the lpi market and assess lpi premium rates , but we limited our analysis to geographical data because the data were incomplete . we discuss data issues more fully later in this report . we conducted this performance audit from march 2014 to september 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . some state regulators noted that some insurers provided tracking and other services for free or below cost , benefitting the servicer , but included the costs of such services in what they charge consumers . one regulator and a consumer advocate said that some lpi insurers have purchased reinsurance at inflated prices from reinsurers owned by the lender . they said this overpayment to the reinsurer affiliated with the servicer could be a benefit to the servicer for purchasing lpi coverage from the insurer . one insurer and an industry official with whom we spoke commented that the use of affiliated reinsurers had decreased in recent years , with the industry official adding that this was at least in part due to the enterprises' guidance , which also prohibited their servicers from entering into reinsurance arrangements with lpi providers . the settlements required the lpi insurers to refile premium rates with a permissible loss ratio of 62 percent ; to refile rates every 3 years ; to annually refile any rates that have an actual loss ratio of less than 40 percent ; to have separate rates for lpi and borrower - purchased insurance ; and prohibited certain practices , including the payment of commissions . the settlements also required the four lpi insurers to pay restitutions to eligible claimants and pay a combined total of $25 million in civil money penalties to nydfs . additionally , four other lpi insurers agreed to sign codes of conduct implementing new york's lpi reforms . as noted earlier , effective february 2015 , new york regulations began addressing several practices , including the use of affiliated insurers , commissions , tracking services , loss ratios , and borrower notification . nydfs officials stated that since these hearings and settlements , lpi insurers had reduced their rates in new york . california's and florida's actions did not result in revised regulations , but both states did require reduced lpi rates . officials from the california department of insurance said that in march 2012 , they contacted lpi insurers and ultimately required four of them to refile their lpi rates . they said that after examining the insurers' annual financial statement data , they found that the insurers' loss ratios were low , and required four insurers to lower their rate schedules . the officials said that these refilings resulted in rate reductions ranging from about 21 percent to 35 percent .
