but introduction of other components have been problematic . smart meters have run into cost and performance issues and resistance to the technology ( generally from concerns of some customers over potential health impacts of radio wave emissions ) . this section discusses some of the major concerns expressed about smart grid adoption . while other potential issues exist , most electric utilities appear to view the intelligence and communications capabilities of smart grid systems positively with regard to the potential benefits of smart grid adoption discussed earlier in this report . in the 115 th congress , the "distributed energy demonstration act of 2017" ( s. 1874 ) , introduced in september 2017 , would direct the secretary of energy to establish demonstration grant programs related to the smart grid and distributed energy resource technologies that are likely dependent on its deployment . these technologies include energy generation technologies , demand response and energy efficiency resources , evs and associated supply equipment and systems , and aggregations and integrated control systems , including virtual power plants , microgrids , and networks of microgrid cells . federal matching funds would be provided for qualifying smart grid investments . s. 1874 would support the continued deployment of smart grid technologies but modify certain conditions of sgig grants to ensure various consumer benefits . in the 114 th congress , the "north american energy security and infrastructure act of 2015" ( h.r . 8 ) was passed by the house in december 2015 . the legislation included provisions to capitalize on the enabling nature of the smart grid for new energy efficient technologies . the bill would have required doe to develop an energy security plan and to report on smart meter security concerns . further , the bill would have directed the federal trade commission to consider energy guide labels on new products to state that the product features smart grid capability . the use and value of that feature would depend upon the smart grid capability of the utility system in which the product is installed and the active utilization of that feature by the customer . using the product's smart grid capability on such a system could reduce the product's annual operation costs . electric utility infrastructure mostly consists of the power plants generating electricity and the transmission and distribution lines and other equipment delivering electricity to customers . electricity infrastructure equipment generally has a long lifespan , and modernization is an ongoing process . as of 2014 , there were more than 3,300 electricity providers — comprised of 2,012 p ublicly - owned utilities ( pous ) , 187 i nvestor - owned utilities ( ious ) , 876 c o - operative electric utilities ( co - ops ) , 218 power marketers , and nine federal power agencies ( fpas ) — serving almost 148 million customers . ious had about 52% of electric industry electricity sales in 2014 , followed by power marketers with 20% , pous with 15% , co - ops with 11% , and fpas with 1% . most electricity infrastructure is financed by private sector investment and is built by ious , pous , and co - ops .
