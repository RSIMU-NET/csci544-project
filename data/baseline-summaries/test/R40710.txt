the senate funded both . the final bill funded neither . a proposed 10.8% increase for advanced scientific computing research was to support additional design research on computer architectures for science and infrastructure improvements for the leadership computing facility at argonne national laboratory . the house provided the requested amount for advanced scientific computing ; the senate provided $10 million less ; the final bill provided $15 million less . in fusion energy sciences , an increase of $11 million was requested for the u.s. share of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor ( iter ) . press reports continue to raise concerns about cost increases and schedule delays for iter . a revised official estimate of cost and schedule is expected in late fy2010 or fy2011 . the house provided the requested amount for fusion , plus $20 million for laser fusion research at the naval research laboratory . the senate provided $416 million . the final bill provided $426 million , including "no explicit funding" for the naval research laboratory . the request for the advanced research projects agency â€“ energy ( arpa - e ) was $10 million , down from the regular fy2009 appropriation of $15 million . this is a new program authorized by the america competes act . doe budget documents describe its mission as overcoming long - term , high - risk technological barriers to the development of energy technologies . the bulk of the agency's funding to date is the $400 million it received in the recovery act . neither the house nor the senate provided fy2010 funding for arpa - e . the house committee report explained that this was because recovery act funds remain available , and "the decision not to provide any additional funding ... does not in any way suggest a lack of commitment to this program by the committee. the final bill also provided no new funds for arpa - e . the request for doe national security r&d was $3.300 billion , a 2.9% increase from $3.206 billion in fy2009 . a proposed increase of $175 million for the naval reactors program included $59 million more for r&d on reactor and power plant technology , as doe and the navy initiate development of a successor to the ohio - class ballistic missile submarine , and $48 million more for refueling , overhaul , and modernization of a prototype reactor plant in upstate new york . a proposed decrease of $66 million for nonproliferation and verification r&d would have resulted mostly from a shift of funding to other doe nonproliferation activities . the request included no funds for the reliable replacement warhead program . the house provided a total of $3.307 billion , including $25 million more than the request for inertial confinement fusion and $20 million less than the request for development of environmental cleanup technologies for use at doe defense sites . the senate provided $3.408 billion , including $16.5 million more than the request for inertial confinement fusion , $40 million more for increased development of nuclear detection technologies , and $30 million less for naval reactor development .
