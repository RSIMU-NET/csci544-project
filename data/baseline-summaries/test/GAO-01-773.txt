iii ) . we could not draw inferences from these reports about the student population as a whole or even about a specific subset of students . for this reason , these studies were not included in the main part of this report . to describe universities' responses to credit card marketing , we judgmentally selected and visited 12 colleges and universities and conducted about 100 structured interviews . we also collected documentation at universities including university policies , credit education materials , and credit card applications . we observed tabling and other marketing directed at college students on these campuses . we compiled a list of colleges and universities chosen for their status as public or private institutions , their geographic region , their admissions policies , the size and composition of their student body , the cost of attendance , and the existence of an affinity relationship with a credit card issuer . we attempted to visit a varied sample of 4-year colleges and universities . nine of the 12 universities we selected were public and 3 were private . five had more selective or most selective admissions standards , according to college entrance test scores , and seven were less selective . we also met with federal bank regulatory officials from the board of governors of the federal reserve system , the federal reserve bank of philadelphia , and occ . the proposed legislation in several states would regulate credit card solicitation in a variety of ways including 1. a ban on the use of incentives to entice students to apply for credit 2. a requirement that a student's parent or legal guardian give written consent to the student's credit card application ; 3. a provision to protect parents of college students from the debt collection actions of credit card issuers ; 4. a requirement that credit card issuers register with the college or university before soliciting on campus ; 5. a requirement that credit card issuers , universities , or organizations provide debt education materials or a program for students ; 6. a provision that colleges , universities , or education departments set policies and procedures for controlling credit card solicitation on campus ; and 7. a prohibition against the dissemination of information on students to credit card issuers or extenders of credit for compensation . to better understand how students acquire and use credit cards , we conducted a literature search . in addition to the studies we used in our report , we found three studies that reported survey results on how students acquire credit cards , how they use them , and how much debt they incur . we did not include the results in our report because the survey methodology of these studies did not employ random sampling techniques that would allow us to draw inferences about the student population as a whole or even about a specific subset of students . for example , the sample size may have been too small , or the observations may have come from populations that were not random , such as students at a particular college or members of a particular organization . we briefly describe these studies below .
