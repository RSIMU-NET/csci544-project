the agency had no comment . we plan to report the final results of our reviews in the fall of 2013 . according to fra data , 2012 was the safest year in railroad history . overall , rail safety — measured by the train accident rate per million train miles — has improved markedly since 1980 , as shown in figure 1 . in addition , the accident rate dropped by almost 50 percent from 2004 to 2012 . even with the significant reduction in accident rates , however , roughly 300 people were injured and 10 people were killed in train accidents on average each year , from 2003 to 2012 . further , recent rail accidents underscore the importance of continued , consistent efforts to ensure rail safety . fra provides regulatory oversight of the safety of u.s. railroads , both passenger and freight . fra develops and enforces regulations for the railroad industry that include numerous requirements related to safety , including requirements governing track ; signal and train control systems ; grade - crossing warning device systems ; mechanical equipment , such as locomotives and tank cars ; and railroad - operating practices . fra also enforces hazardous materials regulations that relate to the safe transportation of such materials by rail . the rail safety improvement act ( rsia ) of 2008 was the first authorization of fra's safety activities since 1994 and is due to be reauthorized in 2013 . rsia overhauled federal rail safety requirements by directing the fra to , among other things , promulgate additional new rail safety regulations and guidance in areas such as railroad risk reduction plans , track inspections standards , and highway - rail grade crossing safety . rsia also required railroads to develop and submit a plan to fra for implementing a ptc system on rail lines that carry intercity or commuter passengers or toxic - inhalation - hazard cargo by december 31 , 2015 . under rsia , fra is responsible for approving railroads' ptc implementation plans and certifying ptc systems prior to installation . ptc is a communication - based system designed to prevent some accidents caused by human factors , including train - to - train collisions and derailments caused by exceeding safe speeds . it is also designed to prevent incursions into work zones and movement of trains through switches left in the wrong position . by preventing trains from either entering a segment of track occupied by another train or moving through an improperly aligned switch , ptc could prevent accidents such as the one in the chatsworth neighborhood of los angeles , california . railroads that are required to implement ptc can choose different ptc systems ; however , railroads' ptc systems must be interoperable . this means that the components of different ptc systems must be able to communicate with one another in a manner to provide for the seamless movement of trains as they cross tracks owned by different railroads that may be using different ptc systems . our work to date indicates that fra primarily monitors railroads' compliance with federal safety regulations through routine inspections by individual inspectors at specific sites on railroads' systems .
