each of these is discussed below . there are three basic approaches to assisting greenhouse - gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries: ( 1 ) assist domestic industry ; ( 2 ) penalize foreign competitors ; and ( 3 ) develop alternative sectoral approaches . it should be noted that these categories are not mutually exclusive ; all three could be used , either in combination for a given industry , or separately as appropriate to a given industry's characteristics and needs . this section is divided into two components: ( 1 ) general issues and questions raised by the various approaches ( design , effects , etc .

 ) , and ( 2 ) discussions of specific options . it is not comprehensive , but illustrative of the range of questions and consequences these initiatives present . table 5 summarizes the three general approaches to address trade - related issues with respect to the various objectives of these approaches . as indicated , each focuses on different objectives . with respect to achieving the more comprehensive solution to trade issues — promoting an international agreement — the range presented by the three approaches is clear and distinct . support for domestic industries , the approach most commonly included in legislative proposals , is not focused on this objective ; it is focused on preserving the industry's current competitive position and jobs and may , depending on the details , help transition that industry to the future . trade measures for foreign competitors , another approach commonly included in legislative proposals , may provide a stick for international negotiation , but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries from "unfair" competition while the country awaits an international agreement . finally , the sectoral approach represents a range of options focused on integrating developing countries' industrial bases into a mutually acceptable international framework that provides a level playing field for all participants . whether any of these approaches would have appreciable effects on carbon leakage is unclear . as the u.s. debate on climate change proceeds , various proposals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions contain provisions to address the trade - related issues presented here . two of the most common options are ( 1 ) subsidies for affected industries through allocation of free allowances within cap - and - trade policies ; and ( 2 ) border adjustments through an international reserve allowance program . in addition to these domestic options , the bali action plan includes sectoral approaches as options for the next phase of the kyoto protocol . other alternatives are also likely to be debated . free allocation of allowances to greenhouse - gas intensive , trade - exposed industries is more narrowly focused on assisting domestic industries maintain their current competitiveness in the face of a domestic greenhouse gas reduction program . it has the virtue of relative simplicity compared with the other approaches and options , but no greater guarantee of success . companies may choose to accept the assistance and not make the necessary improvements to existing facilities to remain competitive in the increasingly carbon - constrained future .
