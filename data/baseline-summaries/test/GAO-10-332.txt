interoperability can be achieved at different levels . at the highest level , electronic data are computable ( that is , in a format that a computer can understand and act on to , for example , provide alerts to clinicians on drug allergies ) . at a lower level , electronic data are structured and viewable , but not computable . the value of data at this level is that they are structured so that data of interest to users are easier to find . at still a lower level , electronic data are unstructured and viewable , but not computable . with unstructured electronic data , a user would have to search through uncategorized data to find needed or relevant information . beyond these , paper records also can be considered interoperable ( at the lowest level ) because they allow data to be shared , read , and interpreted by human beings . according to dod and va officials , not all data require the same level of interoperability , nor is interoperability at the highest level achievable in all cases . for example , unstructured , viewable data may be sufficient for such narrative information as clinical notes . figure 1 shows the distinction between the various levels of interoperability and examples of the types of data that can be shared at each level . the six objectives are listed in table 1 . also since april 2008 , the departments have been working to set up an interagency program office to be accountable for their efforts to implement fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities by the september deadline . for example , veterans may receive outpatient care from va clinicians and be hospitalized at a military treatment facility . the interface also allows dod sites to see previously inaccessible data at other dod sites . the clinical data repository / health data repository ( chdr ) interface , implemented in september 2006 , linked the department's separate repositories of standardized data to enable a two - way exchange of computable outpatient pharmacy and medication allergy information . these repositories are a part of the modernized health information systems that the departments have been developing — dod's ahlta and va's healthevet . in its ongoing initiatives to share information , va uses its integrated medical information system — the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) — which was developed in - house by va clinicians and it personnel . all va medical facilities have access to all vista information . dod currently relies on its ahlta , which comprises multiple legacy medical information systems that the department developed from commercial software products that were customized for specific uses . for example , the composite health care system ( chcs ) , which was formerly dod's primary health information system , is still in use to capture pharmacy , radiology , and laboratory order management . in addition , the department uses essentris ( also called the clinical information system ) , a commercial health information system customized to support inpatient treatment at military medical facilities . not all of dod's medical facilities yet have this inpatient medical system .
