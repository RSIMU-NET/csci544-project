additional copies are $2 each . orders should be sent to the following address , accompanied by a check or money order made out to the superintendent of documents , when necessary . most inspectors are responsible for oversight at more than one repair station . at the faa offices we visited , we examined the workloads of 98 inspectors and found that , on average , they were responsible for 12 repair stations each , although their individual workloads varied from 1 to 42 facilities of varying size and complexity . the inspectors assigned responsibility for repair stations are also assigned oversight of other aviation activities such as air taxis , agricultural operators , helicopter operators , and training schools for pilots and mechanics . faa uses teams for more comprehensive reviews of a few repair stations through its national aviation safety inspection program or its regional aviation safety inspection program . these special , in - depth inspections are conducted at only a small portion of repair stations . in the past 4 years , an average of only 23 of these inspections have been conducted annually at repair stations ( less than 1 percent of the repair stations performing work for air carriers ) . from fiscal year 1993 through 1996 , we found 16 repair stations that were inspected by a single inspector and were also inspected by a special team of inspectors during the same year . the teams found a total of 347 deficiencies , only 15 of which had been identified by individual inspectors . many of the deficiencies the teams identified were systemic and apparently long - standing , such as inadequate training programs or poor quality control manuals . such deficiencies were likely to have been present when the repair stations were inspected earlier by individual inspectors . we believe that there are several reasons why team inspections identify a higher proportion of the deficiencies that may exist in the operation of large repair stations . first , many faa inspectors responsible for conducting individual inspections said that , because they have many competing demands on their time , their inspections of repair stations may not be as thorough as they would like . each day , gao issues a list of newly available reports and testimony . this effort is scheduled to be implemented in the fall of 1998 . it is designed to systematize the process and ensure consistency in inspections and in reporting the results of these inspections so as to allow more efficient targeting of inspection resources . faa guidance prescribes an annual inspection to cover all aspects of a repair station's operations , including the currency of technical data , facilities , calibration of special tooling and equipment , and inspection procedures , as well as to ensure that the repair station is performing only the work that it has approval to do . most faa offices assign an individual inspector to conduct routine surveillance at a repair station , even one that is large and complex , rather than using a team of inspectors . second , team inspections make use of checklists or other job aids to ensure that all points are covered .
