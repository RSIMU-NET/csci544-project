( see app . ii for the full text of bop's written comments. ) services and the ease of doing business with unicor . has far exceeded our expectations.” in another letter , the acquisition chief of the department of veterans affairs' medical center in dallas wrote that fpi had taken actions to improve things like responsiveness and customer service and many , but not all , issues had been resolved . for example , the va official stated that delivery performance had been a problem , but fpi had taken steps to improve its timeliness . in addition , he wrote that prices of some items , such as furniture , had become competitive , but some items , such as sheets , were still “overpriced.” in terms of quality , the va official said that “unicor chairs used to routinely break soon after they were put into service case goods such as desks routinely had formica peeling off the edges” and added that fpi “now makes a very durable chair line and case goods that still look good even after many years of service.” the same official praised fpi's increasing emphasis on customer service and said that “to truly finish the ‘remake' of unicor that has begun . unicor should become nonmandatory.” the official added that such a step would force fpi to become competitive in all areas , not just in some areas . according to fpi , it has implemented several initiatives to improve customer responsiveness . for instance , during fiscal year 1996 , fpi's annual report stated that fpi had initiated a lifetime guarantee on products and services , opened a web site to advertise its products , and begun accepting orders via the internet . the annual report also stated that , among other things , fpi reduced its average processing time on waiver requests to less than 4 days , incorporated liquidated damages clauses into contracts , and initiated automatic discounts for late delivery . fpi's annual report did not discuss , nor did we assess , the implementation or effectiveness of these stated initiatives . fpi states that it is committed to delivering total customer satisfaction and has been satisfying federal customers since 1934 . however , it lacks sufficient data to support any overall conclusions about whether federal customers who buy and use its products and services are satisfied with their timeliness , price , and quality . fpi's management systems are not designed to systematically collect and analyze federal customers' views about its products and services . further , its efforts to gauge customer satisfaction have been limited and do not allow for measurement of , or overall conclusions about , customers' views on its products and services . over the last several years , public and private organizations have recognized the merits of systematically obtaining and using customer satisfaction data to improve performance and adopting customer satisfaction as a performance measure . in the absence of such data and a related performance measure , fpi is unable to demonstrate with any degree of certainty the level of customer satisfaction it delivers .
