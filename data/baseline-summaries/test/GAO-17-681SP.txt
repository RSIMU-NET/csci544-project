( table 1 provides information on the increases in diplomatic security staff from 2008 through 2017 ; see app . iv for further staffing details. ) in response to a benghazi accountability review board recommendation , state established a panel to reexamine diplomatic security's organization and management . in 2013 , the panel reported that , in part , diplomatic security had become more focused on its law enforcement and personnel protection functions . this was not surprising , according to the panel , given that diplomatic security provided security in two war zones and numerous other high - threat posts . simultaneously , diplomatic security had experienced an increased demand on its domestic criminal investigative and dignitary protection programs .
