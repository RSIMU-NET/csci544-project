table 2 . if the secretary of the treasuryreported that , on a given month beginning january 1988 , cumulative net revenues would exceed thepre - established target of $227.3 billion , then the phaseout of the tax would begin on the monthfollowing the attainment of the target . if estimated cumulative net revenues would not exceed$227.3 billion between january 1988 and january 1991 , then the phase out of the tax would beginjanuary 1991 . irrespective of the onset of the phaseout , once the phaseout began , the tax was to havebeen phased out over a 33-month period by reducing each producer's tax by 3% each month ( with4% on the last month ) . cumulative net revenues , which totaled about $43 billion between 1980 and 1987 , fell farshort of the $227.3 billion target . hence , had it not been repealed , the wpt phase out would havebegun january 1991 and the tax would have terminated on october 1 , 1993 . as already discussed,the wpt was repealed in august 1988 , before the onset of the phase - out rules . finally , while the tax was called a "profit" tax , it was not really a profit tax but rather aspecial type of excise tax - - a selective excise tax on oil producers . the tax was paid first , beforeprofits from the sale of the oil were determined . and except for the net income limitation , profitshad no bearing on how much wpt was paid . the base prices had no precise or even approximaterelationship to the costs of oil production . this difference between an excise tax and a true excessprofit tax is crucial because , as will be demonstrated , the two taxes have very different economiceffects , particularly on energy prices and oil imports . the wpt resulted from a compromise between the carter administration , which wanted todecontrol oil prices , and the congress , which generally did not ; without the tax , many doubted thatthe congress would have supported oil price decontrol . the reasons for the tax are manifold and complex ; they transcend economics and theyconcern the image and perception of the oil industry . structure of the crude oil windfall profittax source: sections 4986-4998 of 1986 internal revenue code ; commerce clearinghouse , 1987 ; andresearch division of the internal revenue service . notes: tier i oil is oil that was lower and upper tier oil under epca75 , and sadlerochit oil fromalaska's north slope ; tier ii and tier iii oil was uncontrolled oil under epca75 ; the 1981 ertalegislation changed the rate structure as follows: ( 1 ) the tax rate on new oil was reduced gradually,but further reductions were frozen in 1984 so that the rate remained fixed at 22.5% until 1988 ; ( 2 ) stripper oil produced by independents was made tax - exempt ; ( 2 ) royalty owners received a taxcredit followed by an exemption for limited amounts of oil production . the wpt was imposed on domestic oil producers at the point of the first sale of taxable oil,which was generally to a refiner .
