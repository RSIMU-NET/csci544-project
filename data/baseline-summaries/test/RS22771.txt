no further action has been taken . 1614 , s. 936 , and s. 1285 described above , two other billsâ h.r . 2788 âwere introduced in the 110 th congress that would have altered the congressional franking privilege . 2687 would have effectively prohibited representatives from mass mailing newsletters , questionnaires , or congratulatory notices . the prohibition would not have covered certain other types of mass mailings made by members , including federal documents ( such as the congressional record ) or voter registration information . the legislation would have applied only to representatives ; it would not affect mass mailings made by senators . current law allows members to send mass mailings in various forms ( newsletters , questionnaires , press releases , notices ) on a variety of topics , including but not limited to the impact of laws and decisions , public and official actions taken by members of congress , proposed or pending legislation or governmental actions , the positions of the members of congress on legislation or other public issues , and other related matters of public concern or public service . 2687 was introduced june 12 , 2007 , by representative ray lahood , and was referred to the committee on house administration and the committee on oversight and government reform . no further action was taken . previously , representative lahood introduced similar legislation ( h.r . 3121 , 109 th congress ) , which was referred to the committee on house administration and the committee on government reform . no further action was taken . 2788 would have required that each individual piece of franked mail contained in a mass mailing made by a member of the house contain a statement indicating the aggregate cost of producing and mailing the mass mailing . each piece of franked mail would have contained the statement , "the aggregate cost of this mailing to the taxpayer is _____," with the blank space containing the total cost of producing and franking the mass mailing . the legislation would not have affected mass mailings made by senators . current law requires each mass mailing sent by a member of congress to bear the following notice: "prepared , published , and mailed at taxpayer expense. 2788 does not amend the current law ; if enacted , mass mailings made by members of the house would contain both statements . 2788 was introduced on june 20 , 2007 , by representative jeff flake , and was referred to the committee on house administration . no further action was taken . no further action was taken . a senate office that exceeds its allowance may supplement the allowance with official office account funds . senators are , however , limited to $50,000 for mass mailings ( defined as 500 or more identical pieces of unsolicited mail ) in any fiscal year . in the house , the franked mail postage allowance is based on the number of addresses in each member's district . each representative's mail allowance is combined with allowances for office staff and official office expenses to form a member's representational allowance ( mra ) . members may spend any portion of their mra on franked mail , subject to law and house regulations .
