however , not all underwriter manipulations have been prohibited . a "little price manipulation" has been permitted in order to further appropriate market goals . the securities and exchange commission has traditionally recognized certain types of manipulative activities , considered "stabilizing" activities , as permissible under § 9 ( a ) ( 6 ) of the securities exchange act and sec rule 10b - 1 . in fact , the court itself indicated that the complaint was an attack not on the existence of the sec - approved joint ipo activity , but rather , the abuse of that activity . further , the sec has , and has exercised , its specific authority to supervise those activities . moreover , injured investors are specifically authorized to recover damages , and have successfully sued under the securities statutes , for violation of applicable sec regulations "for conduct virtually identical to the conduct at issue here. further , the court observed , the challenged practices all seemed to describe "conditions that the investors apparently were willing to accept in order to obtain an allocation of new shares that were in high demand. continuing , the opinion noted the variously nuanced sec decisions concerning , for example , commissions and future sales , and "laddering," the court observing that it would "often be difficult for someone who is not familiar with accepted syndicate practices to ... distinguish what is forbidden from what is allowed" — the more so because "evidence tending to show unlawful antitrust activity and evidence tending to show lawful securities marketing activity may overlap. further , since antitrust challenges to securities - marketing activities could be brought "throughout the nation in dozens of different courts with different nonexpert judges," the decision to defer to the sec's expertise seemed only logical . we believe it fair to conclude that , where conduct at the core or the marketing of new securities is at issue ; where securities regulators proceed with great care to distinguish the encouraged and permissible from the forbidden ; where the threat to antitrust lawsuits , through error and disincentive , could seriously alter underwriter conduct in undesirable ways , to allow an antitrust lawsuit would threaten serious harm to the efficient functioning of the securities markets . given ( 1 ) congress's expressed concern that securities markets become and remain stable , ( 2 ) the continued oversight and actions of a single expert regulatory agency versus the probability of diverse and possibly conflicting decisions by nonexpert judges in the event of securities / antitrust lawsuits , and ( 3 ) the likelihood of conflict between the mandates of antitrust law and allowable activities under the securities laws , the court found that "the securities laws are 'clearly incompatible' with the application of the antitrust laws. accordingly , implied immunity from prosecution under the antitrust laws is accorded to participants in securities markets . justice stevens concurred separately to emphasize that , in his opinion , neither the incompatibility between the antitrust and securities laws , nor the question of implied antitrust immunity for regulated entities should have been the issue .
