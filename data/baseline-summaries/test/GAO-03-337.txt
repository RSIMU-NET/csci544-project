iv. ) to identify factors limiting the availability of information needed for the study of retirement income and wealth , we reviewed documents obtained from and interviewed officials at the department of labor's ( labor ) employee benefit security administration ( ebsa ) , and bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , the census bureau , the treasury department's office of tax analysis , the internal revenue service's ( irs ) statistics of income division , the national institute of health's national institute on aging , and the social security administration's ( ssa ) office of research , evaluation , and statistics . we also attended conferences related to retirement income analysis sponsored by the retirement research consortium and the society of actuaries and interviewed analysts at the urban institute , the brookings institution , the employee benefit research institute , and the national research council . the scope of our work did not include an evaluation of estimated costs and benefits of specific proposals for improving retirement income data . we did not independently verify the federal funding figures provided to us by longitudinal survey administrators or agencies sponsoring the surveys . below are recommendations concerning retirement income data needs excerpted from the 1997 report of the national research council's panel on retirement income modeling followed by summaries on the status of each as of december 2002 . continue support of longitudinal studies recommendation: existing panel surveys of middle - aged and older people should receive continued government support . longitudinal data from these surveys are essential to analyze retirement and savings decisions and determine behavioral responses to changes in public and private sector policies . such analyses in turn are essential to develop better models for forecasting the likely effects of alternative policy proposals on retirement income security . in particular , the health and retirement study ( hrs ) and asset and home dynamics among the oldest old ( ahead ) surveys should receive continued support . these surveys should be refreshed periodically with new cohorts in order to offer insight into how behavior changes over time . status: as shown in table 2 , the amounts of federal support for three major longitudinal surveys have been sustained . the hrs and ahead studies , which are now jointly funded , have increased after taking the effects of inflation in account . the national institute on aging continues to fund the hrs and ahead studies . supplemental funding also comes from ssa . both the ahead and hrs studies have been refreshed with new cohorts . in 1998 , interviews began for a cohort of people born from 1924 to 1930 and a cohort of people born from 1942 to 1947 . the national science foundation continues to fund the psid . additional support comes from the national institute on aging , the national institute on child health and human development , and the departments of health and human services , agriculture , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and labor . labor sponsors the national longitudinal survey ( nls ) through bls . the nls is conducted under contract with researchers at ohio state university , the university of chicago , the census bureau and the university of wisconsin .
