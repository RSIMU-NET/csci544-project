in april , u.s . citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) announced that the agency will be taking "multiple measures to further deter and detect h - 1b visa fraud and abuse. some limits on the freedom of movement continued . rape , domestic violence , dowry - related deaths , honor killings , sexual harassment , and discrimination against women and girls remained serious societal problems . child abuse , female genital mutilation and cutting , and forced and early marriage were problems . trafficking in persons , including widespread bonded and forced labor of children and adults , and sex trafficking of children and adults for prostitution , were serious problems . societal discrimination against persons with disabilities and indigenous persons continued , as did discrimination and violence based on gender identity , sexual orientation , and persons with hiv . a lack of accountability for misconduct at all levels of government persisted , contributing to widespread impunity . investigations and prosecutions of individual cases took place , but lax enforcement , a shortage of trained police officers , and an overburdened and under resourced court system contributed to infrequent convictions . international human rights watchdogs also identify widespread abuses . press freedoms in india also appear to be under threat . although religious discrimination and intolerance of social dissent are hardly new to india , the 2014 elevation of the hindu nationalist bjp to majority status at the federal level — the party won 52% of parliament's lower - house seats in 2014 elections — triggered concerns among human rights advocates that agents of hindu nationalist majoritarianism would be empowered . born as the political wing of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ( rss or "national volunteer organization" ) , a militant hindu and social service group — the bjp is a primary political purveyor of hindutva or "hindu - ness" in indian society . prime minister modi is a life - long rss member , and his 2014 election victory evoked fears that a victorious bjp would pursue hindu majoritarian policies . this has led the indian government to cancel some planned new coal plant projects and cut its coal production target by nearly 10% . according to successive u.s. state department country reports on human rights practices , many of india's citizens suffer human rights abuses: the most significant human rights problems involved instances of police and security force abuses , including extrajudicial killings , torture , and rape ; corruption , which remained widespread and contributed to ineffective responses to crimes , including those against women , children , and members of scheduled castes ( scs ) or scheduled tribes ( sts ) ; and societal violence based on gender , religious affiliation , and caste or tribe . other human rights problems included disappearances , hazardous prison conditions , arbitrary arrest and detention , and lengthy pretrial detention . court backlogs delayed or denied justice , including through lengthy pretrial detention and denial of due process . the government placed restrictions on foreign funding of nongovernmental organizations ( ngos ) , including some whose views the government believed were not in the "national or public interest," curtailing the work of civil society . there were instances of infringement of privacy rights .
