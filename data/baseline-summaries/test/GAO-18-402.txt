planning . some states allow for the inclusion of energy storage in integrated resource and transmission planning processes ; grid operators and utilities undertake these planning processes to ensure that the grid infrastructure has sufficient capacity and grid operators are able to meet future power demands . for example: the new mexico public utility commission's integrated resource planning rules require investor - owned utilities to evaluate all feasible energy resources as part of their resource planning process . when the commission's integrated resource planning rules were originally implemented , energy storage was not commercially feasible ; however , the state commission recently amended these rules to include energy storage as a resource in planning . the oregon public utility commission directed portland general electric to address energy storage in its future integrated resource plans . washington's utilities and transportation commission directs utilities to demonstrate that , when considering a new resource acquisition , their analysis should include an evaluation of the costs and benefits of a storage alternative . the commission also directs utilities procuring resources to issue requests for proposals that are technology neutral , allowing energy storage to bid . several states are also incorporating storage into broader energy planning efforts , including conducting research to identify the benefits of and opportunities for storage in the state . for example: north carolina passed legislation directing the north carolina policy collaboratory , at the university of north carolina , to conduct a study on energy storage to address how and if storage may benefit consumers , the feasibility of storage in the state , and policy recommendations . massachusetts has also undertaken a number of efforts including launching the energy storage initiative , an initiative administered by the massachusetts department of energy resources and the massachusetts clean energy center to facilitate the deployment of storage and provide environmental and ratepayer benefits . as part of this initiative the 2016 state of charge report was released and , among other things , identified barriers to energy storage adoption in the state and made recommendations to increase deployment of storage , setting a target of 600 mw of energy storage capacity by 2025 . financial incentives and funding . several states offer financial incentives including tax credits , tax exemptions , and rebate programs that encourage the deployment of residential , commercial and industrial energy storage systems by offsetting costs . for example: california's self generation incentive program — designed to help reduce emissions , demand , and customer electricity costs — provides rebates to support existing , new , and emerging distributed energy resources installed on the customer's side of the utility meter . this program is open to many different technologies , but according to the california public utilities commission , the largest share of funding is allotted for energy storage projects . in 2017 , maryland established a state tax credit for a percentage of certain installed costs of energy storage systems on residential and commercial property . legislation has also been proposed in new york that would create a state tax credit for residential energy storage systems equal to 25 percent of costs up to $7,000 . a number of states offer funding for energy storage pilot and demonstration projects .
