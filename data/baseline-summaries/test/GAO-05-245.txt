error review panels . some of our review states have also established panels to review errors discovered through the qc process . new jersey established such a panel , consisting of system , policy and qc staff . this panel reviews all errors , challenges some that it believes have been inaccurately classified and develops corrective actions to address the root causes of the errors . the results of the reviews can then be communicated to all local offices . for example , as a result the panel's finding that computing utility bill deductions was a source of payment errors , the state implemented a mandatory standard utility allowance policy to reduce this type of error . many of the error reduction practices employed by the states in our review focused primarily on agency - caused rather than client - caused errors . many state officials we spoke with believe that states should not be held accountable for participant - caused errors , such as failure to report information , because the state cannot control participants' behavior . however , fns officials believe that states can reduce participant - caused errors by better using computer matching of state data sources and other outside sources of data , improving interviewing techniques to collect all relevant information and identify discrepancies , and educating clients about their responsibilities . supervisory review of cases . several states have begun to require local supervisory reviews of cases to detect and correct errors caused by misapplication of food stamp policies or workers failing to act on reported information . some states require that all cases be reviewed , while others target error - prone cases or a certain number of cases per worker . targeted local office reviews . some states have used contractors or have established their own teams to target high error rate offices for improvement . michigan recently started using technical assistance teams to observe the local office's processes and make recommendations for improvement . in addition to taking the above steps focused specifically on decreasing the error rate , fns has made and advocated for a number of program and policy changes designed primarily to address other issues , such as program participation , which have also helped reduce payment errors . fns believes that serving eligible low - income families , particularly working poor families , is imperative to the success of welfare reform and the nutritional well - being of eligible persons . however , because the income and deductions for working poor families tend to be volatile , these households are more error prone , and their participation could increase the error rates of states trying hardest to serve them and thus discourage states from reaching out to these families . in response , fns raised the error tolerance level in fiscal year 2000 from $5 to $25 for monthly food stamp payments for all cases . this change exempted smaller errors that had been counted in the past . fns estimated that this change would have reduced the nationwide error rate by 0.66 percentage points if it had been implemented in the previous fiscal year . in addition , fns and congress have made several options available to the states to simplify the application and reporting process .
