we disagree with both . first , defense believes that the corps , rather than epa , should have the lead in implementing the recommendation . we continue to believe that epa should have the lead in implementing our recommendation because section 404 ( b ) of the clean water act authorizes epa to issue section 404 guidance . second , defense stated that , instead of establishing criteria to determine the ecological success of mitigation efforts , because the term “success” is too imprecise and subjective to be consistently and effectively applied , criteria should be established to determine “that wetlands functions have been adequately compensated.” we believe that defense's suggestion of adequate compensation is too narrow and does not address the overall national goal of no net loss of wetlands . we continue to believe that establishment of ecological success criteria is not only possible , but essential to determine whether progress is being made toward achieving that national goal through section 404 mitigation efforts . regarding our recommendation calling for ecological success criteria , interior stated that it did not agree that the federal agencies should establish national criteria . however , our recommendation does not call for national criteria . we agree with interior's comment that criteria are most appropriately developed at the local level , where experienced personnel can work together to develop criteria keyed to local ecosystems or watersheds . the comments of defense , epa , commerce , and the interior , and our responses to those comments , are included in appendixes iii , iv , v , and vi , respectively . to obtain information on the extent to which the in - lieu - fee option has been used and been effective in mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands , and on the extent to which in - lieu - fee organizations compete with mitigation banks for developers' mitigation business , we conducted a two - phase telephone survey of corps officials from the 38 district regulatory offices . the first phase of the telephone survey was conducted for all 38 corps districts . we asked corps officials to provide basic information such as whether their district provides the in - lieu - fee and mitigation banking options for developers , and if so , how many in - lieu - fee arrangements and mitigation banks exist in the district . we also asked corps officials to provide us with copies of written in - lieu - fee agreements and any guidance concerning in - lieu - fee arrangements . we used the responses and documentation from the first phase to obtain an understanding of the extent to which in - lieu - fee arrangements were being used nationwide and to devise questions for the second phase of the survey . the second phase of the telephone survey consisted of two versions: one for districts that have in - lieu - fee arrangements , and the other for districts that do not have such arrangements .
