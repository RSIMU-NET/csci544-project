section . the pst's salmon fishing regimes are based entirely on the recommendations of the psc . many believe that the pst negotiation process has been hampered by the structure of the u.s . section , in which dissent by any single voting member can bring pst negotiations to a halt . on june 30 , 1999 , u.s. and canadian officials signed a comprehensive agreement to resolve long - standing disputes relating to pacific salmon and the pst . for example , who benefits when salmon are caught in alaska but processed in canada ? and , how are the issues of protecting fish habitat by forgoing development opportunities ( eg , logging , mining , petroleum development ) to be balanced ? the memorandum of understanding ( mou ) , which elaborated on elements within the pst , provided minimal guidance . it stated that because data on salmon interceptions and total production by rivers of origin are imprecise , each nation's method for determining benefits equivalent may differ . thus , the mou stated that complete and comprehensive implementation of article iii ( 1 ) ( b ) would not be possible until some time in the future ( without identifying a date or timeline ) . the mou stated that , in the short term , annual fishery regimes shall be conducted in an equitable manner and that "the commission's decisions take into account changes in the benefits flowing to each of the parties through alteration in fishing patterns , conservation actions , or as the result of changes in the abundance of the runs. for the long term , "if it is determined that one country or the other is deriving substantially greater benefits than those provided from its rivers , it would be expected that the parties would develop a phased program to eliminate the inequity within a specified time period , taking into account the provisions of article iii , paragraph 3 , of the pst ( i.e. , the desirability in most cases of reducing interceptions ) , avoiding undue disruption of existing fisheries , and accounting for annual variations in abundance of stocks . the mou also stated that correcting imbalances is a national responsibility and may involve adjusting fishing effort or enhancement projects on a regional basis , and that the party with the advantage shall propose corrective measures to the psc . despite the joint commitment embodied in the pst to conserve and protect the shared salmon stocks , the united states and canada spent many years in a diplomatic stalemate , and the health of the salmon stocks suffered as a result . after the initial disagreements over the equitable sharing of intermingled stocks in the early 1990s , a number of mechanisms were employed to resolve this issue . in 1993 and 1994 , canada and the united states appointed new negotiators to address the benefits equivalent principle . by 1995 , government - to - government negotiations proved unsuccessful and new zealand ambassador christopher beebe was appointed to guide a mediation of the pst's equity ( benefits equivalent ) principle . when this failed , the parties established two stakeholder panels , composed of fishermen from both countries , in an attempt to settle the controversy .
