( see fig . the slight increase in overpayments estimated by the quality assurance system in 2001 is likely related to the overall increase in total ui benefits paid that year . the overpayments estimated by labor's quality assurance data fall into a number of categories . some overpayments result from errors in claimants' reporting or the state agency's recording of important eligibility information , such as wages or other sources of income that a claimant obtained while receiving ui benefits ( “benefit year earnings” violations ) . ( see table 1. ) overpayments also occur because claimants are not able and / or available to work , fail to register for employment services as required by their state , or fail to look for a new job as required ( “eligibility” violations ) . ( see app . the quality assurance data also classify overpayments as being “fraud” or “nonfraud” . fraud can occur when claimants intentionally misrepresent eligibility information , employers file fraudulent claims , or state ui program personnel abuse sensitive information such as social security numbers for personal gain . of the total overpayments estimated by labor in 2001 , about $577 million ( 24 percent ) were attributed to fraud . although this estimate takes into account each state's individual laws , we found that the states differ substantially in how they define fraud . for example , some states may include overpayments resulting from unreported earnings as fraud , while other states do not . thus , state - to - state comparisons of the level of fraud in the ui program and the activities that constitute fraud are difficult to make . similarly , labor awarded california a grant in 1998 to develop a guide on best practices for recovering overpayments . in addition , during the annual budget process , labor reviews states' requests for funds necessary to administer their ui programs and ensures an equitable allocation of funds among states . while completing those reviews , labor could prioritize administrative funding to states to help them achieve or surpass agreed upon payment accuracy performance levels . to facilitate improved payment accuracy in the states' ui programs , labor recently included an indicator in its annual performance plan for fy 2003 that will establish a baseline measurement for benefit payment accuracy during 2002 .
