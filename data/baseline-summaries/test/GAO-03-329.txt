enterprise architecture . enterprise architectures systematically and completely define an organization's current ( baseline ) or desired ( target ) environment . they do so by providing a clear and comprehensive picture of a mission area — both in logical ( eg , operations , functions , and information flows ) terms and technical ( eg , software , hardware , and communications ) terms . if defined properly , enterprise architectures can assist in optimizing interdependencies and interrelationships among an organization's operations and the underlying technology supporting these operations . our experience with federal agencies has shown that attempting to define and build systems without first completing an architecture often results in systems that are duplicative , not well integrated , and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface , and do not optimize mission performance . dod also recognizes the importance of enterprise architectures and developed a framework known as the command , control , communications , computers , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) architecture framework for its components to use in guiding efforts similar to dcgs . dod's acquisition guidance also requires the use of architectures to characterize interrelationships and interactions between u.s. , allied , and coalition systems . migration plan or road map . given the size and complexity of dcgs , it is important that the migration be planned in convenient , manageable increments to accommodate dod's capacity to handle change . at a minimum , a plan would lay out current system capabilities , desired capabilities , and specific initiatives , programs , projects , and schedules intended to get dod and the services to that vision . it would also define measures for tracking progress , such as testing timeliness and the status of modifications , roles and responsibilities for key activities , and mechanisms for enforcing compliance with the migration plan and ensuring that systems conform to technical and data standards defined by the architecture . such plans , or road maps , are often developed as part of an enterprise architecture . investment strategy . to ensure the migration is successfully implemented , it is important to know what funds are available — for the initial phases of migration , for interoperability testing , and for transition to the target architecture . it is important as well to know what constraints or gaps need to be addressed . by achieving better visibility over resources , dod can take steps needed to analyze its migration investment as well as funding alternatives . dod is in the process of developing an architecture for dcgs . it expects the architecture to be completed by july 2003 . as recommended by dod's c4isr architecture framework , the architecture will include a ( 1 ) baseline , or as - is , architecture and ( 2 ) a target , or to - be , architecture . the architecture will also include a high - level concept of operations . the architecture will to also reflect dod's future plans to develop a web - based intelligence information network . this network would substantially change how intelligence information is collected and analyzed and could therefore substantially change dod's requirements for dcgs .
