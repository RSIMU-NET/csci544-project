at the same time , the u.s . fish and wildlife service has drafted a multispecies recovery plan to address the recovery of the 68 federally listed threatened or endangered species located in south florida . in addition , the environmental protection agency and florida's department of environmental protection recently began to develop a comprehensive water quality protection plan for the south florida ecosystem . the working group is also developing an integrated strategic plan , which will include a common vision for all the participants and strategies to measure their success in achieving this vision . transform the built environment . balancing human needs with those of the natural environment will require developing lifestyles and economies that do not have a negative impact on the natural environment and do not degrade the quality of life . this will involve ensuring that traditional industries , such as agriculture , tourism , development , fishing , and manufacturing , continue to be supported while making sure that these industries are compatible with the goals of the restoration effort and that the quality of life in urban areas is maintained or enhanced . participants in the restoration effort include 13 federal agencies , 7 florida agencies and commissions , 2 american indian tribes , 16 counties , and scores of municipal governments . representatives from the state's major industries , the commercial and private sectors , and environmental and other special interest groups also participate in the restoration effort . appendix ii lists the federal , state , tribal , and county participants . appendix iii contains additional details on the south florida ecosystem and the efforts undertaken to restore it . federal funding for the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative does not come from a single source . in addition to funds appropriated directly by the congress for projects managed by the u.s. army corps of engineers and restoration activities designated in the 1996 federal agriculture improvement and reform act ( farm bill ) , the federal agencies participating in the initiative determine and allocate funds from their own appropriations . because the agencies account for these funds independently , no complete and consolidated financial data on the initiative are available . we asked each agency to provide data on the funds provided for the initiative â€” appropriations from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1999 and obligations and expenditures from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1998 ( the latest year for which complete data are available ) . however , many of the agencies had difficulty providing these data because although they track appropriated dollars allocated for the initiative , they do not separately track the funds obligated and expended for it . on the basis of the financial data provided by the federal agencies , we estimate that from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1999 , over $1.2 billion in appropriated funds has been provided to the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative . as figure 2 indicates , the funding for the initiative has increased from about $85 million for fiscal year 1993 to about $238 million for fiscal year 1999 . as figure 2 also shows , 1996 was an unusual funding year because the farm bill included a specific appropriation of $200 million for restoration activities .
