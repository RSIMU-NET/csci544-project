this is not easy . we have all heard the statement “the process is not the problem ; the problem is the problem,” which in this case is the federal government's unsustainable fiscal path . as the committee knows , we have been raising concerns about the long - term trajectory of the budget for nearly two decades . our first long - term simulation of the federal budget path was issued in 1992 for members of the finance and budget committees . focusing on a longer time horizon can help congress find a sustainable fiscal path rather than artificially shifting costs into the future . incorporating a provision under which congress would periodically look back at progress toward reducing the deficit can prompt action to bring the deficit path closer to the original goal . budget process helped once to achieve a goal that had consensus ; it could work again . while bea's focus on actions offered advantages for enforcement , it did not go far enough to meet today's needs . bea specified that congress must appropriate only so much money each year for discretionary programs and that any legislated changes in entitlements and / or taxes during a session of congress were to be deficit - neutral . the effect of this control on discretionary programs and on entitlements was quite different . spending for discretionary programs is controlled by the appropriations process . congress provides budget authority and specifies a period of availability . controlling legislative action is the same as controlling spending . the amount appropriated can be specified and measured against a cap . for mandatory programs and revenues , controlling legislative actions is not the same as controlling spending or revenues . for an entitlement program , spending in any given year is the result of the interaction between the formula that governs that program and demographics or services provided . similarly , for a tax provision , the revenue impact is not directly determined by congress . under bea legislated changes in entitlements and taxes were to be deficit - neutral over multiyear periods . however , bea did not seek to control changes in direct spending or in revenues ( including tax expenditures ) that resulted from other sources — whether from changes in the economy , changes in population , or changes in costs . moving forward this is a major gap: it is the underlying structure of the budget that is driving the long - term fiscal imbalance . bea succeeded as far as its reach . it controlled discretionary spending and prevented legislative expansion of entitlement programs and new tax cuts unless they were offset . however , it did nothing to deal with expansions built into the design of mandatory programs and the allocation of resources within the discretionary budget . congress enacted a return to a statutory paygo process in 2010 . as with the previous iteration , this can help prevent further deterioration of the fiscal position , but it does not deal with the existing imbalance . the problem confronting us today requires going beyond the “do no harm” or “stop digging” framework of bea .
