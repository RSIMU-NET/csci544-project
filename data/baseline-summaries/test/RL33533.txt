appendix a . historical background the modern kingdom of saudi arabia is the third state established in the arabian peninsula since the end of the 18 th century based on the hereditary rule of members of the al saud family . in the mid - 18 th century , a local alliance developed between the al saud and the members of a puritanical sunni islamic religious movement led by a cleric named mohammed ibn abd al wahhab . alliances between the al saud family and supporters of abd al wahhab ( referred to by some as wahhabis ) built two states in the arabian peninsula during the next century . each eventually collapsed under pressure from outside powers and inter - and intrafamily rivalries . during the first quarter of the 20 th century , an al saud chieftain named abd al aziz ibn abd al rahman al saud ( commonly referred to as ibn saud ) used force to unify much of the arabian peninsula under a restored al saud state . ibn saud's forces overcame numerous tribal rivals with the support of an armed wahhabi contingent known as the ikhwan ( or brotherhood ) , and , at times , with the financial and military backing of the british government . by 1932 , king abd al aziz and his armies had crushed an ikhwan revolt , consolidated control over most of the arabian peninsula , and declared the establishment of the kingdom of saudi arabia . six of ibn saud's sons — kings saud , faisal , khaled , fahd , abdullah , and salman — have succeeded him as rulers of the saudi kingdom during the subsequent eight decades . this era has been dominated by the development and export of the kingdom's massive oil resources , the resulting socioeconomic transformation of the country , and accompanying religious and cultural debates spurred by rapid change . during this period , al saud rulers have managed a complex consensus - based system of governance , balancing the various interests of tribal , religious , regional , political , and economic constituencies . a series of agreements , statements by successive u.s . administrations , arms sales , military training arrangements , and military deployments have demonstrated a strong u.s. security commitment to the saudi monarchy since the 1940s . that security commitment was built on shared economic interests and antipathy to communism and was tested by regional conflict during the cold war . it has survived the terrorism - induced strains of the post - cold war era relatively intact , and has continued as new arms sales to saudi arabia — the largest in u.s. history — are implemented . transition to a new generation of leadership in the al saud family , evolution in the saudi economy , and instability in the regional security environment may continue to create challenges and opportunities for the u.s. - saudi relationship . appendix b .
