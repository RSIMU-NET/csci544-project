some key changes are summarized below . the senate bill would establish a health - based safety standard for chemical use that protects vulnerable populations: manufacturers would be required to produce scientific data demonstrating "there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to human health or the environment from aggregate exposure to the chemical substance. s. 847 would prohibit manufacture , processing , and distribution of any chemical substance for any use that had not been included in the safety determination issued for that chemical . moreover , an exemption from a prohibition would be allowed for a particular use only if: it were "in the paramount interest of national security" ; lack of the chemical use "would cause significant disruption in the national economy" ; the use were essential or critical and there were no safer feasible alternative ; or the chemical use , relative to alternatives , provided a benefit to health , the environment , or public safety . in contrast , current law allows manufacture of and commerce in a chemical unless epa promulgates a rule including a finding that a chemical presents or will present an "unreasonable risk" to human health or the environment . if epa demonstrates that a risk associated with a chemical is unreasonable ( relative to the benefits provided by the chemical and the estimated risks and benefits of any alternatives ) , the agency is required to regulate , but only to the extent necessary to reduce that risk to a reasonable level and using "the least burdensome" restriction . 2601 et seq . ; tsca ) , giving the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) authority to regulate production and use of industrial chemicals not otherwise regulated in u.s. commerce . thirty - five years of experience with tsca implementation and enforcement have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to tsca's core provisions in title i . based on hearing testimony , stakeholders generally agree that tsca needs to be updated , although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions . democrats introduced legislation to amend tsca title i in the 111 th congress ( s. 3209 and h.r . 5820 ) , but congress did not vote on either bill . those previous bills proposed generally similar changes to tsca that were summarized in crs report r41335 , proposed amendments to the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) : senate and house bills compared with current law . on april 14 , 2011 , senator frank lautenberg introduced similar , but not identical , legislation ( s. 847 ) in the 112 th congress . to date , no other legislation has been introduced that would amend core provisions of tsca title i . therefore , this report compares key provisions of s. 847 , as introduced , with provisions of tsca title i ( 15 u.s.c . 2601 et seq. ) that would be affected if s. 847 becomes law . these provisions are summarized in tables 1 through 5 .
