we disagree . as we stated in our observations , successful implementation of certain aviation security measures mentioned under the national security goal is contingent upon deciding who will finance the security improvements and developing the needed technology . phyllis f. scheinberg , associate director , transportation issues ; resources , community , and economic development division , ( 202 ) 512-2834 . on july 31 , 1997 , we issued a report on the department of the treasury's draft strategic plan ( the results act: observations on the department of the treasury's july 1997 draft strategic plan , gao / ggd - 97-162r ) . treasury's formally issued strategic plan was submitted to omb and congress on september 30 , 1997 . as requested , we have reviewed the september 30 strategic plan and compared it with the observations in our july 31 report . on october 15 , 1997 , we briefed your staffs on our further observations on the strategic plan . the key points from our july report and october briefing are summarized herein . treasury's july draft strategic plan was incomplete and did not meet all of the requirements of the results act . of the six elements required by the act , the treasury draft plan included four . of these four elements , two — the mission statement and key factors external to the agency that could significantly affect achievement of the strategic goals and objectives — generally met the act's requirements , but , as we stated , these could have been strengthened . the information contained in the plan on the two other elements — goals and objectives and the strategies to achieve them — was often too general and vague to be used effectively by treasury management , congress , and other stakeholders . we said these two elements could be improved if they were more specific , results oriented , and linked to the plans of treasury's bureaus and major program offices . two elements — the relationship between long - term goals and objectives and annual performance goals , and a description of how program evaluations were used to establish or revise strategic plans — were missing from the draft plan we reviewed . the draft strategic plan did not adequately address crosscutting issues and made no mention of whether treasury had coordinated with other federal departments and agencies that shared related functions . in addition , although a major part of the mission statement was focused on management , the draft plan did not adequately address some of the critical management problems facing treasury that could affect its ability to achieve its strategic goals and objectives . finally , we said that treasury's capacity to provide reliable information on the achievement of strategic and program performance was questionable . treasury revised the four elements that were in its draft plan so that they better meet the requirements of the results act . in addition , the plan better addresses treasury's critical management problems and includes more information on how the department plans to coordinate with other agencies on crosscutting issues . treasury's plan is now presented as an overview with more detailed information provided in the plans of its 17 bureaus and major program offices .
