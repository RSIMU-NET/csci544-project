these agreements are generally not subject to the far . this authority originated in 1958 when congress gave the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) the authority to enter into contracts , leases , cooperative agreements , or “other transactions.” in 1989 , congress granted the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) temporary authority to use other transactions for advanced research projects . in 1991 , congress made this authority permanent and extended it to the military services . when the s&t directorate was established in 2003 , it hired scientists , engineers , and experts from federal laboratories , universities , and elsewhere in the federal government for a limited time under the intergovernmental personnel act ( ipa ) with the understanding that these staff would eventually return to their “home” institution . this created potential conflicts of interest for those staff responsible for managing s&t portfolios as these staff could be put in a position to make decisions on their “home” institutions . we recommended that dhs help the portfolio managers assigned through ipa comply with conflict of interest laws by improving the s&t directorate's management controls related to ethics . dhs has complied with these recommendations to define and standardize the role of these portfolio managers in the research and development process ; provide regular ethics training for these portfolio managers ; and determine whether conflict of interest waivers are necessary . the only outstanding recommendation concerns establishing a monitoring and oversight program of ethics - related management controls . furthermore , an s&t official told us the use of rotational portfolio managers has largely been eliminated with the exception of one portfolio manager who is currently serving a two - year term . with federal agencies' increased reliance on contractors to perform mission related functions comes an increased focus on the need to manage acquisitions in an efficient , effective , and accountable manner . the acquisition function is one area gao has identified as vulnerable to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement . an unintended consequence of the flexibility provided by other transaction authority is the potential loss of accountability and transparency . accordingly , management controls are needed to ensure intended acquisition outcomes are achieved while minimizing operational challenges . in 1993 , congress temporarily expanded darpa's other transaction authority , allowing the agency to use the agreements for prototype projects . dhs reported a total of 37 other transaction agreements , 30 of which were entered into in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 . accordingly , 88 percent of total spending was for agreements reached in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 ( see fig . while the total number of new agreements has decreased since 2005 , the total obligations under these agreements have generally increased because funds are obligated for agreements made in prior years ( see fig . the unique nature of other transaction agreements means that federal government acquisition staff working with these agreements should have experience in planning and conducting research and development acquisitions , strong business acumen , and sound judgment to enable them to operate in a relatively unstructured business environment .
