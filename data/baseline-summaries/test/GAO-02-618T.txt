lead development center . irs has adopted a strategy of identifying promoters of tax schemes as a key to halting their promotion and identifying those who have taken advantage of the scheme and thus likely owe taxes . by early april 2002 , sb / se is to initiate a lead development center . the center's primary functions are to develop case leads and assemble case information for distribution to compliance field offices for further investigation . initially the center will focus on abusive tax scheme promoters , and over time , it will expand to perform similar functions for fraud and anti - money laundering cases . also , the center will operate a computer laboratory that , among other things , is expected to monitor possible abusive promoter sites on the internet . in addition , the center is to serve as a coordinating link among various irs groups that deal with abusive tax scheme issues and with outside stakeholders such as the department of justice , the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , and others . the national fraud program , which operates at irs's campuses and field offices , coordinates efforts and provides oversight to irs's compliance efforts to identify potential tax fraud . in addition , the program helps identify trends and disseminates the information within irs and acts as a liaison on fraud cases involving bankruptcy and employment and excise taxes among other types of tax fraud . a national fraud program manager sets overall policy and program direction . fraud managers are located in five area offices , and they oversee the activities of about 65 fraud referral specialists . these specialists assist other irs revenue compliance staff in identifying cases with fraud potential , determining when indications of fraud are present , and developing potential cases . they also review fraud cases for technical accuracy and adequacy of supporting documentation to ensure appropriate and consistent application of fraud program guidelines and requirements . in cases where there is evidence of criminal activity , those cases are to be referred to criminal investigation within irs . for example , ci is planning to add tags such as “pay no tax,” and “form 1040” so that entering these terms will result in ci's internet site being listed in the displayed search results . ci is pursuing other possible strategies to ensure that ci's site rises to the top of internet search responses . for example , ci staff has occasionally visited known promoter internet sites to gather information on keywords used by those sites . irs plans to incorporate those keyword tags into its internet site . as a result , irs expects to increase the odds that the ci internet site would be included alongside internet sites that promote questionable tax avoidance strategies . irs's compliance staff identifies those returns claiming a possible false refund generally during these various return examination processes and referred to questionable refund detection teams ( qrdt ) . the qrdt staff within ci determines which returns should be pursued within ci or civilly . schemes with criminal potential are referred to ci field offices for investigation while schemes lacking criminal potential are referred to the appropriate irs compliance or collection group .
