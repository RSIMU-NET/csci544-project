( app . iv provides a copy of the questionnaire we used. ) extrapolating from the sample results , we estimate that at least 422 officials could have had contractor assignments working on defense contracts that were the responsibilities of their former dod agencies . we estimate that at least nine could have worked on contracts for which they had program oversight responsibilities or decision - making authority at dod . the contractors reported other information about the sampled individuals that justified why these work assignments would not involve potential conflicts of interest or violations of post - government employment restrictions , including the following: the individuals' cooling - off ( i.e. , restriction ) periods had expired . the individuals were performing behind - the - scenes work and did not have direct contacts with their former dod agencies about the particular defense contracts . the individuals were working on different defense projects than they had worked on while at dod but for the same agencies . for example , while the contractors reported that 20 former navy officials in our sample worked on navy contracts , the contractors also reported that none of the individuals were working on the same project they were responsible for when in the navy . how often are the records of government project related job assignments updated ? most of the 47 major defense contractors who responded to our survey on practices related to post - government employment report using a range of techniques to ensure awareness of and employee compliance with restrictions , although we found contractors were challenged to provide accurate information identifying their former dod officials . how would you characterize the completeness of your personal data records regarding the government project related job assignments employees have worked on at your company ? notably , information from the contractors showed little more than half the level of employment of former dod officials than information we derived from matching irs and dod data , suggesting the information challenge defense contractors and dod face in monitoring former dod officials . what limitations , if any , are there of the government project related job assignments data your company maintains ? moreover , what information the contractors may have on former dod officials' assignments on defense contracts is , for the most part , not available to dod . what reviews , if any , have there been of the integrity of your company's government project related job assignments record keeping system ? new legislation requiring former officials to obtain ethics advisory letters and dod to keep them in a central database could provide some additional information , but will not give dod the kind of information needed â€” that is , the names of contractor employees who are former dod officials and are working on a particular contract and the contractor's assurance that these employees are in compliance with their post - government employment restrictions related to the contract . does your company require training that informs and reinforces its policies regarding post - employment restrictions for former federal government employees ?
