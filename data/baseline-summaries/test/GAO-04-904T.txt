our report contains several recommendations . how do first responders know that they have met their preparedness goals ? ncr is an example of the difficulties of answering the second and third questions in particular . the region faces significant challenges in managing homeland security dollars . oncrc and ncr jurisdictions face three interrelated challenges that limit their ability to jointly manage federal funds in a way that demonstrates increased first responder capacities and preparedness while minimizing inefficiency and unnecessary duplication of expenditures . first , a lack of preparedness standards for both equipment and performance means that it is difficult to assess first responder capabilities , identify gaps in those capabilities , and measure progress in closing those gaps . as in other areas of the nation generally , ncr does not have a set of accepted benchmarks ( best practices ) and performance goals that could be used to identify desired goals and determine whether first responders have the ability to respond to threats and emergencies with well - planned , well - coordinated , and effective efforts that involve police , fire , emergency medical , public health , and other personnel from multiple jurisdictions . second , a strategic plan for the use of homeland security funds — whether in ncr or elsewhere — should be based on established goals , priorities , and measures , and align spending plans with those priorities and goals . at the time of our review , oncrc had developed a regional spending plan for the urban area security initiative grants , but this plan was not part of a broader coordinated plan for spending federal grant funds and developing first responder capacity and preparedness in ncr . the lack of benchmarks and performance goals may contribute to difficulties in developing a coordinated region - wide plan for determining how to spend federal funds and assessing the benefits of that spending . third , there is no established process or means for regularly and reliably collecting data on ( 1 ) the amounts of first responder grants available to each jurisdiction and ( 2 ) the budget plans and criteria used for determining spending allocations and budget priorities . reliable data are needed to establish accountability , analyze gaps , and assess progress toward meeting established performance goals . without such data , it is difficult to verify the results of preparedness assessments and to establish a baseline that could be used to develop plans to address outstanding needs . it should be noted that the fragmented nature of the multiple federal grants available to first responders — some awarded to states , some to localities , some directly to local first responder agencies — may make it more difficult to collect and maintain region - wide data on grant funds received and the use of those funds in ncr . what challenges exist within ncr to organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs ? what gaps , if any , remain in the emergency preparedness of ncr ? even if those data were available , a lack of standards against which to evaluate the data would also have made it difficult to assess any gaps .
