one has to do with profit . contractors' fuel costs are intended to be “pass - through” costs , with the postal service reimbursing the contractors for the fuel costs specified in their contracts . the contract prices are based on an estimated price per gallon and an estimated number of gallons to be consumed annually . if the contractors' actual price per gallon paid deviates from the contract's estimated price per gallon by 5 cents or more , they may submit a request for a contract price adjustment . updated fuel cost information from the contractor can be required if the contracting officer suspects that the contractor is being allowed reimbursement for fuel costs greater than those actually being incurred . however , given the volume of contracts , it is difficult and resource intensive to keep up with the fuel price changes , and therefore contracting officers primarily rely on the contractors to submit fuel adjustments . in practice , however , according to postal service officials , contractors are typically quick to submit an adjustment when they are paying more than the contract price , but slow to do so when they are able to obtain the fuel more cheaply . for highway contracts not under the bulk fuel program , contractors have been able to retain the difference between their actual expenditures for fuel and their contract price . the procedures for contract price adjustments under the bulk fuel program do not allow contractors this opportunity . contractors have cited other reasons for resisting the program . they say they have built strong business relationships with their local fuel suppliers and that those suppliers are more responsive than the major suppliers designated in the bulk fuel program . they also believe that , as a business decision , they should be able to elect where to purchase their fuel . some have shown that they can buy fuel more cheaply from their local suppliers than under the bulk fuel program . postal service officials point out that , while it is true that in certain cases the bulk fuel price may not be the lowest , the only way that the savings can be achieved is if a large number of contractors participate in the program . they also note that fuel is supposed to be a pass - through cost and , therefore , contractors should not be concerned that the bulk fuel price may be higher than a discount rate they may be able to obtain on their own . second , effective implementation has been hampered by the postal service's lack of success in bringing new fueling locations into the bulk fuel program . postal service officials recognize that , with only 44 locations available to contractors to buy fuel under the program , the postal service's anticipated savings cannot be achieved . in a solicitation issued april 8 , 2003 , the postal service requested proposals from fuel suppliers in an effort to add 22 locations to the program . the intention was to increase the number of gallons highway contractors purchase at bulk fuel prices by having these additional suppliers distribute fuel purchased from the two national bulk fuel companies .
