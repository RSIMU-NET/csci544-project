no incarcerated individual is eligible for any of the loan programs . prior to that , bjs conducted the spi in 1974 , 1979 , 1986 , 1991 , 1997 , and 2004 , when it was known as the survey of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities . neither the nps or the spi collects data on the types of degrees prisoners seek , how many receive a postsecondary certificate or degree , how much time they spend taking courses , how instruction is provided ( eg , onsite , through correspondence courses , online ) , or how postsecondary education programs are funded . nonetheless , bjs has decades of experience collecting data on prison inmates from state correctional agencies and bop . congress could consider expanding bjs's mandate under 34 u.s.c . section 10132 to require the collection and reporting of more detailed data on postsecondary education in correctional facilities . however , states participate in the nps program voluntarily , so if data collection efforts become too burdensome there is the possibility that some state correctional systems will decline to participate . as a way of promoting state participation in data collection efforts , policymakers might also consider whether to make participation a condition of receiving grant funds under a program such as the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant ( jag ) program . one limitation of both of the nps program and the spi is that they only collect data on prisoners while they are incarcerated . variables that are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of postsecondary correctional education programs―such as rearrest , reconviction , and reincarceration ; post - release educational attainment ; post - release employment , and the nature of post - release employment ; to just name a few―can only be collected after prisoners have been released , and sometimes several years after they have been released . even though there are existing data sources that could be used to measure recidivism ( eg , criminal history records data maintained by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) or in state criminal history repositories ) , a new federally sponsored longitudinal data collection effort to track whether prisoners attain education credentials post - release or find employment post - release would enable additional research on the relationship between education and post - incarceration success . in addition , policymakers might consider whether to authorize the fbi to share criminal history records with non - governmental research organizations for the purpose of promoting and conducting recidivism research . congress might also consider other ways to promote research on prisoners' postsecondary education and its impact on recidivism and employment . the literature on postsecondary correctional education lacks studies that utilized randomized controlled trials , which are regarded as the gold standard of social science research . while randomized controlled trials could help draw more definitive conclusions about whether participation in postsecondary education reduces recidivism , it might also undermine the aims of the proposed policy change . a randomized controlled trial would require prisoners to be randomly assigned to a treatment group ( postsecondary education programming ) or a control group ( no postsecondary education programming ) .
