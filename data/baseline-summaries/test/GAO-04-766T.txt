counting the votes . finally , implementation of the processes for counting votes is affected both by the technology used and by local requirements . with dres , votes are collected within each unit . some contain removable storage media that can be taken from the voting unit and transported to a central location to be tallied . others can be configured to electronically transmit the vote totals from the polling place to a central tally location . as described earlier , optical scan systems also vary in the way votes are counted , depending on whether precinct - based or centralized tabulation equipment is used . for optical scan systems , officials follow state and local regulations and processes to determine whether and how to count ballots that cannot be read by the tabulation equipment . counting such ballots may involve decisions on how to judge voter intent , which are also generally governed by state and local regulations and processes . in addition , depending on the type of voting technology used , ways to perform recounts may differ . for optical scan devices , recounts can be both automatic and manual ; as in the original vote counting , officials make decisions on counting ballots that cannot be read by the tabulation equipment and on voter intent . with dres there is no separate paper ballot or record of the voter's intention , and therefore election officials rely on the information recorded in the machine's memory: that is , permanent ( read only ) electronic images of each of the “marked” ballots . the assurance that these images are an accurate record of the vote depends on several things , including the proper implementation of the processes involved in designing , maintaining , setting up , and using the technology . in 2001 , we identified four key challenges confronting local jurisdictions in effectively using and replacing voting technologies . these challenges are not dissimilar to those faced by any organization seeking to leverage modern technology to support mission operations . the first two challenges are particularly relevant in the near term , as jurisdictions look to position themselves for this year's national elections . whether ballots are electronic or paper , they need to be designed in a way that promotes voter understanding when they are actually used . designing both optical scan and dre ballots requires consideration of the different types of human interaction entailed and the application of some human factors expertise . for dres , programming skills need to be applied to create the ballot and enter the ballot information onto an electronic storage medium , which is then uploaded to the unit . for optical scan systems , paper ballots need to be designed and printed in specified numbers for distribution to polling places ; they may also be used for absentee balloting , usually in combination with printed mailing envelopes . electronic “ballots” in dre units do not require distribution separate from the distribution of the voting equipment itself ; however , the use of dres means that a separate technique is necessary for absentee ballots — generally paper ballots . thus , the use of these units generally requires a mixed election system . voter education .
