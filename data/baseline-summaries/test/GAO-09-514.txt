open . during our fiscal year 2006 audit , we tested a statistical sample of manual interest transactions and estimated that 18 percent of irs's manual interest population contains errors . we concluded that irs controls over this area was still ineffective . the ineffectiveness of these controls contributes to errors in taxpayer records , which is a major component of the material weakness in irs's management of unpaid assessments . while irs has undertaken several actions to strengthen controls over this area , such as updating guidance and providing training related to manual interest calculations , it has yet to develop a sampling methodology to monitor the accuracy of its manual interest computation and assess the effectiveness of its corrective actions . consequently , we did not test irs controls in this area as part of our fiscal year 2008 audit , as both we and irs believed that the actions taken by irs thus far would not improve the accuracy of the manual interest calculations . we will continue to monitor irs's actions to address this recommendation during future audits . internal revenue service: immediate and long - term actions needed to improve financial management ( gao / aimd - 99-16 , oct. 30 , 1998 ) open . small business / self - employed ( sb / se ) continues to request programming changes to increase automated trust fund recovery systemic processing to reduce the number of accounts requiring manual intervention . irs reviews trust fund recovery penalty ( tfrp ) transactions to ensure accurate and timely recording , including performance assurance system reviews by a daily random selection of closed cases , management reviews of a random selection of both closed and open casework , and headquarters operational reviews . in addition to the above reviews , campus compliance services is exploring the development and implementation of a statistically valid sampling plan to monitor the accuracy and timeliness of the cross - referencing of payments and credits to tfrp accounts . the frequency and process for performing these internal reviews will be considered during development . in addition , in fiscal year 2008 , irs ( 1 ) established an office of cost accounting within its cfo , ( 2 ) completed several cost pilots to demonstrate its capability to use the cost data within ifs and the associated workload and production data from its business unit systems to calculate the full costs of its products , services , and programs , and ( 3 ) completed development of the return on investment for the earned income tax credit program that includes full cost information . however , irs has not extended the cost pilot methodology to develop full cost information on the full range of irs's programs . nevertheless , in order to provide recommendations more closely aligned with the current status , we have agreed with irs to close this recommendation based on irs's progress to date and have reported the remaining issues , along with related recommendations for corrective action , in our june 2009 management report . see gao - 09-513r and recommendations 09-14 and 09-15 in this report .
