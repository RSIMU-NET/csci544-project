generally , there are three levels of judicial scrutiny . congress enacted the gun control act of 1968 ( gca or act ) to "keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age , criminal background , or incompetency , and to assist law enforcement authorities in the states and their subdivisions in combating the increasing prevalence of crime in the united states. the gca establishes a comprehensive statutory scheme that regulates the manufacture , sale , transfer , and possession of firearms and ammunition . for instance , the gca prohibits federal firearms licensees ( or licensed dealers ) from selling handguns to any person under the age of 21 and long guns ( i.e. , rifles and shotguns ) to any person under the age of 18 . the second circuit also determined that the second amendment " must have some application in the very different context of public possession of firearms. licensed dealers are also subject to several requirements designed to ensure that a firearm is not transferred to an individual disqualified from possession under the act . under federal law there are nine categories of persons who prohibited from possessing , receiving , or transferring a firearm . unlike the maryland regulation in woollard i , the second circuit decided that the new york proper cause requirement passes muster under intermediate scrutiny . deferring to the state legislature's policy judgments , the court concluded that rather than forbidding anyone from carrying a handgun in public , new york took "a more moderate approach to fulfilling its important objective and reasonably concluded that only individuals having a bona fide reason to possess handguns should be allowed to introduce them into the public sphere. these include ( 1 ) prohibitions on certain persons based on age and on criminal history ; ( 2 ) state concealed carry laws ; and ( 3 ) state and local assault weapons bans . an examination of these categories could provide some insight as to how courts might assess future firearms legislation on second amendment grounds . in the 113 th congress , several gun control proposals have been introduced . these include , among others , measures that would ban certain assault weapons and prohibit possession of large capacity magazines ( eg , s. 150 / h.r . 437 / s. 33 ) ; and measures that would require background checks on private transfers of firearms or ammunition ( eg , s. 22 / s. 174 / s. 374 / h.r . a significant question left open by the court in heller centers on the standard of scrutiny that should be applied to laws regulating the possession and use of firearms . first , strict scrutiny , the most rigorous , requires a statute to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest . second , intermediate scrutiny , requires a statute to further a government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest . third , the rational basis standard merely requires the statute to be rationally related to a legitimate government function .
