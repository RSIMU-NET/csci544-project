each house. to that end , it seems understood that the criminal contempt statute was intended to supplement each house's inherent contempt power , rather than to replace it . the supreme court has specifically articulated this view and , in fact , gone further to suggest that "congress could not divest itself , or either of its houses , of the essential and inherent power to punish for contempt. historical practice also supports this conclusion , as congress continued to use the inherent contempt power after enactment of the criminal contempt statute . as applied to subpoena enforcement , the supreme court has affirmed the existence of each house's constitutionally based authority to arrest and detain individuals for refusing to comply with congressional demands for information . the 1927 case of mcgrain v. daugherty may be viewed as the high - water mark of the judiciary's recognition of this power . mcgrain arose from a senate investigation into the alleged failure of the attorney general to prosecute federal antitrust violations associated with the teapot dome scandal . as part of that investigation , a subpoena was issued to mallie daugherty , the brother of the attorney general and president of an ohio bank , for relevant testimony . when daugherty refused to comply , the senate exercised its inherent contempt power and ordered its sergeant - at - arms to take mr. daugherty into custody . once arrested , daugherty filed a writ of habeas corpus with the local district court , which , upon review , held the house's action unlawful and directed that daugherty be discharged from the sergeant - at - arm's custody . the supreme court reversed and upheld the house's authority to arrest and detain a witness in order to obtain information for legislative purposes — noting that "[t]he power of inquiry — with process to enforce it — is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. in an oft - quoted passage , the court declared: a legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change ; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information — which not infrequently is true — recourse must be had to others who do possess it . experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing , and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete ; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed . although broadly conceived , the court has policed the outer confines of the inherent contempt power . that said , the prevailing enforcement mechanisms of criminal contempt of congress and civil enforcement , both of which rely on the assistance and participation of the other branches of government , have certain drawbacks that arguably limit their effectiveness in ensuring timely compliance with congressional subpoenas by executive branch officials . as discussed , alternatives to the current framework are available , but both the constitutional separation of powers and the practical limitations arising from the political nature of congressional executive information access disputes would likely need to be considered in any potential effort at reform .
