, 60 votes if there are no vacancies ) . if the cloture vote is successful , another 30 hours of consideration are in order before a vote on the underlying business must occur . although examples of uc agreements placing a similar 60-vote threshold provisions can be found dating from at least the early 1990s , the practice has increased in frequency over the last four years . unanimous consent agreements that impose a 60-vote threshold may be agreed to at any time , either in advance , or during consideration . it is notable that unlike senate rules requiring super majorities , which typically are framed in terms of a fraction either of the membership or those voting ( eg , two - thirds , three - fifths ) , these uc agreements explicitly state the number of votes required . given that practices generally specify disposition for a question that achieves a majority vote , but not a super - majority vote imposed by unanimous consent , the language of these uc agreements typically provides for disposition of the amendment or measure if it fails to achieve the required 60 votes . typically , the matter is withdrawn , but it could alternately be laid on the table or returned to the calendar for example , in one uc agreement , the senate agreed that "... two amendments be subject to a 60 affirmative vote threshold , and that if neither achieves that threshold , then it be withdrawn. unanimous consent agreements including a 60-vote threshold may be used not just to avoid the steps associated with invoking cloture , but also to avoid a separate vote on waiving a point of order raised under the congressional budget act . in the senate , most points of order under the budget act may be waived by a vote of at least three - fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn ( 60 votes if there are no vacancies ) . in one uc agreement , the senate agreed to a 60-vote threshold for the passage of a conference report stipulating that a vote on the waiving of a budget act point of order also be treated as a simultaneous vote on adoption . these amendments or measures are sometimes of a controversial nature with potential to be subjected to extended consideration or even a filibuster . by incorporating a 60-vote threshold , such uc agreements avoid the multiple requirements associated with senate rule xxii , both for invoking cloture and for consideration under cloture . such uc agreements ensure that a measure will not be successful without the same level of super - majority support that would be required for cloture by stipulating that if the 60-vote threshold is not reached , the matter will be disposed of . as with all uc agreements , once agreed to , they can be altered only by the adoption of a further uc agreement . several possible effects could result from the senate choosing to impose a 60-vote threshold for the passage of legislation . first , for cases in which a large majority of senators is in favor of or opposed to the question , the time that would ordinarily be required to invoke cloture can be avoided .
