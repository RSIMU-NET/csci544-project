our recommendation was not implemented . our current review found that in the arng , incentives are not always being used to fill military occupational specialties that are consistently below authorized levels and that incentives are being sometimes used for military occupational specialties that are consistently above approved levels . specifically , we found that there were several military occupational specialties that were consistently below 80 percent of approved rates from fiscal year 2012 though fiscal year 2014 . these military occupational specialties were in areas including electronic warfare , explosives ordnance disposal , and special forces , which have all been identified as important to dod . for example , data provided by arng showed that while one special forces military occupational specialty was only at 70 , 66 , and 69 percent filled from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 , respectively , only 14 contracts containing incentives were approved for individuals in these occupational specialties during that time frame . arng officials stated that , depending on the demographics of a given area in close proximity to a unit and the requirements to fill positions within a particular unit , it may be difficult to find applicants who meet the qualifications of an available position . further , data provided by the arng also showed that some military occupational specialties were consistently filled over approved levels yet hundreds of contracts containing incentives were approved for individuals in these positions from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 . for example , one supply military occupational specialty was at 118 , 116 , and 113 percent of authorized levels from fiscal year 2012 through 2014 , respectively , and yet over 880 contracts containing incentives for these positions were awarded during that time frame . officials stated that incentives can be awarded to positions even when the national authorized level is above 100 percent if , for example , the unit or state - level fill rates are low . furthermore , the department of the army and arng - hrm have not exercised their oversight responsibilities to evaluate and document the effectiveness of the arng's financial incentives program in achieving overall objectives . a department of the army official stated that he believed that it was not the role of department of the army to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the arng's financial incentives program , and that he believed that it was the arng - hrm's responsibility to do so . according to arng - hrm officials , the effectiveness of the incentive programs is evaluated on a regular basis . however , arng - hrm officials have not documented results of any evaluations or documented that their current financial incentives programs are meeting overall objectives . department of the army and national guard regulations state that the department of the army office of the deputy chief of staff for personnel and arng - hrm , respectively , will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the arng financial incentives program in achieving overall objectives .
