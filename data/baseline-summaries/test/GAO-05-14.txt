hud agreed with three of our recommendations . specifically , it agreed to consider a requirement to include , when targeting appraisers for review , those appraisers who have recently completed a sanction period . also , the department agreed to modify its system to archive quarterly reports in response to our recommendation that it maintain the historical information used to target appraisers for review . further , it agreed to consider implementing a cost - effective field review contractor oversight process that includes on - site monitoring . however , hud disagreed with our recommendation that it institute reasonable controls on the process of placing appraisers on the appraiser roster . hud commented that our report inaccurately stated that hud does not document all verifications of appraisers' eligibility for the roster and has limited quality control over the approval process , noting that the department has a paper record of the application review process whereby each applicant's eligibility is verified and documented . hud also noted that we did not review its paper records of the application review process . we modified the report to clarify that our primary concern was quality control , in general , and not solely documentation . we did not review the paper files because it was not our objective to test whether or not specific verifications had been performed , but rather to examine the overall verification and documentation procedures hud relies on to ensure that appraisers meet its criteria . in doing so we observed a control weakness and we modified the report to clarify this weakness . appendix i provides additional details on our scope and methodology . each year , hud helps hundreds of thousands of americans finance home purchases by insuring their mortgage loans . hud insures private lenders against losses on mortgages for single - family homes — which hud defines as structures with one to four dwelling units — and plays a particularly large role in certain market segments , including low - income borrowers and first - time homebuyers . the loan amount that hud can insure is based , in part , on the appraised value of the home . the primary role of appraisals in the loan underwriting process is to provide evidence that the collateral value of the property is sufficient to avoid losses on loans if the borrower is unable to repay the loan . if a borrower defaults and the lender subsequently forecloses on the loan , the lender can file an insurance claim with hud for nearly all of its losses , including the unpaid balance of the loan . after the claim is paid , the lender transfers the title of the home to hud , which is responsible for managing and selling the property . most of the mortgages are insured by fha under its mutual mortgage insurance fund . to cover claims for lenders' losses , fha deposits insurance premiums paid by borrowers into the fund , which , historically , has been self - sufficient . figure 1 shows the role appraisals play as part of the home - buying process .
