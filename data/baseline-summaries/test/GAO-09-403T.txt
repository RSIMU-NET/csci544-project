mda conducts testing both on the ground and in flight . the most complex of these is an end - to - end flight test that involves a test of all phases of an engagement including detecting , tracking and destroying a target with an interceptor missile . an end - to - end intercept involves more than one mda element . for example , a recent intercept test involved a target flown out of kodiak , alaska , tracked by the an / tpy - 2 radar located in alaska , and the beale upgraded early warning radar located in california , the sea - based x - band radar and an aegis radar located at different points in the pacific . all of the radars communicated with fire control centers in alaska to guide an interceptor launched from california to hit the target over the pacific ocean . due to the complexity , scale , safety constraints , and cost involved , mda is unable to conduct a sufficient number of flight tests to fully understand the performance of the system . therefore , mda utilizes models and simulations , anchored by flight tests , to understand both the developmental and operational performance of the system . to ensure confidence in the accuracy of modeling and simulation the program goes through a process called accreditation . the models are validated individually using flight and other test data and accredited for their intended use . models and simulations are used prior to a flight test to predict performance , the flight test is then run to gather data and verify the models , and then data is analyzed after the flight and reconstructed using the models and simulations to confirm their accuracy . mda intends to group these models into system - level representations according to user needs . one such grouping is the annual performance assessment , a system - level end - to - end simulation that assesses the performance of the bmds configuration as it exists in the field . the performance assessment integrates element - specific models into a coherent representation of the bmds . fundamentally , performance assessments anchored by flight tests are a comprehensive means to fully understand the performance capabilities and limitations of the bmds . in addition to testing , modeling and simulation , and performance assessments , mda also has a formal process for determining when a newly fielded asset or group of assets can be declared operational â€” that is , cleared for use by the warfighter in operational situations . flight tests are , however , an essential tool used to both validate performance of the bmds and to anchor the models and simulations to ensure they accurately reflect real performance . computer models of individual elements replicate how those elements function . these models are then aggregated into various combinations that simulate the bmds engagement of enemy ballistic missiles . developing an end - to - end system - level model and simulation has been difficult . for example , mda plans to conduct 14 of 18 flight tests in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 .
