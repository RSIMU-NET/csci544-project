the asset is then transferred to the u.s . marshals service for deposit into the seized asset deposit fund . the u.s. attorney's office or the seizing agency must provide notice to interested parties and conduct internet publication prior to entry of an administrative declaration of forfeiture or a court - ordered final order of forfeiture . once the forfeiture is finalized , the seizing agency or the u.s. attorney's office enters the forfeiture information into the consolidated asset tracking system . marshals service subsequently transfers the asset from the seized asset deposit fund to the aff . similarly , the asset forfeiture process for the treasury forfeiture program involves a department of homeland security or treasury investigative agency seizing the asset ( funds , in the cases we reviewed ) . the division and the 93 u.s . attorneys have the responsibility for overseeing criminal matters as well as certain civil litigation . with respect to bsa / aml regulations , doj may pursue investigations of financial institutions and individuals for both civil and criminal violations that may result in dispositions including fines , penalties , or the forfeiture of assets . in the cases brought against financial institutions that we reviewed , the assets were either cash or financial instruments . under the statutes and regulations that guide the assessment amounts for fines , penalties , and forfeitures , each federal agency has the discretion to consider the financial institution's cooperation and remediation of their bsa / aml internal controls , among other factors . the fcpa contains both antibribery and accounting provisions that apply to issuers of securities , including financial institutions . the antibribery provisions prohibit issuers , including financial institutions , from making corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain or retain business . the accounting provisions require issuers to make and keep accurate books and records and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls , among other things . sec and doj are jointly responsible for enforcing the fcpa and have authority over issuers , their officers , directors , employees , stockholders , and agents acting on behalf of the issuer for violations , as well as entities that violate the fcpa . both sec and doj have civil enforcement authority over the fcpa's antibribery provisions as well as over accounting provisions that apply to issuers . doj also has criminal enforcement authority . generally , financial sanctions programs create economic penalties in support of u.s. policy priorities , such as countering national security threats . sanctions are authorized by statute or executive order , and may be comprehensive ( against certain countries ) or more targeted ( against individuals and groups such as regimes , terrorists , weapons of mass destruction proliferators , and narcotics traffickers ) . sanctions are used to , among other things , block assets , impose trade embargos , prohibit trade and investment with some countries , and bar economic and military assistance to certain regimes . for example , financial institutions are prohibited from using the u.s. financial system to make funds available to designated individuals or banks and other entities in countries targeted by sanctions .
