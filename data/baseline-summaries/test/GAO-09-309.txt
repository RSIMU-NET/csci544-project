most of these expenditures were for tutoring and counseling . specific examples of how institutions used grant funds to address student support challenges follow: a 2-year strengthening institution in illinois reported in 2005 that 75 percent of its first - year students were at risk of leaving college without a degree because the institution could not provide adequate academic support and advisement . to reduce the likelihood that students would fail or drop out , the school reported spending $360,000 in grant funds to provide training to 175 faculty members on the use of multimedia and technology , active learning , and strategies to support various learning styles . graduation rates were lower as well . specifically , 39 percent of students at eligible 4-year institutions received a bachelor's degree within 6 years of enrolling , compared to 60 percent of students at ineligible 4-year institutions . according to a recent education study , graduation rates may decline as the percentage of an institution's low - income student population increases . this may be for a variety of reasons , including a student's academic preparation , working full - time while enrolled , parents' educational attainment , as well as an institution's selectivity in admissions . however , the report also found that several highly selective minority serving institutions enrolled a significant number of low - income students and were high performers with respect to graduation . another possible explanation for the difference in graduation rates may also be tied to institutional expenditures . one study reported that those institutions with lower expenditures on student support services had lower graduation rates . graduation rates for both eligible and ineligible 2-year public institutions were similar ; however , the relevance of graduation rates at 2- year institutions has been widely debated since students may enroll in these institutions for a variety of reasons other than completing a degree or certificate program . nearly all grantees reported institutional management challenges , including recruiting and retaining qualified staff , updating technology on campuses , addressing administrative challenges such as financial aid or student registration , undertaking strategic planning , or tracking student performance . twenty - eight percent of all fiscal year 2006 grantees funded at least one activity in this area , and expenditures on institutional management represented about 17 percent of total grant funds spent . specific examples of how institutions used grant funds to address institutional management challenges follow: a 2-year alaska native - serving institution reported significant staffing shortages due to its isolated location , and its staff had to perform a variety of jobs . for example , the business office director also occasionally performs building and grounds maintenance tasks , such as shoveling sidewalks and handling computer problems . additionally , a staff member assigned to manage the bookstore was also responsible for providing financial aid advice . while it is not possible to address all challenges with title iii funds , the grant was a critical first step in establishing four full - time financial aid positions that have since become part of the college's budget . a 4-year historically black university in north carolina that ranks high nationally in the production of computer science graduates reported it has difficulty maintaining its ongoing investment in its technology infrastructure .
