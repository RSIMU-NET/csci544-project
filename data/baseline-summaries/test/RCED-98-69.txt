this report describes the results of our work . when the air quality problem occurred at niehs in 1981 , far less was known about indoor air pollution than is known today , and there was a strong emphasis on energy conservation . as a result of the emphasis on energy conservation at that time , building engineers at facilities across the country had reduced the air exchange rate of air handling systems and initiated other conservation measures . the initial monitoring , which took place on september 28 and 29 , 1981 , found that the formaldehyde levels on the second floor of module a ranged from 0.1 to 0.34 ppm — well below osha's standard in effect in 1981 . subsequent monitoring between january 20 and march 1 , 1982 , by the school of public health and others showed formaldehyde levels that were no higher than 0.044 ppm . the monitors were placed on top of desks , in closed wooden bookcases , and in other locations and attached to the clothing of some employees . formaldehyde levels , however , may have been higher when the employees first moved into the space than when the measurements were taken because research shows that formaldehyde levels in enclosed spaces decrease rapidly during the first few days to several weeks . the contractor also sampled the air in modules a and b for 22 other organic substances and detected minute amounts — less than 0.1 ppm — for 10 of these substances , such as benzene , toluene , and trichloroethane . according to the contractor , the level for each of these substances was well below the standard in effect at the time . an air quality survey done by the national institute for occupational safety and health for niehs in march 1982 reported that the primary source of the formaldehyde was the particle board in the office furnishings . niehs officials said that adjustments were made to balance the air flow and introduce more outside air in module a during the first 5.5 months to alleviate respiratory problems that some employees reported . according to the officials , because the air was not being monitored during this period , the levels of formaldehyde that the employees were exposed to are unknown . we will also make copies available to others on request . please call me at ( 202 ) 512-6111 if you or your staff have any questions . major contributors to this report are listed in appendix iii . upeo noed opossbe lino a quali5 / 3 e m poee agan went to hopa ; 4 / 20 e mpoee went to hopa4 / 11 m oed no new buildng 9 / 29 teand baane eae gned ( n baane ) 9 / 28 - 29 fa am pe ( .1ppm and .34ppm ) 2 / 11 w oe ompenaonomiled b empoee 4 / 27 mem oom heah and ae egadng a handling non peebaane n sepem be 1981 1 / 20 - 21 a ampe ( aeage of .04ppm ) 3 / 25 - 26 soue deemnedo beunue 2 / 25 - 3 / 1 a am pe ( upo .044ppm ) .
