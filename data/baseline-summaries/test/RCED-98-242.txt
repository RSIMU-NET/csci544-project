( app . ii provides more information on these programs. ) according to information from studies and the programs themselves , royalty - in - kind programs seem to be feasible if certain conditions are present . in particular , the programs seem to be most workable if the lessors have ( 1 ) relatively easy access to pipelines to transport the oil or gas to market centers or refineries , ( 2 ) leases that produce relatively large volumes of oil or gas , ( 3 ) competitive arrangements for processing gas , and ( 4 ) expertise in marketing oil or gas . texas accepts gas royalties in kind from about 6 percent of its leases ; the program is intended to increase royalty revenues for the state's school fund and to provide gas to state facilities — schools , universities , hospitals , and prisons — at a cheaper price than is offered by local gas distribution companies . the university of texas accepts gas royalties in kind from seven of its leases and sells this gas under a single contract . to determine what information mms used to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations , we reviewed mms' reasons for proposing new regulations as published in federal register notices and read all of the comments submitted in response to the first notice that solicited information on oil marketing and the relevance of posted prices . we interviewed officials in mms' royalty valuation division and reviewed the marketing studies for which mms had contracted . we also reviewed the final report of the interagency task force that examined federal oil valuation in california and interviewed individuals who had served on that task force and individuals who were involved in the city of long beach's litigation . in addition , we solicited information on lawsuits and settlements from state representatives present at a meeting of the state and tribal royalty audit committee in denver , colorado , and we subsequently contacted representatives of these various states for additional information . to ascertain how mms addressed concerns expressed by the oil industry and states in developing its proposed regulations , we identified 39 major issues on which mms had solicited comments in its federal register notices . we selected a judgmental sample of about 50 percent of the 183 letters that were submitted to mms in response to these notices . in selecting this sample , we sought to represent a cross - section of the oil industry and included in our sample major oil companies that both produced and refined oil , large independent companies that only produced oil , small independent producers , independent refiners , oil marketers , and oil industry trade associations . alaska and mms both operate oil royalty - in - kind programs under which they sell the oil in noncompetitive sales to small refiners . major contributors are listed in appendix v . in developing its proposed oil valuation regulations , the minerals management service ( mms ) received comments from the oil industry making the point that separate oil markets exist in different geographic areas of the united states .
