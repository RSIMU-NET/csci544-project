the federal budget has been in deficit ( i.e. , spending has exceeded revenues ) since 2002 , and deficits were significantly larger from 2009 to 2012 than in any other year since world war ii . as a result , the federal debt held by the public increased from 39% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2008 to 72% of gdp in 2013 , which was its highest share of gdp since after world war ii . from 1946 to 2008 , budget deficits averaged 1.7% of gdp and exceeded 5% of gdp only three times ( equaling 7.2% in 1946 , 6.0% in 1983 , and 5.1% of gdp in 1985 ) . in long - term projections , cbo assumes discretionary spending will remain at its 2024 share of gdp . this has reduced discretionary defense spending relative to the september 2008 baseline , which assumed that such spending would increase at the rate of inflation each year . for 2012 to 2021 , the budget control act ( bca ; p.l . 112-25 ) reduced discretionary spending and mandatory spending relative to the baseline . the bca implemented spending cuts through statutory caps for defense and non - defense discretionary spending for 2012 to 2021 and sequestration for mandatory spending for 2013 to 2021 . the bca exempted most mandatory spending programs from sequestration and capped medicare cuts at 2% . on the discretionary side , the bca exempted military oco , disaster spending , and emergency spending from the spending caps . the bca did not provide any details as to what discretionary programs would absorb the cuts needed to adhere to the defense and non - defense caps , however , and congress has struggled to reach a consensus on that issue each year since the bca was enacted . through 2014 , total discretionary spending has ended up higher than envisioned under the bca because of subsequent legislation reversing some of the bca spending cuts and because spending in categories exempt from the caps was higher than envisioned . overall , discretionary spending was $75 billion lower in 2013 and is projected to be $120 billion lower in 2014 than the september 2008 baseline level . the bca cuts to mandatory spending were not large enough to offset other legislative changes that increased mandatory spending in 2013 or 2014 . c hanges that permanently increased deficit . various legislative changes since september 2008 have permanently increased the deficit . the major changes involve the extension of expiring tax provisions and temporary extensions of the "doc fix. congress temporarily extended expiring tax provisions , including major tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 , numerous times . most provisions from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were permanently extended in the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l . 112-240 ) in january 2013 . atra also temporarily extended arra's tax cuts until 2017 and reduced revenues overall by $3.9 trillion over 10 years . it peaked at 14.5% of gdp in 2009 , marking its highest share of gdp since data were first compiled in 1962 .
