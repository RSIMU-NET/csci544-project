this is accomplished through an adversarialhearing process . the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will bepermitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among thevarious customer classes ( residential , commercial , and industrial ) . under the fpa , federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates forelectric power flowing in interstate commerce . federal regulation followed state regulation and ispremised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of statesto regulate interstate commerce . in this bifurcation of regulatory jurisdiction , federal regulation islimited and conceived to supplement state regulation . the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) has the principal functions at the federal level for the economic regulation of the electricityutility industry , including financial transactions , wholesale rate regulation , transactions involvingtransmission of unbundled retail electricity , interconnection and wheeling of wholesale electricity,and ensuring adequate and reliable service . in addition , to prevent a recurrence of the abusivepractices of the 1920s ( eg , cross - subsidization , self - dealing , pyramiding , etc .

 ) , the securities andexchange commission ( sec ) regulates utilities' corporate structure and business ventures underpuhca . the electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation . during the past 25years , there has been a major change in direction concerning generation . first , improved technologieshave reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities . priorpreference for large - scale - - often nuclear or coal - fired - - powerplants has been supplanted by apreference for small - scale production facilities that can be brought online more quickly and cheaply,with fewer regulatory impediments . second , this has lowered the entry barrier to electricitygeneration and permitted non - utility entities to build profitable facilities . recent changes in electricutility regulation and improved technologies have allowed additional generating capacity to beprovided by independent firms rather than utilities . the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nation's electricitysupply and led to enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 ( purpa ) . ( 3 ) for the first time , utilitieswere required to purchase power from outside sources . the purchase price was set at the utilities'"avoided cost," the cost they would have incurred to generate the additional power themselves , asdetermined by utility regulators . purpa was established in part to augment electric utilitygeneration with more efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electricconsumers . in addition to purpa , the fuel use act of 1978 ( fua ) ( 4 ) helped qualifying facilities ( qfs ) become established . under fua , utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel newgenerating facilities . qfs , which by definition are not utilities , were able to take advantage of newlyabundant natural gas as well as new generating technology , such as combined - cycle plants that usehot exhaust gases from combustion turbines to make steam to generate additional power . thesetechnologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity generation business aswell as shortened the lead time for constructing new plants .
