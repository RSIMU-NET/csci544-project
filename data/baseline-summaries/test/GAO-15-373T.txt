not met . few , if any , actions towards meeting the criterion have been taken . figure 2 is a visual representation of varying degrees of progress in each of the five criteria for a high - risk area . each point of the star represents one of the five criteria for removal from the high risk list and each ring represents one of the three designations: not met , partially met , or met . the progress ratings used to address the high - risk criteria are an important part of our efforts to provide greater transparency and specificity to agency leaders as they seek to address high - risk areas . beginning in the spring of 2014 leading up to this high - risk update , we met with agency leaders across government to discuss preliminary progress ratings . these meetings focused on actions taken and on additional actions that need to be taken to address the high - risk issues . several agency leaders told us that the additional clarity provided by the progress rating helped them better target their improvement efforts . since our last high - risk update in 2013 , there has been solid and steady progress on the vast majority of the 30 high - risk areas from our 2013 list . progress has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of congress and the leadership and staff in agencies and omb . as shown in table 1 , 18 high - risk areas have met or partially met all criteria for removal from the list ; 11 of these areas also fully met at least one criterion . of the 11 areas that have been on the high risk list since the 1990s , 7 have at least met or partially met all of the criteria for removal and 1 area — dod contract management — is 1 of the 2 areas that has made enough progress to remove subcategories of the high - risk area . overall , 28 high - risk areas were rated against the five criteria , totaling a possible 140 high - risk area criteria ratings . of these , 122 ( or 87 percent ) were rated as met or partially met . on the other hand , 13 of the areas have not met any of the five criteria ; 3 of those — dod business systems modernization , dod support infrastructure management , and dod financial management — have been on the high risk list since the 1990's . throughout the history of the high - risk program , congress played an important role through its oversight and ( where appropriate ) through legislative action targeting both specific problems and the high - risk areas overall . since our last high - risk report , several high - risk areas have received congressional oversight and legislation needed to make progress in addressing risks . table 2 provides examples of congressional actions and of high - level administration initiatives — discussed in more detail throughout our report — that have led to progress in addressing high - risk areas . additional congressional actions and administrative initiatives are also included in the individual high - risk areas discussed in this report .
