( see fig . while the average percent of patients reporting health care coverage increased across all federally operated ihs facilities , our analysis of ihs data showed substantial variation in the magnitude of these increases . specifically , from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018 , increases at each of the 73 facilities ranged from a low of 2 to a high of 31 percentage points . forty - four federally operated ihs facilities experienced an increase in the percent of patients with coverage over this time period of more than 10 percentage points ( see fig . our analysis of ihs data shows that federally operated ihs facilities in states that expanded medicaid had larger increases in health insurance coverage compared with such facilities in states that had not expanded medicaid . specifically , federally operated ihs facilities in medicaid expansion states experienced an average 17 percentage point increase in patients reporting any form of health coverage , compared with an average 8 percentage point increase at federally operated ihs facilities in states that did not expand medicaid . however , these increases in coverage were not spread evenly among the facilities . ( see fig . ihs officials we interviewed also reported that a variety of factors in addition to medicaid expansion likely affected the number of patients at federally operated ihs facilities who reported having health insurance coverage . specifically , officials we interviewed at all of the 11 selected federally operated ihs facilities cited efforts at their facilities that helped increase coverage , such as increasing the number of onsite patient benefits coordinators to help enroll patients in all forms of health coverage and enhancing efforts to ensure that all patients were screened for coverage . for example , one federally operated ihs facility reported renovating its office to , among other things , move the patient benefits coordinator near the waiting room , which allowed patients to be immediately screened after walking in for an appointment . officials we interviewed at nearly all of the selected federally operated ihs facilities also noted that their outreach and education efforts about the importance of health insurance coverage may have helped to increase enrollment . officials we interviewed at all of the selected federally operated ihs facilities said they were engaged in such activities which included broadcasting public service announcements , posting newspaper advertisements , and promoting insurance during community events . officials from most of the 12 ihs area offices also reported collaborating with tribes to conduct outreach and education to enhance enrollment . officials at many ihs area offices also noted that external factors may have also played a role in increasing coverage levels , such as improvements in the local economy , which officials said led to increases in the number of patients with private health insurance . additionally , entities outside of ihs also implemented initiatives to increase coverage for patients at federally operated ihs facilities . for example , ihs officials stated that some patients obtained health insurance through the health insurance exchanges , and in some cases , the tribe paid all premiums , coinsurance , and deductibles for these plans .
