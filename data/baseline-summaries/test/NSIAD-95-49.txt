he was retained at the academy . others gear us to the “right” answer by how they are worded.” ( military academy cadet ) “there are lots of gray areas in several of these questions . the biggest thing i look at before turning someone in is intent . not everything is black and white . the absence of guilt and the parallel conviction that punishment was undeserved combined to sanction violations of the honor code ( particularly lying ) as a means to avoid getting caught. three - quarters or more of the students at each academy indicated that conduct offenses were handled differently across the academy . in addition , they perceived the regulations as not being uniformly applied and that students committing the same offense received different disciplinary actions . ( see fig . while about one - third or more of the students believed that strict enforcement was important , about one - third or more disagreed . similarly , there was little agreement regarding whether disciplinary actions were appropriate to the offense , although from the wording of the question we were unable to determine whether those who believed the punishments were inappropriate saw them as being too harsh or too lenient . there was also considerable disagreement on whether serious conduct offenders should be expelled . ( see fig . at the military and naval academies , perceptions of the class of 1994 regarding the conduct systems tended to change from their freshman year to their senior year , while there was little apparent change in perceptions at the air force academy . the responses of the class of 1994 in their senior year at both the military and naval academies showed an increase in the proportion of students who viewed themselves as being overregulated with unreasonable rules and regulations and an increase in the proportion who perceived inconsistent and inappropriate disciplinary actions . at the naval academy , there was also an increase in the proportion who saw inconsistent handling of conduct offenses and lack of uniformity in the application of rules and regulations . definitely there are actions that are wrong and should never be covered up but intent is the biggest determinant.” ( naval academy midshipman ) “the answers i have given throughout the survey often depend on situation , intensity , etc . “there are no 'little white' lies sir.” ( naval academy midshipman ) “i think your questions on honor situations contain too many black and white answers . a finding of not guilty is not reviewable . each of the academies has a multistep review process that each guilty verdict automatically undergoes . the review processes are intended to identify whether there were any legal shortcomings that may have worked to the disadvantage of the accused . the commandant or superintendent at each academy can overturn a guilty finding based on legal or procedural errors . in addition , the commandant and superintendent at the military and air force academies are required to independently assess the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the guilty finding . while some of the reviewers may meet with the accused and others and conduct an informal hearing , they do not conduct a new hearing .
