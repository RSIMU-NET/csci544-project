these efforts , however , have been halted . to improve noaa's ability to execute goes - r's remaining planned development with appropriate reserves , improve the reliability of its schedules , and address identified program risks , we are recommending in our report being released today that noaa assess and report to the noaa program management council the reserves needed for completing remaining development for each satellite in the series . assess shortfalls in schedule management practices , including creating a realistic allocation of resources and ensuring an unbroken critical path from the current date to the final satellite launch . execute the program's risk management policies and procedures to provide more timely and adequate evaluations and reviews of newly identified risks , and provide more information , including documented handling strategies , for all ongoing and newly - identified risks in the risk register . add to the program's critical risk list the risk that goes - s milestonesthat this risk and the program - identified funding stability risk are adequately monitored and mitigated . may be affected by goes - r development , and ensure in commenting on a draft of our goes - r report , noaa agreed with three of our four recommendations . it partially concurred with the fourth recommendation to fully further execute the program's risk management policies and procedures and to include timely review and disposition of candidate risks . noaa stated that it did not consider the “concerns” listed in its risk database to be risks or candidate risks and that the risk management board actively determines whether recorded concerns should be elevated to a risk . however , the goes - r program is not treating concerns in accordance with its risk management plan , which considers these to be “candidate risks” and requires their timely review and disposition , as evidenced by the many concerns in the database that were more than 3 months old and had not been assessed or dispositioned . unless noaa follows its risk management plan by promptly evaluating “concerns,” it cannot ensure that it is adequately managing the full set of risks that could impact the program . in summary , after spending about $3.3 billion on the now - defunct npoess program , noaa officials have established a $12.9-billion jpss program and made progress in launching npp , establishing contracts for the first jpss satellite , and enhancing the ground systems controlling the satellites and processing the satellite data . in the coming months , program officials face changing requirements , technical issues on individual sensors , key milestones in developing the jpss satellite , and important decisions on the spacecraft , launch vehicles , and instruments that are not included on the jpss satellite . goes - r has also encountered a number of technical challenges , some of which remain to be fully addressed . for example , in early 2011 the program discovered that the ground project development schedule included software deliveries from flight project instruments that were not properly integrated — they had not yet been defined or could not be met .
