an hsa , in and of itself , is not a health insurance plan . this bifurcated arrangement was unquestioned for a time . but as medical costs began to rise , sometimes faster than other sectors of the national economy , many observers criticized this delivery model as contributing to increasing expenditures . because providers were compensated on a fee - for - service basis , some argued that providers were not given incentives to provide efficient health care . in fact , some critics accused health care practitioners and institutions of providing an over - abundance of health care in order to generate greater revenue . by the early 1970s , legislators , analysts , and others expressed considerable interest in alternative models , such as managed care models , with cost control as a key feature . managed care while managed care means different things to different people , several key characteristics set it apart from traditional ( indemnity ) insurance . one of the main differences is that the service delivery and financing functions are integrated under managed care . also , opponents point out that the tax advantages of such insurance arrangements benefit the wealthy to a greater extent than those less well off . recent enrollment trends from the mid - 1990s to 2014 , hmos continued to become proportionally less popular among covered workers , declining to a 13% share of the employer - sponsored insurance market in 2014 after reaching a 31% share in 1996 . for more than a decade , ppos have made up the majority ( 58% share in 2014 ) of employer - sponsored plans — contributing to the displacement of conventional indemnity coverage , which has by now all but disappeared from the private market . ppo plans , which combine moderate provider network restrictions with increased patient freedom relative to hmos , remain the dominant form of worker coverage today . high - deductible coverage paired with hsas and other savings account arrangements have also made inroads in the market , making up about a fifth of employer - sponsored enrollment by 2014 . the individual insurance market has seen a similar distribution of plan types . surveys taken of health insurers show that for the individual market , just as for the group market , ppos are the most popular option ; in fact , they are overwhelmingly popular , accounting for more than 80% of self - only plans and more than 70% of family plans in 2009 . in contrast , hmos are relatively unpopular , with hmo plans declining from about 6% of self - only plans in 2004 to about 2% in 2009 . this report provides background information about these topics . americans obtain health insurance through a variety of methods and from different sources ( see figure 1 ) . people may get it through the private sector or from a government source . consumers may purchase health coverage on their own , as part of an employee group , or through a trade or professional association . individuals can also have multiple sources of coverage in a year . that is , they may have multiple types of coverage at one time or even switch coverage types within a year .
