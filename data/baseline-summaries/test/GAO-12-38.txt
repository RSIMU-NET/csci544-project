( see app . iii for more information about the recovery act's across - the - board and hold - harmless provisions. ) furthermore , none of the recovery act provisions distinguished among states with varying degrees of reduced revenue in the allocation of assistance . the prototype formula we outlined in our march 2011 report provides a more targeted approach than the increased fmap formula used in the recovery act . it also improves the responsiveness of assistance provided , in part by having an automatic trigger to begin and end assistance . in particular , we discussed mechanisms that ( 1 ) improve the timing for starting assistance , ( 2 ) better target for state needs , and ( 3 ) taper off the end of assistance . more responsive federal assistance can aid states in addressing increased medicaid enrollment resulting from a national economic downturn , as well as addressing reductions in states' revenues . improving targeting is essential to meet the goals of providing assistance to states in an efficient and effective manner . a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is presented in appendix i . in the development of our prototype formula we made a number of choices about specific elements of the formula design for the timing and targeting of funds . for example , in contrast to the recovery act , which provided funds for broad state fiscal relief in addition to supporting state medicaid programs , our formula was calibrated to provide a baseline of funding only for state medicaid needs during a downturn . however , this formula could be scaled up to address broader state needs or scaled down to meet only a portion of state medicaid needs . a discussion of these and other alternative choices and considerations is presented in appendix ii . we conducted this performance audit from april 2011 to october 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . although every economic downturn reflects varied economic circumstances at the national level and among states , evaluations of prior federal fiscal assistance strategies have identified considerations to guide policymakers as they consider the design of future legislative responses to national economic downturns . these include timing assistance so that aid begins to flow as the economy is contracting and targeting assistance based on the magnitude of the economic downturn's effects on individual states . to be effective at stabilizing state funding of medicaid programs , assistance should be provided , or at least authorized , close to the beginning of a downturn . additionally , to be efficient , funds should be targeted to states commensurate with their level of need due to the downturn . states that experience greater stress in their medicaid programs — due to increased enrollment or decreased revenues — should receive a larger share of aid than states less severely affected .
