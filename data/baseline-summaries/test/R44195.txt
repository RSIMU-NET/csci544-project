does it have bipartisan appeal ? senate rules tend to favor deliberation over decision , so building a coalition of support for a proposal can take time . with few limits on senate debate , reaching a final vote on legislation often requires a supermajority of 60 senators to bring debate to a close , so some amount of bipartisan cooperation usually is needed to secure final passage . measures that are limited in scope but have broad bipartisan appeal may be passed ( or "cleared" ) by unanimous consent with minimal floor time expended . the senate's clearance system ( or "hotline" ) can facilitate swift action on noncontroversial proposals , but this pathway can be blocked by even a single objection . what are the budgetary implications ? the senate places a number of restrictions on legislation with budgetary consequences . for instance , if a proposal adds to the federal deficit , it may be subject to a point of order on the chamber floor for violating congressional budget rules ( many of which are codified in the congressional budget act of 1974 ) . support for a measure may also hinge on how its costs are paid for . senators may agree about the merits of a bill but disagree with how its provisions are funded . should companion legislation be introduced in the house ? to become law , a bill or joint resolution must pass both houses of congress in identical form ( including the same text and bill number ) and be signed by the president . for this reason , senate sponsors sometimes encourage their allies in the house to introduce identical or similarly worded legislation into that body to encourage bicameral consideration . companion bills might also attract wider public and member attention to the issues addressed in the legislation . is the measure best introduced at the beginning , in the middle , or toward the end of a congress ? timing the introduction of a measure can be important . comprehensive legislation is likely to require a great deal of time to work through , both in committee and on the floor . an early introduction will give the senate more time to examine the measure's provisions . advantage might also be gained by being the first to address an issue . those who move first tend to attract media attention and may be seen by their colleagues as exercising leadership in that particular policy area . strategic delay is another option . this approach might provide more time for an individual or committee to study the issue and build support for a preferred solution . to be sure , many bills do not follow a linear ( or "regular order" ) legislative process â€” introduction , consideration in committee , and arrival on the floor for further debate and amendment . for example , a legislative proposal that had languished in committee might suddenly be taken up in the senate because it deals with an unfolding crisis or emergency . there is no senate rule that introduced bills and resolutions must be prepared by the office of the legislative counsel . senators can receive drafts of bills from executive officials , interest groups , and others .
