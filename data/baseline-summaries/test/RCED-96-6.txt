( app . iii provides additional details on fhwa's study. ) fhwa estimates the states' contributions to the trust fund , which derive from various federal excise taxes such as the gasoline and diesel tax . because the majority of revenues credited to the trust fund derive from the federal fuel tax , the states' contributions to the trust fund tend to be quite closely linked with fuel consumption . as a potential formula factor , these contributions therefore offer the same kinds of advantages and disadvantages as fuel consumption does . returning the states' contributions to the highway trust fund to their source is a relatively simple and direct way of distributing these funds . some state transportation officials could be expected to support this approach because it would guarantee that all or a substantial amount of the revenues collected in their states would be returned to them . an advantage of returning funds to their source is that , as the 1986 faucett study shows , contributions to the highway trust fund tend to correlate highly with highway needs , particularly for major highways . however , the return - to - origin approach would not be universally attractive , as a number of states would lose funds . for instance , those states whose fuel usage is low relative to their land area and extent of highway network would be financially hurt . a prime argument made by officials from these states is that the national interest requires highways to span the wide expanses of large , sparsely populated states that are the source of goods for citizens in the population centers , but the financial resources of those states are often insufficient to construct , maintain , and operate such networks . two additional arguments are made against the return - to - origin approach . first , as new york transportation officials noted , formulas based on returning contributions to the trust fund to the state where they are raised meet neither federal or state transportation goals nor national policy as set forth in istea . if the primary goal of federal apportionment formulas is to return revenues from motor fuel taxes to the place they were earned , these officials questioned whether there was a need for a federal program . second , state officials have questioned the wisdom of selecting a formula factor that is geared predominantly to fuel use . they argue that such an approach rewards greater use of motor fuel and as such contradicts federal goals of improving air quality and conserving energy . finally , this approach would not necessarily preclude congressional direction of the use of those funds . legislation could still specify that the returned funds be used in certain proportions for certain programs , such as the nhs . moreover , the return could function as ( 1 ) a simple return of funds , in which states would be exempt from any or most federal oversight , or ( 2 ) a distribution of funds , in which fhwa would oversee the programs for which the funds were returned . under a return - to - origin approach , we considered three different alternatives , which are summarized in table 3.2 .
