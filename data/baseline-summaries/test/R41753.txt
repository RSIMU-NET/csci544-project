some of these issues are highlighted below . over the past decade , the united states has admitted or adjusted about 1 million foreign nationals to legal permanent resident ( lpr ) status each year , and annual asylee adjustments have ranged from 1% to 9% of the total . overall , asylee adjustments comprised only 4% ( 411,972 ) of the 10.3 million lprs admitted or adjusted from fy2000 through fy2009 . unlike other facets of u.s. immigration policy , asylum issues are less about the number of foreign nationals involved and more about the qualities of the policies and the efficacy of the procedures . asylum is an adjudication of a person based upon facts , evidence , beliefs , and circumstances that might be clear at some times yet nebulous at other times . the policy tensions of asylum often pit the promotion of our humanitarian values against the prevention of fraudulent abuses ; the protection of the persecuted against the security of our borders ; and the obligations of our moral responsibilities internationally against the commitments of our social priorities domestically . the balance of these competing concerns may be shaken by a crisis in a neighboring nation or by larger world events . the u.s. congress plays the key role in considering when and whether revision or re - calibration of asylum law and policies is warranted . the prc remained the leading source country throughout the 2000s . country conditions lie at the core of the principle that the united states will not return a foreign national to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . as discussed more fully above , individualized persecution or persecution resulting from group identity may form the basis of the asylum claim . in the individualized instance , if the asylum seeker demonstrates that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution as an individual if he or she were to return to that country ; and he or she is unable or unwilling to return to , or avail himself or herself of the protection of , that country because of such fear ; then the fear of persecution is deemed reasonable . in the group identity instance , if the asylum seeker establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her home country of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion ; and establishes his or her own inclusion in and identification with such group of persons ; then the fear of persecution is deemed reasonable . although there are many who would revise u.s. asylum law , those advocating change have divergent perspectives . some cite the seemingly inexplicable disparities in asylum approvals rates and urge broad - based administrative reforms . others argue that given the religious , ethnic , and political violence in various countries around the world , it has become more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from the persecutors .
