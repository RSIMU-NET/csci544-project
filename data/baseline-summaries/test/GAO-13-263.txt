alternatives evaluation . the amp process establishes a review and approval framework criteria for justifying new construction , whereas none existed in the previous process . the amp process evaluates some alternatives , such as renovating existing courthouses to meet needs , but it is unclear if the judiciary considered other options , such as courtroom - sharing in the existing courthouse . assessing a wide - range of alternatives would help the judiciary ensure that it evaluated other , less costly , approaches to bridging the performance gap before recommending new construction . review and approval framework with established criteria for selecting capital investments . to determine if life - cycle cost estimates were provided in the 5-year plan , we assessed the judiciary data against gao's cost estimating and assessment guide . to determine the current dollar value of the judiciary's estimate of courthouse projects' rents , we calculated the present value of the estimated project cost based upon averages of monthly indexes from u.s. department of labor , bureau of labor statistics , and rent based upon 20 year omb published discount rate for analyses . in addition , we interviewed judiciary officials on the amp process and its alignment with leading capital - planning practices . to analyze judiciary's capital - planning process , we reviewed our previous reports on capital - planning across the federal government , including the efforts by the judiciary and the department of veterans affairscommunicate its urgent housing needs to congress . we reviewed gsa data on actual costs of construction and tenant improvements at two courthouse projects ( las cruces , nm and ft. pierce , fl ) one completed in 2010 and one completed in 2011 ; and gsa and judiciary estimated costs of construction for the courthouse projects on the most recent 5-year plan , covering fiscal years 2014 to 2018 . to assess recent courthouse projects recommended for funding under the judiciary's current capital - planning process , we reviewed the judiciary's documents detailing the projects recommended for funding for fiscal years 2009 through 2018 , called 5-year plans , and other documents on: congressional authorizations and funding appropriations for courthouse projects ; judiciary information on courts and courthouses ; and gsa information on federal buildings , existing and planned federal courthouses , courthouse design , and federal historic property . we interviewed judiciary and gsa officials in washington , d.c. , and federal courthouses we selected in anniston , al ; macon , ga ; and savannah , ga. to observe existing courthouses , we selected anniston and savannah because they were evaluated under judiciary's old capital - planning process and are on the most recent 5-year plan , covering fiscal years 2014 to 2018 . we selected macon because it was highly ranked under the judiciary's new capital - planning process and is in close proximity to anniston and savannah . while our observations cannot be generalized to all federal courthouses , they provide keen insights into physical conditions at old historic courthouses . we reviewed documentation provided by the judiciary on strategic planning , capital - planning , existing courthouse evaluations , the rating and ranking of existing courthouse deficiencies , existing and future judgeships , and courtroom - sharing by judges .
