lease . an arrangement whereby military and commercial entities enter into a contractual relationship for the private sector's use of public depot maintenance facilities and / or its equipment to perform work for either the public or private sector . twelve — 13 percent — of the 90 partnerships we reviewed used the lease approach , often in conjunction with other partnering approaches . for example , the upgrade partnership for the army's fox nuclear , biological , chemical reconnaissance system vehicle uses a lease arrangement in conjunction with a direct sale arrangement . the lease portion of the fox partnership involves the depot's providing underutilized facilities at anniston army depot and the contractor's paying for facility upkeep and utilities . the air force's partnership for the f100 aircraft engine special technologies coating facility is an example of a stand - alone lease arrangement not involving other partnering arrangements . in this example , the air force's oklahoma city depot provides underutilized facilities , while the contractor pays the depot for the use of the facilities , provides facility upkeep , and pays utilities . government - furnished resources . an arrangement whereby military and commercial entities enter into an agreement for private - sector use of public depot maintenance facilities and / or its equipment and employees at no cost in connection with and under the terms of a contract . nine — 10 percent — of the 90 partnerships we reviewed used the government - furnished resources approach , which was also often used in conjunction with other partnering approaches . the air force's f - 16 block 40 avionics software maintenance / upgrade and the navy's puget sound railway partnerships are examples of the government - furnished resources approach to partnering . under the f - 16 partnership , the government performs f - 16 component software maintenance tasks for the contractor without charge as a government - furnished resource , while the contractor performs final software integration . in the railway partnership , the government provides the contractor with access to a navy - owned railway in exchange for the contractor's performing normal maintenance on the railway . according to dod and contractor officials , the type of partnership selected is based on what approach or combination of approaches best served the objectives of the partnership . for example , in the case of the army's fox vehicle upgrade partnership , the army contracted with general dynamics to upgrade its fox vehicle . to improve the economy and efficiency of the upgrade , the contractor elected to partner with the army's anniston depot for a portion of the work and to colocate its segment of the upgrade with anniston's segment at the anniston depot . consequently , the contractor's approach used a combination of two partnership types — direct sale and lease . depot maintenance involves not only the application of labor to repair and maintain military equipment but also several other logistics elements or functions such as supply support , production engineering , facilities , and equipment .
