we reviewed 23 retrospective studies . appendix i provides additional information on these studies . all but one of the retrospective studies focused on adult male sex offenders , and in most studies the offenders sampled were imprisoned or in some type of treatment program . however , these studies varied considerably in the types of child sexual abusers studied , whether control or comparison groups were used , and if so , the types of individuals in these groups . the retrospective studies also varied considerably in their findings and conclusions . the percent of adult sex offenders against children identified as being sexually abused as children themselves ranged from zero to 79 percent . the chief limitation of the retrospective studies is that studying a known group of sexual offenders cannot provide any direct information about the extent to which children who are sexually abused become sexual offender as adults . the two studies we reviewed that were prospective in design attempted to overcome this limitation by identifying samples of sexually victimized children and tracking them into adulthood to determine how many became sex offenders . these studies also had limitations , which made it difficult to reach any definitive conclusions about the cycle of sexual abuse . however , in spite of their limitations , overall , the retrospective studies , prospective studies , and research reviews did indicate that the experience of childhood sexual victimization is quite likely neither a necessary nor a sufficient cause of adult sexual offending . further research would be necessary to determine what kinds of experiences magnify the likelihood that sexually victimized children will become adult sexual offenders against children and , alternatively , what kinds of experiences help prevent victimized children from becoming adult sexual offenders against children . we are sending copies of this report to the ranking minority member of the house subcommittee on crime and the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate committee on the judiciary . copies will also be made available to others upon request . the major contributors to this report are listed in appendix ii . please call me at ( 202 ) 512-8777 if you have any questions about this report . third , where comparison or control groups were used , attempts to match group members to sex offenders of children on factors possibly related to being sexually abused or abusive were typically limited ; few of the studies attempted to control for such factors statistically . finally , one of the major shortcomings of these retrospective studies is that they cannot reveal how likely it is that a person who has been sexually abused as a child will become a sexual abuser in adulthood . for example , even if 100 percent of sexual abusers of children were sexually abused as children , this would not necessarily mean that sexual abuse causes abused children to become abusers themselves . it may be that only a small percentage of sexually abused children become sex offenders against children . determining how likely victims of childhood sexual abuse are to become adult sex offenders requires that a sample of sexually abused children be followed forward in time , rather than the histories of sex offenders be traced backward .
