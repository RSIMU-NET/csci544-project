appendix a . seq. ) and the aquatic nuisance prevention and control act ( 16 u.s.c . §§4701 et seq. ) ( appendix c ) . some stakeholders may contend that directing agencies to work together under a specific federal authority and with an organizing structure would encourage more efficient progress toward restoration . congress has enacted organizing entities for the great lakes task force , under the great lakes restoration initiative ( p.l . 111-88 , title i ) , and the south florida ecosystem restoration task force , under the comprehensive everglades restoration plan ( p.l . 106-541 , title vi , section 601 ) . other stakeholders , however , may note that legislation authorizing coordination and collaboration among federal agencies is not necessary , as restoration activities are already authorized for the epa and several other agencies under more general authorities . further , these individuals may note that federal agencies are coordinating efforts under the chesapeake bay watershed agreement and through the cbp . several chesapeake bay evaluations are conducted on an ongoing basis to measure the progress of bay restoration over time , each with unique methodologies . chesapeake bay restoration progress results differ among evaluations . the differences may be due to different priorities , methodologies , data sets , metrics , and timescales of interest . the cbp has periodically assessed progress in restoring the bay since the 1983 chesapeake bay watershed agreement . goals set in the bay agreements have been largely missed , such as in the 2000 chesapeake bay agreement , which aspired to restore the bay to certain conditions by 2010 . the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement set 2025 as its target year to reach certain goals ( and underlying outcomes ) and tracks biennial progress toward the goals . for 2016-2017 , cbp reports that progress was made in five goals , and five goals showed no progress / regress . for example , progress was made toward the sustainable fisheries goal due to reported increases in the blue crab and oyster populations . in july 2018 , the epa released its midpoint assessment of progress in implementing practices to reach a 60% reduction of nutrients and sediment by 2017 , as set in the tmdl . according to the epa , jurisdictions have implemented practices to achieve the phosphorus and sediment reductions , but did not reach the nitrogen reduction . in addition to federal reporting , several ngos have evaluated restoration progress over time . non - federal evaluations of restoration progress generally have been critical of the level of progress . the 2016 chesapeake bay foundation ( cbf ) state of the bay report assigned the chesapeake bay a rating of 34 out of 100 , a slight increase from the 2014 rating of 32 . since 1998 , cbf has rated the bay between 27 and 34 ; cbf would consider the bay restored at a rating of 70 . similar chesapeake bay conditions were reported by an evaluation completed by the university of maryland center for environmental science ( umces ) . according to umces , in 2017 decreased nutrient levels were "significantly improving" the bay , but poor to moderate water clarity and nitrogen , among other indicators , persisted .
