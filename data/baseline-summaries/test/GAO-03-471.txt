we have clarified the report , where appropriate . it has not yet identified which specific activities will be modified . at the time of our review , headquarters could not provide details on how it intends to monitor the nnsa site offices' performance with respect to safeguards and security or address deficiencies . in creating this new management structure , nnsa has not yet developed a functions , responsibilities , and authorities manual ( fram ) , an organizational tool used by managers at federal agencies , including doe , for defining roles and responsibilities . this manual is to address the functions , responsibilities , and authorities of all elements within nnsa . nnsa headquarters security officials agree that this guidance is crucial and stated that they are currently developing the components of a fram , which should be finalized in 2003 . nnsa told us that completing the fram takes significant time because of the highly detailed planning necessary for determining staff functions at the various sites . according to nnsa site office officials , as they wait for formal guidance from headquarters on conducting security oversight , each office is carrying out oversight activities as it deems appropriate . in addition , these officials told us that they have not received formal notification about the change in their safeguards and security oversight responsibilities , such as responsibilities for the survey program . overall , nnsa concurred with two of our four recommendations , disagreed with one , and did not indicate agreement or disagreement with the fourth . in the area of concurrence , nnsa concurred with our recommendation to formally establish roles and responsibilities , and it plans to do so in 2003 . nnsa also concurred that corrective action plans must be prepared in accordance with established standards and policy and based on documented root cause analysis , risk assessments , and cost - benefit analysis . since we provided our draft report to nnsa , it has sent its site offices a guidance letter on corrective action plans that clarifies its analysis and documentation requirements . nnsa now allows required elements to be omitted from corrective action plans , but only if the contractors document the rationale for the exclusion as a formal part of their plan . we believe this guidance letter is a positive step in clarifying some implementation aspects of the doe requirements , and we encourage continued management attention to this area . nnsa did not comment on the portion of this recommendation concerning the use of appropriate incentives to motivate contractors to address findings effectively . nnsa disagreed with the conclusion that led to our recommendation to conduct oversight using a survey approach , which provides an integrated , comprehensive view of security conditions and is consistent with doe orders . specifically , nnsa disagreed with our conclusion that it was not ensuring the comprehensive annual assessments of contractors' performance that doe policy requires . as we reported , four of the seven site offices no longer conduct comprehensive , integrated surveys to assess security but instead rely on surveillance activities .
