tourists . according to the cnmi government , tourists from certain countries may enter the cnmi as part of its entry permit waiver program . the program allows eligible participants to enter for tourism or business for up to 90 days without a visitor entry permit . we determined that mva data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes . we did not receive sufficient bms data from the cnmi government on visitors to allow us to analyze the size of each tourist market and related trends . we interviewed mva representatives , who explained to us the process they use to collect the data . we also compared the aggregate visitor numbers to the ones from bms , and the two are generally consistent . mva also provided us with information on the cost of tour packages from japan , korea , and the people's republic of china . in addition , we reviewed visa interview wait times reported by the u.s. department of state . we previously found that these data are not sufficiently reliable to determine the number of posts with 30 or more days of wait time . however , we report these data to illustrate the ranges of possible wait times . foreign investment . we analyzed foreign investor entry permit data from the cnmi department of commerce . the department provided data tables on foreign investor and business entry permits issued , based on administrative information maintained by department staff . although the data were limited to entry permits issued , did not give any information on the value of investment other than category of permit issued , and did not reflect whether entry permit holders were present in the cnmi , we determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review . we did not receive some data requested from the cnmi government , including data from liids on foreign investors . this information would have included the current numbers of foreign investors holding each type of entry permit and would have allowed us to compare numbers of entry permit holders with cnmi department of commerce data . without liids data on foreign investors , we were unable to verify whether the holders of foreign investor entry permits issued were present in the cnmi , nor did we know the total number of holders of perpetual foreign investor permits . however , in its comments on a draft of this report , the cnmi government said that our analysis of data on permits issued conflicted with cnmi department of commerce data . the cnmi government provided the number of active and valid long - term business and perpetual foreign investor entry permits , as well as the numbers of businesses associated with these permits , as of july 8 , 2008 , based on the cnmi department of commerce's manual review of its files . these data were not previously provided to us . the new data do not include information on issued entry permits and do not include complete information on country of origin and other characteristics .
