this is incorrect . our finding is based primarily on our analysis of epa's december 1994 study , which also concluded that minimum program needs could be met with a fraction of the data that would have been required by the suspended regulation . the acting director also commented that the report did not adequately reflect epa's efforts to respond to the states' concerns . we believe that the report makes clear that epa took action and suspended the draft regulation based on state concerns . finally , the acting director stated that the draft report did not reflect the success of epa's regulatory review process and only focused on an interim finding that epa addressed by suspending the regulation . we believe the report adequately reflects epa's process and states' concern with the additional burden that would have been imposed on them if the draft regulation had been promulgated . for example , we note in the report that epa has recently begun studying alternative reporting options . we are sending copies of this report to the administrator , epa ; interested congressional committees ; and the director , office of management and budget . copies will also be made available to others upon request . please call me at ( 202 ) 512-6253 if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report . major contributors are listed in appendix iv . expands several existing information collection , storage , and reporting requirements currently being met by the aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) . thousands of additional facilities in ozone nonattainment areas will be defined as “major sources” and will thus be subject to enhanced monitoring , recordkeeping , reporting , and emissions control requirements . expands and revises emission limitations for mobile sources ( automobiles and trucks ) of air pollutants . new standards are established for motor vehicle engines , fuel content , alternative fueled vehicles , and other mobile sources . airs was not affected by these requirements . creates a program to monitor and control the 189 hazardous air pollutants . airs is being enhanced to provide a tool for epa to develop technology - based standards and , when standards have not been developed , for state pollution control agencies to make case - by - case decisions on the best demonstrated control technologies for hazardous air pollutants within an industry . establishes a new federal program to control acid deposition . airs was not affected by these requirements . the separate acid rain data system / emissions tracking system provides for recording and validating emissions data from sources emitting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides , ingredients of acid rain . establishes a new permit program that , in large part , is to be implemented by the states . airs is being enhanced to accommodate additional permit program data elements and to merge emissions and enforcement data . creates a new federal program for the protection of stratospheric ozone . each person producing , importing , or exporting certain substances that cause or contribute significantly to harmful effects on the ozone layer must report to epa quarterly the amount of each substance produced . airs was not affected by this requirement .
