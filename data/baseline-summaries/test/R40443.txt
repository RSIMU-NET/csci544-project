fsma provisions . fsma ( § 102 ) amends ffdca § 415 to require domestic and foreign facilities to register every two years , and to provide some additional types of contact information , with an abbreviated renewal process available to facilities with no change in status . it provides for new procedures for the suspension of registration if the hhs secretary "determines that food manufactured , processed , packed , received , or held by a facility registered under this section has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. the maximum criminal penalty for organizations ( as adjusted by 18 u.s.c . §§ 3559 and 3571 ) is $200,000 if the offense does not result in death and $500,000 if the offense results in death . there are exceptions to the misdemeanor penalty provisions in ffdca § 303 ( a ) ( 1 ) . a person could avoid being subject to penalties for certain violations of the prohibited acts section under the good faith exception , and persons may also avoid liability for violations of certain prohibited acts if they receive a guaranty from the manufacturer or the person from whom they received the product . a violation of ffdca's prohibited acts section is a felony offense if it occurs after a prior conviction for violating ffdca's prohibited acts section or if it is committed with the intent to defraud or mislead . the maximum criminal penalty for individuals convicted of a felony violation of ffdca ( as adjusted by 18 u.s.c . §§ 3559 and 3571 ) is imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine of not more than $250,000 , or both . fsma also provides for procedures for vacating such a suspension . the nation's public health capacity for foodborne illness surveillance and outbreak response is a mix of significant strengths and significant gaps . the ability to link seemingly unrelated illnesses through genetic "fingerprinting" has revolutionized the identification of large multistate outbreaks . however , the epidemiological approaches used to identify the food associated with an outbreak can be labor - intensive and time - consuming . also , especially for fda - regulated foods , information about common contaminants that may be present in foods during production and in commerce , as well as how to test for them , is limited . as a result , "attribution" — identifying the types of foods that cause foodborne illnesses — remains a significant challenge . the outbreaks of the past few years underscore the problem , but are not the only evidence . based on data from foodnet , its active surveillance system , cdc reported that as of 2009 , the incidence of several of the foodborne diseases under surveillance had reached a plateau , instead of declining , and that national 2010 health targets for three out of four targeted pathogens — campylobacter , listeria , and salmonella — may not be met . fsma provisions . fsma ( § 205 ) contains provisions that , for purposes of surveillance , define a foodborne illness outbreak as two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a food .
