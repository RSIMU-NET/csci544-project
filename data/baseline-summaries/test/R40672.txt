this report will not be updated . another crs report ( crs report rl33731 , education for the disadvantaged: reauthorization issues for esea title i - a under the no child left behind act , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] ) discusses issues related to the accountability and other policies of esea title i - a . those interested in a more concise description of the esea title i - a allocation formulas and review of reauthorization issues related to them than found in this report should refer to the final section of that report ( rl33731 ) . the current equity factor might be broadened to consider additional categories of "high cost" pupils . should the current provisions for intra - lea allocation be reconsidered ? the participation of middle and , especially , high schools in title i - a programs is very low , and might be increased through modification of the requirements for allocation of funds within leas . issues affecting a limited number of states or leas: should the remaining special constraints on grants to puerto rico , the cap on aggregate population weights in the targeted grant formula , be removed ? title i - a grants to puerto rico would be substantially higher if remaining special constraints were removed . should the temporary assistance to needy families ( tanf ) formula factor be eliminated ? this formula population factor is of little significance , and may remain primarily for historic and symbolic reasons . should each county portion of new york city and other multi - county leas continue to be treated as separate leas under the title i - a allocation formulas ? this provision leads to substantially different treatment of title i - a schools in different counties within new york city , and has mixed impact on total title i - a grants to the city overall . finally , a general introductory note regarding funding levels and allocations: most references to appropriation levels , and all discussions and analyses of allocation patterns , in this report refer to those for fy2008 , the most recent year for which actual allocations were available at the time this report was prepared . therefore , there will be only marginal reference to fy2009 appropriations or allocations for title i - a , whether provided under the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l . 111-5 ) or regular fy2009 omnibus appropriations legislation ( p.l . for the allocation of funds to states and leas , esea title i - a has four separate formulas: the basic , concentration , targeted , and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas . once these funds reach leas , they are no longer treated separately ; they are combined and used without distinction for the same program purposes . a primary rationale for using four different formulas to allocate a share of the funds for a single program is that the formulas have distinct allocation patterns , providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of localities ( eg , leas with high poverty rates , or states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their leas ) , as is discussed later in this report .
