gsa can delegate the requested authority to the agencies . for example , in 1996 , gsa began a program to offer what are known as general purpose lease delegations . under this program , called “can't beat gsa leasing,” federal agencies have the choice of using gsa as their leasing agent or assuming responsibility of their own leasing . the program was an outgrowth of gsa's commitment to streamline its leasing operations , respond to the government's changing needs , and address recommendations from client agencies . these basic management controls are the first line of defense in safeguarding assets and providing effective stewardship of public resources . given your interest in the general services administration's ( gsa ) use of real property delegations of authority , we determined ( 1 ) what real property authority gsa has delegated to its tenant agencies , ( 2 ) what policies and procedures gsa uses to manage delegated real property authority , and ( 3 ) reasons the tenant agencies requested delegated authority . to determine what real property authority gsa delegated to its tenant agencies and the criteria gsa used when deciding to delegate those activities , we reviewed , among other materials , the law , the federal management regulation , and the federal acquisition regulation related to gsa's authority to delegate real property functions ; existing policies and procedures for managing the delegations , including internal public buildings service ( pbs ) guidance on delegations of real estate leasing authority and pbs's “standard operating procedures for operation and maintenance of delegated real property ; ” previous office of governmentwide policy reviews of delegations of real estate leasing authority ; pbs summaries of the lease delegation program ; and data on the number of delegations by type and agency from fiscal years 1996 to 2006 . we limited our review to delegations for the following agencies: departments of commerce , defense , health and human services , homeland security , interior , justice , the treasury , environmental protection agency , the judiciary , and the social security administration . these agencies were gsa's top 10 customers in annual rent for fiscal year 2005 as reported in gsa's state of the portfolio . for the purposes of our review , we did not include real property disposal authority or delegations of security authority in our analysis . to assess the reliability of the delegations data we ( 1 ) reviewed related documentation , ( 2 ) conducted manual testing of certain source databases , and ( 3 ) interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about the quality of the data . as a result , we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report . finally , to obtain information on the views and experiences of agencies with delegations we interviewed officials from six agencies . to select the agencies , we reviewed gsa's data on delegations to its tenant agencies from fiscal years 1996 to 2006 and selected the two agencies with the most delegations in each category for which we had data: real estate leasing authority , administrative contracting officer authority , operations and maintenance authority , repair and alteration project authority , and utility service authority .
