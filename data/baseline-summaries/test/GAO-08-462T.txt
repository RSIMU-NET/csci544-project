sfis . key limitations in the department's ability to consistently provide timely , reliable , accurate , and relevant information for analysis , decisionmaking , and reporting are ( 1 ) its lack of a standard financial management data structure and ( 2 ) a reliance on numerous nonautomated data transfers ( manual data calls ) to accumulate and report financial transactions . in fiscal year 2006 , dod took an important first step toward addressing these weaknesses through publication of its sfis phase i data elements and their subsequent incorporation into the dod bea . in march 2007 , the department issued a checklist for use by dod components in evaluating their systems for sfis compliance . sfis is intended to provide uniformity throughout dod in reporting on the results of operations , allowing for greater comparability of information . while the first phase of sfis was focused on financial statement generation , subsequent sfis phases are intended to provide a standardized financial information structure to facilitate improved cost accounting , analysis , and reporting . according to dod officials , the department has adopted a two - tiered approach to implement the sfis data structure . furthermore , they stated that sfis is a mandatory data structure that will be embedded into every new financial management system , including enterprise resource planning systems , such as the army's general fund enterprise business system and the air force's defense enterprise accounting and management system ( deams ) . further , recognizing that many of the current accounting systems will be replaced in the future , the department will utilize a common crosswalk to standardize the data reported by the legacy systems . beis . a second important step that the department took toward improving its capability to provide consistent and reliable financial information for decisionmaking and reporting was to initiate efforts to develop a dod - level suite of services to provide financial reporting services , cash reporting , and reconciliation services . as an interim solution , financial information obtained from legacy component systems will be cross - walked from a component's data structure into the sfis format within beis . newer or target systems , such as deams , will have sfis imbedded so that the data provided to beis will already be in the sfis format . according to dod's september 2007 fiar plan update , the department prepared financial statement reports using sfis data standards for the marine corps general and working capital funds , the air force general and working capital funds , and the navy working capital funds . the department plans to implement sfis - compliant reporting for the army working capital funds , the navy general funds , and its defense agencies in fiscal year 2008 . the development and implementation of sfis and beis are positive steps toward standardizing the department's data structure and expanding its capability to access and utilize data for analysis , management decisionmaking , and reporting , including special reports related to the global war on terrorism . however , it is important to keep in mind that a great deal of work remains .
