however , weaknesses remain . however , officials believe that the trend in waived ssi overpayments is more likely due to annual increases in the number of periodic reviews of recipients' medical eligibility . these reviews have resulted in an increase in benefit terminations and subsequent recipient appeals . during the appeals process , recipients have the right to request that their benefits be continued . those who lose their appeal can then request a waiver of any overpayments that occurred during the appeal period . ssa will usually grant these requests under its current waiver policies . another factor affecting trends in waivers may be staff application of waiver policies and procedures . although ssa has developed guidance to assist field staff in deciding whether to deny or grant waivers , we found that field staff have considerable leeway to grant waivers based on an individual's claim that he or she reported information to ssa that would have prevented an overpayment . while staff and managers had varying opinions regarding the time and administrative costs associated with denying waiver requests , they also acknowledged that numerous recent automation upgrades may be cause for reexamining the current $500 waiver threshold . we plan to issue our final report in september 2002 . in summary , ssa has taken many actions over the last several years to strengthen ssi program integrity . for example , to better deter and detect overpayments , the agency obtained legislative authority to use additional tools to verify recipients' financial eligibility for benefits ; enhanced its processes for monitoring and holding staff accountable for completing assigned ssi workloads ; and improved its use of automation to strengthen its overpayment detection capabilities . however , because a number of initiatives are still in the planning or early implementation stages , it is too soon to assess their ultimate impact on ssi payment accuracy . further , there are vulnerabilities that ssa has yet to address , such as excessively complex program rules for determining recipient living arrangements and underused penalty authorities for persons who fail to report information affecting their benefits . in addition to improving its overpayment deterrence and detection capabilities , ssa has also made recovery of overpaid benefits a higher priority . for example , ssa now seizes the tax refunds of individuals with unresolved ssi debt and recently began more aggressive actions to recover overpayments from former ssi recipients by reducing their social security retirement or disability benefits . other potentially effective recovery initiatives , such as wage garnishment and referral of debtors to collection agencies , remain unimplemented . further , at a time when ssa has enhanced its debt recovery capability , its current overpayment waiver policies and practices may be causing ssa to unnecessarily forego the collection of millions of dollars in overpaid benefits annually . the ssi program provides eligible aged , blind , or disabled persons with monthly cash payments to meet basic needs for food , clothing , and shelter . state disability determination services determine whether ssi applicants are medically disabled , and ssa field office staff determine whether applicants meet the program's nonmedical ( age and financial ) eligibility requirements .
