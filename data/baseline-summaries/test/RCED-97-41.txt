these projects were proposed by both minority and nonminority farmers . in the aggregate , 98 of 271 applications from minority farmers were disapproved in the five county offices we visited . thirty - three were disapproved for technical reasons and 62 for lack of funds . fsa could not find the files for the remaining three minority applicants . we found that the applications of nonminority farmers were disapproved for similar reasons . of the 305 applications for nonminority farmers we reviewed , 106 were disapproved . fifty - three were disapproved for technical reasons and 52 for lack of funds . fsa could not find the file for the remaining applicant . approval and disapproval decisions were supported by material in the application files , and the assessment criteria used in each location were applied consistently to applications from minority and nonminority farmers . nationally , the vast majority of all applicants for direct loans have their applications approved . however , the disapproval rate for minority farmers is higher than for nonminority farmers . from october 1994 through march 1996 , the disapproval rate was 16 percent for minority farmers and 10 percent for nonminority farmers . we found some differences in the disapproval rates for different minority groups . specifically , 20 percent of the loan applications from african american farmers , 16 percent from hispanic american farmers , 11 percent from native american farmers , and 7 percent from asian american farmers , were disapproved . to assess the differences in disapproval rates , we examined the direct loan applications for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 at five district loan offices.table 2 shows the number of applications for direct loans during this period for minority and nonminority farmers in each of the five districts , as well as the number and percent of applications disapproved . our review of the direct loan program files in these locations showed that fsa's decisions to approve and disapprove applications appeared to follow usda's established criteria . these criteria were applied to the applications of minority and nonminority farmers in a similar fashion and were supported by materials in the files . the process for deciding on loan applications is more uniform for the direct loan program than for the acp . the district loan office first reviews a direct loan application to determine whether the applicant meets the eligibility criteria , such as being a farmer in the district , having a good credit rating , and demonstrating managerial ability . farmers who do not demonstrate this ability may take a course , at their own expense , to meet this standard . if the applicant meets these criteria , the loan officer determines whether the farmer meets the requirements for collateral and has sufficient cash flow to repay the loan . these decisions are based on the farm and home plan — the business operations plan for the farmer — prepared by the loan officer with information provided by the farmer . if the collateral requirements and the cash flow are sufficient , the farmer generally receives the loan . over 2,500 fsa borrowers have been served by these efforts . fsa has also assisted native american farmers by establishing satellite offices on reservations .
