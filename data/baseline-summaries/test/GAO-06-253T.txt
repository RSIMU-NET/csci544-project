see table 2 below . nonetheless to receive benefits while in the u.s. , noncitizens must be legally present in the u.s. under immigration law regardless of when they were first assigned an ssn . previously if noncitizens accrued social security benefits and resided outside the u.s. , they could under some circumstances receive those benefits without ever having been legally present in the u.s . since sspa required all noncitizens originally assigned an ssn on or after january 1 , 2004 , to have a work authorized ssn to accrue benefits , those living outside the country must also obtain a work - authorized ssn . obtaining a work - authorized ssn requires both lawful presence in the u.s. and an immigration status permitting work in the u.s . however , a noncitizen may receive benefits outside the u.s. if he or she is a citizen of a country that has a social insurance or pension system that pays benefits to eligible u.s. citizens residing outside that country or is a worker covered under a totalization agreement . a noncitizen not meeting any of these exceptions will have his or her benefits suspended beginning with the seventh month of absence . in general , totalization agreements between the u.s. and other countries provide mutually beneficial business , tax and other incentives to employers and employees , but the agreements also expose both countries to financial costs and risk . our recent reports on totalization agreements identified two fundamental vulnerabilities in ssa's existing procedures when entering into totalization agreements . first , our analysis demonstrated that the agency's actuarial estimates for the number of foreign citizens who would be affected by an agreement ( and thus entitled to u.s. social security benefits ) have overstated or understated the number , usually by more than 25 percent . as a result , depending on the size of the foreign population covered by an agreement , the actual cost to the social security trust fund from a given agreement could be greater or smaller than predicted . in response to our recommendation to improve its process for projecting costs to the trust fund from totalization agreements , ssa responded that it cannot eliminate all variations between projected costs and subsequent actual experience . secondly , our work has shown that ssa's processes for entering into these agreements have been largely informal and have not included specific steps to assess and mitigate potential risks to the u.s. social security system . for example , we found that ssa's procedures for verifying critical information such as foreign citizens' earnings , birth , and death data were insufficient to ensure the integrity of such information . inaccurate or incomplete information could lead to improper payments from the social security trust fund . in response to our recommendations , ssa developed several new initiatives to identify risks associated with totalization agreements . for example , ssa developed a standardized questionnaire to help the agency identify and assess the reliability of earnings data in countries that may be considered for future totalization agreements . in addition , ssa is conducting numerous “vulnerability assessments” to detect potential problems with the accuracy of foreign countries' documents .
