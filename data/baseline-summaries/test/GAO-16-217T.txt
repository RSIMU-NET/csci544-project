the agencies generally agreed with our recommendation . in our september 2015 report , we found that the forest service and interior were jointly implementing the aerial firefighting use and effectiveness study begun in 2012 . according to the study website and agency officials , the agencies are collecting information on how aerial retardant and suppressant delivery affects fire behavior , and they plan to use this and other collected information to track the performance of specific aircraft types . as of november 2015 , according to agency officials , the agencies had collected data on aircraft use in more than 100 fires as part of the study . in addition , according to these officials , as part of the study the agencies are developing specific ways to assess firefighting aircraft performance effectiveness to be used during the 2016 fire season . agency officials told us the study is not a one - time activity but is an ongoing effort to continually provide information to help improve their use of firefighting resources . as detailed in our september 2015 report , the forest service and the interior agencies have conducted reviews to assess their effectiveness in responding to wildland fires , but have not consistently followed agency policy in doing so and did not always use specific criteria for selecting the fires they reviewed . congressional committee reports and agency policy have generally called for the agencies to review their responses to wildland fires involving federal expenditures of $10 million or more , in part to help understand how to better contain suppression costs . the agencies , in turn , have each developed their own policies that generally direct them to review each fire that exceeds the $10 million threshold and , in some cases , those policies note that fire reviews may be conducted for other purposes , such as where the fire raised significant political , social , natural resource , or policy concerns . the agencies have not consistently conducted reviews of fire incidents meeting the $10 million threshold , in part because , according to officials , doing so does not reflect the agencies' focus on assessing the effectiveness of their response to fire . however , the agencies have not developed specific criteria for selecting fire incidents for review . forest service officials told us that rather than selecting all fires with federal expenditures of $10 million or more to review , they changed their selection approach . these officials told us that focusing exclusively on suppression costs when selecting fires may keep the agency from choosing those fires where it can obtain important information and best assess management actions and ensure they are appropriate , risk - based , and effective . instead , forest service officials told us the agency judgmentally selects incidents to review based on a range of broad criteria , such as complexity and national significance , taking into account political , social , natural resource , or policy concerns . using these broad selection criteria , the forest service reviewed 5 wildland fires that occurred in 2012 and 10 that occurred in 2013 . however , with these broad criteria it is not clear why the forest service selected those particular fires and not others .
