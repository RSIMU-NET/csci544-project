the thresholds are increased at the rate of inflation . the 2007 annual poverty threshold was $9,944 for an elderly individual and $12,533 for an elderly couple . a family is considered poor if its countable money income is less than the poverty threshold for its family type and size . this report uses the official poverty thresholds appropriate for each individual's family type and size ( including the thresholds for elderly individuals and couples ) . the thresholds are projected using the intermediate assumptions about future inflation from the 2005 social security trustees report . behavioral changes this analysis assumes that no behavioral changes result from the modification of the social security or ssi benefit rules . thus , policy changes will not automatically alter an individual's work patterns or age at benefit take - up . however , it's likely that if policy changes were implemented , individuals' incentives and behavior could also change . the model assumes that roughly two - thirds of individuals who qualify for ssi take up benefits . none of the elderly poor is projected to lose income . among the non - poor elderly , most ( 96% ) are projected not to be affected , as shown in figure 8 . under option #4 , which would raise ssi federal benefit rates to the poverty line and also liberalize eligibility , about 59% of the poor elderly are projected to be unaffected , as shown in figure 7 . this is roughly the same proportion of the poor elderly who live in families where no elderly member receives ssi under the option . the remaining 41% of the poor elderly are projected to be winners under the option none of the elderly poor is projected to lose income . among the non - poor elderly , most ( 96% ) are projected not to be affected , as shown in figure 8 . about 4% are projected gain income under the option . changing the social security benefit formula to mitigate the effects of changes on the elderly poor arguably would not target additional dollars as efficiently . it also might complicate the balance between adequacy and equity in the social security program . another possible subject for discussion is the potential scope of policy changes â€” factors such as program participation rates and eligibility restrictions . social security participation among the elderly is nearly universal . ssi has strict eligibility criteria and its participation rates are far lower . as a result , changes to ssi would likely affect fewer of the elderly poor than would changes to social security . some individuals prefer not to receive means - tested assistance and would not participate in ssi regardless of changes . other individuals may not qualify even for a liberalized ssi program because of asset restrictions . this would be a particular problem for people with retirement savings , as defined contribution retirement plans ( such as 401 ( k ) s and individual retirement accounts ) count toward ssi's asset test . finally , another potential topic that could be discussed is the prevailing political and fiscal environment . in recent years , major changes to social security and ssi have been rare .
