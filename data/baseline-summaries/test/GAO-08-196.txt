created by fltfa . however , the act limits the revenue deposited into this account to that generated from sales or exchanges of public lands identified for disposal in a land use plan in effect as of july 25 , 2000 â€” the date of fltfa's enactment . money in the new account is available to blm and the other three agencies to purchase inholdings , and in some cases , land adjacent to federally designated areas and containing exceptional resources . the act expires in july 2010 , and the administration has proposed revising and extending it . blm sells its land in one of three ways: competitive sales ; modified competitive sales , which provide a preference to existing land users or adjoining landowners ; and direct sales , which occur in special situations , such as when parcels are completely surrounded by one landowner and there is no public access . blm prefers competitive sales because these usually generate the most revenue and , therefore , are more likely to increase the revenue available under fltfa for land acquisitions . blm staff in headquarters , its 12 state offices , and 144 field offices nationwide manage and conduct these sales . about 300 full - time equivalent staff , out of a workforce of about 10,500 full - time equivalent staff , are responsible for land and realty management in blm . these staff are directly responsible for land sales and acquisitions , along with other realty responsibilities , such as processing energy rights - of - way and leasing and permitting on public lands . the federal land agencies have two methods for identifying land to acquire under fltfa . first , the agencies can nominate parcels through a process laid out in state - level implementation agreements that were developed under the direction of a national memorandum of understanding ( mou ) that implemented the program . under the process , state - level interagency teams are to review proposals for land acquisitions and forward their nominations to the secretaries of agriculture and of the interior for approval . second , the secretaries can directly use a portion of fltfa revenue to acquire specific parcels of land at their own discretion . the national mou laid out the expectation that most acquisitions would occur through the state - level process . fltfa places several restrictions on using funds from the new u.s. treasury account . among other things , fltfa requires that ( 1 ) no more than 20 percent can be used for blm's administrative and other activities necessary to carry out the land disposal program ; ( 2 ) of the amount not spent on administrative expenses , at least 80 percent of the revenue must be expended in the state in which the funds were generated ; and ( 3 ) at least 80 percent of fltfa revenue required to be spent on land acquisitions within a state must be used to acquire inholdings ( as opposed to adjacent land ) within that state .
