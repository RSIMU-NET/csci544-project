points. these amendments remain current law . the jones act applies only to domestic waterborne shipments . it does not apply to the nation's international waterborne trade , which is almost entirely carried by foreign - flag ships . the u.s. citizen crewing requirement means that the master , all of the officers , and 75% of the remaining crew must be u.s. citizens . if the u.s. owner of a jones act ship is a corporation , 75% of the corporation's stock must be owned by u.s. citizens . regarding u.s. territories , the u.s. virgin islands , america samoa , and the northern mariana islands are exempt from the jones act . therefore , foreign - flag ships can transport cargo between these islands and other u.s. points . puerto rico is exempt for passengers but not for cargo . vessels traveling between guam and another u.s. point must be u.s. - owned and - crewed but need not be u.s. - built . the coast guard is in charge of enforcing the u.s. - build requirement for vessels ( 46 c.f.r . §§67.95-67.101 ) , u.s. ownership of the carriers ( 46 c.f.r . §§67.30-67.43 ) , and u.s. crewing ( 46 c.f.r . §10.221 ) — essentially , the licensing of jones act operators . it enforces these requirements when an operator seeks a "coastwise endorsement" ( 46 c.f.r . §67.19 ) from the agency . the terms "coastwise qualified" and "jones act qualified" are synonymous . customs and border protection ( cbp ) is primarily responsible for determining what maritime activity falls under the act , namely defining what constitutes "transportation" and whether the origin and destination of a voyage are "u.s. points" ( 19 c.f.r . agency interpretations of domestic shipping restrictions have been consistent since the late 1800s and early 1900s , as discussed further below . since 1920 , congress has enacted provisions that could be said to tighten jones act requirements , as well as provisions that exempt certain maritime activities from the requirements . in 1935 , congress forbade jones act - qualified vessels sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign - flag to subsequently requalify as jones act - eligible ( p.l . 74-191 ) , meaning that they could never again be used in u.s. domestic trade . this provides additional protection from competition for jones act carriers if coastal shipping demand increases , because it can take two years to construct a new ship . in 1940 , congress expanded the jones act to cover towing vessels , such as river tugs that push barge tows and harbor tugs that assist larger ships , and salvage vessels operating in u.s. waters ( p.l . in 1988 , congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material , such as dredge spoil or municipal solid waste , requires use of a jones act - qualified vessel ( p.l . recent controversies over the jones act have concerned the oceangoing ship and offshore supply vessel sectors . the jones act also covers ships on the great lakes , river barges , harbor tugs , dredging vessels , and various kinds of passenger vessels .
