( see fig . this variation may reflect differences in the number and type of services provided and ordered by these patients' physicians as well as factors not under the physicians' direct control , such as a patient's response to and compliance with treatment protocols . holding health status constant , overly expensive beneficiaries accounted for nearly one - half of total medicare expenditures even though they represented only 20 percent of beneficiaries in our sample . once these patients were identified and linked to the physicians who treated them , we were able to determine which physicians treated a disproportionate share of these patients compared with their generalist peers in the same location . we classified these physicians as outliers — that is , physicians whose proportions of overly expensive patients would occur by chance less than 1 time in 100 . notably , all physicians had some overly expensive patients in their medicare practice , but outlier physicians had a much higher percentage of such patients . we concluded that these outlier physicians were likely to be practicing medicine inefficiently . based on 2003 medicare claims data , our analysis found outlier generalist physicians in all 12 metropolitan areas we studied . the miami area had the highest percentage — almost 21 percent — of outlier generalists , followed by the baton rouge area at about 11 percent . ( see table 1. ) across the other areas , the percentage of outliers ranged from 2 percent to about 6 percent . in 2003 , outlier generalists' medicare practices were similar to those of other generalists , but the beneficiaries they treated tended to experience higher utilization of certain services . outlier generalists and other generalists saw similar average numbers of medicare patients ( 219 compared with 235 ) and their patients averaged the same number of office visits ( 3.7 compared with 3.5 ) . however , after taking into account beneficiary health status and geographic location , we found that beneficiaries who saw an outlier generalist , compared with those who saw other generalists , were 15 percent more likely to have been hospitalized , 57 percent more likely to have been hospitalized multiple times , and 51 percent more likely to have used home health services . by contrast , they were 10 percent less likely to have been admitted to a skilled nursing facility . medicare's data - rich environment is conducive to identifying physicians who are likely to practice medicine inefficiently . fundamental to this effort is the ability to make statistical comparisons that enable health care purchasers to identify physicians practicing outside of established standards . cms has the tools to make statistically valid comparisons , including comprehensive medical claims information , sufficient numbers of physicians in most areas to construct adequate sample sizes , and methods to adjust for differences in patient health status . among the resources available to cms are the following: comprehensive source of medical claims information . cms maintains a centralized repository , or database , of all medicare claims that provides a comprehensive source of information on patients' medicare - covered medical encounters .
