1328 as reported . changes are also noted that were made in h.r . 1328 by the house health subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee , in the version it forwarded to the full committee in november 2007 . the bills are compared with current law and sometimes with bills from previous congresses . during the senate's consideration of s. 1200 , the administration issued a "statement of administration policy" ( sap ) on s. 1200 . the sap objected to about a dozen and a half items in s. 1200 and threatened a veto over a provision involving the " davis - bacon act application " ( see below ) . some of the new concerns raised by the sap are noted in the discussions below . the bills add or amend many of the definitions used in the act , set in ihcia section 4 . some of the changes may have program or policy implications , discussed below . the bills greatly expand the definitions of health promotion and disease prevention , which increases the range of services that indians may demand of ihs , since the terms occur frequently in ihcia . for instance , ihcia section 203 ( b ) of the bills would require that the hhs secretary "shall provide health promotion and disease prevention services to indians. 1328 and section 409 in s. 1200 exempt entities operated by the ihs , tribes , tos , and uios from having to be licensed or recognized under state or local laws as a condition for eligibility for reimbursement from any federal health care program . instead , such an entity shall be deemed to have met such state or local licensing requirements if it is determined that the entity "meets all applicable standards for such licensure. if any staff member of the entity lacks a state or local license required for its location , that fact may not be taken into account if the staff member has a valid license from another state . the bills prohibit payments by federal health care programs to entities or individuals who have been excluded from participation in any federal health care program or whose license is under suspension by the state . a parallel amendment to the ssa is in section 205 of title ii of the bills . hhs opposes exemption of tribal , to , and uio entities from state licensure , arguing that it would not be consistent with maintaining quality of care . the bills do not state who determines that an entity meets all the applicable standards , and place no limits on the number or proportion of entity staffers who may not have state or local licenses . the house health subcommittee version of h.r . 1328 deletes both this section and section 205 in title ii of the bills . both bills require the secretary to study the feasibility of allowing the navajo nation — a tribe with significant reservation land and population in three states ( arizona , new mexico , and utah ) — to be treated as a state for the purposes of medicaid services for all indians within its boundaries .
