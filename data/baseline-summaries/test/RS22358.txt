disaster voucher program . language included in the fy2006 defense appropriations act ( p.l . 109-148 ) transferred $390 million in fema funds to hud to administer a modified form of kdhap called the disaster voucher program . the act also included administrative provisions permitting housing authorities to combine their public housing and section 8 voucher funds , and directed the secretary , to the extent feasible , to preserve all assisted housing damaged by the storm . on august 31 , 2005 , hud issued mortgagee letter 2005-33 , reminding hud - approved lenders that when the president declares a disaster , as in the case of hurricane katrina , it automatically triggers certain procedures with regard to fha - insured mortgages in the affected areas . the following procedures become effective for one year from the date of declaration: ( 1 ) a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days from the date of declaration ; ( 2 ) lenders are encouraged to offer special forbearance , mortgage modification , refinancing , and waiver of late charges to affected borrowers ; ( 3 ) families whose residences were destroyed or severely damaged are eligible for 100% financing under the section 203 ( h ) program for the cost of reconstruction or replacement ; ( 4 ) damaged properties become eligible for section 203 ( k ) financing , under which costs to purchase and rehabilitate the property are included in one loan and hud waives the requirement that the property has been completed for more than one year prior to application for the mortgage ; ( 5 ) underwriting guidelines are relaxed to permit disaster victims to qualify for loans even if their total monthly debt , including the proposed mortgage , would equal 45% of gross income ; and ( 6 ) lenders must ensure that hazard claims are expeditiously filed and settled , and lenders may not retain hazard insurance proceeds to make up an existing arrearage without written consent of the borrower . the section 203 ( h ) program is available for borrowers who already own homes in the affected area . the loans are limited to the fha loan limit for the area , subject to the provision that the loan may not exceed 100% of the appraised value of the property . in some cases it may not be possible to obtain 100% financing . it may often be the case that the cost to repair or replace the property exceeds the appraised value of the property . this is the reason that most lenders require borrowers to obtain hazard insurance that covers the replacement cost of the property instead of its appraised value . the section 203 ( k ) program permits borrowers who do not already own homes to purchase and rehabilitate properties in the area that are either abandoned by owners , or are being sold by owners who do not want to repair them and remain in the area . the current fha underwriting guidelines provide that a prospective borrower's total debt , including the proposed mortgage payment , may not exceed 41% of the borrower's gross monthly income .
