governments . figure 20 provides information on the duration of cases by the outcomes reached in the cases . cases that included previously negotiated settlements were substantially shorter , on average , than other cases . the longest cases were those that included nonconsensual judgments . figure 21 provides information on the percentage of closed cases with minimal litigation . cases with minimal litigation are those whose only outcomes were either ( 1 ) previously negotiated settlements or ( 2 ) settlements in cases in which there was no evidence of adversarial actions , such as counterclaims or discovery activity recorded in the docket . while 65 percent of closed federal plaintiff cases and 59 percent of closed state plaintiff cases were classified as having minimal litigation , only 4 percent ly 4 percent of cases filed by other plaintiffs fell into this category . negotiations . as with the search for responsible parties , negotiations typically take place early in the site cleanup process , but can resume at various points during the enforcement process . formal negotiations begin when epa sends a “special notice letter” to parties . this letter typically includes information about the site , the work necessary to study or clean up the site , other responsible parties , and also provides a draft settlement document to be used as a basis for negotiations . the special notice letter also initiates a “negotiation moratorium,” or a period of time during which epa is prohibited from starting the site study or remedial action . epa and the responsible parties may use this time to reach agreement about how the necessary site work will be conducted . if negotiations are successful and parties settle with epa to conduct site work or reimburse agency costs , cercla authorizes epa to provide several benefits to the settling parties . epa has the discretion to provide parties with a “covenant not to sue,” in which the federal government promises not to pursue additional enforcement actions against the parties for matters addressed by the settlement . in most cases , settlements also include “reopeners,” which allow epa to take new enforcement actions if it discovers new evidence of liability or contamination after the initial settlement . cercla also provides “contribution protection” to parties that settle with epa . that is , other parties cannot sue the settling parties for the costs affiliated with the matters addressed by the settlement . in cases involving the performance of site work , where epa and the responsible parties are unable to reach agreement , epa may order the parties to conduct the cleanup action . if the parties do not comply with such orders , or for enforcement actions related to matters other than site work , epa may refer the case to doj for litigation . doj officials then renew efforts to negotiate with responsible parties . these efforts are known as “pre - filing negotiations” and are required prior to all civil litigation the federal government brings . negotiations continue after doj files a cercla case , even during a trial .
