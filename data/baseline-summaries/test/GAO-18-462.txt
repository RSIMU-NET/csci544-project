, project justification ) . for example , for core capacity projects , fta is required to evaluate and rate a project against six criteria: ( 1 ) mobility improvements , ( 2 ) environmental benefits , ( 3 ) cost - effectiveness , ( 4 ) the congestion relief associated with the project , ( 5 ) the economic development effects associated with the project , and ( 6 ) the existing capacity needs of the corridor . fta is also required to evaluate and rate the local financial commitment to a project , including evidence of stable and dependable financing sources , as well as the project sponsor's ability to operate the project and continue to operate any related transit system . however , the department also stated in its letter that our report did not adequately describe the steps fta has completed to implement the statutory provisions discussed in this report . further , the department stated that fta has demonstrated its intent to address the outstanding provisions . we agree with the department that fta has taken numerous actions toward addressing various statutory provisions of the capital investment grants program , provisions contained in either map - 21 or the fast act . as noted above in this report , we discussed many of those actions in our april 2016 review of the capital investment grants program . at that time , we reported that fta was making progress implementing map - 21 and that fta intended to take action over the next 2 years toward addressing the remaining provisions of map - 21 and the new requirements of the fast act . however , as of this report , fta has still not addressed all the provisions , and as the department stated in its letter , fta cannot specify when action will be taken to address the outstanding provisions . accordingly , we believe that our assessment is an accurate reflection of fta's progress in addressing the outstanding statutory provisions of the capital investment grants program as amended by map - 21 and the fast act . we are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees and the secretary of the department of transportation . if you or your staff have any questions or would like to discuss this work , please contact me at ( 202 ) 512-2834 or goldsteinm@gao.gov . contact points for our offices of congressional relations and public affairs may be found on the last page of this report . gao staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix iii . appendix i: core capacity improvement projects project description the metropolitan transportation authority proposes to implement capacity improvements to the canarsie l line , which operates between south brooklyn and manhattan . improvements include three new power substations and other upgrades necessary to increase capacity on the line . the metropolitan transportation authority estimates that when the project is complete , capacity in the corridor will be increased 10 percent . in addition , this report will be available at no charge on gao's website at http: / / www.gao.gov . the dallas area rapid transit is proposing to extend and modify platforms along two existing light rail lines to accommodate longer trains .
