award . once proposals were received , the proposals were evaluated by the source selection team consisting of four primary entities: the teams that comprised the source selection evaluation board ( evaluation board ) , the group that made up the source selection advisory council ( advisory council ) , an individual serving as the source selection and an individual serving as the authority ( selection authority ) ,procuring contracting officer ( contracting officer ) . each entity had specific tasks to complete during the award phase and performed these in a specific order . ( see fig . tma used a process established in the source selection plan to evaluate offerors' proposals . to accomplish this , evaluation board teams reviewed offerors' proposals against the three rfp evaluation factors and their relevant subfactors . the evaluation factors , in descending order of importance , were: ( 1 ) technical approach , ( 2 ) past performance , and ( 3 ) price / cost . these evaluation factors were developed to target critical aspects of the program for review and evaluation . the evaluation board evaluated each proposal against these factors . ratings were assigned to each of the offerors' proposals under the technical and past performance evaluation factors , and each offeror's total proposal price was determined during the price / cost evaluation . the source selection team used a best - value tradeoff process to compare the relative merits of the offerors' proposals under the various evaluation factors . the rfp provided that the technical approach and past performance factors , combined , were significantly more important than the price / cost factor , which allowed tma to accept other than the lowest priced proposal in favor of a technically superior proposal in the best - value tradeoff decision . the technical approach factor was used to evaluate the offerors' proposed approach â€” how the offeror intended to deliver services to fulfill contract requirements . under this factor , the rfp identified seven evaluation subfactors , including network development and maintenance ( which encompassed the consideration of network provider discounts ) , and claims processing.rating and the subfactors were equally weighted during the evaluation . the technical evaluation team's responsibility was to evaluate how well an offeror's proposed approach met or exceeded tma's minimum requirements for each subfactor . the past performance factor was used to evaluate an offeror's ability to supply services based on a demonstrated record of performance . if an offeror did not have relevant past performance , the evaluation board's past performance evaluation team was allowed to consider information from a predecessor company or parent organization . according to a senior tricare acquisition official , staff in the former tma requirements branch developed requirements for tricare's third generation mcscs during the acquisition planning phase . this senior official explained that the requirements branch was disbanded in 2009 because tma leadership officials determined that the responsibility for developing requirements should be located within the program management office requiring the services and not tma's acquisition office .
