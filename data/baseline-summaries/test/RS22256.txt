the court's approach to these precedents was highly fractured . although the court upheld the michigan law by a vote of 6-2 , there were three different opinions concurring in the judgment . in an opinion announcing the judgment of the court , justice kennedy distinguished its rulings in cases such as hunter and seattle , noting that these cases involved state laws that encouraged or inflicted injuries on racial minorities , while michigan's proposal 2 reflected the right of its voters to decide whether race - conscious preferences should continue to be used . in parents involved in community schools v. seattle school district no . 1 , a consolidated 2007 ruling that resolved both cases , the court , in a fractured decision , struck down the school plans at issue , holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment . announcing the judgment of the court was chief justice roberts , who led a plurality of four justices in concluding that the school plans were unconstitutional because they did not serve a compelling governmental interest . although justice kennedy concurred in the court's judgment striking down the plans , he declined to sign on to the plurality opinion in full , in part because he disagreed with its implication that diversity in elementary and secondary education , at least as properly defined , does not serve a compelling governmental interest . according to justice kennedy , "[d]iversity , depending on its meaning and definition , is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue," but neither seattle nor louisville had shown that its plans served a compelling interest in promoting diversity or that the plans were narrowly tailored to achieve that goal . the court's ruling appears to indicate that race - conscious measures to promote racial diversity in public elementary and secondary education remain constitutionally permissible in theory , although in practice it is less clear what types of programs the court would consider to be sufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster . the basic statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education derives from the civil rights act of 1964 . public and private employers with 15 or more employees are subject to a comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under title vii of the 1964 act . in another series of decisions , the court approved of congressionally mandated racial preferences to allocate the benefits of contracts on federally sponsored public works projects , fullilove v. klutznick , while condemning similar actions taken by local governmental entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs , city of richmond v. j.a . school districts across the nation operating under these decrees later sought to be declared in compliance with constitutional requirements in order to gain release from federal intervention . the supreme court eventually responded by holding that judicial control of a school system previously found guilty of intentional segregation should be relinquished if , looking to all aspects of school operations , it appears that the district has complied with desegregation requirements in "good faith" for a "reasonable period of time" and has eliminated "vestiges" of past discrimination "to the extent practicable.
