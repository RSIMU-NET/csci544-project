as of march 2013 , fema had not addressed this action . in addition , in the 2012 report , we suggested that congress , working with the administrator of tsa , may wish to consider increasing the passenger aviation security fee according to one of many options , including but not limited to the president's deficit reduction plan option ( $7.50 per one - way trip by 2017 ) or the congressional budget office , president's debt commission , and house budget committee options ( $5 per one - way trip ) . dhs generally agreed with our suggestions and is reported taking steps to address them . individuals who made key contributions to this testimony are kathryn bernet , assistant director ; elizabeth luke ; and meg ullengren . this enclosure presents a summary of the areas and actions we identified in our 2011-2013 annual reports that are relevant to the department of homeland security ( dhs ) . it also includes our assessment of the overall progress made in each of the areas and the progress made on each action that we identified in our 2011 and 2012 annual reports in which congress and dhs could take actions to reduce or eliminate fragmentation , overlap , and potential duplication or achieve other potential financial benefits . as of april 26 , 2013 , we have not assessed dhs's progress in addressing the relevant 2013 areas . table 4 presents our assessment of the overall progress made in implementing the actions needed in the areas related to fragmentation , overlap , or duplication . we conducted this work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . since 2011 , we have identified 11 areas across dhs where fragmentation , overlap , or potential duplication exists , and suggested 24 actions to the department and congress to help strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of dhs operations . in some cases , there is sufficient information available to show that if actions are taken to address individual issues , significant financial benefits may be realized . in other cases , precise estimates of the extent of potential unnecessary duplication , and the cost savings that can be achieved by eliminating any such duplication , are difficult to specify in advance of congressional and executive branch decision making . however , given the range of areas we identified at dhs and the magnitude of many of the programs , the cost savings associated with addressing these issues could be significant . in april 2013 , we identified 2 new areas where dhs could take actions to address fragmentation , overlap , or potential duplication . first , we found that dhs does not have a department - wide policy defining research and development ( r&d ) or guidance directing how components are to report r&d activities . as a result , the department does not know its total annual investment in r&d , a fact that limits dhs's ability to oversee components' r&d efforts and align them with agency - wide r&d goals and priorities .
