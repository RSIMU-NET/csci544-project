app . finally , we interviewed acc officials to obtain their views on conflicts of interest and on the role of acc representatives in developing the announcement of funding availability , reviewing and funding research proposals , and administering the grants . we did not test the niehs or ord internal controls governing the administration of grants awarded under the arrangements . to determine whether niehs's acceptance of acc funds as a gift complied with nih policy for accepting gifts , we collected and analyzed nih's policy for gift acceptance and we interviewed legal staff at niehs concerning their review of potential gifts and their assistance to program officials . we obtained and reviewed the research arrangement and related documentation on transferring and administering the gift funds . we interviewed program officials on their actions in accepting the funds and compared activities and documentation pertaining to niehs's acceptance of acc's gift with the requirements and recommendations outlined in nih's policy . to determine the extent of similar research arrangements at other federal agencies , we identified officials responsible for 96 percent or more of the extramural research budgets at nih , epa , and two additional agencies . we then used a structured guide to determine what , if any , research arrangements the agencies had with external partners . in addition to niehs and ord , we selected a nonprobability sample of two additional agencies on the basis of the magnitude of the research component of their mission and congressional interest . the two agencies selected were the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the federal aviation administration ( faa ) because each agency had a research component to its mission , a corresponding research budget , and a regulatory role . we determined that the selection was appropriate for our design and objectives and that the selection would generate valid and reliable evidence to support our work . to determine the extent to which arrangements exist within these four agencies , we obtained the most current available data on extramural research budgets from institutes and centers in nih , program and regional offices in epa , and the programs and centers at faa and fda . to assess the reliability of these data , we used a structured guide to interview officials at each agency responsible for maintaining the databases containing the data provided . specifically , we obtained descriptions of the databases , how data are entered into the databases , quality control checks on the data , testing conducted on the data , and officials' views on the accuracy and completeness of the data . we asked follow - up questions whenever necessary . fda officials noted one limitation on the data that were provided . specifically , when compiling data on research budgets , officials must sometimes subjectively interpret the term “research.” the impact of such interpretation may cause the extramural research figures for fda to be slightly overstated . after taking these steps , we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report . we used these data to rank order the programs and centers and identify officials in each agency responsible for administering 96 percent or more of each agency's extramural research budget .
