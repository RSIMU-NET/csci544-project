we disagree . our objectives were to provide information on the cost , functions , and funding for visitor center projects . because interior does not maintain a database with this information , it was necessary for us to first identify visitor center projects and then to gather specific information using a questionnaire to answer the study's specific objectives . as we pointed out in our scope and methodology , we designed our questionnaire with the park service's input and we discussed the questionnaire in detail with officials from 11 parks . to address potential inconsistencies or misinterpretations in responses from the parks , we followed up , as is our normal practice , with all parks that provided data that appeared to be inconsistent or misinterpreted . as a further check on the validity of the data , we corroborated the project cost and funding data with regional budget staff . we believe the data upon which the report is based are accurate . other data which we gathered as part of the questionnaire and to which interior is referring — data on the visitor center building costs — were not used in the report . we attempted to gather this data because interior did not maintain the data . however , in discussing visitor center building costs with the parks and with interior construction staff , we found that the data were subject to different interpretations and assumptions about what specific costs should be included . for example , parks used different interpretations on whether or not to include site development costs , which in its comments interior points out can be a major cost in the overall visitor center project costs . given that collecting specific data on visitor center building costs was not part of our overall objectives , and that the data are subject to different interpretations and assumptions , the data need to be clarified and studied in more detail as part of a separate review . interior also believes that providing costs per square foot of the individual visitor center buildings is more meaningful than providing the overall costs of visitor center projects . we strongly disagree that information on visitor center building costs is more meaningful than the cost of the projects . as stated above , our purpose was to discuss the cost , functions , and funding sources for visitor center projects and not just visitor center buildings . the requesters asked that we gather data on overall visitor center projects because the total project costs reflect all costs related to developing and constructing a visitor center , which represent the cost to the taxpayer . also , only in this way can the full range of visitor center project functions , including transportation facilities , be addressed . although interior states that cost - per - square - foot data is more meaningful than project costs , the park service has not developed a database containing this information . furthermore , interior asserts that the data could have been easily developed from data already accumulated . we disagree . we gathered , as part of our study , data that could be used to calculate the cost per square foot of individual visitor centers .
