these impacts are discussed below . it is not clear what direction europe's pta policy will head in the future . under its global europe policy , the eu intended to negotiate commercially relevant and wto - compliant ptas by targeting middle - sized economies with some significant barriers such as korea , india , and eventually canada . according to some european observers , by pursuing this strategy , the eu hoped to gain better access to foreign markets without having to concede significant reductions in its own agricultural and services barriers . the underlying premise may have been that smaller countries or regions would be willing to deliver cuts in their own protective barriers on a nonreciprocal basis because the eu offered a much bigger market that would facilitate increases in export volume . to move forward , these same observers maintain that the eu should examine the idea of targeting bigger economies for bilateral negotiations . these would be the handful of remaining countries that fall outside the eu's network of ptas , namely the united states , china , japan , and australia . pta negotiations with these countries , it is argued , could yield significant economic benefits and provide the biggest impact ( for good or ill ) on the world trading system . bigger trade partners such as the united states and china , however , would likely demand openings in agriculture and services , sectors where there is widespread opposition to liberalization . from a different perspective , some european economists maintain that the competitiveness of eu firms has more to do with internal eu market conditions ( domestic trade policy ) than with opening export markets through pta negotiations . rejecting the notion that opening export markets will strengthen the competitiveness of european companies , these observers advocate placing greater emphasis on unilateral liberalization of protected sectors and domestic market reforms . in addition to reforms of the common agricultural policy , these economists propose completing a single market for services by ending barriers that member states still impose against suppliers from other member states on the grounds of regulatory differences . they argue that the absence of a more dynamic european - wide services sector raise the prices of services relative to goods , and prevents the eu from trading off its agricultural protectionism for better access for its industrial and services firms . if europe is not prepared to extend improved market access to exports of services and agriculture , foreign countries are likely to maintain barriers against europe's industrial and services firms . if public support in the eu is lacking for undertaking significant agricultural reforms and services liberalization to position itself to negotiate an fta with the largest economies , european policymakers could explore a number of alternative approaches to trade liberalization both with the united states and with other big economies such as china . for the united states the possibilities include intensified regulatory cooperation with the goal of developing common standards , sector specific initiatives to remove barriers to trade , or the elimination of all tariffs on manufactured goods .
