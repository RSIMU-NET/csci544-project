a few definitions are called for before proceeding with the explanation . to begin with , the official definition of the unemployment rate prescribed by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) is the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed . the labor force , in turn , is defined as the number of employed and unemployed individuals in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older . lastly , unemployment is defined as the number of people who actively searched for work in the four weeks before the week in which the census bureau administers the current population survey to members of households . mathematically , the unemployment rate is expressed as: the unemployment rate consequently may move up or down depending not just on a change in the number of workers who lack jobs ( the numerator ) but also on a change in the number of individuals participating in the labor force ( the denominator ) . the size of the labor force may decrease during a recession in part because unemployed workers who give up searching for jobs out of discouragement over their reemployment prospects cease to be included . conversely , the number of labor force participants may increase during a recession if people see signs the economy is improving and think it again worthwhile to look for work . if hiring does not keep pace with discouraged workers reentering the labor force , for example , the unemployment rate will rise in the face of otherwise good economic news . the unemployment rate thus is called a lagging economic indicator: it typically improves only after other indicators have signaled an impending recovery and actually may rise for some time after a recession's end . firms usually are reluctant to add workers to their payrolls until convinced that the economy will continue growing ( i.e. , gross domestic product , gdp , will keep increasing ) . before employers are fairly certain that the increase in demand for their goods and services will continue , they are likely to boost production by restoring the hours of those currently in their employ and by having employees work overtime rather than by hiring new workers or recalling laid off workers . as a result , job growth may not occur immediately upon the economy showing signs of a turnaround . the source of jobs data that labor market analysts generally utilize is the current employment statistics program . in its establishment survey , bls queries nonfarm employers each month about the number of jobs ( employees ) on their payrolls . employers are considered to be a more accurate source for this information compared to the members of households who respond to the current population survey , from which the unemployment rate and most demographic information on workers is derived . in addition , the business cycle dating committee appears to rely chiefly on changes in both national output ( gdp ) and employment trends from the establishment survey to determine the official beginning and end of recessions . the u.s. economy experienced 10 recessions since world war ii , excluding the latest , which ran from december 2007 to june 2009 .
