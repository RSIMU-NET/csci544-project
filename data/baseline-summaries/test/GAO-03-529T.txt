we recommended that epa negotiate inspection goals with each state . while epa has not yet set such inspection goals , it has been working with states to use third - party inspectors and other options to increase their inspection coverage . we also suggested that the congress may want to ( 1 ) consider increasing the amount of funds it appropriates from the trust fund and allow states to spend a limited portion on inspections and enforcement , ( 2 ) authorize epa to require physical inspections of all tanks on a periodic basis , ( 3 ) authorize epa to prohibit fuel deliveries to non - compliant tanks , and ( 4 ) require states to adopt this enforcement authority . states still face a considerable workload in ensuring that contamination from leaking tanks , including those that leak mtbe , is cleaned up , and that funding is available to address these cleanups . as of september 30 , 2002 , states and epa regions had to ensure the completion of ongoing cleanups for about 99,427 leaks and initiation of cleanups for another 43,278 . the fund is replenished partly through a $.001 / gallon tax on gasoline and other fuels . at the end of fiscal year 2002 , the fund had a balance of about $1.9 billion . because the states are primarily implementing the provisions of the program , we conducted a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia in the fall of 2000 to determine the extent to which tanks comply with program requirements , how epa and the states inspect tanks and enforce requirements , and whether upgraded tanks still leak . we based the findings of our report , which we are discussing today , primarily on the survey and our visits to three epa regions with the largest number of tanks to monitor . in addition , since the release of our report , we have updated our findings and reviewed states' progress in cleaning up tank releases . in summary , we found that: about 89 percent of tanks that states monitor had the required leak prevention and detection equipment installed , according to our estimates at the time of our 2002 survey . epa data at the time indicated that about 70 percent of the tanks its regions managed on tribal lands had the required equipment , although not all regions could even attest to the location of all tanks on these lands to ensure they had been updated . furthermore , we estimated that almost 30 percent of the tanks — more than 200,000 — were not being operated and maintained properly , thus increasing the chance of leaks and posing health risks . for example , 15 states reported that leak detection equipment was frequently turned off or improperly maintained . for these and other reasons , states reported that leaks persisted even in the tanks with the required equipment installed . in december 2002 , epa reported that 19 to 26 percent of the nation's underground storage tanks still have operational problems , although agency program managers think these numbers are understated because of inconsistent reporting from the states .
