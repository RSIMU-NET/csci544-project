data files . however , now nara estimates that some federal agencies , such as the department of state and department of the treasury , are individually generating 10 times that many electronic records annually just in e - mail â€“ and many of those records may need to be preserved by nara . in addition to increasing volume , nara must address some definitional problems , such as what constitutes an electronic record . in addition , because agencies follow no uniform hardware or software standards , nara must be capable of accepting various formats from agencies and maintaining a continued capability of reading those records . the long - term preservation and retention of those electronic records is a challenge because of the difficulty in providing continued access to archived records over many generations of systems , because the average life of a typical software product is 2 to 5 years . nara is also concerned about the authenticity and reliability of records transferred to nara . nara is not alone in facing erm challenges , the agencies also must meet federal records act responsibilities . records management is the initial responsibility of the staff member who creates the record , whether the record is paper or electronic . preservation of and access to that record then also becomes the responsibility of agency managers and agency records officers . agencies must incorporate nara's guidance into their own recordkeeping systems . agencies' responsibilities are complicated by the decentralized nature of electronic records creation and control . for example , agencies' employees send huge volumes of e - mail , and any of those messages deemed to be an official record must be preserved . agencies must assign records management responsibilities , control multiple versions , and archive the messages . agencies' reactions to the challenges i just mentioned are varied . on the basis of our discussions with nara and some agency officials , we learned that some agencies are waiting for more specific guidance from nara while others are moving forward by looking for ways to better manage their electronic records . however , there has been no recent governmentwide survey to determine the extent of agencies' erm programs and capabilities or their compliance with the federal records act . for several years to develop dod's erm software standard , which is intended to help dod employees determine what are records and how to properly preserve them . nara endorsed the dod standard in november 1998 as a tool that other agencies could use as a model until a final policy is issued by nara . nara , however , did not mandate that agencies use the dod standard . the dod standard ( 1 ) sets forth baseline functional requirements for records management application software ; ( 2 ) defines required system interfaces and search criteria ; and ( 3 ) describes the minimum records management requirements that must be met , according to current nara regulations . a number of companies have records management application products that have been certified by dod for meeting this standard . other agencies have also been testing erm software applications for their electronic records .
