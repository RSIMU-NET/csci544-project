iv ) . the reason for the closures , the proximity of the receiving branch , and what actions the applicant plans to take to mitigate the impact on that community . the officials stated that they undertook such an analysis on the chemical - chase merger application . the law does not provide the regulators with the authority to prohibit banks from closing a branch . we were told by community development officials at two bhcs that the cra agreements are significant in terms of external relations for the bhc with its communities . according to these officials , the primary purpose of the commitments and pledges was not to influence the regulatory process , since frb does not consider the agreements of the applicant as a part of its analysis of the applicant's cra record . alternatively , community groups we interviewed want frb to consider the banks' compliance with those agreements as part of its assessment of the applicant's cra record . frb's lack of written guidance for how it addresses public comments contributed to the concerns voiced by some community groups and two bhcs regarding the lack of transparency in the merger application process . several of the community groups who submitted comments told us that they did not understand the process by which frb approved the six bhc mergers and how frb considered their public comments raising concerns . the community group officials told us that frb does not have written criteria for how it assesses merger applications , and frb did not explain its process when community groups met with frb officials . some of the officials told us that while frb conducted hmda analysis , it did not criticize the applicant's lending performance on the basis of the analysis . two bhc community development officials told us that they did not understand why they needed to provide the federal reserve with redundant information when they had established good cra records . one bhc official stated that if a bank has been examined for cra , why should the federal reserve have to reexamine the bank . the banking official's perception of frb's cra review was different from that of frb officials who do not consider their review process to be a reexamination of the bank's cra performance . the bhc officials told us that during the application process , frb will ask for redundant information . according to the officials , even if frb has requested information from the applicant on a particular issue , it would request the same information again from the applicant if it subsequently received comment letters on the same issue . commenters who raised concerns often expressed judgments that were critical of the bhc applicant , the bhc to be acquired , and the bank and nonbank subsidiaries of the bhcs . the merging bhcs have a business interest in completing the merger in a timely manner with minimal disruption to their future consolidation efforts . therefore , the implications of frb's actions are of major importance to the parties involved in this process .
