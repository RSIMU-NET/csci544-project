these provisions were unchanged by the 2014 farm bill . what did change under the 2014 farm bill was the list of usda program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found out of compliance with the sodbuster provision . the list was expanded to "include any portion of the premium paid by the federal crop insurance corporation for a policy or plan of insurance under the federal crop insurance act. where appropriate , funding levels are repeated within a program's corresponding subtitle table . this does not mean that producers cannot purchase a crop insurance plan through the federal crop insurance program ; rather , if found out of compliance , they would be ineligible to receive the insurance premium subsidy paid by the federal government . the loss of the insurance premium subsidy is not retroactive and would only take effect after all administrative appeals were exhausted . a number of eligible activities are defined in statute . however , consistent with the repealed programs , water quantity and water quality concerns continue to have a large presence in rcpp . rcpp incorporates the agricultural water enhancement program ( awep ) , the cooperative conservation partnership initiative ( ccpi ) , the chesapeake bay watershed program ( cbwp ) , and the great lakes basin program for soil erosion and sediment control ( glbp ) . priority enrollment is given to expiring crp acres . similar to fpp , acep requires usda to enter into partnership agreements with eligible entities to purchase agricultural land easements . agreements with certified entities are a minimum of five years with a review and recertification required every three years thereafter . agreements with non - certified entities are three to five years in length . the entities agree to share the cost of the easement ; purchase easements according to usda's requirements ; and enforce and monitor easements purchased . also similar to the repealed fpp and grp easements , agricultural land easements allow production to continue on the land while prohibiting nonagricultural uses . acep provides funding to purchase easements through eligible entities and provides technical assistance for developing an agricultural land easement plan . the federal share of the easement may not exceed 50% of the fair market value of the easement . another major change was the reduction in enrollable acres . under the 2008 farm bill , csp could enroll up to 12.769 million acres annually . the fy2014 farm bill reduces this to 10 million acres annually . this reduction creates an estimated $2.272 billion in savings over 10 years ( see figure 2 ) . csp was reduced in fy2011 and fy2012 , when appropriators placed limits on mandatory spending ( chimps ) . the program was further reduced in fy2013 by sequestration . if these reductions continue , then the lower 10 million acre cap authorized in the farm bill would continue to slow program growth . at the end of fy2013 , 59 million acres were enrolled in csp . a detailed analysis of the programmatic changes may be found in table a - 2 . land retirement programs provide federal payments to private agricultural landowners for temporary changes in land use or management to achieve environmental benefits .
