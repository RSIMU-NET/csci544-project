apr . 26 , 1996 ) summary summarizes uses of tcmp data and outlines who uses the data . identifies weaknesses of proposed changes and establishes criteria for evaluating proposed changes to measures of voluntary compliance . summarizes irs' plans for the 1994 tcmp and discusses promising changes . identifies several weaknesses in the plan that irs needs to fix before implementing the project . testimony on 1994 tcmp before the subcommittee on oversight , committee on ways and means . discusses uses of tcmp data and status of planned 1994 tcmp effort . discusses some of the criticisms of tcmp . identifies gao reports where tcmp data were used . summarizes errors in audits for 1988 tcmp and suggests changes to codes to be used to categorize the cause of noncompliance for the planned 1994 tcmp project . follow - up on issues raised in our december 1994 report concerning timeliness and the types of data irs planned to gather for tcmp audits . also , briefly discusses other sources of data on voluntary compliance and the relevance of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals . indicates how irs responded to our recommendations . summarizes the problems caused by cancellation of the 1994 tcmp project . this report also identifies sampling strategies that will reduce the sample size and still provide some data . similar to irs' prior studies on measuring taxpayer compliance , some federal agencies randomly sample their clients to measure compliance with the rules and regulations covering their programs and services . in general , agencies use random samples to reduce the cost and burden of collecting information on how well the agency is performing its functions . we tried to focus on the following six areas , when the data were available: ( 1 ) sample population from which the sample is drawn ; ( 2 ) sample size ; ( 3 ) methodology used to select the sample ; ( 4 ) what data were collected and how they were used ; ( 5 ) length of time to conduct the case reviews ; and ( 6 ) cost of the reviews . the agencies we contacted have augmented their efforts to measure compliance since passage of the government performance and results act ( gpra ) , which required that agencies establish measures to determine the results of agency activities . gpra seeks to shift the focus of government decision - making and accountability away from a preoccupation with the activities that are undertaken — such as grants dispensed or inspections made — to focus on the results of those activities , such as real gains in employability , safety , responsiveness , or program quality . gpra also requires federal agencies to set goals , measure performance , and report on their accomplishments . measuring compliance is not the same thing as ensuring compliance . agencies use various processes , including verification of submitted information , in an effort to ensure that all clients are in compliance with the rules and regulations governing the programs . for example , in the food stamp program , states verify income and household circumstances during the application process . in contrast , agencies measure compliance to determine the effectiveness of these efforts to ensure compliance .
