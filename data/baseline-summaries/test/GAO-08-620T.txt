we have reported on three of the proposals . in 2006 , we suggested that the congress consider an idea for reducing securities capital gains noncompliance . in 1991 , we supported the notion that payments to corporations be reported on information returns . finally , in 2007 , we described ways to mitigate the compliance costs related to these information returns and to other information returns associated with credit and debit card payments . the revenue expected from irs's enforcement initiatives is modest compared to the net tax gap , which was last estimated at $290 billion for tax year 2001 . as we noted in our statement to this committee last year , no single approach , such as irs enforcement , is likely to fully and effectively address noncompliance . multiple approaches are needed because noncompliance has multiple causes and spans different types of taxes and taxpayers . hiring needed staff for the nonlegislative initiatives will be challenging for irs's large and mid - size business ( lmsb ) and small business / self - employed ( sb / se ) divisions . for instance , the initiatives call for adding 1,431 revenue agents in addition to those who must be replaced from attrition , a high number relative to past years . irs divisions have previously hired large numbers of staff in a short time because of specific budget initiatives , but officials reported that hiring gradually over time would reduce challenges . if irs were to fall behind in its hiring efforts , it would not need all $226 million of the funding for staff for fy 2009 initiatives . responding to our recommendations from last year , irs included more information on initiatives in the fy 2009 proposed budget , including roi information for all nonlegislative initiatives . last year , we recommended that irs have available basic descriptive , cost , and expected performance information on all new initiatives and include such information in future budget submissions . this year , the budget request has sections explicitly entitled , for instance , “initiative summary,” “implementation plan,” “expected benefits,” and “roi.” four of the five nonlegislative enforcement initiatives for fy 2009 were revisions of fy 2008 initiatives , but with more total funds requested and generally more informative justifications than for fy 2008 . however , irs's roi calculations have limitations that reflect the challenges of estimating rois . for example , the calculations do not account for benefits that are harder to measure , such as improved voluntary compliance . another example showing roi limitations is the $51 million national research project ( nrp ) initiative for which irs estimates the roi to be $0.40 per $1.00 invested . nrp funds research audits in order to develop more effective enforcement programs . the roi calculation only includes direct revenue resulting from the research audits , not the potential for increased revenue from improved enforcement programs ; nor does the calculation include the benefits of the department of the treasury's use of nrp data to provide the basis for legislative recommendations . although the budget request for irs provides performance measure data , it does not provide roi analyses for programs or activities other than the new initiatives .
