see app . iv for additional information on the revenues generated under the program . our review found that 8 ( a ) anc - owned firms serviced by the alaska district office — which represent 18 of the 26 8 ( a ) anc firms we reviewed — were allowed by the alaska district office to provide varying levels of detail about compensation — including non - responses — in their annual updates despite the rules , which may make it difficult for this office to determine if firms have violated excessive withdrawal rules . sba regulations and the agency's 2008 program guidance call for firms to provide records of all payments , compensation , and distributions ( including loans , advances , salaries and dividends ) made by the firm to each of its owners , officers or directors or to any person or entity affiliated with any of those entities each year to their assigned sba district office . we reviewed the compensation - related information for a non - generalizable sample of 26 8 ( a ) anc - owned firms required to submit this information to sba . of these , 10 firms consistently answered all questions in their annual updates related to compensation from calendar year 2011 through 2014 . by contrast , another 5 firms provided no details on compensation at the subsidiary level , but indicated in the reports submitted to sba that the compensation was paid by the parent corporation . another 7 firms were missing at least one year of compensation data . one firm that participated in the program between 2011 and 2013 did not provide any compensation data for those 3 years , and withdrew from the program in 2014 . one firm entered the program in 2014 and a final firm exited the program in 2011 . thus , there were no reporting requirements for these two firms . while we could not thoroughly examine whether all firms were complying with compensation - related regulations because of some limitations in the information that sba collected , we were able to analyze a smaller number of firms that provided compensation data for all years in which they were program participants from our non - generalizable sample of 26 firms by their average annual sales between calendar years 2011 through 2014 . based on our review of the files provided , the overall compensation for firms' executives ranged from $0 to $820,793 annually as shown in table 4 . a key limitation of the data we reviewed was that not all firms provided compensation for all review years ; in other instances we also noted that some firms did not provide any compensation to their executives , instead their parent corporation did . our review also identified other differences that were reported about compensation to sba from year to year for the same firms . for example , one anc - owned firm in the construction industry provided compensation data for its president and chief executive officer for calendar years 2011 and 2013 ; but did not provide the same information in calendar years 2012 and 2014 .
