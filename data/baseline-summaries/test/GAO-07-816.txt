( see fig . in 1994 , the congress authorized the use of flexible funding demonstration waivers to encourage innovative and effective child welfare practices . these waivers , typically authorized for 5 years , allowed states to use title iv - e funds to provide services and supports other than foster care maintenance payments . for example , states could use waivers to provide subsidies to legal guardians or services to caregivers with substance abuse problems . among federal policies that affect states' ability to find permanent homes for children , those that promote adoption were believed to reduce the proportion of african american children in foster care , according to our survey results . although the recognition of guardianship as a placement option under federal law was also considered helpful , state and local officials reported that the lack of federal reimbursement for subsidies to guardians constrained their ability to place children in such arrangements . ( see fig . in our survey , 22 states reported that the requirement to diligently recruit minority families contributes to a decrease in the proportion of african american children in care . according to officials from illinois , new york , and north carolina , the requirement to diligently recruit minority families has had a positive impact on moving african american children into permanent homes . for example , this requirement broadened the role and use of extended family as possible caregivers for children , according to an hhs survey of child welfare workers . state officials told us that it was a challenge to recruit a racially and ethnically diverse pool of potential foster and adoptive parents , as evidenced by the fact that more than half of states are not meeting hhs performance goals for recruitment . state officials noted the shortage of willing , appropriate , and qualified parents to adopt african american children , particularly older children , and researchers also cited a lack of resources among state and local agencies and federal guidance to implement new recruiting and training initiatives . perhaps because of these challenges , 9 states in our survey reported that the policy requiring diligent recruitment had no effect on the proportion of african american children in care , and 15 states reported that they were unable to tell . over the last 5 years , african american children as well as native american children have consistently experienced lower rates of adoption than children of other races and ethnicities , according to hhs adoption data . ( see fig . providing adoption incentive payments to states generally helps reduce the proportion of african american children in care , according to our survey ; however , these benefits may not be sustainable over time . in our survey , 20 states reported that these federal incentive payments provided to states for increasing adoptions contributes to reducing the proportion of african american children in care . a state official from texas's child welfare agency told us that in 2005 the state received the highest adoption incentive payments among all states and that the number of african american children adopted has increased each year since 2004 .
