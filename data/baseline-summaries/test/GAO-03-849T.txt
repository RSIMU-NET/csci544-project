improving contract management . controlling international space station costs . therefore , we have placed this area on our high - risk list . an agency's most important organizational asset is its people — they define the agency's culture , drive its performance , and embody its knowledge base . leading public organizations worldwide have found that strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious change management initiative . weak contract management and financial controls pose risks across the agency . however , nasa , like many federal agencies , is facing substantial challenges in attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce , thus putting the agency's missions at risk . while nasa is taking comprehensive steps to address this problem across all mission areas , implementing a strategic approach to marshal , manage , and maintain human capital has been a significant challenge . in january 2001 , we reported that nasa's shuttle workforce had declined significantly to the point of reducing nasa's ability to safely support the shuttle program . many key areas were not sufficiently staffed by qualified workers , and the remaining workforce showed signs of overwork and fatigue . recognizing the need to revitalize the shuttle program's workforce , nasa discontinued its downsizing plans in december 1999 and initiated efforts to hire new staff . in september 2001 , we testified that nasa was hiring approximately 200 full - time equivalent staff and that it had focused more attention on human capital in its annual performance plan by outlining an overall strategy to attract and retain skilled workers . however , considerable challenges remain , including the training of new staff and addressing the potential loss of key personnel through retirement . as we reported in january 2003 , these challenges have not been mitigated , and work climate indicators , such as forfeited leave and absences from training courses continue to reflect high levels of job stress . in addition , staffing shortages in many key skill areas of the shuttle program remain a problem , despite the recent hires . these areas include subsystems engineering , flight software engineering , electrical engineering , environmental control , and shuttle resources management . nasa's hiring posture for fiscal year 2003 has been to target areas where skill imbalances still exist in the shuttle program . nasa believes that similar workforce problems affect the entire agency and that , as a result , its ability to perform future missions and manage its programs may be at risk . currently , the average age of nasa's workforce is over 45 , and 15 percent of nasa's science and engineering employees are eligible to retire ; within 5 years , about 25 percent will be retirement eligible . at the same time , the agency is finding it difficult to hire people with science , engineering , and information technology skills — fields critical to nasa's missions . within the science and engineering workforce , the over - 60 population currently outnumbers the under - 30 population nearly 3 to 1 . as the pool of scientists and engineers shrinks , competition for these workers intensifies . the agency also faces the loss of significant procurement expertise through 2007 , according to nasa's inspector general .
