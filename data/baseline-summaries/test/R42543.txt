588 ( pallone ) . securing access to networks in disasters act . directs the fcc to conduct a study on network resiliency during times of emergency . requires the fcc to submit within three years a study on the public safety benefits and technical feasibility and cost of ( 1 ) making telecommunications service provider - owned wifi access points , and other communications technologies operating on unlicensed spectrum , available to the general public for access to 9-1-1 services , without requiring any login credentials during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable ; ( 2 ) the provision by non - telecommunications service provider - owned wifi access points of public access to 9-1-1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable ; and ( 3 ) other alternative means of providing the public with access to 9-1-1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable . also amends the stafford act to include all communications providers as essential service providers during federally declared emergencies . firstnet may later choose to alter its plans . firstnet's deployment strategy reportedly will include state - based enodeb's in firstnet's core services , thereby bringing the entire 20 mhz spectrum license under the full control of firstnet and its federal contractors . this decision , if implemented , represents a change in an earlier statement that proposes including the enode b as part of the radio area network . provide local area network capacity and connections as an extension of firstnet , limiting state authority to providing fill - in capacity for some under - served areas . assign to firstnet contractors the responsibility of identifying additional partners or subcontractors to act under the authority of the contractor ; this might include , for example , negotiating an agreement with a local power company for access to its infrastructure . assign negotiations for access to existing state , local , or tribal infrastructure to contractors , to be pursued after the contract has been issued . extend coverage to rural areas where there is currently little or no commercial service through new , federally funded build - out to the commercial networks of partners chosen through the rfp process . a major goal of this network design is to maximize the value of spectrum by capturing its full value , nationwide , in order to provide sufficient funding for rural coverage . firstnet therefore believes that allowing states to build their own rans "potentially takes with it subscriber fees and / or excess network capacity fees that would have helped fund the firstnet network in all other states. apparently not included in firstnet's planning process is an analysis of the costs to be assumed by states as a consequence of its business plan . these costs include the continued operation and possible expansion of state and local lmr voice networks ; the cost of integration of lmr and broadband infrastructure ; the costs of forfeiting to firstnet the potential economies of scale in network construction and operation ; and the cost of lost opportunities for competition and innovation in wireless services at the state and local level .
