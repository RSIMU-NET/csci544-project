as of the january 2013 report , no such savings have been reported . these weaknesses in oversight are due , in part , to omb not ensuring that assigned responsibilities are being executed . improved oversight could better position omb to assess progress against its cost savings goal and minimize agencies' risk of not realizing anticipated cost savings . omb's recent integration of fdcci and portfoliostat made significant changes to data center consolidation oversight and reporting requirements . officials from several agencies reported that this information was still being developed . notwithstanding these weaknesses , we found that agencies collectively reported anticipating about $2.4 billion in cumulative cost savings by the with less than 3 end of 2015 ( the planned completion date of fdcci ) .years remaining to the 2015 fdcci deadline , almost all agencies still need to complete their inventories and consolidation plans and continue to identify additional targets for closure . because closing facilities is a significant driver in realizing consolidation savings , the time required to realize planned cost savings will likely extend beyond the current 2015 time frame . with at least one agency not planning on realizing savings until after 2015 and other agencies having not yet reported on planned savings , there is an increased likelihood that agencies will either need more time to meet the overall fdcci savings goal or that there are additional savings to be realized in years beyond 2015 . until omb tracks cost savings data , the agency will be limited in its ability to determine whether or not fdcci is on course toward achieving planned performance goals . additionally , extending the horizon for realizing planned cost savings could provide omb and fdcci stakeholders with input and information on the benefits of consolidation beyond omb's initial goal . we have previously reported that oversight and governance of major it initiatives help to ensure that the initiatives meet their objectives and performance goals . when an initiative is governed by multiple entities , the roles and responsibilities of those entities should be clearly defined and documented , including the responsibilities for coordination among those entities . we have further reported , and omb requires , that an executive - level body be responsible for overseeing major it initiatives . we and other federal agenciesto develop performance measures to gauge progress . the remaining 21 agency submissions had weaknesses in several areas . for fdcci , omb originally established goals for data center closures and the expected cost savings . specifically , omb expected to consolidate approximately 40 percent of the total number of agency data centers and achieve $3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2015 , and established the means of measuring performance against those goals through several methods . have documented the need for initiatives the 24 agencies have collectively made progress towards omb's data center consolidation goal to close 40 percent , or approximately 1,253 of the 3,133 data centers , by the end of 2015 . to track their progress , omb requires agencies to report quarterly on their completed and planned performance against that goal via an online portal . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
