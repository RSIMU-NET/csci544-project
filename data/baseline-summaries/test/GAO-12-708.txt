recommendations made in both reports . you asked us to review ice's implementation of the secure communities program . this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) what trends can be identified in ice's enforcement actions related to the secure communities program ? we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . ice has received funding specifically designated for removing criminal aliens . for example , the fiscal year 2008 dhs appropriations act made $200 million of ice's salaries and expenses appropriation available through the end of fiscal year 2009 to “improve and modernize efforts to identify aliens convicted of a crime , sentenced to imprisonment , and who may be deportable , and remove them from the united states , once they are judged deportable.” in response , ice initiated secure communities and issued a plan that detailed how ice would implement policies and modernize technologies to accomplish its overall goal of identifying and ice's enforcement and removal operations removing criminal aliens . chicago , illinois ; and miami , florida , where we met with agency officials , local law enforcement officials , and community groups . we selected these field offices because they are geographically dispersed and would provide perspectives from different parts of the country , and because the los angeles , chicago , and miami field offices house three of ice's four interoperability response centers where secure communities fingerprint match information is analyzed . the information obtained from these visits is not generalizable to other ice field offices , but it provided valuable insights into secure communities implementation . we also visited ice's law enforcement support center ( lesc ) in williston , vermont , where we met with officials responsible for determining the immigration status of individuals identified by secure communities as potentially removable . to identify trends in ice's enforcement actions related to the secure communities program , we reviewed ice's progress reports for activating jurisdictions into the program and conducted interviews with ice officials on each of our site visits . we reviewed ice alien removal data from october 2008 through march 2012 , and analyzed arrest charges for aliens removed from the united states during fiscal year 2011 , when ice began collecting arrest charge data , and the first half of fiscal year 2012 . we also examined ice's policies and procedures for identifying and removing criminal aliens , and documents related to enforcement actions and detainers . we interviewed officials from ice's secure communities and law enforcement systems and analysis offices . we assessed the reliability of secure communities – related data by examining documentation about the various systems that ice uses to analyze secure communities fingerprint submissions and maintain information on aliens it encounters , and confirming with ice officials that the documentation is accurate and up to date . in doing so , we confirmed that ice has controls in place to ensure that the data it maintains on aliens encountered by the program are entered accurately . we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report .
