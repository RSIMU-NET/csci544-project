none were seen . the helicopter then landed near the site of the fire they had worked the previous day in northern california , and the crew hiked to the fire to ensure it was extinguished . at 2:17 p.m. , the cdf helicopter reported the fire was cold , and the helicopter was assigned to another incident in california . at 6:40 p.m. , in response to the july 13 request for a helicopter , a regional dispatch official in portland working with officials in the northern california regional dispatch center in redding , the fortuna dispatch center , and the grants pass dispatch center arranged for a cdf helicopter with a water bucket to respond to the biscuit fires , as allowed under the provisions of the mutual aid agreement . the helicopter had been working on fires in northern california . however , a few minutes later , as the helicopter was en route to oregon , siskiyou officials canceled the request because at that point the fires had spread to more than 300 acres , and officials stated that the helicopter would have been of limited use on a fire that size . officials explained that without ground resources available to fight the fire , water drops alone are usually of limited value . on july 15 , the last two fires that would make up the biscuit fire — sourdough and florence — were discovered . the sourdough fire was found near biscuit 1 and biscuit 2 . the florence fire was located almost 30 miles north of these fires . siskiyou officials requested the grants pass dispatch center to order numerous resources on july 15 , including helicopters , engines , and crews . most of these requests were not able to be filled for several days or longer . by july 16 , the northwest's multi - agency coordination group in portland , oregon , which is responsible for prioritizing fires and allocating firefighting resources in the region , ranked the biscuit fires as priority 12 out of 18 large fires in the region . the florence fire went on to burn almost 250,000 acres before merging with the other fires on august 7 . concerns were later expressed by state and local officials in california that a cdf helicopter , fighting fires in six rivers national forest on july 13 , just across the state border from biscuit 1 , could have been provided earlier to assist on the biscuit fire . grants pass personnel explained that they did not request assistance from the fortuna dispatch center on july 13 because , based on the daily fire situation reports , they believed no resources would be available due to the fires in northern california . california was also fighting numerous fires ignited by the same lightning storm that passed through oregon . when we asked the fortuna dispatch center about this issue , the forest service and state of california dispatchers working there expressed differing viewpoints on whether they could have provided a helicopter on the first day of the biscuit fire if such a request had been made .
