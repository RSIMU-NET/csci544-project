report did not identify the correct manufacturer . to determine how many reports of harm contained product identification information , particularly such numeric identifiers as model number or serial number , we obtained and analyzed electronic data from cpsc's safety information database . we reviewed the database fields provided and determined that submitters had entered numeric product identifiers in four database fields: incident narrative , product description , model , and serial number . we reviewed each of these four fields for 1,847 reports of harm published on saferproducts.gov and counted each numeric identifier provided in any of these fields to determine how many reports of harm contained numeric product identifiers somewhere in the report . we obtained documentary and testimonial information from cpsc officials to determine how the agency developed its statistic that , as of june 2011 , 84 percent of reports of harm contained model information or serial numbers . to examine how the agency resolved claims of material inaccuracy , including how many mii claims were accepted , accepted - in - part , or rejected , we analyzed a data field from the safety information database that contained this information . to obtain the perspectives of industry and consumer groups regarding required and optional product identification information in a report of harm and cpsc's process for reviewing and resolving mii claims , we conducted interviews with associations of manufacturers and retailers , attorneys that counsel these groups and individual companies , consumer advocacy groups , and individual companies that submitted mii claims . for the latter group , we reviewed cpsc's list of mii claims and randomly selected two companies with accepted mii claims , two companies with mii claims that were accepted - in - part , and two companies with rejected mii claims . five of these companies responded affirmatively to our request for an interview , and one did not respond . to address the third objective , we reviewed cpsia and the safety information database regulation to determine ( 1 ) the procedural requirements for transmission of reports of harm to the identified manufacturer or private labeler within the statutory 10 business day time frame and ( 2 ) cpsc's review time of mii claims from manufacturers and private labelers . we discussed these requirements with cpsc officials and requested electronic data and documentary evidence from saferproducts.gov in order to identify the reports of harm that were transmitted to the manufacturer or private labeler , and , of these reports , those manufacturer comments that cpsc reviewed and determined whether to publish by the tenth business day . cpsia set an 18-month deadline for the release of the database . cpsc submitted the database implementation plan to congress in september 2009 . cpsc published a final rule on the database in the federal register on december 9 , 2010 . prior to the public release of saferproducts.gov on march 11 , 2011 , cpsc held a series of workshops for agency staff and held public outreach events , including web conferences designed for businesses and consumers on the implementation of the online searchable consumer product safety incident database . in addition , before launching saferproducts.gov , cpsc conducted an initial 6-week trial release available to interested users for testing and feedback .
