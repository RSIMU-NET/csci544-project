10 , and currentla . their legislation also would have created a separatedirector of cia . boren and mccurdy failed to win adoption of their legislation in the face ofopposition by the department of defense ( dod ) and the congressional armed services committees . in december 2002 , the congressional joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ( 5 ) , recommended that a new cabinetlevel senate - confirmed nid position be established , and that a separate director be named to managethe cia . the joint inquiry also recommended that the nid be granted the full range ofmanagement , budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed to make the entire ic operate as acoherent whole . supporters of the nid concept argue that the dci , who manages the ic and the cia , and servesas the principal intelligence advisor to the president , has too many jobs , and that an nid , unburdenedby the need to manage the cia , must be established if the ic is to be effectively managed . ( 12 ) they also argue that an nid must be empowered with two authorities the dci now lacks: the authority to hire and remove ic agency heads in consultation with the defense secretary ( currently,the secretary of defense selects principal ic agency heads for the three combat support agencies - - nsa , nro , and nga - - with the concurrence of the dci ) ; and the authority to move funding andpersonnel within or across ic agencies at any time during the year of execution with congressionalapproval . ( 13 ) some proponents add what theycharacterize as a third essential authority - - the powerto set standards for the ic's information infrastructure and personnel . ( 14 ) from the prospective of proponents , failure to establish an empowered nid with hiring , firing and budget authority will leave the ic with divided management of intelligence capabilities ; lack ofcommon standards and practices across the foreign - domestic intelligence divide ; structural barriersthat undermine the performance of joint intelligence work ; and a weak capacity to set priorities andmove resources . a presidentially selected deputy would have managed the cia . there have been a variety of proposals concerning the nid ( 4 ) position . in 1992 , senator david boren and representative david mccurdy , respective chairmen of the senate select committee on intelligence ( ssci ) and house permanent select committee onintelligence ( hpsci ) , introduced legislation creating the nid position and giving the position theauthority to program and reprogram funds . they cite dci george tenet's 1998 "declaration of war" ( 15 ) on osama bin laden and thecorresponding lack of an integrated ic response as a clear indication of the need for an nid . ( 16 ) senator bob graham , a co - chairman of the 9 / 11 congressional joint inquiry , stated , "the intelligencecommunity needs a leader with the clout to set common goals , establish priorities , knock heads andensure that the american people are protected.
