there is no statutory requirement that crmps be updated . in some river study authorizations , congress has required the study agency to develop a crmp in concert with the study process . in some cases , congress has adopted these crmps in the legislation designating the river . agencies have sometimes developed elements of the crmp while studying the river , even if not directed by congress to do so . the agency determines the boundaries of areas along the designated river . the land area included may not exceed an average of 320 acres per mile of river designated ( an average quarter - mile - wide corridor of land on each side of the river ) or 640 acres per mile in alaska ( an average half - mile - wide corridor of land on each side of the river ) . in addition to the statutory direction discussed above , management of wsrs on federal lands differs based on the statutory management criteria for each agency's lands . fs and blm manage their lands for a sustained yield of multiple uses . nps manages the national park system under a dual mission: to preserve unique resources and to provide for their enjoyment by the public . fws manages the national wildlife refuge system ( nwrs ) under a dominant mission to conserve plants and animals for the benefit of future and present generations . these varying missions shape the management decisions the federal land management agencies make regarding wsrs on their lands . wsrs need not flow entirely through federal land . wsrs on nonfederal lands differ based on whether they were designated by congress or through an administrative process . wsrs designated by congress may flow wholly through nonfederal land or may have segments on nonfederal land . wsrs on nonfederal land managed at the state , county , or other nonfederal level , and usually congressionally designated , are referred to colloquially as partnership wild and scenic rivers ( or partnership wsrs ) . wsrs also may be designated through an administrative process . states may apply to the secretary of the interior for inclusion of a state - protected river in the nwsrs . the relevant state administers wsrs added to the system in this way . these wsrs , as well as those that contain both federal and nonfederal land , generally are not referred to as partnership wsrs . for rivers administered by the four federal land management agencies , congress provides funds for operations and maintenance through annual congressional appropriations for the relevant agencies . each agency approaches river management differently in its budget . rivers administered exclusively by states typically do not receive federal funding for river administration . the wsra authorizes federal agencies to assist states and their political subdivisions ( such as counties , townships , and others ) , landowners , organizations , or individuals in planning , protecting , and managing wsrs ; this provision includes financial and technical assistance , except in the case of administratively designated wsrs . nps administers partnership wsrs and provides technical and financial assistance to manage these rivers . wsr designation has been controversial in some cases , especially for wsrs containing nonfederal lands .
