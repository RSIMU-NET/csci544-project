encryption . encryption — encoding data so that it can only be read by authorized individuals — can in some cases prevent unauthorized access . however , some forms of encryption are more effective than others , and encryption does not necessarily preclude fraudulent use of data — for example , if the key used to unencrypt the data is also compromised . hardware requirements . data that only can be accessed using specialized equipment and software may be less likely to be misused in the case of a breach . for example , some entities that have lost data tapes have stated that criminals would require specific data reading equipment and expertise in how to use it to access the information . number of records . larger breaches may pose a greater overall risk that at least one individual would become a victim of identity theft . at the same time , given the resources needed to commit identity theft , breaches of very large numbers of records may pose less risk to any one individual whose data were compromised . breach notification requirements have several potential benefits , including creating incentives for entities to improve their data security practices ( and thus prevent potential breaches from occurring ) , allowing affected consumers to take measures to prevent or mitigate identity theft , and serving to respect individuals' basic right to know when their personal information is compromised . at the same time , breach notification requirements present costs , both for developing compliance strategies and for actual notifications in the event of a breach . further , there is the risk of overnotification , or inundating consumers with frequent notifications of breaches that may present little or no risk of identity theft or other harm . thus , policymakers face the challenge of setting a notification standard that allows individuals to take steps to protect themselves where the risk of harm exists , while ensuring they are only notified in cases where the level of risk warrants such action . according to our review of studies and interviews with representatives in government , academia , and private industry , breach notification requirements have several potential benefits , as follows: incentives for improved data security . breach notification requirements can provide an incentive for companies and other entities to increase their data security measures to avoid the possible financial and reputational risks that can be associated with a publicly reported data breach . representatives we contacted in the private , nonprofit , and government sectors told us that they believe that existing breach notification requirements in state laws , or the breach notification provisions in federal banking regulatory guidance , have provided entities with incentives to improve data security practices . for example , some representatives of companies and other organizations noted that passage of state notification laws led to companies reexamining data security procedures and making improvements , such as encrypting sensitive data and restricting consumer data that can be accessed online . similarly , federal banking regulators told us that they believe their notification guidance has motivated regulated institutions to enhance data security .
