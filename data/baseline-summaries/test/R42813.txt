specific proposals include the following . the local farms , food , and jobs act of 2011 ( h.r . expansion continued over the subsequent decade . by 2011 , insurance was available for more than 80 specialty crops in counties considered to be major growing areas . crops include avocados , blueberries , grapes , citrus , onions , pumpkins , and tomatoes , among others . another measure of program growth is the total liability , which is the estimated value of the insured portion of the crop ( figure 1 ) . insured liability of the specialty crops rose from less than $8 billion in 2000 to nearly $13 billion in 2009 , reflecting increased production and participation . the ratio is 0.7% for specialty crops , and 5.1% for program crops . these figures illustrate that , relative to total crop value , specialty crops in general are subsidized at lower levels than program crops . factors affecting the difference between program and specialty crops in subsidy amounts include acreage participation and crop insurance availability . ( the premium subsidy rates are the same for all crops. ) another important factor is the level of coverage purchased , which is significantly lower for specialty crops , particularly fruits and nuts . in 2011 , for example , acreage with coverage above the catastrophic level ( i.e. , 50% deductible ) was 59% for specialty crops compared with 89% for program crops . higher coverage levels purchased by farmers correspond with higher premiums ( and associated premium subsidies ) . usda reports that over 80 crop varieties were insured either as certified or transitional organic under crop insurance in recent years , with annual area rising from 210,393 acres in 2004 to 565,195 acres in 2009 . the department estimates organic crop insurance participation at nearly 35% . prior to 2000 , when the agricultural risk protection act ( arpa ) was enacted , crop insurance for organic production was available only by written agreement . under a written agreement , a producer could receive an individual determination of coverage for specific crops in specific counties . each situation was evaluated separately based on a farmer's organic cropping practices . arpa allowed organic production to be considered under the terms and conditions of all crop policies available at that time . by 2004 , rma modified the basic provisions such that organic producers were eligible for standard crop insurance policies and were not required to obtain a written agreement . for organic crops , federal crop insurance is available for ( 1 ) certified organic acreage , ( 2 ) transitional acreage ( acreage on which organic farming practices are being followed but does not yet qualify to be designated as certified organic acreage ) , and ( 3 ) buffer zone acreage ( used to minimize the possibility of unintended contact by prohibited substances ) . to insure certified organic acreage , a producer must have a current organic plan and written certification from a certifying agent . for transitional acreage , a producer needs written documentation from a certifying agent showing that an organic plan is in effect ( acreage without documentation can be insured under conventional farming practices ) .
