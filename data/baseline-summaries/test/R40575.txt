subsequent usda pork product purchases followed later in 2009 . following the h1n1 outbreak , usda predicted that prices would recover and did not alter its outlook for hog prices during the second half of 2009 , based on expectations that market disruptions from trade restrictions and consumer concerns would be short - lived . in mid - june , smithfield foods company reported that , although it remained concerned about restrictions on international markets , the company believed that h1n1 had had "only a short - term effect on u.s. fresh pork demand," with "no significant effect on the quarter" based on the company's consolidated income statement . initial reports of the aggregate economic effects of h1n1 on the farming sector — especially on u.s. hog producers — were grim . however , as time has passed and the general economic downturn in the u.s. hog industry has deepened , it has become difficult to separate out the economic effects of h1n1 from generally unfavorable market conditions in the u.s. hog sector . early estimates by analysts at the university of missouri estimated that the u.s. pork industry could see losses of up to $400 million in the months following initial reports of the outbreak , given expected lower market prices . in its may 2009 outlook report , usda revised its second - quarter hog prices downward to reflect lower prices in april due to the negative effects of h1n1 flu virus . in june 2009 , ustr reported updated estimates by the university of missouri , indicating that the u.s. pork industry could face losses of about $270 million in income in the second quarter of 2009 alone , based on market conditions in the first few days since the virus was identified . more recent estimates , however , indicate that the economic effect of the h1n1 virus has not been as negative as some analysts had predicted . pork producers in the united states began to see a downturn in u.s. pork markets in late 2007 . following years of favorable returns in 2004-2006 , the domestic industry began to expand and eventually pushed up slaughter rates to record levels in 2008 . at the same time , pork prices started to decline while feed costs and other production input costs were rising . starting in 2008 , the worldwide economic downturn resulted in a decrease in meat demand . the h1n1 outbreak compounded this already worsening situation , and newly imposed trade restrictions in u.s. export markets , particularly in russia and china , only further strained demand for u.s. pork products . at the same time , despite industry efforts to downsize and reduce sow numbers , increased herd productivity and efficiency gains — given higher litter rates and also higher slaughter weights owing to favorable weather over the summer of 2009 — kept overall production volumes stable and put downward pressure on prices . in part because of the surplus situation , in may 2008 and march 2009 , usda announced that it would purchase $50 million and $25 million , respectively , in pork products for federal food and nutrition assistance programs .
