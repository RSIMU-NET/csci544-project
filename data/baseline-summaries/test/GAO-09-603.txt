quality . fta has no performance measures for assessing the quality of the triennial review program . fta officials help ensure quality by checking triennial review reports to determine whether the contractors made reasonable findings for grantees , determining what actions grantees must take to resolve findings , and attending some site visits to oversee contractors . however , fta officials are unsure how to develop a measure for evaluating the quality of the triennial review program . in addition , booz allen hamilton reported that fta headquarters and field staff do not have a common understanding of what constitutes a quality review or how it could be measured . without common quality standards , fta cannot evaluate the overall quality of the program nor ensure the results and objectives of the triennial review program are being met . performance measures related to quality could assess the implementation of triennial reviews , including a way to oversee contractors and test the overall quality of reviews . many federal agencies periodically review their programs to ensure they meet quality standards . fta officials recognize the benefits of such performance measures and plan to enhance its current measures and standards to assess the quality and value added of the triennial review program to help ensure that the results and objectives of the triennial review program are being met . balance . fta's triennial review program performance measures address only one of three governmentwide priorities and , therefore , are not balanced — an attribute that applies to the overall suite of measures , rather than the measures individually . balanced performance measures allow managers to understand what other triennial review aspects are working well and why . adding outcome and quality performance measures will help balance the existing timeliness measures and could allow managers to better set triennial review priorities by not overemphasizing one or two priorities at the expense of others . fta officials recognize current performance measures do not assess some aspects of the triennial review program and are undertaking efforts to enhance them . strong fta oversight of federal surface transportation grant programs helps ensure that grantees meet federal requirements , provide safe public transportation , and safeguard from misuse the billions of dollars that congress appropriated for surface transportation programs to help america recover from the economic downturn and the billions more that congress plans to reauthorize for surface transportation . fta's efforts over the past decade to improve the congressionally - mandated triennial review — the primary means for overseeing hundreds of grantees — have produced concrete results . for example , fta now regularly collects oversight data on grantees , issues the vast majority of triennial review reports within 30 days of the review ( a significant improvement since our last report in 1998 ) , and provides grantees with technical assistance to address problem areas . nonetheless , fta should undertake additional efforts to further improve the triennial review program .
