develop one . dhs agreed with our recommendation . in january 2009 , we recommended that the secretary of homeland security develop a strategic plan for the domestic part of the global nuclear detection strategy to help ensure the success of initiatives aimed at closing vulnerabilities in the united states.on , among other things , establishing time frames and costs for the areas dndo had identified â€” land border areas between ports of entry , aviation , and small maritime craft . dhs did not comment on this recommendation but noted that it aligned with dndo's past , present , and future actions . the status of these recommendations is discussed later in this testimony . we stated that this plan should focus as we will discuss today , dhs has made meaningful progress in deploying radiation detection equipment at u.s. border crossings and seaports ; however , as deployed portal monitors begin to reach the end of their expected service lives , dhs will soon need to make decisions about whether to refurbish or replace them . dhs has also made progress in developing key planning documents to guide the gnda . this testimony discusses: ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to complete the deployment of radiation detection equipment to scan all cargo and conveyances entering the united states at ports of entry , ( 2 ) observations from our past work that may help dhs as it considers options for deploying new technologies to refurbish or replace existing portal monitors when they reach the end of their expected service lives , and ( 3 ) our assessment of the extent to which dhs has addressed our prior recommendations . this testimony is primarily based on our prior work on federal efforts to detect and prevent the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials , issued from october 2002 through july 2011 . we have updated our prior work in this testimony to reflect dhs's continuing efforts to deploy radiation detection equipment . to do so , we met with dhs , dndo , and customs and border protection ( cbp ) officials and reviewed dhs documents including the gnda strategic plan , the 2011 gnda joint annual interagency review , and the gnda implementation plan issued in april 2012 . as part of our update , we asked for , and dhs provided , a classified briefing that compared the gnda capabilities with the expected capabilities of adversaries who may wish to smuggle nuclear material into the united states . details on the scope and methodology for our prior reviews are available in our published reports . we conducted this work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . in summary , over the past 10 years , dhs has made significant progress in deploying radiation detection equipment to scan for nuclear or radiological materials in nearly all trucks and containerized cargo coming into the united stated through seaports and border crossings . however , challenges remain for the agency in developing a similar scanning capability for railcars entering this country from canada and mexico , as well as for international air cargo and international commercial aviation .
