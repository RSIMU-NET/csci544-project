gao - 04-418t . washington , d.c.: january 28 , 2004 . these comments are reproduced in appendix iv . hhs also provided technical clarifications , which we incorporated where appropriate . hhs generally agreed with our findings and noted that the cfsr process has already focused national attention on child welfare reform , but because the cfsr is the first review of its kind , hhs is engaged in continuous monitoring and improvement of the process . however , in its technical comments , hhs commented that while it acknowledges that the cfsr is its top priority , it disagreed with our statement that hhs's focus rests exclusively on implementing the cfsr , stating that the administration for children and families ( acf ) also conducts other oversight efforts , such as title iv - e eligibility reviews and afcars assessments . while we acknowledged acf's other oversight activities in the background section of the report , this report focuses primarily on the cfsr and we reflected the comments that acf officials made throughout the course of our work that the cfsr was the primary tool for monitoring state performance and that it served as the umbrella for all monitoring activities undertaken by central and regional acf staff . hhs further noted in its technical comments that we were wrong to suggest that federal staff do not know how to monitor state pips or assess financial penalties . however , we do not report that acf is unsure of how to monitor pips or how to assess financial penalties — rather , we reported that acf regional staff have not received sufficient guidance on how to best monitor pips and that acf officials have not decided how or when to apply such penalties , even though two states to date have completed their initial pip implementation timeframe and all states reviewed thus far are engaged in pip development and implementation . with regard to our first recommendation , hhs acknowledged that several steps are under way to address necessary data improvements and said that states have begun to submit more accurate information in their afcars and ncands profiles , with hhs's assistance . hhs also commented that we failed to properly emphasize the states' responsibility to improve overall data quality . we believe that our report , as well as our previous report on child welfare data and states' information systems , addresses hhs's activities and the steps many states have taken to enhance their cfsr data . given that many states have developed independent data collection tools — and included findings from these instruments in their statewide assessments — our recommendation is meant to encourage hhs to work more closely with all states to supplement their afcars and ncands data in order to improve the determinations made about state performance . in addition , hhs commented that our report emphasized the limitations of the 50 case sample size without focusing on the expenses and the increased state and federal staff time that would likely be associated with efforts to increase the sample size .
