( see fig . va reported spending the remaining $2 billion on inpatient hospital services — which provide intensive treatment for patients admitted to hospitals for mental health conditions — and on residential and domiciliary services , which provide rehabilitation , treatment , and a range of other services in a structured living arrangement at a va facility . in fiscal year 2009 , va's spending on mental health services provided in va settings used primarily for mental health services varied across va's 21 networks , ranging from about $123 million in network 19 ( denver ) to about $297 million in network 16 ( jackson ) . ( see fig . across va's networks , outpatient services accounted for the largest percentage of each network's mental health spending in fiscal year 2009 , followed by inpatient hospital services , though specific spending amounts varied by each network . according to va officials , this variation may be caused , in part , by the number of inpatient mental health beds within a network . networks with more beds would likely have higher utilization of inpatient hospital mental health services , resulting in higher spending for mental health services . va officials told us that they do not have data to identify all the factors that account for the variations in spending for mental health services across networks . in addition to the $4.4 billion va reported spending in fiscal year 2009 for mental health services provided in va settings primarily used for mental health , va spent additional amounts for mental health services . specifically , va ( 1 ) paid non - va providers to provide mental health services in community settings ; ( 2 ) provided mental health services through va mental health providers in va settings not primarily used for providing mental health services , such as nursing homes and spinal cord injury clinics ; and ( 3 ) provided counseling services to address mental health issues through vet centers . however , va did not report this spending as mental health spending in its fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification or in any other publicly available report . va determines how much it spends for some of these mental health services . according to va officials , va spent about $269.4 million in fiscal year 2009 for the following mental health services: va spent about $137.4 million for non - va providers — such as community - based hospitals and mental health professionals — to provide mental health services to patients . va spent about $132 million on outpatient mental health services provided by mental health providers in va settings not primarily used for providing mental health services . although va determines how much it spends for some of its mental health services , it did not report fiscal year 2009 spending for these mental health services as mental health spending in its fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification or in any other publicly available report . instead , according to va officials , va includes this spending as part of broader categories of spending when reporting information in congressional budget justifications . see appendix i for a complete description of our scope and methodology .
