fig . refuge managers also reported that 11 percent to 18 percent of habitats on refuges for key species have worsened since 2002 . camas nwr in idaho , for example , has faced a drought for the last several years . according to the refuge manager , the lack of water has negatively impacted a riparian zone of cottonwoods and willows that migrating birds , such as yellow warblers , use during migration . in addition , many of the trees in the riparian area are close to 100 years old and are dying . we also conducted reliability assessments of the data we obtained electronically and determined those data to be of sufficient quality to be used for the purposes of this report . during our site visits to wildlife refuges , during our interviews with refuge managers , and in written responses to our survey questions , refuge managers asserted that staff reductions threaten the quality of wildlife habitat . to test these assertions , we developed statistical models that assess whether staffing change is associated with changes in habitat quality . in particular , our models assess whether refuges where staff spent decreased time on habitat management activities between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 were more likely than other refuges to report that habitat conditions worsened rather than improved . in assessing this likelihood , our models account for refuge characteristics other than change in staff time that might impact habitat conditions , including tier designation , which indicates relative importance of a refuge compared to other refuges , and the change in external factors , such as extreme weather and off - refuge agriculture , that contribute to habitat problems . the results of our models show that habitat was more likely to worsen , rather than to improve , at refuges where staff time decreased between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 compared to those where staff time increased , even after adjusting for these other characteristics . our analysis assesses the change in the quality of waterfowl and other migratory bird habitat as a function of three key refuge characteristics: ( 1 ) the change in staff time spent on habitat management , ( 2 ) tier designation , and ( 3 ) the change in external factors that contribute to habitat problems . frequency counts for the key variables used in our analysis are presented in table 17 . to measure habitat change , we used responses to a question on our survey , which asked whether the overall quality of habitat on a refuge improved , stayed the same , or worsened between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 . the question was asked separately for both waterfowl and for other migratory birds , leading to two indicators of the change in habitat quality . we used these two indicators to develop separate statistical models for waterfowl and for other migratory birds .
