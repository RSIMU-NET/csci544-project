ii ) . he said that irs generally agreed with our findings and recommendations and that the ultimate determination of the benefit of using lockboxes to the taxpaying public requires information and analysis by both irs and fms . he said that irs would pursue a study with fms during fiscal year 1998 to reach a long - term decision about lockbox processing and that irs would welcome the opportunity to assist fms in analyzing the savings to the government attributable to the use of lockboxes to process form 1040 tax payments . the deputy commissioner also said that ( 1 ) it would be impossible to determine conclusively whether any savings from having taxpayers mail their returns and payments in separate envelopes outweighed the additional cost and other burden to taxpayers because “the perceived burden of this new way of paying and filing may involve intangibles which cannot be measured ( eg , a negative reaction to changes in procedures ) ” and ( 2 ) a broad - based study to determine taxpayers' perception of burden and their willingness to accept that burden would be necessary to satisfy our recommendation . scrips is one such system . irs uses scrips , which was implemented in 1994 , to process tax returns filed on form 1040ez , federal tax deposit ( ftd ) coupons , and information returns ( eg , forms 1099 ) . in january 1997 , we reported that one of the major problems with scrips was slow processing rates ( i.e. , the number of documents processed per hour ) . as the data in table 4 show , this problem intensified with respect to forms 1040ez and ftd coupons in 1997 . an irs official in the scrips project office attributed the decline in the processing rate for forms 1040ez , at least in part , to irs' decision , as discussed earlier , to issue telefile packages that did not have a form 1040ez . because the package contained no form that the taxpayer could use to file on paper , it also contained no preprinted label for the taxpayer to affix to a paper form . successful optical character recognition operations depend , in part , on the kind of clearly printed data provided by a label . we did not assess the validity of that estimate . another factor that contributed to the increase in the number of calls answered was irs' decision to assign more staff to answer the telephone . nationwide , according to data provided by irs' customer service function , irs dedicated 2,546 full - time - equivalent staff years to answer taxpayers' telephone calls between january 1 and april 30 , 1997 . this was an increase of 605 staff years over the 1,941 staff years dedicated during the same period in 1996 . in addition , some field offices , including the three service centers we visited , temporarily detailed staff to help answer the telephone , some of whom came from functions other than customer service . according to irs , some of these staff were used only as needed , while others were detailed for a few months .
