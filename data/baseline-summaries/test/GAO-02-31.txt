we disagree . throughout this review , we repeatedly asked the bureau for explanations and supporting documentation for the reasons for the cost increases . to the extent data and explanations were provided for the cost increases , we discussed them in this report . however , in many instances , particularly with respect to the 1990 census , the bureau was unable to provide us explanations or documentation at the activity and project level . our report clearly states that cost information provided by the bureau for the 1990 census was limited . third , the bureau pointed out that any analysis of cost increases must take into account the fact that the bureau was asked to develop , and to begin to implement , two different operational designs . our september 1999 reportprovided information on the supreme court decision that prohibited the bureau from carrying out its plans to use statistical methods . as mentioned in that report , the bureau did not begin detailed budgeting for a nonsampling - based census until after the supreme court ruling in january 1999 . our work associated with this review showed that the majority of the cost increases for the 2000 census were not in the planning of two operational designs but in the execution of the traditional census . specifically , we found no evidence that the bureau's planning for a “dual - track” census was a significant driver of cost increases of the 2000 census compared to the 1990 census . finally , the bureau noted that it was not appropriate to discuss the cost increases without acknowledging the substantial achievement in developing and implementing extensive new census operations . as stated previously , the objectives of this review did not include evaluating the quality of new programs implemented as part of census 2000 . throughout the report , we mentioned several important innovations to the census process and related costs , including expanded partnership agreements , the new construction program , the availability of the census questionnaire in multiple languages , and expanded mass media efforts including the first - ever paid advertising campaign . also , we have a separate effort under way to analyze variances from the bureau's fiscal year 2000 budget and the reasons that certain obligations and expenditures were different than planned . the complete text of the response to our draft report from the department of commerce , u.s. census bureau , is presented in appendix ii . we are sending copies of this report to the chairman and ranking minority member , senate committee on governmental affairs , and the chairman and ranking minority member , house committee on government reform and oversight . we are also sending copies to the acting director of the u.s. census bureau , the secretary of commerce , the director of the office of management and budget , the secretary of the treasury , and other interested parties . this report will also be available on gao's home page at http: / / www.gao.gov .
