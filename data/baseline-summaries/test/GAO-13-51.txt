this is known as a sensitivity analysis . such an analysis helps decision makers identify areas that could significantly affect a program's cost , such as changes in program quantities . according to air force officials , the service may choose to upgrade and extend the service life of additional aircraft if there are further delays in f - 35 production . for example , in a written statement , air force leaders testified in march 2012 that the intent is to include 350 f - 16 aircraft in the upgrade and life extension programs — 50 more aircraft than originally planned . air force officials explained that they did not assess the range of costs that may result from expanding the number of aircraft in the program up to the maximum of 650 since the program is currently approved for only 300 aircraft . however , without an assessment of how much the total cost may increase as the aircraft quantity increases , the estimate lacks transparency on the full range of possible costs , which could be significant . for example , we calculated that the cost to upgrade and extend the service life of all 650 aircraft could total $5.53 billion . the second major shortcoming is that the air force did not compare the estimates to independently developed cost estimates . see appendix i for a complete description of our scope and methodology . we conducted this performance audit from may 2011 to november 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . the air force and the navy plan to replace many of their current fighter aircraft with the joint strike fighter , also called the f - 35 . dod plans to buy a total of 2,443 f - 35s — 1,763 for the air force and 680 for the department of the navy — between 2008 and 2037 . however , we have reported on f - 35 issues since 2005 and found that the f - 35 is still in development and the program has experienced significant delays and cost increases . for example , we reported that the f - 35 program has experienced numerous delays in development and production , including program restructuring , which has increased time for development . further , we reported that the f - 35 program costs have increased 42 percent from the 2007 baseline and unit costs have doubled since the start of development in 2001 . in addition , the dod fiscal year 2011 annual report on operational test and evaluation stated that the f - 35 is not on track to meet operational effectiveness or operational suitability requirements and that testing identified structural and maintenance issues.first few production lots will need a significant number of modifications and upgrades in order to attain planned service life and capabilities .
