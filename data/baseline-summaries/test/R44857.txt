reserved for use in only the most 'extraordinary circumstances.' such circumstances , according to sessions , require the attorney general to determine that "'the public interest would be served by removing a large degree of responsibility for the matter from the department of justice.' instead , the attorney general indicated that doj's inspector general has been tasked with reviewing the actions that the members had suggested be the subject of the second special counsel inquiry , including allegations about doj's compliance with legal requirements and internal policies . instead , the attorney general announced that he had tasked john w. huber , u.s. attorney for the district of utah , to lead the investigation into those allegations , emphasizing that huber would be working "from outside the washington , d.c. area and in cooperation with the inspector general. designing a mechanism to provide for criminal inquiries of executive branch officials by officers independent from the executive branch has raised questions about whether this goal can be accomplished in harmony with the requirements of the constitution . under the doctrine of separation of powers , the constitution assigns each branch of government particular functions that generally may not be delegated to , nor usurped by , another branch . in this vein , congress is entrusted with the legislative power , and may establish executive branch agencies and conduct oversight of those entities . congress may not , however , engage in criminal prosecutions on behalf of the united states â€” a function generally reserved for the executive branch . a crucial bulwark in preserving this separation of powers is the appointments clause of article ii . that provision requires "officers of the united states" to be appointed by the president "with the advice and consent of the senate," although congress may vest the appointment of "inferior" officers "in the president alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments. crucially , article ii also empowers the president to hold executive branch officers accountable , through removal if necessary , which the supreme court in myers v. united states explained was essential in order to "maintain administrative control of those executing the laws. the court has , however , recognized that congress may in certain situations restrict the president's power of removal over certain discrete offices . the powers of appointment and removal are key to understanding congress's authority to create independent investigative offices and define their contours . both congress and the executive branch have employed a variety of means to establish independence for certain criminal investigations and prosecutions . the use of special prosecutors , independent counsels , and special counsels all have allowed for the investigation of executive branch misconduct . nonetheless , efforts to provide independence for prosecutors from executive branch control often raise constitutional questions . in turn , proposals to statutorily protect a special counsel from removal thus raise important , but unresolved , constitutional questions about the separation of powers . as a general matter , simply insulating a future special counsel from removal except for specified reasons appears consistent with the court's opinion in morrison .
