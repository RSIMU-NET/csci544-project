none were enacted . 1265 and s. 506 defined the excluded category of "tax planning invention[s]" to mean "a plan , strategy , technique , scheme , process , or system that is designed to reduce , minimize , determine , avoid , or defer , or has , when implemented , the effect of reducing , minimizing , determining , avoiding , or deferring , a taxpayer's tax liability or is designed to facilitate compliance with tax laws , but does not include tax preparation software and other tools or systems used solely to prepare tax or information returns.... " h.r . 2584 would have prevented any patent claiming a "tax planning method," which is defined similarly . the legislation would have applied to any application filed at the uspto on or after the date of enactment . other legislative responses are also possible . in furtherance of its oversight over the uspto , congress could continue to track that agency's activities with respect to tax strategy patents . in this vein , commentators have proposed several reforms , including uspto hiring of examiners with expertise in taxation and related disciplines . congress could also encourage continued cooperation between the uspto and the irs with respect to tax strategy patents . congress may also wish to promote the engagement of the community of tax professionals with the patent system . the patent laws allow members of the public both to comment upon many pending patent applications and to challenge issued patents through administrative proceedings . the voluntary contributions of knowledgeable specialists , through these and other mechanisms , may help promote a high level of quality of issued tax strategy patents . tax strategies represent the latest area of controversy regarding patentable subject matter . other sorts of inventions , such as business methods , biotechnologies , and computer software , have also raised considerable legal and policy questions when they were initially brought before the patent system . some observers believe that patents on these and other innovations have been allowed for many years , without any evidence of harm to the u.s. innovation environment . others contend that the affirmative case for granting patents on business methods remains weak , and that patents on tax strategies present uniquely deleterious social consequences . although proposed legislative responses to the phenomenon of tax strategy patents have thus far been limited to those instruments , this episode might also promote broader congressional thinking of the sorts of inventions that may be appropriately patented . this report concludes with a summary of congressional issues and options . although business method patents have been held to be patentable at least since the issuance of the state street bank opinion in 1998 , the more recent phenomenon of tax strategy patents has resulted in a spirited discussion . some commentators , and in particular tax professionals , have found tax strategy patents to be "ridiculous," "bizarre" and "deeply unsettling. on the other hand , other observers , including many patent professionals , believe both that concerns over tax patents are overstated , and that the patenting of tax strategies may lead to numerous positive consequences . this report next reviews some of the competing concerns about tax strategy patents .
