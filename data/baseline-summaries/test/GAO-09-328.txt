omb circular no . a - 127 , revised in january 2009 , requires agencies to registe approved exceptions to the standard configuration to meet their needs . according to omb officials , omb's priority is to focus on governmentwide standard business processes that generally affect all agencies . iii ) . in its comments , omb generally agreed with our recommendation to facilitate complete and accurate reporting of actual and planned spending related to financial management system modernization projects and described actions being taken to address this recommendation . omb also provided technical comments on a draft of this report that we incorporated as appropriate . in its comments , omb expressed concern with part of our recommendation directed at better capturing cost information specifically related to the financial portion of mixed systems and stated that it is evaluating the need for such information . according to omb , its preliminary analysis shows that breakouts of this cost data would have limited value for decision making because such a distinction is highly subjective and would not likely change agencies' investment decisions . omb did not provide the preliminary analysis for our review . omb believes it would be more cost - effective to focus its resources on other , higher risk areas , such as finalizing the concept of operations . however , as discussed in our report , the resources devoted to the financial portion of mixed systems are significant and , although determining the amount of such resources may be subjective , we believe more effective omb guidance and oversight could further improve the accuracy , consistency , and usefulness of such information . the implementation of mixed system projects is critical because these systems provide input to the core financial system and in some cases are the sole source of data needed by management to make informed decisions . omb needs such cost information to effectively evaluate the risks associated with financial management system modernization projects , including mixed systems , thus ensuring that its oversight efforts are properly aligned to focus on those projects needing increased attention . we are sending copies of this report to the ranking member , subcommittee on federal financial management , government information , federal services , and international security , senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs , and the chairman and ranking member , subcommittee on government management , organization , and procurement , house committee on oversight and government reform . we are also sending copies to the director of omb and director of fsio . in addition , this report will be available at no charge on the gao web site at http: / / www.gao.gov . if you or your staff have any questions about this report , please contact kay daly , director , financial management and assurance , who may be reached at ( 202 ) 512-9095 or dalykl@gao.gov , or naba barkakati , chief technologist , applied research and methods , who may be reached at ( 202 ) 512-2700 or barkakatin@gao.gov . contact points for our offices of congressional relations and public affairs may be found on the last page of this report . gao staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix iv .
