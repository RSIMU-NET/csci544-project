morgan & co . prior to glass - steagall's enactment , j.p. morgan was a prestigious financial conglomerate that successfully engaged in both commercial banking and securities activities . in response to the glass - steagall act , j.p. morgan & co. was forced to split into two distinct firms with separate boards , directors , officers , and management . john pierpont morgan , jr. headed the commercial banking business , which took his name , while other partners and employees from the old firm established a separate securities firm called morgan stanley . in lay language , the investment bank , morgan stanley , was separated from the commercial bank , jpmorgan . equally important to this discussion is what the glass - steagall act and complementary securities laws did not do . while the glass - steagall act generally prohibited depository banks from competing in securities markets as broker - dealers and underwriters , the only activities - based restriction on securities firms and their employees contained in the glass - steagall act and the complementary securities laws relevant to this discussion was the prohibition on accepting deposits . these laws did not prohibit securities market professionals from using securities markets to fund private debt in competition with , or even in conjunction with , commercial banks . thus , for example , during the glass - steagall era , commercial entities and individual consumers were free to borrow through either securities markets or the commercial banking market . commercial and consumer borrowers could get a loan: 1. exclusively through the commercial banking market , where the loan was originated and held for its full term by a depository bank ( an originate - to - hold business model ) ; 2. exclusively through the securities markets , where the loan was originated by a nonbank and then sold to a trust , insurance company , or some other nonbank firm ( an originate - to - distribute model ) ; or 3. through a combination of both , where the loan was originated by a depository institution and then sold to a nonbank ( another originate - to - distribute model ) . in other words , while j.p. morgan & co. could not conduct all of the same activities after glass - steagall as before its enactment within a single , affiliated financial conglomerate , the glass - steagall act did not prohibit all of the very same activities ( in type and volume ) from entering the marketplace through the combined efforts of the unaffiliated jpmorgan ( commercial bank ) and morgan stanley ( investment bank ) . although glass - steagall limited the scope of the activities of jpmorgan the commercial bank , it had much less to do with the size or scale of the bank going forward . for example , although the firm that morgan built was broken in two in reaction to the glass - steagall act , the act itself was not designed to cap the size of commercial or investment banks or to break up these banks with the intent of eliminating the risk that they would become "too - big - to - fail.
