chairmen , this concludes my remarks . as i noted earlier , the more detailed findings and conclusions of our review of minority cdes' participation in the new markets tax credit program can be found in our recently issued report ( gao - 09-536 ) . i would be happy to answer any questions you or other members of the subcommittees may have . for further information on this testimony , please contact michael brostek at ( 202 ) 512-9110 or brostkem@gao.gov . the report includes a detailed description of our scope and methodology . we conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . as of the time of this hearing , the cdfi fund in the department of the treasury has authorized $21 billion of the $26 billion in tax credit authority to be awarded between 2001 and 2009 to cdes that manage nmtc investments in low - income community development projects . eligible organizations may apply for and receive nmtc allocations once they have been certified as a cde by the cdfi fund ( a cde that receives an allocation is often referred to as an allocatee ) . the cdfi fund's process for making nmtc awards takes place in two phases . nmtc applications are first reviewed and scored by a group of external reviewers selected by the cdfi fund who have demonstrated experience in business , real estate , or community development finance . cdes that meet or exceed minimum thresholds in each of the four main application sections ( business strategy , community impact , management capacity , and capitalization strategy ) and an overall scoring threshold ( out of a total of 25 points in each application section ) advance to the second phase where they are re - ranked based on their scores in the business strategy and community impact sections of the application and half of the priority points awarded to cdes that demonstrate a track record of investing in low - income communities and investing in unrelated entities . cdfi fund staff review the amount of allocation authority that the cde requested and , based on the information in the application materials , award allocation amounts in the descending order of cdes' final ranking based on their re - ranked scores . according to our analysis of nmtc application data , of the 88 applications submitted by minority cdes , 31 applications met the minimum threshold scores to advance to the second phase of the ntmc review process from 2005 to 2008 . by comparison , during this same time period 518 of the 846 applications submitted by non - minority cdes met the minimum thresholds to advance to the second phase of the review process . the cdes , in turn , are required to invest “substantially all” of the proceeds they receive into qualified low - income community investments ( qlici ) . qualified low - income community investments include ( but are not limited to ) investments in businesses , referred to as qualified active low - income community businesses ( qalicb ) , to be used for residential , commercial and industrial projects , and other types of investments , such as purchasing loans from other cdes .
