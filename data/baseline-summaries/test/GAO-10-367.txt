vendors do not compete against each other to receive mas contracts . instead , gsa evaluates a vendor's offer under a multiple award schedule solicitation by comparing the terms and conditions of the mas contract solicitation to the terms and conditions of the vendor's agreements with its commercial customers , taking into account factors such as prices and discounts offered to the vendor's commercial customers , sales volume , and contract length , in order to establish price negotiation objectives . additional information on the mas contract award process is available in appendix ii . the negotiation objective described above , which calls for comparing prices and discounts that a vendor offers the government with the prices and discounts that a vendor offers its similarly situated commercial customers , is done as part of gsa's goal to receive “most favored customer” pricing for mas contracts . when trying to achieve this negotiation objective , gsa seeks to obtain the best price a vendor provides its most favored customer while recognizing that there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved given that terms and conditions of commercial sales vary . for example , a vendor may incur more expenses selling to the government than to a customer who receives the vendor's best prices , which could justify a smaller price discount for the government . in its comments on a draft of this report , omb agreed with our assessment that interagency and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to the government by leveraging the government's buying power and maximizing efficiencies in the procurement process . most favored customer pricing is one of the two key regulatory provisions that gsa has established in its acquisition regulations that work together to obtain the best prices throughout the life of mas contracts . the second pricing provision is the inclusion of a price reduction clause in mas contracts . this provision provides price protection for the government following contract award if a vendor lowers its prices to commercial customers during the contract period . in written comments on a draft of this report , gsa stated that it agreed with our findings and recommendations pertaining to gsa and agreed to make additional efforts to improve mas program pricing and management . gsa also stated that it plans to brief the administrator of the ofpp on its plans to implement the recommendations . in addition , gsa noted the key role that competition plays in helping agencies achieve the best value through the mas program . specifically , gsa stated that the pre - award audit cost avoidance amounts identified by the gsa ig do not account for additional price reductions that might be realized from other regulatory procedures in the far that call for users of the mas program to seek competition and additional price reductions on mas orders . as noted in our report , the pre - award amounts reflect cost avoidance in the negotiated contract - level prices for mas contracts as opposed to order - level prices , which gsa acknowledges are challenging to collect information on .
