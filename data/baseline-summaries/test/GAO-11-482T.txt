financial resource constraints . many member states did not pay their full share of support to the tcf but nevertheless received tc assistance , while some high - income countries also received support from the tc program . the tcf experienced a shortfall in 2007 of $3.5 million , or 4 percent , of the $80 million total target budget because 62 member states did not pay their full contributions , including 47 countries that made no payment at all . in addition , in 2007 , 13 member states that the un defined as high - income received a total of $3.8 million in assistance from the program , or 4 percent of the total tc disbursements that year . while iaea officials told us it would be helpful if more developed countries shifted from tc recipients to donors , iaea had not developed a policy or criteria for determining when such countries should be graduated from assistance . tc project and program sustainability challenges . iaea did not systematically review completed tc projects to determine or verify whether the host country is sustaining project activities and results . in addition , the tc program overall faced sustainability challenges because program funding was distributed across 18 different technical areas , making it difficult for iaea to set clear program priorities and to maximize the impact of limited tc program resources . finally , iaea had developed outreach strategies to engage new potential partners and donors — primarily from international development organizations — to help sustain the tc program . however , this effort faced several limitations and shortcomings , including a focus on attracting tc program donors and partners in the economic and social development communities — rather than private sector partnerships — and failure to evaluate long - term commercial potential of tc projects . based on our findings , we asked congress to consider directing state to withhold a proportionate share of future u.s. voluntary contributions to the tc program that is equivalent to the amounts of tcf funding that would otherwise be made available to u.s. - designated state sponsors of terrorism and other countries of concern , as it currently does with cuba and has done in the past with iran , libya , and the territories under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority . alternatively , we noted that if congress wishes to obtain additional information before making this decision , it could require state to report to congress explaining its rationale for not withholding a proportionate share of the u.s. contribution to the tcf for u.s. - designated state sponsors of terrorism . in addition , we recommended that the secretary of state , working with iaea and member states through the board of governors , explore undertaking the following eight actions to address the range of proliferation and management concerns related to the tc program: establish a formal mechanism to facilitate greater and more timely information sharing on tc project proposals between iaea and the united states and other countries — including detailed information on the tc proposals themselves , as well as the results of iaea's internal proliferation reviews of the proposals — so that proliferation and other concerns can be identified and addressed early in the project development cycle .
