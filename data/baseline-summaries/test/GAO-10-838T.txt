● electronic records are complex . electronic records have evolved from simple text - based files to complex digital objects that may contain embedded images ( still and moving ) , sounds , hyperlinks , or spreadsheets with computational formulas . some portions of electronic records , such as the content of dynamic web pages , are created on the fly from databases and exist only during the viewing session . others , such as e - mail , may contain multiple attachments , and they may be threaded ( that is , related e - mail messages are linked into send – reply chains ) . in the centralized environment of a mainframe computer , it is comparatively simple to identify , assess , and manage electronic records . however , in the decentralized environment of agencies' office automation systems , every user can create electronic files of generally unstructured data that may be formal records and thus should be managed . documents can be created on individuals' desktop computers and stored on local hard drives . e - mail can come from outside the agency . in cases like these , the agency generally depends on the individual to identify the document or the e - mail as a record , and , through placing it in a recordkeeping system , associate it with its appropriate schedule , make it searchable and retrievable , and preserve it until it is due for disposal . as we reported in 2008 , e - mail is especially problematic . e - mail embodies several major challenges to records management: ● it is unstructured data , and it can be about anything , or about several subjects in the same message , making it difficult to classify by content . ● there is a very large volume of it: one study estimates that a typical corporate user sends or receives around 110 messages a day . further , there may be many copies of the same e - mail , which can increase storage requirements or require a means of determining which copy to keep . keeping large numbers of messages potentially increases the time , effort , and expense needed to search for information in response to a business need or an outside inquiry , such as a freedom of information act request . ● it is complex: e - mail records may have multiple attachments in a variety of formats , they may include formatting that is important for meaning , and they include information about senders , recipients , and time of sending . recordkeeping systems must be able to capture all this information and must maintain the association between the e - mail and its attachment ( s ) . ● its relevance depends on context . it may be part of a message thread that is necessary to understand its content , or it may discuss other documents or issues that are not well identified . an e - mail that says “i agree . let's do it” may be about a major decision or about going to lunch next week . ● it may not be obvious who is responsible for identifying an e - mail as a record and at what point .
