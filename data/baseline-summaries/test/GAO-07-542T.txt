statement of social insurance . the statement of social insurance in the financial report displays the present value of projected revenues and expenditures for scheduled benefits of certain benefit programs that are referred to as social insurance ( eg , social security , medicare ) . for social security and medicare alone , projected expenditures for scheduled benefits for the next 75 years exceed earmarked revenues ( eg , dedicated payroll taxes , premiums , and existing government bonds in the trust funds ) for the same period by approximately $39 trillion in present value terms . stated differently , one would need approximately $39 trillion invested today to deliver on the currently promised benefits for the next 75 years . what kind of information is most relevant and useful for a sovereign nation ? do traditional financial statements convey information in a transparent manner ? what is the role of the balance sheet in the federal government reporting model ? how should items that are unique to the federal government , such as social insurance commitments and the power to tax , be reported ? engaging in a reevaluation of this nature could stimulate discussion that would bring about a new way of thinking about the federal government's financial and performance reporting needs . to understand various perceptions and needs of stakeholders for federal financial reporting , a wide variety of stakeholders from the public and private sector should be consulted . ultimately , the goal of such a reevaluation would be reporting enhancements that can help the congress deliberate strategies to address the federal government's challenges , including those of our growing long - term fiscal imbalance . more specifically , we continue to support several specific improvements to federal financial reporting . for example , the federal government's financial reporting should be expanded to disclose the reasons for significant changes during the year in scheduled social insurance benefits and funding . it should also include a statement of fiscal sustainability — providing a long - term look at the sustainability of current federal fiscal policy in the context of all major federal spending programs and tax policies . the reporting on fiscal sustainability should include additional information that will assist in understanding the sustainability of current social insurance and other federal programs , including key measures of fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity , projected annual cash flows , and changes in fiscal sustainability during the reporting period . we believe that such reporting needs to reflect the significant commitments associated with the social security and medicare programs while recognizing a liability for the net assets ( principally investments in special u.s. treasury securities ) of the “trust funds.” we support the current efforts of the federal accounting standards advisory board ( fasab ) to begin a project on fiscal sustainability reporting . in addition , an easily understandable summary annual report should be prepared and published that includes in a clear , concise , and transparent manner , key financial and performance information embodied in the financial report . later in this statement , i offer other suggestions for improved reporting that will help in this regard .
