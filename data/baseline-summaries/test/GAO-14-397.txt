i&a is an element of the intelligence community . according to its february 2011 strategic plan , i&a's mission is to equip the homeland security enterprise with the intelligence and information it needs to keep the homeland safe , secure , and resilient . to carry out its mission , i&a is to ensure that information related to homeland security threats is collected , analyzed , and disseminated to homeland security partners to keep the homeland safe , secure , and resilient . i&a prepares written , finished analytical products that it makes available to its customers . in addition to written analytical reports , i&a provides intelligence analysis to its customers through oral briefings ( both classified and unclassified ) and other analytic services , such as access to i&a analysts for review of the customers' intelligence products , and advice and instruction on tradecraft standards.provides services to state , local , tribal , and territorial partners , as well as the private sector , through deployed personnel at fusion centers . what challenges does i&a face in maintaining a skilled analytic workforce and what steps has it taken to address these challenges ? for all objectives , we focused on the six dhs entities in the enterprise for which intelligence analysis is a core function in supporting their unique missions and operations: i&a , the u.s. coast guard , transportation security administration ( tsa ) , u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , and u.s . citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) . subject to departmental direction , and consistent with any direction and guidance from the president and , as applicable , by the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) , the head of each dhs intelligence component is responsible for , among other things , ensuring the effective and efficient collection , processing , analysis , and dissemination of intelligence information , and supporting and implementing the intelligence mission of the department.products generated by each entity . see appendix ii for a description of the intelligence to address the first objective , we analyzed dhs and i&a documents intended to set strategic departmental intelligence priorities — such as the fiscal years 2011 through 2014 dhs intelligence enterprise program of analysis ( poa ) and the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 homeland security intelligence priorities framework ( the framework ) — to determine how strategic intelligence priorities are established and how the enterprise is to follow them . we also analyzed component documents — such as tsa's mission and functional statement and ice's intelligence fact sheet on securing borders , safe travel , and legal trade — to help determine to what extent components address departmental priorities . we met with officials responsible for managing the enterprise to determine expectations for components in following the priorities , and with officials from i&a and the intelligence offices of cbp , the u.s. coast guard , ice , tsa , and uscis to obtain views on the extent to which the poa and framework guide their analytic production .
