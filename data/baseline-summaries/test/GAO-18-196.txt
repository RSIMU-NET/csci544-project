, and environment . hhs stated that: in january 2017 , acf clarified in guidance several of the issues raised in the report , including the population of infants and families covered by the provision and the state flexibility inherent in determining which infants are “affected by” substance abuse , and the terminology used in the federal law of what a “plan of safe care” is ; acf believes it is necessary to allow states the flexibility to meet the requirements in the context of their state cps program ; several of the challenges that the gao notes are not specific to capta compliance with the safe care plan and notification requirements ; and it does see the value in continuing to provide technical assistance to states to address known challenges and to enhance their understanding of capta requirements . with respect to hhs' january 2017 guidance , state officials reported in our survey and during site visits that they found some terms unclear and were uncertain about what is required of them . in written responses to our survey , states reported challenges understanding how to define substance - affected under capta . in addition , as we note in our report , the guidance about plans of safe care described the following: “while capta does not specifically define a ‘plan of safe care,' cara amended the capta state plan requirement . to require that a plan of safe care address the health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver.” states reported in our survey and in follow - up discussions that this lack of specificity remained an ongoing challenge for them . for example , as we discuss in our report , one state that we followed up with in august 2017 was still unsure about whether its safety plans would meet capta requirements for plans of safe care . in addition , as of october 2017 , hhs confirmed that some state plans did not meet capta requirements and that the states were asked to develop program improvement plans . accordingly , a key ongoing challenge was not addressed by the january guidance . regarding allowing states flexibility to meet capta requirements , we acknowledge in our report that hhs said that states have flexibility . medications can include fentanyl and oxycodone . women under the care of a physician and undergoing treatment for an opioid use disorder with medications , such as methadone or buprenorphine . this type of treatment is generally referred to as medication - assisted treatment ( mat ) . women misusing opioid pain medications with or without a prescription ( such as using without a prescription , using a different dosage than prescribed , or continuing to use a drug when no longer needed for pain ) . women using or abusing illicit opioid , such as heroin . in response to our survey , 42 states reported that state policies and procedures require health care providers to notify cps about substance - affected infants . some states reported that they explicitly require health care providers to notify cps of substance - affected infants .
