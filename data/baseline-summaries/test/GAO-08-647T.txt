my remarks today are based on this report . specifically , i will ( 1 ) identify workforce challenges that va medical facilities experience related to va crnas , and ( 2 ) identify a key mechanism that va medical facilities have to help make va crna salaries competitive for recruitment and retention purposes and the extent to which va facilities use this mechanism . to do the work for our december 2007 report , we analyzed web - based surveys we sent to all va chief anesthesiologists , va human resources ( hr ) officers , and va crnas , with survey response rates of 92 , 85 , and 76 percent , respectively . we also analyzed data on va crna vacancies — the number of unfilled va crna positions at va medical facilities — obtained from va headquarters . these data were from 2005 , the most recent year for which vacancy data were available at the time of our review . additionally , we obtained data on va crnas' salaries for 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 and compared these to national salary data we obtained from the american association of nurse anesthetists ( aana ) , a professional organization for crnas . we visited eight va medical facilities and interviewed chief anesthesiologists , va crnas , hr officers , and other facility officials about their efforts to recruit and retain va crnas . we also interviewed a representative from kaiser permanente , a large health care plan that primarily uses crnas to deliver anesthesia services , to identify what steps this plan takes to ensure it has a sufficient number of crnas and to determine the indicators this plan uses to identify a crna shortage or potential future crna shortage . based on our survey results , we also found that in addition to their current recruiting challenges , va medical facilities would likely face a challenge retaining va crnas in the next 5 years due to the number of va crnas projected to either retire from or leave va. va medical facility officials reported in our survey that the recruitment and retention challenges were caused primarily by the low level of va crna salaries when compared with crna salaries in local market areas . in december 2007 we also reported that va's locality pay system ( lps ) is a key mechanism that va medical facilities can use to determine whether to adjust va crna salaries to help the facilities remain competitive with crna salaries in local market areas . we reported that the majority of va medical facilities that employ va crnas used lps . however , at the eight va medical facilities we visited , we found that although the facilities used va's lps , five of these facilities did not fully follow va's lps policy correctly in either 2005 or 2006 . the problems some va medical facilities had fully following va's lps policy , along with the explanations of facility officials , indicated that va had not provided adequate training on its lps policy . as a result , va medical facility officials cannot ensure that va crna salaries have been adjusted as needed to be competitive in local market areas .
