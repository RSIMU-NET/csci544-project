gao - 07-892 . washington , d.c.: july 23 , 2007 . ( see fig . after resuming screening examinations in december 2005 and conducting them for about a year , hhs again placed the program on hold and suspended scheduling of screening examinations for responders from january 2007 to may 2007 . this interruption in service occurred because there was a change in the administration of the wtc federal responder screening program , and certain interagency agreements were not established in time to keep the program fully operational . in late december 2006 , aspr and niosh signed an interagency agreement giving niosh $2.1 million to administer the wtc federal responder screening program . subsequently , niosh and foh needed to sign a new interagency agreement to allow foh to continue to be reimbursed for providing screening examinations . it took several months for the agreement between niosh and foh to be negotiated and approved , and scheduling of screening examinations did not resume until may 2007 . second , the program's provision of specialty diagnostic services has also been intermittent . after initial screening examinations , responders often need further diagnostic services by ear , nose , and throat doctors ; cardiologists ; and pulmonologists ; and foh had been referring responders to these specialists and paying for the services . however , the program stopped scheduling and paying for these specialty diagnostic services in april 2006 because the program's contract with a new provider network did not cover these services . in march 2007 , foh modified its contract with the provider network and resumed scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services for federal responders . in july 2007 we reported that niosh was considering expanding the wtc federal responder screening program to include monitoring examinations — follow - up physical and mental health examinations — and was assessing options for funding and delivering these services . if federal responders do not receive this type of monitoring , health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated , and knowledge of the health effects of the wtc disaster may be incomplete . in february 2007 , niosh sent a letter to fema , which provides the funding for the program , asking whether the funding could be used to support monitoring in addition to the onetime screening currently offered . a niosh official told us that as of august 2007 the agency had not received a response from fema . niosh officials told us that if fema did not agree to pay for monitoring of federal responders , niosh would consider using other funding . according to a niosh official , if fema or niosh agrees to pay for monitoring of federal responders , this service would be provided by foh or one of the other wtc health programs . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . initially , niosh made two efforts to provide screening and monitoring services for these responders , the exact number of which is unknown .
