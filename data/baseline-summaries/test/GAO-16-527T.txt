at the time , we did not make any recommendations on this issue . each of the services flies various types of uas . the air force flies the mq - 1 ( predator ) , the mq - 9 ( reaper ) , and the rq - 4 ( global hawk ) while the army flies the rq - 7 ( shadow ) , the mq - 5 ( hunter ) and the mq - 1c ( gray eagle ) . we found in our prior work that in recent years , the air force has not provided a sufficient number of uas pilots to meet requirements due to several factors including most notably the increase in demand for intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance . as a result , the uas workload has been performed by fewer pilots working more hours to accomplish the air force mission . in additional in our prior work , we found that the army has faced challenges ensuring that its pilots in uas units that are not deployed conduct unit training to prepare them to perform their missions . in april 2014 and may 2015 , we reported on these other issues and made ten recommendations to dod to improve the air force's management of uas pilots , address army uas pilot training challenges , and enhance dod coordination of uas pilot training . i will focus my remarks today on dod's progress in ( 1 ) taking actions to strengthen the management of air force uas pilots , ( 2 ) addressing challenges the army faces to ensure that its uas pilots complete their required training and receive high - quality training , and ( 3 ) coordinating the training of uas pilots within dod . my testimony is primarily based on reports we issued on uas personnel issues in may 2015 and april 2014 . however , as we found in may 2015 , without a dod - wide uas training strategy that addresses if and how the services should coordinate with one another on training uas pilots , the services may miss opportunities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of this training and may waste scarce funds on training uas pilots . we therefore recommended that the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness address how the services should coordinate with one another in the dod - wide uas training strategy the office was drafting at the time we issued our report , and dod concurred with this recommendation . in march 2016 , the director of force training in the office of the assistant secretary of defense ( readiness ) stated that dod had not yet published the dod - wide uas training strategy but the strategy was in the final drafting phase . he stated that his office held a summit in october 2015 with each of the services and during this summit representatives from each of the services discussed the draft strategy and how to incorporate our recommendation into the strategy . he stated that his office was collecting the services' comments on the draft strategy and would provide them to rand and that rand is currently revising the strategy .
