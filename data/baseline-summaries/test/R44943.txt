( b ) exception . - a claim for a useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any useful improvement thereof , may be denied eligibility under this section 101 on the ground that the scope of the exclusive rights under such a claim would preempt the use by others of all practical applications of a law of nature , natural phenomenon , or abstract idea . patent eligibility under this section shall not be negated when a practical application of a law of nature , natural phenomenon , or abstract idea is the subject matter of the claims upon consideration of those claims as a whole , whereby each and every limitation of the claims shall be fully considered and none ignored . eligibility under this section 101 shall not be negated based on considerations of patentability as defined in sections 102 , 103 and 112 , including whether the claims in whole or in part define an inventive concept . the aipla asserts that section 101 was intended to act as an "enabling provision" rather than "provide the standard for whether a particular technical advance should receive patent protection. similarly , the aba section on intellectual property asserts that recent supreme court decisions "have injected ambiguity into the eligibility determination by requiring courts and the [uspto] to apply criteria such as 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' factors that were previously relevant only to novelty and obviousness , in order to ignore limitations and render a claim patent ineligible and in effect have turned the gateway function of patent eligibility into a patentability test better left to the other statutory provisions.... " for its part , the ipo explains that the supreme court's analysis "is contrary to [c]ongressional intent , too restrictive , technologically incorrect , unsound from a policy standpoint , and bad law. not everyone agrees that legislative reform is necessary . one commentator finds no evidence that more restrictive patent eligibility rules "have affected innovation or investment in any meaningful way. in his view , the proposed amendments would "essentially do away with any limits to software patenting. another observer believes that these proposals would "eliminate any real constraint on subject matter eligibility. he also observes that the aipla proposal would also change the current statutory phrase "may obtain a patent subject to the conditions and requirements of this title" to "shall be entitled to a patent only subject to the conditions and requirements set forth in this title. in his view , this language would have the perhaps unintended effect of eliminating other common law patentability standards , including the so - called "obviousness - type double patenting" rule . patents in the fields of software and life sciences have proven controversial for decades . recent supreme court interest in the topic of patentable subject matter , which has made patenting in these fields more difficult , has led to a heated debate . many knowledgeable observers believe that section 101 helps ensure an appropriate balance between the innovative contributions of inventors and the scope of the rights that they receive . however , other experts express concern that the lack of availability of patent rights will decrease innovation and investment in the united states .
