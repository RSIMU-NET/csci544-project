technology . officials from this same association also noted that the costs of technology associated with remote patient monitoring may not be fully captured by cms's valuation methodology . for example , while wearable remote devices only monitor one patient at a time , wireless communication systems — with their hardware and software costs — that can be used to remotely monitor multiple patients at a time are not attributed to an individual patient when considering the direct practice expense inputs . therefore , this type of equipment is classified within the indirect cost category ( with overhead costs ) , resulting in lower payment rates than if these costs were considered direct costs , according to association officials . additionally , other unique costs for remote patient monitoring related to technology include such things as the cost of delivering the monitoring device to the patient and the cost of the patient returning the device after the monitoring period has ended . in addition , technology used to provide remote patient monitoring services can vary among service providers and is evolving , contributing to difficulties in developing valuation for the services . officials with a payer association said there is variation among the type of devices the patient or provider must possess or that must be installed in the patient's home to carry out remote patient monitoring , such as motion sensors to determine if a patient has fallen or the components that transmit biometric information such as blood pressure or weight back to the monitoring site . personnel . officials from an association representing certain providers of remote patient monitoring services told us that independent diagnostic testing facilities frequently perform remote patient monitoring services that include patient diagnostic testing , but some personnel costs may not be recognized in the medicare valuation methodology because these personnel are not considered clinical staff . for example , personnel involved in remote cardiac monitoring at independent diagnostic testing facilities include non - clinical administrative staff who the association officials noted are not adequately accounted for in the cms methodology . officials with a second provider association noted that remote patient monitoring technology continues to evolve , and for such newly - developed technology there is not a consensus in how to use and charge for the multiplicity of delivery models , including the range of services and procedures . hours of operation and location . some remote patient monitoring may require a monitoring facility to operate 24 hours a day , 7 days per week . an association representing certain providers of remote patient monitoring services noted that medicare's valuation methodology , which cms officials stated was designed for and primarily applies to services furnished in standard physician offices during business hours , may not fully incorporate costs associated with maintaining operations outside of standard business hours and in non - physician office settings , such as at independent diagnostic testing facilities or other types of remote monitoring centers . knowledgeable stakeholders .
