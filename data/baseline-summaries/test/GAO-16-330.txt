however , there is presently no specific requirement that they do so . to its credit , nrc has taken a number of corrective actions in response to our findings , including more training on prelicensing guidance to ensure that nrc and agreement state staff provide adequate scrutiny during prelicensing site visits . nrc has also formed working groups to consider enhancements to the prelicensing process . in addition , nrc recommended that we revise the first recommendation for clarity . we modified the language in this recommendation to provide greater clarity . nrc also provided technical comments that were incorporated , as appropriate . as agreed with your office , unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier , we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date . at that time , we will send copies of this report to the chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission , the appropriate congressional committees , and other interested parties . in each case , we took no actions to prepare the leased space for the site visit . according to nrc officials , while the nrc prelicensing checklist does not require that a site have implemented all the requirements that apply to licensees , its purpose , among other things , is to establish a basis for confidence that radioactive material will be used as specified on the license being sought , and we made no attempt to improve or outfit the site to make it appear as if a legitimate business was operating there . in our view , a prelicensing site visit , conducted with adequate scrutiny , would likely reveal that our fictitious companies were not suitable for a license . doing so would also enable lvs to query these systems and better enable transferors to verify the legitimacy of those seeking to purchase radioactive materials . as the results of our covert vulnerability testing show , it is possible for someone to obtain a license , which is printed on paper ; make alterations to this paper license ; and use the altered license for a category 3 source to acquire another category 3 source and thereby accumulate more dangerous , high - risk category 2 quantities . including category 3 quantities in nsts and wbl , and requiring transferors to verify the legitimacy of licenses of those seeking to purchase radioactive materials through lvs or with the appropriate regulatory body , would provide greater assurance that a bad actor could not manipulate the system by , for example , altering a paper license , to acquire radioactive materials in aggregate greater than what they are authorized to possess . moreover , nrc regulations governing the steps that transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive materials must take to verify that those wishing to take possession of the material are properly licensed to do so have not been updated since 1978 and may not be adequate to protect public health and safety . in contrast , nrc has taken several steps to update its licensing guidance by , among other things , directing regions and agreement states to conduct site visits for unknown applicants and suspending the good faith presumption , which fosters greater scrutiny of applicants .
