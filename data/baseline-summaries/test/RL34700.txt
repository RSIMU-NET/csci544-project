this report uses three . first , the report discusses how an interim cr's provisions and requirements may impact directly upon an agency , based on what an interim cr explicitly is formulated to do . second , the report analyzes office of management and budget ( omb ) and agency documents that have provided guidance or requirements for how an agency should navigate through periods of interim crs . the existence and emphases of such documents may suggest the occurrence , or at least the risk of occurrence , of interim cr - related impacts on the operations of agencies . third , the report analyzes brief mentions of claims of impact contained in government accountability office ( gao ) reports from a 20-year span , typically made by agency officials without independent gao validation . in addition , a gao report from 2009 provided the results of a case study , in which gao evaluated the effects of interim crs on six federal bureau - size agencies . the possibility that an interim cr might cause impacts may raise corresponding issues for congress . one issue relates to the fact that the president , omb , and agencies may play roles in the formulation , negotiation , and implementation of interim crs . an implication of this involvement is that congress typically does not solely determine what the impacts of an interim cr will be , because the president , omb , and agencies may influence the nature and extent of potential impacts . another issue relates to interim crs as a product of high - stakes negotiation over major issues of fiscal and substantive policy . claims about positive or negative impacts of crs may be used to argue that changes in cr language , budget priorities , or the budget process are necessary . the ways in which such claims are framed , however , typically rest on implicit assumptions about what would have happened in the absence of the interim cr ( eg , a government shutdown , on one hand , or agreement on final appropriations , on the other ) . viewing interim crs as a product of high - stakes negotiation helps explain why differing assumptions sometimes may be plausible . given the nature of budget deliberations and the potential for changes in the budget process to change power relationships among participants , the ways in which the impact of an interim cr may be framed might be viewed as similarly significant . the report's final section discusses these and other topics . full - year crs occur less frequently than interim crs . historically , the term "cr" has been used in different ways in the context of providing full - year appropriations amounts . in any case , full - year crs effectively become regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year , complete with the certainty of final funding decisions . for this reason , full - year crs generally are not discussed in this report . usage of the term "continuing resolution," like other budget terms , has varied sometimes to reflect evolving budget practices .
