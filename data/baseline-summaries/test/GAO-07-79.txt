( see app . ii for a timeline of key developments in the joint commission and jcr relationship. ) jcr also became the official publisher of the joint commission's accreditation manuals and support materials . jcr offers consulting services either independently to health care facilities or through a subscription - based service called the continuous service readiness ( csr ) program , which is typically offered in partnership with state hospital associations . the csr program provides ongoing technical assistance and education to subscribers through a variety of means , including meetings , e - mails , telephone calls , and conferences . in 2004 , we reported that cms's oversight of the joint commission hospital accreditation process is limited . although it conducts on - site validation surveys of a sample of joint commission - accredited hospitals , the agency cannot restrict or remove the joint commission's accreditation authority if it detects problems . cms reported that the agency and the joint commission engage in ongoing dialogue to identify potential hospital accreditation performance issues . in addition , cms provides an annual report of its findings to congress . unlike the joint commission , jcr is not subject to any oversight by cms . when developing policies regarding its relationship with jcr , the joint commission has been affected by the increased focus in both the public and private sectors on governance issues . the sarbanes - oxley act of 2002 , passed in response to corporate and accounting scandals , required publicly traded companies to follow new governance standards , including those designed to ensure auditors' independence from their clients . even though most provisions of the sarbanes - oxley act are not applicable to nonprofit organizations , activities that have occurred in the wake of the act have affected nonprofits . for example , several state legislatures are considering legislation that applies standards similar to the sarbanes - oxley requirements to nonprofit organizations . in addition , some nonprofit organizations , such as the joint commission , have voluntarily adopted policies and altered governance practices based upon the act . organizations in the public and private sectors have also begun to institute compliance programs and those that provide accreditation or certification services have developed standards to ensure the independence of these services . compliance programs for health care organizations — such as hospitals , home health agencies , and medical supply companies — have used provisions of the federal sentencing guidelines , developed in 1991 , as a program model . these guidelines lay out two common principles of adequate compliance programs — to prevent and detect criminal conduct , and to promote an organizational culture of ethics and compliance with the law . in 1998 , the hhs office of inspector general developed a model compliance program for hospitals . regarding independence standards , organizations that provide accreditation or certification , or recognize accreditation bodies , have begun to impose certain criteria to demonstrate independence .
