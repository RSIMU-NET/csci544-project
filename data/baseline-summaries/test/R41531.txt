where is the remaining oil and what is its physical and chemical state ? some data and ongoing studies offer some clues that could provide a partial and preliminary answer . one of the more comprehensive of these studies was released december 17 , 2010 , by the unified command's operational scientific advisory team ( osat ) . this report ( hereinafter referred to as the "osat report" ) provides results from samples collected from may through october 2010 in the gulf's nearshore , offshore , and deepwater areas . although the purpose of the sampling data was to provide responders with detailed information about the location of recoverable oil , the results ( discussed below ) offer further pieces of information concerning the oil's fate . a complete and definitive answer to the question of the remaining oil is unknown at this juncture . the most recent authoritative assessment — the november oil budget document — contained estimates based on calculations made in july 2010 . at the time of these calculations , a substantial portion of the oil had been effectively removed from the gulf environment through human interaction . a pressing question raised by many stakeholders is where did the oil go ? assessing the oil's fate is the primary objective of this report . for the purposes of this report , the term fate refers to the oil itself , not its actual or potential impacts on the gulf ecosystems or organisms . the impact of the 2010 gulf spill is still being assessed and will likely continue to be assessed for years to come . because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult , perceptions of the oil's fate may influence congressional interest and action , with consequences for the affected stakeholders . these perceptions may be influenced by multiple factors , including oil spill assessments and their methods , the group that prepared the assessment ( and perceived biases of the group ) , and the manner in which the assessment is presented . if policymakers have the perception that the oil has degraded with minimal impacts to the environment , attention to oil spill's consequences and associated impacts may wane . on the other hand , a perception that a substantial volume of oil remains and poses a threat to the environment could result in continuing pressure on gulf industries and livelihoods . the fate of the oil may be of interest to policymakers for other reasons , including oversight of oil spill response performance and assessment of the government's capability to monitor oil spills in the environment . multiple factors play a role in determining the fate of oil released into a marine environment . these include the chemical composition of the oil , a complex collection of natural processes and pathways , the location of the spill or discharge , and human intervention . on august 4 , 2010 , the national incident command ( the spill response leadership team of the federal government ) made public an estimate of the oil spill budget for the deepwater horizon incident .
