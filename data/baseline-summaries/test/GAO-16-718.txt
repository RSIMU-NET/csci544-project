( see app . ii for more detailed information about direct care workers' numbers , demographics , wages , and other characteristics. ) we were unable to identify federal data sources on workforce stability measures , which are often used for workforce planning . bls conducts the job openings and labor turnover survey , which provides data on job openings and separations for broad industries , such as all health care and social assistance establishments . however , due to the small sample size , this survey does not determine attrition for specific occupations , such as personal care aides . bls officials informed us that filling the data gaps of attrition rates at the occupational level would require major changes in their surveys and would be costly to implement . the four states we reviewed ( arkansas , maine , minnesota , and oregon ) each conducted one - time studies to obtain more detailed information about direct care workers who provide ltss in those states . three of the states ( arkansas , maine , and minnesota ) collected data on direct care workers in 2012 as part of a cms initiative called the national balancing indicators project ( nbip ) . the seven states that participated in the nbip collected data using two standardized surveys — one for employer organizations and one for independent providers — designed by cms's national direct service workforce resource center , in coordination with the participating states . the surveys were designed to collect data about the number of workers , their hours , worker compensation , and measures of workforce stability . each survey incorporated these required variables , and states included additional variables at their discretion . see table 1 . the fourth state we reviewed ( oregon ) collected data in 2014 on direct care worker compensation , attrition , and the relationship between workers' wages and medicaid payment rates over time . oregon's survey of medicaid - participating ltss providers also captured many of the same variables included in nbip's employer survey . both nbip's and oregon's surveys asked about direct care workers as a group as opposed to asking about each separate direct care worker occupation . the four states obtained data that federal sources have not , such as information describing the characteristics of independent providers and attrition rates . we obtained summary results from independent provider surveys for maine and minnesota , which showed that most responding independent providers worked for a family member , a neighbor , a friend , or someone else they knew . the data also showed large differences between the two states in the education , income levels , and hourly wages of independent providers . appendix iii provides more detailed information on the nbip and the survey results for independent providers . arkansas , maine , and oregon also surveyed employer organizations providing ltss to calculate attrition . the report provided a comprehensive assessment of data needed for program and policy development as well as the extent and limitations of available data , including eight federal data sets ; 45 state registries of certified nursing assistants ; and 4 states' data collection activities .
