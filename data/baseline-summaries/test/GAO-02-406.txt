education requested documentation from these schools . the department provided us with student transcripts and other data from less than half of the 700 schools . based on our review of the documentation we received , we identified 19 additional schools that disbursed pell grants to large numbers of students who were 70 years of age or older and whose course of study was mainly esl . these 19 schools made disbursements totaling about $573,000 to these students during the period of our review . we also identified 9 other schools , based solely on data from the pell grant system , that had similar disbursement patterns to those making the payments to ineligible students . these 9 schools did not provide supporting documentation for approximately $547,000 in pell grant disbursements . we provided information on these 28 schools to education for follow - up . education staff and officials told us that they have performed ad hoc reviews in the past to identify schools that disbursed pell grants to ineligible students and have recovered some improper payments as a result . however , education did not have a formal , systematic process in place specifically designed to identify schools that may be improperly disbursing pell grants . in september 2001 , we issued an interim report in which we recommended that the secretary of education ( 1 ) establish appropriate edit checks to identify unusual grant and loan disbursement patterns and ( 2 ) design and implement a formal , routine process to investigate unusual disbursement patterns identified by the edit checks . this type of process would serve not only to detect fraudulent and otherwise improper payments , but would also act as a deterrent to others who may be inclined toward these types of activities . in response to our work , education told us an edit was implemented in january 2002 in cps , the application processing system , that will identify applications that indicate a student is 75 years of age or older . if the student's date of birth indicates that he or she is 75 years of age or older , the system edit will reject the application and the school will not be authorized to give the student federal education funds until the student either submits a corrected date of birth or verifies that it is correct . however , without also looking for unusual patterns and following up , the edit may not be very effective , other than to correct data entry errors or confirm older students applying for aid . education is also in the process of implementing a new system called common origination and disbursement ( cod ) that is to be effective beginning in april 2002 . education officials told us that this integrated system will replace the separate systems education has used for pell grants and direct loans and other systems containing information on student aid , and it will integrate with applicant data in cps . the focus of cod is to improve program and data integrity . according to education officials , they will be able to use cod to identify schools with characteristics like those we identified .
