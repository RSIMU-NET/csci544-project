see appendix i for the list of experts we interviewed . we asked these experts to provide their views about the effectiveness of program types ( eg , drug courts ) , rather than about the effectiveness of individual intervention programs ( eg , a specific drug court program that was implemented in one county ) . because the model programs guide , like other online repositories , contains information about the effectiveness of individual intervention programs , it does not provide information about the effectiveness of program types . as a result , we were interested in obtaining the experts' consolidated views of the effectiveness of program types . to what extent does ojjdp have plans in place to accomplish its juvenile justice research and evaluation goals ? to determine what experts and the available research indicate about the types of reentry programs and substance abuse programs that are effective or cost beneficial for juvenile offenders , we reviewed relevant literature , studies , and federal resources for juvenile justice programs , and interviewed federal officials and 26 juvenile justice experts . specifically , to identify the types of programs to review , we conducted a literature search for studies and articles , including evaluations of juvenile reentry and juvenile substance abuse programs in the united states that were published from may 30 , 1999 , through may 30 , 2009 . we chose this time frame , the past 10 years , because it provided us with an overview of the available research , including unpublished and ongoing studies , which assesses the effectiveness of reentry and substance abuse programs . we also consulted with ojjdp officials who coordinate research on juvenile justice programs and department of health and human services officials who oversee substance abuse and adolescent programs to obtain their recommendations for repositories — online databases that contain information on effective programs — and research studies and relevant web sites for identifying types of reentry and substance abuse programs . using these recommendations , information from relevant literature , and categories of program types used by ojjdp's model programs guide , we identified five types of juvenile justice programs that are used to address reentry issues and five types of programs that are used to address substance abuse issues for juvenile offenders . specifically related to substance abuse , we focused on substance abuse programs that involved relapse prevention treatment for juvenile offenders with substance abuse histories . after consulting with experts and reviewing the literature , we excluded juvenile alcohol abuse programs and substance abuse programs for the general juvenile population as well as at - risk juveniles who are prone to , but have not yet developed , substance abuse problems . for instance , we excluded after school or recreation programs , conflict resolution programs , and school or classroom programs . while all of these programs may have a substance abuse component , this component is not designed to address juvenile offenders' actual substance abuse problems .
