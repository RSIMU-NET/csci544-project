state and usda have directly supported these oversight mechanisms . my testimony today summarizes the findings from our june 2017 report and our december 2017 report on u.s. assistance to inter - american organizations . this testimony addresses , for calendar years 2014 through 2016 , ( 1 ) the amounts and percentages of u.s. assessed contributions to the four organizations , ( 2 ) the extent to which u.s. agencies included and documented key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of u.s. agencies . for our reports , we analyzed strategic planning and budget documentation from the four organizations for calendar years 2014 through 2016 . we also interviewed officials from the four organizations , as well as officials from state , hhs , usaid , and usda , which provide contributions to these four organizations . to assess u.s. agencies' oversight of assistance agreements , we identified 60 active assistance agreements that these agencies awarded to oas , paho , and iica during calendar years 2014 through 2016 and selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 agreements , three each from hhs , state , usaid , and usda . we selected the three agreements from each agency based on the lowest , median , and highest dollar value . we assessed whether the agencies' agreements included key monitoring provisions implementing applicable agency guidance . we identified key monitoring provisions agencies are to include as part of their agreements as provisions that ensure oversight of the use of funds by requiring monitoring activities , such as financial and progress reports . we then assessed the extent to which the agencies had documentation of the required monitoring activities and examined the documentation of monitoring activities that they provided . more detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in the two reports cited above . we conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . in response to that requirement , state told us that they submitted to congress a strategy that included working with oas member states toward ensuring that the oas would not assess any single member state a quota of more than 50 percent of all oas assessed contributions . state officials informed us that they worked with other oas member states , including canada and mexico , to explore assessed quota reform options . for example , state officials consulted with their counterparts from mexico to review the oas's assessed quota structure and to consult on alternatives that would adjust all member states' quotas so that no member state's quota exceeds 50 percent of the oas's assessed contributions .
