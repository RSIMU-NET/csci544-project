these concussions would not be included in the database . in addition , because high school rio collects information on only 20 sports , its data cannot be used to estimate the occurrence of concussion in all sports . similarly , neiss gathers information only on concussions in patients who are treated in emergency departments , but not all athletes with a concussion go to an emergency department for treatment . furthermore , the medical charts that are reviewed by hospital staff for neiss may not always indicate detailed circumstances of the concussion , and therefore the staff may miss some concussions that were sustained during athletic participation . experts and federal officials identified additional features of the databases that may lead to further uncertainty and thus preclude the use of the data to provide comprehensive national estimates of concussion in high school sports . ( 2 ) what federal programs are directed specifically at the prevention of concussion incurred in high school sports ? ( 3 ) what are the components of key state laws regarding the management of concussion incurred in high school sports ? ( 4 ) what are the recommendations of voluntary nationwide guidelines for the management of concussion incurred in high school sports ? to determine what is known about the nationwide occurrence of concussion incurred in high school sports , we conducted a literature search of social science and medical databases to find articles published from 1999 through 2009 that discuss or report national data from public or private programs for tracking the occurrence of concussion in high school sports . we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from cpsc , the center for injury research and policy , and nccsi . the interviews focused on information about data collection methods and the generalizability , strengths , and limitations of the data that these organizations collect . we also conducted interviews with federal officials and experts from organizations that conduct work in the area of high school athletics or sports medicine to obtain assistance in identifying relevant data sources and to obtain information about the strengths and limitations of existing data sources . we identified these organizations from interviews with federal officials , literature we reviewed , and interviews with other experts . we then examined the characteristics of the national databases we identified , including how data are collected , the target population , and the sports studied . we did not analyze the data to generate and report incidence statistics , but rather to determine the manner in which the data are collected and to analyze how this affects the availability of data on nationwide occurrence . to determine what federal programs are directed specifically at the prevention of concussion incurred in high school sports , we searched federal web sites to identify prevention programs related to concussion in high school sports . we also interviewed federal officials to identify federal prevention programs and to obtain information and program materials , and we reviewed these materials to determine when these programs were developed , how educational materials are disseminated , and who the target audience is .
