there are separate listings for adults and children . the childhood listings are used first in evaluating childhood claims . if the child's impairment does not meet or equal the severity of a childhood listing , the adult listings are considered . the second regulatory change , issued in february 1991 in response to the sullivan v. zebley supreme court decision , added two new bases for finding children eligible for benefits , both of which required an assessment of a child's ability to function: functional equivalence , which was set at “listing level” severity , and an individualized functional assessment ( ifa ) , which was set at a lower threshold of severity . functional equivalence is based on the principle that it is the functional limitations resulting from an impairment that make the child disabled , regardless of the particular medical cause . it was added as a basis for eligibility in response to the supreme court's determination in the zebley case that ssa's medical listing of impairments — which had been the only basis for eligibility — was incomplete . under functional equivalence , a child could be found eligible for benefits if the child's impairment limited his or her functional ability to the same degree as described in a listed impairment . functional equivalence is particularly appropriate for assessing children with combinations of physical and mental impairments . the ifa allowed children whose impairments were less severe than listing level to be found eligible if their impairments were severe enough to substantially limit their ability to act and behave in age - appropriate ways . a child was generally found eligible under the ifa if his or her impairment resulted in moderate functional limitations in three areas of functioning or a marked limitation in one area and a moderate limitation in another area . in 1995 , we reported that the subjectivity of the ifa called into question ssa's ability to ensure reasonable consistency in administering the ssi program , particularly for children with behavioral and learning disorders . we suggested that the congress consider eliminating the ifa and directing ssa to revise its medical listings . several welfare reform provisions enacted in august 1996 made the eligibility criteria for disabled children more restrictive: ( 1 ) childhood disability was redefined from an impairment comparable to one that would prevent an adult from working to an impairment that results in “marked and severe functional limitations,” ( 2 ) the ifa was eliminated as a basis for determining eligibility for children , and ( 3 ) maladaptive behavior was removed from consideration when assessing a child's personal or behavioral functioning . thus , such behavior would be considered only once — in the assessment of that child's social functioning — when determining whether the child had a mental impairment severe enough to meet or equal the medical listings . the law also required ssa to redetermine the eligibility of children on the rolls who might not meet the new eligibility criteria because they received benefits on the basis of the ifa or maladaptive behavior . earlier legislative proposals under consideration in 1995 might have removed from the rolls as few as 45,000 to as many as 190,000 children , according to congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates .
