agencies also vary in how they allow requests to be made . depending on the agency , requesters can submit requests by telephone , fax , letter , or e - mail or through the web . in addition , agencies may process requests in two ways , known as “multitrack” and “single track.” multitrack processing involves dividing requests into two groups: ( 1 ) simple requests requiring relatively minimal review , which are placed in one processing track , and ( 2 ) more voluminous and complex requests , which are placed in another track . in contrast , single - track processing does not distinguish between simple and complex requests . with single - track processing , agencies process all requests on a first - in / first - out basis . agencies can also process foia requests on an expedited basis when a requester has shown a compelling need or urgency for the information . citizens have been requesting and receiving an ever - increasing amount of information from the federal government , as reflected in the increasing number of foia requests that have been received and processed in recent years . in fiscal year 2004 , the 25 agencies we reviewed reported receiving and processing about 4 million requests , an increase of 25 percent compared to 2003 . omb is responsible for issuing guidelines on the uniform schedule of fees . specifically , justice's requirements under the act are to ● make agencies' annual foia reports available through a single electronic access point and notify congress as to their availability ; in consultation with omb , develop guidelines for the required annual agency reports , so that all reports use common terminology and follow a similar format ; and ● submit an annual report on foia statistics and the efforts undertaken by justice to encourage agency compliance . within the department of justice , the office of information and privacy ( oip ) has lead responsibility for providing guidance and support to federal agencies on foia issues . oip first issued guidelines for agency preparation and submission of annual reports in the spring of 1997 and periodically issued additional guidance . oip also periodically issues guidance on compliance , provides training , and maintains a counselors service to provide expert , one - on - one assistance to agency foia staff . further , it also makes a variety of foia and privacy act resources available to agencies and the public via the justice web site and on - line bulletins . in addition , the act requires omb to issue guidelines to “provide for a uniform schedule of fees for all agencies.” in charging fees for responding to requests , agencies are required to conform to the omb guidelines . further , in 1987 , the department of justice issued guidelines on waiving fees when requests are determined to be in the public interest . under the guidelines , requests for waivers or reduction of fees are to be considered on a case - by - case basis , taking into account both the public interest and the requester's commercial interests .
