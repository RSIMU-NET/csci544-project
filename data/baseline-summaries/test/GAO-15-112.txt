forward . we believe that , if implemented effectively , these planned actions will help oig ensure that all complainants have an opportunity to provide additional information or written comments before oig closes their complaints and that complainants will receive the information they need to make decisions about their complaints . whistleblowers play an important role in safeguarding the federal government against waste , fraud , and abuse , but they often risk retaliation from their employers as a result of their actions . doj has established a process by which fbi whistleblowers can seek recourse should they experience such retaliation , and doj generally has the discretion to revise this process , as needed . we found that doj has terminated many fbi whistleblower complaints based on complainants' failure to meet threshold regulatory requirements rather than whether the retaliation occurred . in particular , fbi employees are protected if they report wrongdoing to certain high - level fbi or doj officials and other specified entities , and — unlike employees of other executive branch agencies — are not protected if they report wrongdoing to their supervisors . doj officials have stated plans to partially address this by adding several more senior officials in fbi field offices to the list of individuals to whom complainants may report protected disclosures , but the timing and outcome of this stated plan are uncertain . doj officials said they do not plan to expand the list to include supervisors or others in an employee's chain of command in part because of their concerns about the additional resources that would be needed to handle a possible increase in complaints and the potential effect on the timeliness of doj's process to handle these complaints . while doj officials' concern about timeliness is important , they are already taking other steps to improve the efficiency of this process . more importantly , dismissing retaliation complaints made to an employee's supervisor or someone in that person's chain of command leaves some fbi whistleblowers with no recourse if they allege retaliation , as our review of case files demonstrated . training that doj officials plan to provide to fbi employees could help provide information on how to make a protected disclosure ; however , this planned training will not address the fact that some employees report alleged wrongdoing first to their supervisors or others in their chain of command without ever expecting that this will lead to retaliation and a whistleblower claim . as a result , congressional consideration of whether the purposes of 5 u.s.c . § 2303 , which prohibits a personnel action taken against an fbi employee as a reprisal for a protected disclosure , are being met — in particular , whether fbi employees should , like employees of other executive branch agencies , have a means to obtain corrective action for retaliation for disclosures of wrongdoing made to supervisors and others in the employees' chain of command — could help ensure that doj's process for handling these complaints is consistent with congressional action to strengthen and expand protections for other federal whistleblowers .
