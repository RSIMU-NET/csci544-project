( see fig . lack of insurance coverage is more common among certain types of workers , employers , and industries . one state revised its computer systems so that eligible families leaving cash assistance due to employment were automatically transferred to transitional medicaid assistance coverage . in addition , this state's eligibility workers randomly contacted families who were leaving cash assistance to determine their health insurance status and to ensure that they obtained the additional months of medicaid coverage for which they were eligible . as a result of this state's efforts , about 70 percent of the families leaving cash assistance or medicaid received transitional medicaid coverage . officials in three other states encouraged increased participation in transitional medicaid assistance by contacting families with closed cash assistance cases to determine whether these families had obtained the additional months of medicaid coverage if so entitled . one of these states , which also provided 24 months of transitional medicaid assistance , reported that 77 percent of eligible families were receiving this benefit . however , even with such successful enrollment efforts , many families did not receive the full transitional medicaid assistance benefits because they failed to periodically report their income as required . the medicaid statute requires that beneficiaries report their income three times during the 12 months of transitional medicaid assistance: once in the first 6-month period and twice in the second 6-month period . failure to report income status in either of these 6-month periods results in termination of transitional medicaid benefits . in 1999 , we reported that families' failure to periodically submit required income reports often resulted in their not receiving transitional medicaid coverage for the full period of eligibility . for example , officials in three states we reviewed told us that families typically received only 6 months of transitional medicaid , generally because they failed to submit the required income reports â€” and not because of a change in income that made them ineligible for transitional medicaid . in contrast , the state that had a 94 percent participation rate for transitional medicaid offered coverage for 24 months and had received hcfa approval to waive the periodic income - reporting requirements . overall , we found that states that waived income - reporting requirements reported higher participation rates than states that did not . in implementing public programs such as medicaid , difficult trade - offs often exist between ease of enrollment for eligible individuals and program integrity efforts to ensure that benefits are provided only to those who are eligible . the experience of some states in easing statutory periodic income - reporting requirements proved successful in increasing participation for eligible beneficiaries . in view of concerns that beneficiary reporting requirements were limiting the use of the transitional medicaid benefit , hcfa proposed legislation to eliminate beneficiary reporting requirements for the full period of eligibility ( up to 1 year ) . to date , no action has been taken on this proposal . in our earlier report we recommended that the congress may wish to consider allowing states to lessen or eliminate periodic income - reporting requirements for families receiving transitional medicaid assistance , provided that states offer adequate assurances that the benefits are extended to those who are eligible .
