t his report provides descriptions of selected health care - related provisions that are scheduled to expire during the 115 th congress , first session ( i.e. , during calendar year [cy] 2017 ) .

for purposes of this report , expiring provisions are defined as portions of law that are time limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached , absent further legislative action .

the expiring provisions included in this report are those related to medicare , medicaid , state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and private health insurance programs and activities .

the report also includes other health care - related provisions that were last extended under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra ; p.l .

114-10 ) .

additionally , this report describes health care - related provisions within the same scope that expired during the 114 th congress , second session ( i.e. , during cy2016 ) .

although the congressional research service ( crs ) has attempted to be comprehensive , it cannot guarantee that every relevant provision is included here .

this report generally focuses on two types of health care - related provisions within the scope discussed above .

the first type of provision provides or controls mandatory spending , meaning that it provides temporary funding , temporary increases or decreases in funding ( eg , medicare provider bonus payments ) , or temporary special protections that may result in changes in funding levels ( eg , medicare funding provisions that establish a floor ) .

the second type of provision defines the authority of government agencies or other entities to act , usually by authorizing a policy , project , or activity .

such provisions also may temporarily delay the implementation of a regulation , requirement , or deadline , or establish a moratorium on a particular activity .

expiring health care provisions that are predominantly associated with discretionary spending activities — such as discretionary authorizations of appropriations and authorities for discretionary user fees — are excluded from this report .

for example , the food and drug administration medical product user fee programs , which expire on september 30 , 2017 , are discussed in a separate crs report .

certain types of provisions with expiration dates that otherwise would meet the criteria set forth above are excluded from this report .

some of these provisions are excluded because they are transitional or routine in nature or have been superseded by congressional action that otherwise modifies the intent of the expiring provision .

for example , statutorily required medicare payment rate reductions and payment rate re - basings that are implemented over a specified time period are not considered to require the attention of congress and are excluded .

the report is organized as follows: table 1 , below , lists the relevant provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2017 .

table 2 , which follows , lists the relevant provisions that expired during 2016 .

the provisions in each table are organized by expiration date and applicable health care - related program .

the report then provides descriptions of each listed provision , including a legislative history .

the summaries are grouped by provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2017 followed by those that expired in 2016 .

appendix a lists demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2017 or that expired in 2016 and are related to medicare , medicaid , chip , and private health insurance programs and activities or other health care - related provisions that were last extended under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra ; p.l .

114-10 ) .

appendix b lists all laws that created , modified , or extended the health care - related expiring provisions described in this report .

appendix c lists abbreviations used in the report .

most program integrity activities that address health care fraud , waste , and abuse are funded through the health care fraud and abuse control ( hcfac ) account , authorized by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ; p.l .

104-191 ) .

hcfac was established to increase and stabilize federal funding for health care antifraud activities .

the hcfac account funds the following two programs: ( 1 ) the health care fraud and abuse control program and ( 2 ) the medicare integrity program ( mip ) .

the health care fraud and abuse control program finances hhs , the hhs office of the inspector general , the department of justice , and the federal bureau of investigation administrative and operational ( investigation , prosecution , audits , evaluation , and education ) activities .

the mip finances cms medicare program integrity activities , which generally are conducted through contractors , and mip administrative activities .

congress authorized annual mandatory appropriations from the medicare hi trust fund to fund both the health care fraud and abuse control program and the mip .

hipaa section 201 appropriated $104 million to the hcfac account for fy1997 and authorized annual fy1998-fy2003 appropriations based on the amount allocated in the previous year increased by 15% .

trhca section 303 extended the annual mandatory appropriation for the hcfac account for fy2004-fy2006 at the fy2003 appropriation limit .

for fy2007-fy2010 , trhca extended the hcfac account appropriation at the total amount appropriated for fy2006 and authorized an inflation adjustment increase for fy2007-fy2010 to hcfac's fraud and abuse program component by adjusting the total amount appropriated for the previous year by changes in the consumer price index for all urban consumers ( cpi - u ) .

trhca did not extend the cpi - u adjustment to the mip component .

moreover , trhca authorized hcfac account appropriations to be available until expended .

aca section 6402 appropriated an additional $10 million annually on top of previously appropriated funding to the hcfac account for fy2011-fy2020 .

aca section 6402 also authorized a cpi - u inflation adjustment to mip appropriations applied to the total amount appropriated for the previous year .

hcera section 1303 appropriated additional funding to the hcfac account on top of previously appropriated funding in the following amounts for fy2011-fy2016: fy2011 , $95 million ; fy2012 , $55 million ; fy2013 , $30 million ; fy2014 , $30 million ; fy2015 , $20 million ; fy2016 , $20 million .

these appropriations were available until expended .

the additional hcfac appropriations ( $20 million in fy2016 ) authorized by hcera section 1303 have not been enacted for fy2017 or subsequent fiscal years .

however , funds appropriated prior to fy2017 are available for obligation until expended .

medicare reimburses ltchs for inpatient hospital care under the ltch pps , which is typically higher than inpatient hospital care reimbursement under the ipps .

psra established patient criteria for reimbursement under the ltch pps and a site - neutral payment rate for ltch patients who do not meet these criteria beginning in fy2016 .

specifically , under the site - neutral policy , ltchs receive reimbursement under the ltch pps if a medicare beneficiary either ( 1 ) had a prior three - day intensive - care - unit stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay or ( 2 ) is assigned to an ltch pps case - mix group that is based on the receipt of ventilator services for at least 96 hours and had a prior hospital stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay .

discharges involving patients who have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or rehabilitation do not qualify for the ltch pps rate .

in fy2016 and fy2017 , for patients who do not meet these ltch pps criteria , the site - neutral policy establishes that the ltch will receive a blended payment amount based on 50% of what the ltch would have been reimbursed under the ltch pps rate without the site - neutral policy and 50% of the site - neutral payment rate .

beginning in fy2018 , for discharges involving patients who do not meet these ltch pps criteria , the ltch will receive the site - neutral payment rate , which is equal to either 100% of the ipps reimbursement or 100% of the estimated cost of the case , whichever is lower .

caa 16 , division h , title ii , section 231 , provided a temporary third criterion for reimbursement under the ltch pps for discharges before january 1 , 2017 .

specifically , the site - neutral policy would not apply to an ltch discharge if all three of the following are satisfied: ( 1 ) the ltch is a grandfathered hospital - within - hospital ; ( 2 ) the ltch is located in a rural area ; and ( 3 ) the patient discharged has a severe wound — defined as a stage 3 or 4 wound , unstageable wound , nonhealing surgical wound , infected wound , fistula , osteomyelitis , or wound with morbid obesity .

cures act , division c , section 15 0 10 temporarily reinstated , after a lapse period and with some modifications , the exception for severe wound discharges .

the reinstated exception will apply only to ltch discharges occurring during an ltch's cost - reporting period beginning during fy2018 .

the reinstated exception , similar to the caa 2016 exception , applies only to a grandfathered hospital - within - hospital .

it eliminates the requirement from caa 16 that an ltch be located in a rural area and narrows the definition of a severe wound that was used in caa 16 .

in addition , unlike the caa 16 exception , only discharges associated with diagnosis - related groups relating to cellulitis or osteomyelitis are eligible for the reinstated exception .

the authority for the temporary third criterion for reimbursement under the ltch pps expired for discharges after december 31 , 2016 .

the reinstated exception will apply only to ltch discharges occurring during an ltch's cost - reporting period beginning during fy2018 .

in the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system ( opps ) 2009 final rule , cms established that outpatient therapeutic services furnished in hospital outpatient departments are required to have direct physician supervision , defined as having a physician "present and on the premises of the location and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure. .

on march 15 , 2010 , cms instructed its medicare contractors not to enforce these supervision requirements with respect to critical access hospitals ( cahs ) in cy2010 .

as cms continued to refine its direct supervision policy , the agency extended the moratorium on enforcement through cy2011 and expanded the scope of the moratorium to include both cahs and small rural hospitals ( which cms defined as having 100 or fewer beds , being geographically located in a rural area , or being paid under the opps using a rural wage index ) .

on november 1 , 2012 , cms issued a notice that extended the moratorium through the end of cy2013 .

p.l .

113-198 , section 1 extended the moratorium through the end of cy2014 .

p.l .

114-112 , section 1 extended the moratorium through the end of cy2015 .

cures act , division c , section 16004 extended the moratorium through the end of cy2016 .

the moratorium on enforcement of the requirement of direct supervision of outpatient therapeutic services furnished in cahs and small rural hospitals expired after december 31 , 2016 .
