the united states plays a critical role in global markets for both feed grains and oilseeds .

the united states is the world's leading producer and exporter of both corn and soybeans .

in 2007 the united states had 42% and 63% shares , respectively , of world corn production and trade , and 32% and 41% shares of world soybean production and trade .

as a result of this dominant role , unexpected changes in u.s. production for either corn or soybeans , such as those stemming from the midwest floods of 2008 , can have a major impact on both u.s. and global commodity markets .

during the first half of 2008 , u.s. and world agricultural markets for most grains and oilseeds experienced tight supplies and record high prices .

the high prices provided a tantalizing incentive for u.s. farmers as they prepared to plant their crops this past spring .

in contrast , the dramatic , unexpectedly sharp price increases of the past year have raised costs for livestock feeders and agricultural processors , evoked considerable concern about consumer food - price inflation and international food aid availability , and sparked a global debateâreferred to as the "food versus fuel" debateâabout the increasing policy trend of dedicating commercial agricultural crops to biofuels production , particularly corn used for ethanol .

against this backdrop of producer anticipation and consumer angst , substantial new concerns emerged by late june about potential weather - and flood - related production losses to this year's u.s. corn and soybean crops .

widespread , good growing conditions have persisted since the floods adding to the uncertainty over crop production prospects .

on august 12 , 2008 , usda released the first survey - based forecast of corn and soybean production for 2008 .

according to usda's forecast , u.s. farmers will produce the second largest corn crop on recordâ12.3 billion bushelsâup about 5% from the previous month's forecast , but down over 6% from the 2007 record crop .

usda's soybean production forecast of nearly 3 billion bushels is unchanged from the july forecast , but up 15% from 2007 .

these production forecasts reflect three factors .

first , flood - related acreage losses appear to be substantially less than initially projected .

second , nearly ideal growing conditions that have persisted across the corn belt since late june have contributed to sharp increases in usda's yield outlook for corn , thus , offsetting flood - related area losses .

third , despite a 17.6% increase in planted acreage in 2008 , soybean production is flat due to a diminished yield outlookâlargely due to the lateness of the crop's planting and development , as well as dry conditions in the delta , the southeast , and the northern plains .

usda's august crop production forecast appear to have calmed much of the market concern regarding crop losses due to flooding .

however , a large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and , as of early august , remain substantially behind historical development rates .

as of august 11 , usda estimates that 30% of corn had reached the dough stage of development compared with the 5-year average of 50% , while only 6% had dented compared with an average of 16% the past five years .

similarly , 60% of soybean plants had set pods compared with the 5-year average of 75% .

as a result , market analysts suggest that weather problems could still emergeâsuch as an early freezeâthat could lower yield and production prospects , especially in the more northerly regions where crop development remains behind normal .

flood - related crop damage assessments generally are made by county and state officials in the affected regions .

however , a rough approximation of flood - damaged acres can be obtained by comparing the implied state - level abandonment rates from usda's august forecasts with the recent eight - year average abandonment rates .

if one attributes any change from the 8-year average entirely to the flood , then the data suggest that about 889,000 acres planted to corn and intended for harvest were lost in iowa ( 453,000 ) , illinois ( 236,000 ) , indiana ( 102,000 ) , and missouri ( 99,000 ) âsee table 1 .

this "lost" area estimate represents about 1% of the 87.0 million acres planted to corn in 2008 .

however , projected below - average abandonment rates throughout the remainder of the corn belt , particularly in nebraska , kansas , south dakota , ohio , and in lower - yielding non - corn belt states more than offset the lost acres .

applying usda august yield forecasts to the area - loss calculations suggests that the four major flood - affected states of iowa ( 77.5 million bushels ) , illinois ( 40.6 ) , indiana ( 15.8 ) , and missouri ( 14.4 ) , cumulatively account for 148.2 million bushels of "potentially" lost production .

this "lost" production estimate represents 1.2% of the 12.3 billion bushel crop estimate announced by usda .

applying the same abandonment rate methodology to soybeans suggests that projected area loss related to bad weather and flooding amounts to nearly 400,000 acres in the corn belt , partially offset by 184,000 acres of below - normal abandonment in non - corn belt states ( table 2 ) .

this "lost" area estimate represents about 0.2% of the 74.8 million acres planted to soybeans in 2008 .

applying usda august yield forecasts to the area - loss calculations suggests that for soybeans there are six major flood - affected states that cumulatively account for 63 million bushels of "potentially" lost soybean production: iowa ( 19.1 million bushels ) , illinois ( 19.0 ) , indiana ( 12.5 ) , missouri ( 8.8 ) wisconsin ( 2.4 ) , and minnesota ( 1.3 ) .

this "lost" production estimate represents 2.1% of the estimated 3 billion bushel crop .

as mentioned earlier , the united states and world markets have experienced tight supplies and record high prices during the first half of 2008 .

most long - term forecasts project prices for feed grains and oilseedsâas well as those crops that compete for area with feed grains and oilseedsâto remain at significantly higher levels than experienced during the recent 1998-2006 period .

the main factors behind higher long - term prices are projections for a steady rise in global population , accompanied by steady income growth in the world's developing economies , which combine to sustain growth in demand for livestock products and the feedstuffs ( eg , coarse grains and protein meals ) needed to produce those products .

in addition , the outlook for increased demand for agricultural feedstocks to meet large increases in government biofuel - usage policies , particularly in the united states and the european union ( eu ) , suggest that demand will increase strongly over the coming decade for corn ( the primary feedstock for u.s. ethanol production ) , and vegetable oils ( the primary feedstock for biodiesel production in the united states and the eu ) .

these long - run forecasts assume normal crop growing conditions and successful harvests .

as a result , any deviation from normal growing conditions can be expected to have negative market repercussions and drive prices higher .

the potential weather - and flood - related production losses to this year's u.s. corn and soybean crops were unwelcome news to the market and , likely to contribute to higher commodity prices in june .

because the united states plays a dominant role in global corn and soybean markets , u.s. price changes transmit directly to the international marketplace .

in summary , good growing conditions during july and early august of 2008 appear to have moderated initial concerns over potential flood - related crop losses .

however , a large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and , as of early august , remain substantially behind historical development rates .

as a result , market analysts suggest that weather problems such as an early freeze could still emerge to lower yield and production prospects .

such concerns are likely contribute to volatile commodity prices , thereby , maintaining pressure on policymakers over concerns about consumer food price inflation , international food aid availability , and the soundness of policy that dedicates commercial agricultural crops to biofuels production , particularly corn used for ethanol .
