u.s. government accountability office , government shutdown: three departments reporting varying degrees of impacts on operations , grants , and contracts , gao - 15-86 , november 14 , 2014 , available at https: / / www.gao.gov / products / gao - 15-86 .

gao reviewed how the 2013 shutdown affected some operations and services at three departments: the departments of energy , health and human services ( hhs ) , and transportation ( dot ) .

gao selected these three departments for review based on the value of grants and contracts , the percentage of employees expected to be furloughed , and the potential for longer - term effects .

gao recommended that the office of management and budget ( omb ) instruct agencies to document lessons learned in planning for and implementing a shutdown , as well as for resuming activities following a shutdown should a funding gap longer than five days occur in the future .

omb staff did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with the recommendation .

u.s. general accounting office , cost of the recent partial shutdown of government offices , pad - 82-24 , december 10 , 1981 , available at http: / / www.gao.gov / products / pad - 82-24 .

according to gao , this report was completed "in response to congressional requests," for which "gao contacted 13 cabinet departments and 12 selected agencies and offices to obtain information about the costs of a 1981 partial shutdown of government offices. .

it includes cost estimates , background information about the costs , and gao recommendations to congress concerning agency operations in the event of a government shutdown .

u.s. general accounting office , funding gaps jeopardize federal government operations , pad - 81-31 , march 3 , 1981 , available at http: / / www.gao.gov / products / pad - 81-31 .

according to gao , as of march 1981 , "interruptions in federal agency funding at the beginning of the fiscal year ( fy ) and operations on continuing resolutions have become the norm rather than the exception. .

for years , many federal agencies continued to operate during a funding gap , while "minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations , believing that congress did not intend that agencies close down" while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or continuing resolutions .

during the fy1981 appropriations process , the president requested opinions on the antideficiency act from the then - u.s. attorney general , benjamin civiletti .

in two memoranda issued in 1980 and 1981 , the attorney general stated that the act required agencies to terminate all operations when their current appropriations expired .

according to gao , agencies were uncertain how to respond to the attorney general's opinion and what activities they would be able to continue if appropriations expired .

this gao report outlines some of the problems surrounding late appropriations and funding gaps .

it also includes attorney general civiletti's opinions within appendices iv and viii .

u.s. general accounting office , government shutdown: funding lapse furlough information , ggd - 96-52r , december 1 , 1995 , available at http: / / www.gao.gov / products / ggd - 96-52r .

gao was asked to provide available information on the numbers of federal employees who might have been subject to furlough in the event of a second shutdown in 1995 .

gao provided numbers that were based on plans provided by the office of management and budget ( omb ) to gao in october 1995 .

the numbers included within this document do not represent actual furloughs .

the numbers represent planned furloughs in advance of the two shutdowns , which occurred later in november and december â€“ january .
