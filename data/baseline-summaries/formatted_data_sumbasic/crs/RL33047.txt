this report discusses the statutory and congressional rule structure under which members of the house and senate , under an exception to the gift rules , may generally accept from some private sources — other than registered lobbyists or registered foreign agents — necessary travel expenses , including transportation , food and lodging , for travel "in connection with" their official duties , such as for fact - finding trips , conferences or symposia , under certain circumstances and limitations .

the receipt of "gifts" by members and staff of the house of representatives and of the senate , including the receipt or acceptance of payment or reimbursement of travel expenses from outside , private , third - party sources , is generally restricted by the operation of federal statutory law , as applied by the house and senate rules .

under these provisions , members of congress and congressional staff are prohibited from soliciting or accepting gifts from any private sources unless expressly permitted by an exception in the congressional rules .

members and staff may generally not accept private gifts , reimbursements , or payments of their expenses , other than from their relatives and certain long - term personal friends , when the value of a gift is $50 or more ( or when multiple gifts of under $50 from the same source aggregate $100 or more in a calendar year ) .

there do exist exceptions to the gifts prohibitions under both house and senate rules which allow for the acceptance of some travel expenses from outside , third parties for what is characterized as "officially connected" travel by members , officers and employees of the house and senate in specifically defined and limited circumstances .

the travel that has recently raised several questions has been the acceptance of private payment or reimbursement of "officially connected" travel by members and staff .

both the rules of the house of representatives and the rules of the senate expressly permit , as an exception to the general gifts restriction , the payment or reimbursement by certain outside , private sources of the "necessary" travel expenses of members for events such as conferences , fact - finding tours , symposia or lectures which , although not core congressional functions , are "in connection with" or sufficiently related to a member's official duties .

the wording of the house and senate rules on this subject are substantially identical , other than as to the permissible duration of such trips , which is limited in the house to four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel ( excluding travel days ) , and in the senate to three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel ( also excluding travel days ) .

the preceding discussion has centered around the language and interpretations of internal house and senate rules on the acceptance of gifts and things of value from outside , private sources .

it should be noted that there are also criminal statutes that involve specifically the receipt of anything of value by a public official .

while a "gift" is generally understood to be given and accepted with no "strings attached," that is , that the gift has the requisite donative intent and is not specifically connected to or related to any particular "official act" by the public officer , the criminal laws are aimed at the receipt of things of value when the offer and / or acceptance or receipt are connected in some way to an official act or forbearance by that public official .

the "bribery" provisions of federal law prohibit the "corrupt" receipt of something of value "in return for" being influenced in any official act , while the "illegal gratuities" clause of that law requires merely the receipt of something of value with the knowledge that one is being compensated or rewarded "for or because of" any official act done or to be done .

house rule xxv , clause 5: ( b ) ( 1 ) ( a ) a reimbursement ( including payment in kind ) to a member , delegate , resident commissioner , officer , or employee of the house from a private source other than a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal for necessary transportation , lodging , and related expenses for travel to a meeting , speaking engagement , factfinding trip , or similar event in connection with his duties as an officeholder shall be considered as a reimbursement to the house and not a gift prohibited by this clause , if the member , delegate , resident commissioner , officer , or employee — ( i ) in the case of an employee , receives advance authorization , from the member , delegate , resident commissioner , or officer under whose direct supervision the employee works , to accept reimbursement ; and ( ii ) discloses the expenses reimbursed or to be reimbursed and the authorization to the clerk within 30 days after the travel is completed .

 ( b ) for purposes of subdivision ( a ) , events , the activities of which are substantially recreational in nature , are not considered to be in connection with the duties of a member , delegate , resident commissioner , officer , or employee of the house as an officeholder .

 ( 5 ) the clerk shall make available to the public all advance authorizations and disclosures of reimbursement filed under subparagraph ( 1 ) as soon as possible after they are received .
