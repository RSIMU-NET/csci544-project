for fy2016 , the house subcommittee mark proposed $1.0 million for an orderly shutdown of open world .

language in the full committee print , released prior to the markup of the fy2016 bill , stated , the committee believes given our current fiscal environment , and in light of both the lack of quantifiable results from the open world leadership center and its duplication of programs more appropriately offered by the state department , the program has long outlived its short - term intent .

the committee understands the program has some strong champions on the committee .

however , with further reductions being made to every program within the legislative branch , the committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the owlc .

the committee directs the executive director of the owlc to retain any necessary prior year funds in the trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill be utilized for the orderly shutdown .

the executive director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the legislative branch fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill .

the fy2014 senate - reported bill would have provided $4.0 million , as well as a provision allowing the librarian of congress to transfer up to $6.0 million in nonappropriated funds to open world .

the final enacted fy2014 level was $6.0 million .

the fy2013 house - reported bill would have provided $1.0 million , a decrease of $9.0 million ( - 90.0% ) , from the $10.0 million provided in fy2012 and requested for fy2013 .

the house report stated that this funding level would "cover the cost associated with the shutdown" and directed that "the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the legislative branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill. .

the senate - reported bill , in contrast , would have provided $10.0 million ( - 12.1% ) .

the senate report stated that "despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule. .

the fy2012 act contained the senate - reported level .

this sentiment was also expressed in the conference report , which stated , the conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the open world center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the legislative branch appropriations bill in future years .

the committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request .
