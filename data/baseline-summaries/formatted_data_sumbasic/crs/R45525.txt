congress has been active in establishing federal policy for the agricultural sector on an ongoing basis since the 1930s .

over the years , as economic conditions and technology have evolved , congress has regularly revisited agricultural policy through periodic farm legislation .

across these decades , the breadth of policy areas addressed through such farm bills has expanded beyond providing support for a limited number of agricultural commodities to include establishing programs and policies that address a broad spectrum of related areas .

these include agricultural conservation , credit , rural development , domestic nutrition assistance , trade and international food aid , organic agriculture , forestry , and support for beginning and veteran farmers and ranchers , among others .

the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-334 ) , known as the "2018 farm bill," was enacted on december 20 , 2018 , approximately eight months after the bill was introduced ( table 1 ) .

in the house , the agriculture committee reported the bill on april 18 , 2018 , by a vote of 26-20 .

an initial floor vote on may 18 , 2018 , failed in the house by a vote of 198-213 , but floor procedures allowed that vote to be reconsidered ( h.res .

905 ) .

the house passed h.r .

2 in a second vote of 213-211 on june 21 , 2018 .

in the senate , the agriculture committee reported its bill ( s. 3042 ) on june 13 , 2018 , by a vote of 20-1 .

the senate passed its bill as an amendment to h.r .

2 by a vote of 86-11 on june 28 , 2018 .

conference proceedings to resolve the differences between the house - and senate - passed versions of h.r .

2 officially began on september 5 , 2018 , and concluded in december 2018 with senate passage of h.r .

2 on a vote of 87-13 and house passage by a vote of 369-47 ( h.rept .

115-1072 ) .

the enacted 2018 farm bill continues a tradition of multi - year farm bills that would establish policy for a broad array of agriculture and nutrition assistance programs .

to this end , p.l .

115-334 addresses agriculture and food policy across 12 titles .

these titles cover commodity support programs , agricultural conservation , trade and international food aid , domestic nutrition assistance , credit , rural development , research and extension , forestry , horticulture , crop insurance , and a variety of other policies and initiatives .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projected at enactment that outlays of the 2018 farm bill will amount to $428 billion over the five - year life of the law ( fy2019-fy2023 ) .

most of this projected spending — $326 million , or 76% — is in the nutrition title for the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) .

the remaining 24% — $102 billion of projected outlays — stems primarily from agricultural programs , including crop insurance , farm commodity programs , and conservation .

cbo estimated that the conference agreement for the 2018 farm bill will be budget neutral over a 10-year period ( fy2019-fy2028 ) .

cbo estimated that in its first five years , the enacted 2018 farm bill will increase spending by $1.8 billion , compared with a simple extension of the 2014 farm bill , but that this initial increase will be entirely offset in the second five years of the budget window .

the " budgetary impact " section of this report provides additional detail at the level of individual titles and major programs .

the policymaking environment for the 2018 farm bill differed materially from that of the 2014 farm bill , reflecting lower farm income levels in recent years and disruptions to agricultural exports beginning in 2018 .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) forecasts that for 2018 , net cash farm income — a measure of the profitability of farming — will be about one - third below the levels of 2012 and 2013 , which were the highest in the last 40 years adjusted for inflation .

the decline in net cash farm income over this period reflects lower farm prices for many commodities .

u.s. farm exports , which provide critical support to u.s. agricultural commodity prices and farm profitability , have been disrupted since early 2018 by a series of trade disputes involving major u.s. agricultural export markets — including china , canada , mexico , and the european union — that has led to the imposition of tariffs by these trading partners on a range of u.s. farm product exports .

the decline in farm income , coupled with uncertainty about prospects for agricultural exports , may well have played a role in shaping a set of policies in the enacted farm bill that provide farmers and ranchers with a degree of continuity for the next five years .

this report provides an analysis of the budgetary implications of both bills , followed by summaries identifying some of the changes contained in the enacted 2018 farm bill compared with prior law .

these summaries are followed by tables containing a title - by - title analysis of all of the policies and provisions in the enacted 2018 farm bill compared to the house - and senate - passed versions of h.r .

2 and with the expired 2014 farm bill .

the allocation of federal spending is one way to measure the activities covered by a farm bill , both by how much is spent in total and by how a new law changes policy .

cbo estimates are the official measures when bills are considered and are based on long - standing budget laws and rules .

a farm bill authorizes funding in two ways: it authorizes and pays for mandatory outlays with multi - year budget estimates when the law is enacted .

it also sets the parameters for discretionary programs and authorizes them to receive future appropriations but does not provide funding .

mandatory programs often dominate farm bill policy and the debate over the farm bill budget .

figure 1 illustrates the $428 billion , five - year total of projected mandatory outlays at enactment for the life of the 2018 farm bill ( fy2019-fy2023 ) .

figure 2 shows program - level detail for agriculture - specific programs , particularly the farm commodity and conservation titles .

the nutrition title is the largest component of the farm bill budget , followed by crop insurance , farm commodity programs , and conservation .
