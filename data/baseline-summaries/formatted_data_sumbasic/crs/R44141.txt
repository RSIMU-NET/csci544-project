this report discusses the fy2016 budget request , related congressional actions , and appropriations ( discretionary budget authority ) for the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) and bureau of the census ( census bureau ) .

these entities make up the economics and statistics administration ( esa ) in the u.s. department of commerce , which is funded under annual appropriations for the departments of commerce and justice , and science and related agencies ( cjs ) .

the report focuses primarily on the census bureau , whose budget justification is published separately from esa's and whose budget is far larger .

table 1 , below , shows the fy2015-enacted , fy2016-requested , house - passed , senate committee on appropriations - reported and fy2016-enacted amounts for esa , bea ( insofar as available separately from esa ) , and the census bureau , with its two major accounts .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , h.r .

2029 , p.l .

114-113 , became law on december 18 , 2015 .

it provides $109.0 million for esa ( with no separate amount shown for bea ) , $9.0 million ( 9.0% ) more than the $100.0 million enacted for fy2015 , passed by the house , and recommended by the senate committee , and $4.8 million ( 4.3% ) less than the $113.8 million requested for fy2016 .

the fy2016 appropriations act funds the census bureau at $1,370.0 million , $282.0 million ( 25.9% ) more than the $1,088.0 million enacted for fy2015 , $130.0 million ( 8.7% ) below the $1,500.0 million requested for fy2016 , $378.3 million ( 38.1% ) more than the house - passed $991.7 million , and $242.0 million ( 21.5% ) above the senate appropriations committee - reported $1,128.0 million .

the act provides $270.0 million for current surveys and programs , $7.9 million ( 2.8% ) less than the requested $277.9 million , $9.0 million ( 3.4% ) above the house - passed amount of $261.0 million , and $4.0 million ( 1.5% ) more than the $266.0 million the senate committee recommended .

the $1,100.0 million provided for periodic censuses and programs is $122.1 million ( 10.0% ) less than the requested $1,222.1 million ; it exceeds the house - passed amount of $730.7 million by $369.3 million ( 50.5% ) and the senate committee - reported amount of $862.0 million by $238.0 million ( 27.6% ) .

the act approves the bureau's restructuring of its two major accounts and does not include house - passed language that , in effect , would have made acs responses voluntary instead of mandatory .
