the united states congress conducts several types of activities for which it employs staff .

congressional employees are retained to perform public duties that include assisting members in official responsibilities in personal , committee , leadership , or administrative office settings .

organized to support members of congress in their various duties and functions in washington , dc , and constituency offices around the united states , staff are involved in virtually all elements of the work of congress .

individuals in congressional staff positions may come from a wide range of training or professional backgrounds .

these might include the law , business , medicine , political campaigns , engineering , the social sciences , or fine arts .

nevertheless , congressional staff are seen by some as a professional cohort .

congressional career tracks generally mirror common stages of other professional careers , but with adaptations to the congressional workplace .

these adaptations include relatively short career ladders on which staff may acquire substantial responsibilities in a relatively short period of time , and close support of a member's legislative and representational responsibilities .

this report focuses on positions in house and senate personal offices , and provides sample position descriptions for 14 positions with similar job titles in each chamber .

identifying congressional staff duties and job descriptions is complicated by the highly decentralized nature of congressional employment practices .

the house of representatives is composed of as many as 500 entities that set job criteria and employ staff ; in the senate , there are about 135 such entities .

congressional staff may work in a member , committee , or leadership office ; in positions under the authority of chamber officers ; or in chamber support entities with specialized duties .

additional challenges of the congressional personnel environment may include different approaches to some practices common in many professional environments .

some congressional employing entities may not use formal position descriptions ; others may not implement formal personnel practices and guidelines , or clearly establish lines of authority for personnel issues in their offices .

in offices where personnel practices and guidelines are developed , practices could vary from office to office .

all decisions regarding activities and operations in a member's office are within the discretion of the member , subject to chamber rules and relevant statute .

as with all congressional entities with employing authority , individual members of congress have wide discretion in setting many workplace policies , including procedures for establishing the duties and functions of staff positions .

staffing decisions may be determined by the priorities and goals of a congressional office , and the preferences and needs of a member's constituents .
