t he ryan white hiv / aids program makes federal funds available to eligible metropolitan areas , states and local community - based organizations to provide a number of health care services for hiv / aids patients , including medical care , drug treatments , dental care , home health care , and outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment .

the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) estimates that more than 1.2 million people in the united states have hiv / aids .

the ryan white hiv / aids program reports that in 2014 it served 512,214 low - income people with hiv / aids , 25.4% of whom were uninsured and 64.2% of whom were living at or below 100% of the federal poverty level .

the majority of clients in 2014 were male ( 70.6% male , 28.3% female , 1.1% transgender ) , from racial / ethnic minority populations ( 47.2% black / african american , 22.2% hispanic / latino , 0.5% american indian / alaska native , 1.2% asian , 0.2% native hawaiian / pacific islander , 1.8% multiple races , 27% white ) , and aged 50 years and older ( 40.4% ) .

the ryan white hiv / aids program states that in 2014 , 80.4% of clients were retained in hiv medical care ( 218,758 clients of 272,193 total clients ) .

clinical research has demonstrated that treatment of hiv patients with anti - hiv ( also called antiretroviral ) medication reduces the amount of virus in the blood to very low levels ( also called viral suppression ) and lowers the risk of hiv transmission by 96% .

the ryan white hiv / aids program indicates that in 2014 , 81.4% of clients achieved viral suppression ( 231,140 clients of 283,811 total clients ) .

among youth aged 13-24 years , retention in care was lower ( 10,988 youth clients of 14,639 total youth clients , or 75.1% ) than the national ryan white hiv / aids program average and viral suppression was much lower ( 10,407 youth clients of 16,117 total youth clients , or 64.6% ) .

the ryan white hiv / aids program was established in law in 1990 ( p.l .

101-381 ) and reauthorized and amended in 1996 ( p.l .

104-146 ) , 2000 ( p.l .

106-345 ) , 2006 ( p.l .

109-415 ) , and 2009 ( p.l .

111-87 ) .

it was enacted as title xxvi of the public health service ( phs ) act and codified as parts a , b , c , d , e , f , and g under 42 u.s.c .

§300ff - 11 et seq .

the program is administered by the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) hiv / aids bureau .

most of the program funding is distributed to eligible entities based on formulas that take into account the number of people living with hiv / aids .

fy2016 funding of $2.3 billion is divided among the individual grant programs ( parts a , b , c , d , and f ) as shown in figure 1 .

at the end of this report , table 1 provides fy1991-fy2017 request dollar amounts ; the grant programs are summarized in the appendix .

114-113 ) .notes: adap = aids drugs assistance program ; adr = aids dental reimbursement program ; aetc = aids education and training centers ; and spns = special projects of national significance .

p.l .

111-87 provided specific authorization levels for parts a , b , c , d , and f for each fiscal year through fy2013 , resulting in a four - year reauthorization for the ryan white hiv / aids program .

the program's authority is currently expired , but congress continues to appropriate funds for the program .

p.l .

111-87 required that the secretary establish a national hiv / aids testing goal of 5 million tests annually through programs administered by hrsa and the cdc .

the secretary is required to submit an annual report to congress on the progress made in achieving the testing goal , including any barriers to meeting the goal , the amount of funding necessary to meet the goal , and the most cost - effective strategies for identifying individuals who are unaware of their hiv status .

the secretary is also required to review each of the programs and activities conducted by cdc as part of the domestic hiv / aids prevention activities .

other provisions of p.l .

111-87 are discussed below in the sections of this report on the various parts of the ryan white hiv / aids program .

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 ( aca , p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance and is expected to increase coverage for people living with hiv / aids .

these provisions include prohibitions on the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition , elimination of lifetime caps on insurance benefits and annual limits on coverage , and eligibility for tax subsidies to help low - and middle - income individuals purchase coverage from health insurance exchanges .

in addition , states have the option to broaden medicaid eligibility to include single adults .

aca phases out the medicare part d so - called "doughnut hole" — a gap in prescription drug coverage — for individuals who are medicare - eligible , including individuals with hiv / aids .

the long - range impact of the health care law on hrsa's ryan white hiv / aids program ( in which the health and treatment services provided under ryan white are likely to be replaced to some extent by access to such services through health coverage via aca ) remains to be determined and may be of interest to policymakers given that authorization for the ryan white hiv / aids program has lapsed .

the national hiv / aids strategy ( nhas ) is a five - year plan detailing the "principles , priorities , and actions" to guide the "collective national response to the hiv epidemic. .

the nhas was first released in july 2010 and updated in july 2015 .

the current nhas goals are as follows: 1 .

reduce new infections .

2 .

increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people living with hiv .

3 .

reduce hiv - related health disparities and health inequities .

4 .

achieve a more coordinated national response to the hiv epidemic .

the nhas cites the ryan white hiv / aids program as a critical source of lifesaving care and treatment for indi viduals living with hiv .

moreover , providing such treatment "not only improves the health outcomes for individuals with hiv , it serves the public health benefit of helping to prevent hiv transmission. .

clinical research has demonstrated that early treatment of hiv patients with antiretroviral medication results in viral suppression and reduces the risk of hiv transmission by 96% .

however , cdc data indicate that in 2012 , only 30% of people living with hiv were virally suppressed .

according to hrsa , the ryan white hiv / aids program grant awards , by supporting cities , states , and communities in the treatment of hiv patients , will allow the goals of the updated nhas to be achieved .

prior to the implementation of the aca ( p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) , obtaining private health insurance was difficult for individuals with hiv / aids and others living with serious preexisting medical conditions .

a 2011 institute of medicine ( iom ) report estimated that in urban areas , only about 13% of hiv patients in 2010 had private health insurance ; most hiv patients were covered by medicaid ( 36% ) , medicare ( 12% ) , or a combination of these two programs ( 6% ) .

the remaining individuals were either uninsured and obtained services through the ryan white hiv / aids program ( 24% ) , or their insurance coverage information was missing or unknown ( 8% ) .

in 2012 , the ryan white hiv / aids program served more than a half million low - income individuals with hiv / aids in the united states , of whom 28% were uninsured and 59% were underinsured .

the cdc estimates that more than 1.2 million people have hiv / aids , but does not indicate the percentage of this population that is low income .

among those who were underinsured , ryan white hiv / aids program funds were used to supplement insurance gaps .

the aca expanded insurance coverage through a number of different provisions .

specifically , it expanded public coverage for low - income individuals through the medicaid program .

it also made a number of changes to the private insurance market , created a standardized marketplace for individuals to purchase insurance coverage and premium subsidies for individuals whose incomes were too high for medicaid , but were otherwise unable to afford private insurance coverage .

the aca may affect the need for , and use of , certain services provided by the ryan white hiv / aids program .

for example , about half of adap clients would be medicaid - eligible in expansion states , and the remainder would likely be eligible for premium subsidies to purchase health coverage on the exchange .

this section describes the aca changes that are relevant to the ryan white hiv / aids program and its service population .

the section also highlights some of the services provided under the ryan white hiv / aids program that are not covered by the aca .

p.l .

111-87 provided authority for the ryan white hiv / aids program through fy2013 .

section 2 ( a ) of p.l .

111-87 removed the sunset provision that had been included in the 2006 reauthorization ( §703 of p.l .

109-415 ) .

the program's authority is currently expired , but congress continues to appropriate funds for the program to carry out title xxvi and title iii of the phs act .

as noted above ( " aca and the ryan white hiv / aids program " ) , the role of the ryan white hiv / aids program has been and may continue to be altered by the aca , particularly state decisions on medicaid expansion .

such changes may be taken into consideration should congress undertake another reauthorization of the ryan white hiv / aids program or consider making changes to the aca .

for fy2016 , the obama administration requested a total of $2.323 billion for the ryan white hiv / aids program , an increase of $4 million compared with fy2015 ; the increase would go to part c. as in fy2015 , the fy2016 budget request again proposed consolidating part d funds into part c. the house appropriations committee reported h.r .

3020 , the fy2016 labor / hhs / education bill on june 24 , 2015 ( h.rept .

114-195 ) .

the house bill would have provided $2.319 billion for the ryan white hiv / aids program , the same as the fy2015-enacted level , without the consolidation of parts c and d. the senate appropriations committee reported s. 1695 on june 25 , 2015 ( s.rept .

114-74 ) .

the senate bill would have provided $2.294 billion for the ryan white hiv / aids program , $25 million less than the fy2015-enacted level .

the senate bill did not agree to the proposed consolidation of parts c and d and did not provide $25 million in funding for spns .

on september 30 , 2015 , the president signed into law the continuing appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-53 , h.r .

719 ) , which provided funding for the ryan white hiv / aids program through december 11 , 2015 , at the same level as in the fy2015 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( p.l .

113-235 ) , minus an across - the - board reduction of 0.2108% .

the further continuing appropriations act , 2016 , ( h.r .

2250 , p.l .

114-96 ) provided funding through december 16 , 2015 , under the same conditions and funding rate as p.l .

114-53 .

on december 17 and 18 , 2015 , the house and senate passed the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( h.r .

2029 , p.l .

114-113 ) , which the president signed on december 18 , 2015 .

the measure provides a total of $2.323 billion for the ryan white hiv / aids program in fy2016 , including the $25 million for spns , but did not agree to the consolidation of parts c and d .

the obama administration requests $2.298 billion in budget authority and $34 million via the phs evaluation tap — for spns — resulting in a total of $2.332 billion for the ryan white hiv / aids program in fy2017 .

the $9 million increase over fy2016 would be for a new spns initiative to expand screening for and treatment of hepatitis c in people living with hiv .

the fy2017 budget request again proposes a consolidation of part c and part d , which was proposed in the fy2015 and fy2016 budget requests and rejected by congress .
