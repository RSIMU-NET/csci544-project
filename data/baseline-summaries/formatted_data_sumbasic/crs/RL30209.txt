106-479 , pp.69-243 temporary restrictions on fy1999 appropriations .

congress had placeda time limitation on all funding for agencies covered by cjs appropriations , pursuant to section 626 of title vi of the cjsappropriations sections of the omnibus measure ( h.r .

4328 ) .

this section provided that all funding wouldcease to be available after june 15 , 1999 , unless continued by enactment of another appropriations measure by thatdate .

 ( the reason for this limitation was congressional concern about the proposed use of statistical sampling in the 2000decennial census .

the supreme court ruled on january 25 , 1999 , that the census statute , 13 u.s.c. , prohibits thisuse toderive population data for house reapportionment , although the ruling left unresolved related issues such as the useofsampling in the census to produce data for within - state redistricting. ) .

section 626 , title vi , was repealed by h.r .

1141 , fy1999 emergency supplemental appropriations , which became law on may 21 , 1999 .

h.r .

1141 included an additional $44.9 million for the 2000 census in fy1999 , provided that congressreceived , by june 1 , 1999 , a revised fy2000 budget submission for the census , with detailed justification .

therevisedsubmission requested an extra $1.7 billion for the census in fy2000 .

the senate appropriations committee,reporting s. 1217 , approved the administration's original fy2000 request of $2.8 billion for the census , without theadditional amount .

the full senate also approved $2.8 billion .

in the house version of the bill , the cjsappropriationssubcommittee approved $4.5 billion designated as emergency spending .

the full appropriations committeeapproved thisamount in its markup of the measure on july 30 , 1999 , as did the house when it passed h.r .

2670 on august5 .

it is important to note that during the final days of the 105th congress , congress approved a special supplementalappropriation for fy1999 to provide funds for american farmers affected by natural disasters and low commodityprices,embassy security and counter - terrorism as a result of the august embassy bombings , ( 9 ) meeting the year 2000 ( y2k ) computer requirements , covering the costs of maintaining the u.s. troops in bosnia , defense readiness,counter - narcoticsinterdiction initiatives , and domestic natural disaster needs .

this funding totaling $20.8 billion was included invarioussections of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1999 ( p.l .

105-277 ) .

the supplemental appropriations relating to agencies covered by the fy1999 cjs appropriations ( which are containedin samepublic law ) are reflected in the fy1999 agency totals contained in this report .

the creation , legislative authority , and principal activities of the major agencies covered by the cjsappropriationslegislation for each fiscal year are described below .

brief descriptions of most of the related agencies covered bythelegislation are also included in this section .

the 106th congress addressed a number of issues during the cjs appropriations process for fy2000 .

majorissuesincluded: extending the 1994 crime act funding beyond fy2000 under the violent crime reduction fund,eliminatingmost funding for title iii crime prevention programs , funding for programs that would reduce violence in schoolsand thatwould address missing children under the safe schools initiatives , the adequacy of immigration and naturalizationservicefunding and the possible need for reorganizing the federal immigration system ; the downsizing of commercedepartmentprograms , funding and sampling needs for the decennial census , the use of federal funds to support industrialtechnology,and implementing the modernization of the national weather service ; the funding controversy regarding u.s.contributionsto international organizations ( particularly the payment of arrears to the united nations ) and u.s. peacekeepingoperations , the reorganization of foreign policy agencies and a $3 billion advance appropriations request from theadministration forembassy security in fy2001-2005 ; the adequacy of funding to maintain essential services and security in the lowercourts ; the merits of a pay increase for federal judges ; how to contain the growing costs of the judiciary's defender servicesaccount ; and whether to increase funding to compensate court - appointed defense attorneys in federal criminal cases .

as noted earlier in this report , the government performance and results act ( gpra ) passed by congress in1993 ( p.l.103-62 ) requires that agencies develop strategic plans that contain goals , objectives , and performance measures forallmajor programs .

in its report on the cjs appropriations bill ( s. 2260 ; s.rept .

105-235 , pp .

5-6 ) , the senateappropriations committee made the following evaluation regarding agency compliance with gpra requirements: the committee has received a number of strategic plans from different organizations receiving appropriated funds within the bill .

the committee found weaknesses with the fiscal year1999performance plans of the departments of commerce and state and the small business administration .

thecommittee wasespecially troubled by the lack of results - oriented , measurable goals in the performance plans .

the committee isalsoconcerned that the plans did not uniformly display clear linkages between performance goals and the programactivities inagencies' budget requests .

also , some plans did not sufficiently describe approaches to produce credibleperformanceinformation .

the committee considers the full and effective implementation of the results act to be a priority forallagencies under its jurisdiction .

we recognize that implementation will be an interactive process , likely to involveseveralappropriations cycles .

the committee will consider agencies' progress in addressing weaknesses in strategic andannualperformance plans in tandem with their funding requests in light of their strategic goals .

this effort will helpdeterminewhether any changes or realignments would facilitate a more accurate and informed presentation of budgetaryinformation.agencies are encouraged to consult with the committee as they consider such revisions prior to finalizing anyrequests .

the plan prepared by the department of justice was given high marks by the committee .

it stated that: "the plan wasreceived in a timely fashion and contained objective , measurable performance goals .

the strength of theperformanceplans was its presentation of reasonably clear strategies for its intended performance goals. .

 ( 59 ) in its report on its version of the cjs bill , the house appropriations committee in 1998 noted that "performance planshave generally been of mixed utility in considering the fiscal year budget request. .

the committee requests that eachagency consult with it early in the process of formulating the budget and performance plan for fy2000 , to improvetheplan's usefulness to the committee when it examines the fy2000 request ( h.rept .

105-636 , p .

8. ) .

in its report on the fy2000 cjs appropriations , the senate appropriations committee stated that it had "...sent amemorandum to all organizations subject to gpra funded within this act .

it requested information about theagencies'experiences resulting from the act .

the committee reiterates that all responses be provided no latter than july 1,1999. .

 ( 60 ) brief descriptions of the latest versions of the strategic plans of the major agencies covered by cjsappropriations arecontained in the discussions of the fy2000 budget requests of individual agencies included in this crs report .

the table below shows funding trends for the major agencies included in cjs appropriations over the periodfy1995-fy1999 .

as seen in the table below , funding increased , in current dollars , for the department of justice by$5,871 million ( or 47.6% ) ; for the department of commerce by $1,020 million ( or 25 % ) ; and for judiciary $748million ( or 25.8% ) .
