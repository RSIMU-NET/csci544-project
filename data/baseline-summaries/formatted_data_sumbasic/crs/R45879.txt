for more than 65 years , the u.s. congress has funded international food assistance through the food for peace program ( ffp ) to alleviate hunger and improve global food security .

u.s. food assistance comes in the form of in - kind food commodities purchased in the united states and shipped overseas , and through market - based approaches .

market - based approaches include purchasing food in foreign local and regional markets and then redistributing it , and providing food vouchers and cash transfers that recipients can use to buy food locally .

the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , the lead development and humanitarian arm of the u.s. government , administers the majority of u.s. international food assistance .

within the agency , the office of food for peace manages the ffp program , which provides both emergency and nonemergency food aid .

nonemergency programming once represented a significant portion of ffp , but this portion has declined ( from 83% in fy1959 to 11% in fy2018 ) as emergency needs have continued to rise and ffp has received emergency funding from additional accounts ( see figure 3 ) .

the bureau for food security ( bfs ) , within usaid , manages agricultural development and nutrition programs , which support food security goals but are not considered food aid under the umbrella of the feed the future initiative ( ftf ) .

the distinctions between ffp nonemergency programs and bfs development programs are found in authorizing legislation , funding flows , and congressional jurisdiction .

this report focuses primarily on ffp's nonemergency activities .

it explains current programs , legislative history , and funding trends .

the report also discusses how ffp nonemergency programs fit within the broader food aid and food security assistance framework , and the future of ffp nonemergency programs in the context of related trump administration proposals .

finally , this report explores the challenges congress faces in conducting oversight of u.s. international food assistance programs , which fall under two separate congressional committee jurisdictions .

in fy2018 , food for peace ( both emergency and nonemergency programs ) operated in 59 countries and reached more than 76 million recipients .

however , ffp had active nonemergency programs in only 15 countriesâmost of which were in sub - saharan africa , with the remaining in latin america and the caribbean , and asia .

ffp nonemergency programs seek to aid the poorest of the poor by addressing the root causes of hunger and making vulnerable communities more resilient to shocks , both natural and human - induced .

programs generally last five years and , according to ffp , "aim to reduce chronic malnutrition among children under five and pregnant or lactating women , increase and diversify household income , provide opportunities for microfinance and savings , and support agricultural programs that build resilience and reduce vulnerability to shocks and stresses. .

common types of ffp nonemergency activities include in - kind food , cash or voucher distributions , educational programs to encourage dietary diversity and promote consumption of vitamin - and protein - rich foods , farmer training on agricultural value chains and climate - sensitive agriculture , and conflict sensitivity training for local leaders .

in building resilience in vulnerable communities , ffp seeks to reduce the need for future emergency assistance and pave the way for communities to pursue longer - term development goals .

with few exceptions , nonemergency programs are implemented by nongovernmental organization ( ngo ) partners .

examples of the range of ffp nonemergency programs include the following: strengthening household ability to respond to development opportunities ( shouhardo iii ) in bangladesh began in 2015 to improve "gender equitable food and nutrition security and resilience of the vulnerable people" in two of the country's regions .

usaid identified four areas of concern on which interventions should focus: gender inequality and women's disempowerment , social accountability , youth , and climate adaptation .

care , a nonprofit organization that formed in post - world war ii to distribute food packages in europe , implements shouardo iii .

the program's goal is to reach 384,000 participants through activities that address climate change and disaster resilience training , supplementary food distributions for pregnant and lactating women , youth skills training , the organization of microenterprise groups , and water supply and sanitation activities , among others .

shouhardo iii is one of the few ffp nonemergency programs that includes a monetization component .

in fy2018 , shouhardo received more than $18 million in ffp title ii funding .

the program is scheduled to run through the end of fy2020 .

tuendelee pamoja ii in the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) was initiated in 2016 to improve food security and resilience among 214,000 households in selected provinces , with a special focus on women and youth .

food for the hungry , an international christian relief , development , and advocacy organization , implements the program .

interventions include the distribution and testing of new varieties of soybeans , beans , and maize ; construction of planting terraces to reduce land erosion ; training on fishing practices ; literacy and numeracy education ; and youth training in wood - and metal - working ; among others .

the program received more than $15 million in ffp title ii funding in fy2018 and is scheduled to run through the end of 2021 .

njira pathways to sustainable food security in malawi began in 2014 with the aim of improving food security for more than 244,000 vulnerable people in selected districts in malawi .

the programs were designed to address feed the future ( ftf ) - established food security goals for the country and to complement other ftf programs and development goals under usaid / malawi mission's country development cooperation strategy .

project concern international ( pci ) , a global development program established in 1961 , implements the njira project ; its activities include distributing livestock and offering animal health services to improve livestock production , increasing access to and participation in women's empowerment savings and loan groups , conducting farmer training to combat fall armyworm , and distributing food rations to children under five .

in fy2018 , the njira project received nearly $2 million in ffp title ii nonemergency funds and nearly $2.5 million in community development funds ( cdf ) .

the project is slated to run through late 2019 .

the food for peace program was established in 1954 with the passage of the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 ( p.l .

83-480 ) .

title ii of the act authorized the use of surplus agricultural commodities to "[meet] famine or other urgent relief requirements" around the world and provided the general authority for ffp development programs .

now referred to as the food for peace act , the program has evolved to reflect changes in domestic farm policy and in response to foreign policy developments .

congress authorizes the majority of international food assistance programs , including the ffp program , in two pieces of legislation: the farm bill .

typically renewed every five years , legislation commonly referred to as the farm bill is a multiyear authorization that governs a range of agricultural and food programs .

the majority of farm bill - authorized programs are domestic , but title iii includes the food for peace act as subtitle a .

in the most recent farm bill , the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-334 ) , congress authorized programs through fy2023 .

the global food security act of 2016 ( gfsa ) .

congress enacted the global food security act of 2016 ( p.l .

114-195 ) to direct the president to coordinate the development of a whole - of - government global food security strategy and to provide food assistance pursuant to the foreign assistance act of 1961 ( p.l .

87-195 ; 22 u.s.c .

2151 et seq. ) .

the gfsa also amended sections 491 and 492 of the 1961 act ( 22 u.s.c .

2292 et seq. ) .

to establish the emergency food security program ( efsp ) under international disaster assistance authorities , which ffp uses to provide emergency food assistance primarily through market - based approaches such as local and regional procurement ( lrp ) , vouchers , and cash transfers for food .

an extension of gfsa ( p.l .

115-266 ) was enacted in 2018 and authorizes programs through fy2023 .

food for peace nonemergency programs , in particular the title ii in - kind commodity purchase and distribution components , have historically received considerable bipartisan support from a broad domestic constituency .

this support is a result of the program's link to u.s. farmers and shippers through the farm bill's statutory requirements .

while ffp emergency responses make up the majority of the u.s. in - kind programming , the nonemergency food assistance programs share the same domestic connections .

in a prepared statement for the house agriculture committee in relation to a 2017 hearing on the farm bill , the chairperson of the usa rice farmers board shared the board's support of u.s. international food aid programs , noting that while u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) commodity procurement - purchases comprise only between 1% and 2% of total rice exports , "it is important to the industry that we continue to play a strong role in providing our nation's agricultural bounty to those in need. .

in written testimony for the house subcommittee on agriculture appropriations , the senior director of policy and advocacy at mercy corps stated that "from our decades of experience working in fragile states , we have found non - emergency ffp programs to be the leading us government tool , for building the resilience of families and communities to food insecurityâ¦ .

[w]ith these investments , we can prevent and mitigate food security crises. .

further , ffp has a close relationship with the u.s. maritime industry as a result of longstanding but evolving requirements that a percentage of ffp commodities be shipped on u.s. - flagged vessels .

these agricultural cargo preference requirements can sometimes create tension ; the u.s. maritime administration asserts that agricultural cargo preference is critical to maintaining u.s. sealift capacity while ffp often expresses concern about how the increased cost of adhering to agricultural cargo preference affects its ability to meet the needs of the world's most food insecure populations .

despite this tension , the maritime industry remains engaged and active in ffp programming and has been a vocal advocate for the commodity - based programs .

these historic links to the u.s. agriculture and maritime industries have been a significant factor when congress considers legislation .

consistent with the two authorization vehicles described above , food assistance funds are appropriated through both agriculture appropriations ( for farm bill - authorized programs ) and department of state , foreign operations and related programs ( sfops ) appropriations ( for gfsa - authorized programs ) .

funds for nonemergency programs come from two accounts: the food for peace title ii grants account within the foreign agricultural service in agriculture appropriations .

ffp has received food for peace title ii grants since its establishment .

the development assistance ( da ) account within sfops appropriations .

ffp receives da fundsâdesignated as community development funds ( cdf ) âfrom bfs to complement its title ii nonemergency resources and improve coordination between ffp and bfs .

first legislated in fy2010 , congress intended cdf funds be used to help ffp reduce its reliance on monetizationâthe practice of partners selling u.s. commodities on local markets and using the proceeds to fund nonemergency programs .

the level of cdf that ffp receives from bfs is not required by law ; however , congress has designated funds for cdf in the report accompanying annual appropriations ( sometimes referred to as a "soft earmark" ) to which usaid has adhered each fiscal year .

ffp receives additional funding for emergency food programs through the international disaster assistance ( ida ) account within sfops appropriations .

in fy2010 , ffp started receiving ida funds for the emergency food security program ( efsp ) to supplement its title ii emergency funds .

in fy2018 , food for peace received nearly half of its resources through agriculture appropriations ( see figure 2 ) .

of its overall funding , ffp used 11% ( $431 million ) for nonemergency programsâfunded both through title ii and cdfâand 89% ( $3.250 billion ) for emergency programs .

as previously mentioned , this was a marked change from the early years of the ffp program .

when the title ii program was established , nonemergency programs constituted 65% of funding .

while their share of overall programming rose in the first few years of the programâin 1959 , they made up 83% of title ii programmingâthe share steadily declined in the following decades .

by 2007 , nonemergency programming accounted for 20% of title ii funds ( see figure 3 ) .

the following year , congress established a minimum level ( in u.s. dollars ) of nonemergency food assistance in the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) .

the nonemergency minimum has been maintained in subsequent authorizations but has fallen by $10 million since it was first added to the bill ( see table 1 ) .

the most recent farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) , enacted in december 2018 , set the minimum level of nonemergency food assistance at $365 million but allowed for community development funds and the farmer - to - farmer program funds to be counted toward the minimum .

the 116 th congress may be interested in a number of issues related to food for peace nonemergency programs .

areas of interest may include proposed and ongoing reforms to the ffp program funding and structure that could change both how nonemergency programs fit into the broader landscape of u.s. international food assistance programs , and the means through which the program is funded .

with enactment of the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) , food for peace title ii nonemergency programs are authorized through fy2023 .

however , the administration continues to propose the elimination of the ffp title ii program in its annual budget requests .

by moving forward with usaid's transformation initiative , the administration is implementing changes to organizational structures through which nonemergency food assistance programs are administered .

congress may consider addressing its priorities for ffp nonemergency programs in annual appropriations legislation , stand - alone bills that address certain components of the program , and transformation - related consultations .
