the energy and water development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

figure 1 compares the major components of the energy and water development bill from fy2017 through the fy2020 request .

president trump submitted his fy2020 detailed budget proposal to congress on march 18 , 2019 ( after submitting a general budget overview on march 11 ) .

the budget requests for agencies included in the energy and water development appropriations bill total $38.02 billion — $6.64 billion ( 15% ) below the fy2019 appropriation .

 ( see table 3 . ) .

a $1.309 billion increase ( 12% ) is proposed for doe nuclear weapons activities .

for fy2019 , the conference agreement on h.r .

5895 ( h.rept .

115-929 ) provided total energy and water development appropriations of $44.66 billion — 3% above the fy2018 level and 23% above the fy2019 request .

the bill was signed by the president on september 21 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-244 ) .

figures for fy2019 exclude emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $17.419 billion provided to usace and doe for natural disaster response by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) , signed february 9 , 2018 .

for more details , see crs report r45258 , energy and water development: fy2019 appropriations , by mark holt and corrie e. clark , and crs report r45326 , army corps of engineers annual and supplemental appropriations: issues for congress , by nicole t. carter .

the fy2020 budget request proposes substantial reductions from the fy2019 enacted level for doe energy research and development ( r&d ) programs , including a reduction of $178 million ( - 24% ) in fossil fuels and $502 million ( - 38% ) in nuclear energy .

energy efficiency and renewable energy r&d would decline by $1.724 billion ( - 83% ) .

doe science programs would be reduced by $1.039 billion ( - 16% ) .

programs targeted by the budget for elimination or phaseout include energy efficiency grants , the advanced research projects agency — energy ( arpa - e ) , and loan guarantee programs .

funding would be reduced for usace by $2.172 billion ( - 31% ) , and reclamation and cup by $462 million ( - 29% ) .

congress did not enact similar reductions included in the fy2018 and fy2019 budget requests .

several issues raised by the administration's budget request could generate controversy during congressional consideration of energy and water development appropriations for fy2020 .

the issues described in this section — listed approximately in the order the affected agencies appear in the energy and water development bill — were selected based on the total funding involved , the percentage of proposed increases or decreases , and potential impact on broader public policy considerations .

 table 1 indicates the steps during consideration of fy2020 energy and water development appropriations .

 ( for more details , see the crs appropriations status table at http: / / www.crs.gov / appropriationsstatustable / index . ) .

as of the publication date of this report , no markups had been held .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2011 through fy2019 , plus the fy2020 request .

the annual energy and water development appropriations bill includes four titles: title i — corps of engineers — civil ; title ii — department of the interior ( central utah project and bureau of reclamation ) ; title iii — department of energy ; and title iv — independent agencies , as shown in table 3 .

major programs in the bill are described in this section in the approximate order they appear in the bill .

previous appropriations and budget recommendations for fy2020 are shown in the accompanying tables , and additional details about many of these programs are provided in separate crs reports as indicated .

for a discussion of current funding issues related to these programs , see " funding issues and initiatives ," above .

congressional clients may obtain more detailed information by contacting crs analysts listed in crs report r42638 , appropriations: crs experts , by james m. specht and justin murray .

independent agencies that receive funding in title iv of the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the defense nuclear facilities safety board .

nrc is by far the largest of the independent agencies , with a total budget of more than $900 million .

however , as noted in the description of nrc below , about 90% of nrc's budget is offset by fees , so that the agency's net appropriation is less than half of the total funding in title iv .

the recent appropriations history for all the title iv agencies is shown in table 7 .

the following hearings have been held by the energy and water development subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees on the fy2020 budget request .
