the congressional research service receives numerous requests for lists of recipients of the medal of honor ( moh ) , the nation's highest award for military bravery .

since its first presentation in 1863 , there have been nearly 3,500 recipients of the medals of honor .

in 1973 and 1979 , the senate veterans' affairs committee issued committee print 8 , vietnam era medal of honor recipients: 1964-1972 , and committee print 3 , medal of honor recipients: 1863-1978 .

each print lists recipients and provides the full text of the citations describing the actions that resulted in the awarding of the moh .

since the release of the committee prints , there have been several additions and changes to the list of recipients of this award .

this report covers additions and changes to the list of recipients of the medal since the release of the above - mentioned committee prints .

an asterisk ( * ) indicates those individuals who were awarded their medals posthumously .

the citations are written in draft form by the time the recommendation packet leaves the hands of the individual's co ( commanding officer ) .

thus the originator of the citation is whomever the co has detailed to compile the evidence and eyewitness statements .

it's called the "proposed citation" and is a whole section of the form .

as the citation is processed through the chain of command , it is edited .

the final citation that is read at the presentation ceremony is a composite work completed by everyone in the chain of command .

further detailed information about the recommendation process may be found at http: / / www.army.mil / medalofhonor / process.html .

most citations are published in a department of the army general order by the u.s. army human resources command , awards and decorations branch at http: / / www.apd.army.mil / adminpubs / dago_by_year.asp .

however , the congressional medal of honor society may occasionally publish citations before the awards and decorations branch publishes them .

the citations are also published by the department of the army center of military history .

links to additional agencies and internet sites concerned with awards for valor are provided at the end of this report .

the congressional medal of honor society ( cmohs ) was congressionally chartered and signed into law by president dwight d. eisenhower on august 5 , 1958 , for the purpose of encouraging patriotism and honoring all recipients of the moh .

it contains all moh citations along with historical information , statistics , and information pertinent to the award .

it may be accessed at http: / / www.cmohs.org .

in some instances , congress approved legislation to remove statutory time limits in order for the moh to be awarded .

where this has occurred , the legislation is cited .

date of issue information , if not provided by cmohs or the military branches , was located on the website of military times / home of heroes at http: / / www.homeofheroes.com / a_homepage / community.html or through news reports .

the fy1996 national defense authorization act ( p.l .

104-106 , title v , subtitle c , section 524 ) provided for the review of records relating to asian americans and native american pacific islanders who received distinguished service crosses or navy crosses for service during world war ii .

this legislation also waived the time limit to allow the president to award the moh ; consequently , 22 asian americans received the moh .

the fy1997 national defense authorization act ( p.l .

104-201 , title v , subtitle g , sections 561 and 562 september 23 , 1996 ) waived the time limit to allow the president to award the moh to seven african american soldiers for their heroic acts during world war ii .

 ( some military personnel records were destroyed for these individuals in a 1973 fire at the national personnel records center .

records were reconstructed from auxiliary sources ; therefore , the place indicated after the date of birth is the home of record at the time the individual entered the military , and not necessarily the place of birth .

data on the place where the individual entered service is often not available. ) .

in 2002 , through the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 , congress requested that the department of defense ( dod ) review records of veterans of jewish or hispanic heritage from world war ii to later periods .

earlier measures provided in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 authorized review of the records of african americans who may have also been eligible for the award .

dod's review resulted in 19 veterans approved to be recipients of the moh .

an additional five were named after a review of recipients of the distinguished service cross .

president obama presented the moh posthumously to 21 veterans and three living recipients on march 18 , 2014 .

most recently , on november 6 , 2014 , president obama awarded the moh to representatives of first lieutenant alonzo h. cushing for his actions at the battle of gettysburg , july 3 , 1863 .
