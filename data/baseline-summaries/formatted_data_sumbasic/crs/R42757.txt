t he national park service ( nps ) administers the national park system , which covers 85 million acres of land and consists of 417 diverse units valued for their natural , cultural , and recreational importance .

nps generally receives appropriations in the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill .

this report examines trends in the agency's discretionary appropriations over the past decade ( fy2009-fy2018 ) and related issues and congressional actions .

it also discusses changes in the size of the national park system , numbers of recreational visits to the parks , and nps staffing levels during that period .

nps's discretionary appropriations fluctuated during the past decade ( fy2009-fy2018 ) .

appropriations in the decade's first and last years were highest , partially owing to supplemental appropriations in both years .

with the supplementals included , discretionary appropriations totaled $3.276 billion in fy2009 and $3.460 billion in fy2018 .

the fy2018 figure was 5.6% higher than fy2009 in nominal dollars but 8.0% lower when adjusted for inflation ( figure 1 and table 1 ) .

excluding supplementals , nps's fy2018 appropriations were 26.8% higher than fy2009 appropriations in nominal dollars and 10.5% higher in inflation - adjusted dollars .

in either case , the main trend was decline in the first part of the decade and increase in the second part .

the supplemental appropriations consisted of economic stimulus measures in fy2009 ( p.l .

111-5 , the american recovery and reinvestment act ) and appropriations for hurricane recovery in fy2013 ( p.l .

113-2 ) and fy2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) .

these funds were provided outside of regular appropriations laws and were not subject to discretionary spending caps .

during the decade , nps's appropriations were primarily organized in five accounts that cover basic park operations ( operation of the national park system , or onps , account ) ; construction and repair of infrastructure ( construction account ) ; assistance to state , local , tribal , and private land managers ( national recreation and preservation account ) ; grants to states and localities for historic preservation ( historic preservation fund ) ; and land acquisition by both nps and the states ( land acquisition and state assistance account ) .

by far the largest share of nps's discretionary appropriations — 72% in fy2018 — went to the onps account , which covers basic park operations ( figure 2 and table 2 ) .

in addition to these five accounts , during five years of the past decade ( fy2010 and fy2015-fy2018 ) , congress appropriated funds for a sixth account , the centennial challenge account .

the account provides the federal share of matching grants for "signature" park projects and programs , primarily aimed at addressing the agency's substantial backlog of deferred maintenance on its infrastructure .

changes in nps appropriations can be considered in the context of the national park system's size , the number of visits to the parks , and nps staffing levels , among other factors .

over the past decade , the acreage of the national park system remained relatively stable , growing by 0.8% , while 26 new units were added .

visitation peaked in 2016 and was generally higher in the second part of the decade than the first .

staffing levels fluctuated around 20,000 during the past 10 years .

nps's appropriations fluctuated over the past decade , and supplemental appropriations notably increased the totals in fy2009 , fy2013 , and fy2018 .

counting the supplementals , the total nps discretionary appropriation for fy2018 was 5.6% higher than fy2009 in nominal dollars but 8.0% lower in inflation - adjusted dollars .

excluding supplementals , the fy2018 appropriation was higher than fy2009 in both nominal ( +26.8% ) and inflation - adjusted ( +10.5% ) dollars .

the overall trend was one of decline in the first part of the decade and growth in the second part .

the share of total appropriations represented by each individual account in the nps portfolio also fluctuated , and overall changes in share vary depending on whether or not supplemental appropriations are counted .

the funding changes took place in the context of a park system of relatively stable size and a staffing level that hovered around 20,000 .

although park acreage grew only slightly , 26 units were added to the system during the decade .

visits to the parks generally were higher in the second half of the decade than the first and peaked in 2016 at approximately 331 million visits .

a major funding issue for nps is infrastructure reinvestment .

the agency's backlog of deferred maintenance and repairs for its infrastructure was estimated at $11.61 billion for fy2017 .

funding for both of the discretionary appropriations accounts that mainly address deferred maintenance ( onps and construction ) decreased over the decade if supplementals are counted in the measurement but increased if supplementals are excluded .

nps's infrastructure needs continue to receive attention in the 115 th congress , both within and outside the annual appropriations process .
