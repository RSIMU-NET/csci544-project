on december 30 , 2005 , president bush signed the department of defense appropriation for fy2006 ( p.l .

109-148 ) , legislation that affects foreign operations spending in three ways .

the defense appropriation includes $3.8 billion for addressing the avian influenza virus , of which $131.5 million is available to usaid for international surveillance , planning , preparedness , and response .

p.l .

109-148 further rescinds $25 million from the export - import bank as part of a large package to offset the costs of relief for victims of hurricane katrina .

finally , the defense appropriation enacts a 1% across - the - board reduction for most non - emergency discretionary appropriations , resulting in a reduction in foreign operations spending of approximately $209 million from the amount approved earlier for fy2006 .

previously , on november 14 , 2005 , president bush signed into law a $20.94 billion foreign operations appropriation for fy2006 ( p.l .

109-102 ; h.r .

3057 ) .

 ( the net total for foreign operations , after adjusting for supplemental funds and rescissions enacted in p.l .

109-148 , is $20.83 billion. ) .

the house passed the conference report ( h.rept .

109-265 ) on november 4 ( 358-39 ) , while the senate approved it on november 10 ( 91-0 ) .

conferees decided to separate the state department and related agencies portion of the senate - passed measure , and address those funding and policy issues as part of the science , state , justice , and commerce appropriation ( h.r .

2862 ) .

the enacted foreign operations appropriations , adjusted for supplementals and rescissions in p.l .

109-148 , falls $2.1 billion , or 9.3% below the president's request , and represents by far the largest cut in regular ( non - supplemental ) foreign operations spending relative to the administration's proposal during the bush administration .

the total , however , remains about $1.4 billion higher than the regular fy2005 foreign aid spending measure ( excluding emergency and supplemental appropriations ) , and falls between the house - passed $20.27 billion level and the senate - passed $22.16 billion amount .

conferees made the largest reduction to the president's proposed $3 billion millennium challenge account , paring the appropriation down to $1.77 billion .

for nearly every other account , the enacted bill also sets spending at or somewhat below requested levels .

p.l .

109-102 further reduces the president's $459 million request for iraq to $61 million .

in a few selected areas , however , the enacted measure adds funds .

appropriations for the three "core" bilateral development aid accounts of child survival / health , development assistance , and the global aids initiative are $5.2 billion , or 10.5% higher than the request , and aid to the former soviet states is set at $514 million , 6.6% more than proposed .

the conference agreement further adds to spending for the african and inter - american foundations , voluntary contributions to international organizations , and establishes a new democracy fund of $95 million as proposed by the senate .

the total amount for hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis programs , across all foreign operations accounts , is $2.82 billion , up from the president's $2.56 billion request .

this includes $450 million for the global fund , higher than the $200 million request .

for family planning , p.l .

109-102 provides $466 million — $432 million in bilateral funding and $34 million as a contribution to the u.n. population fund ( unfpa ) .

this compares to a $425 million total request .

on key policy issues , the conference agreement deletes senate - passed provisions that would have reversed the mexico city family planning policy and altered the kemp - kasten restrictions that apply to u.s. contributions to the u.n. population fund ( unfpa ) .

the enacted measure also stipulates that a portion of u.s. assistance to egypt must support democracy , human rights , and governance programs .

amounts appropriated for foreign operations programs and for the department of state and related agencies comprise about 97% of the total international affairs budget and represent roughly 7% of discretionary budget authority under the jurisdiction of house and senate appropriations committees .

at the beginning of the 109 th congress , house and senate committees on appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures .

the house panel reduced the number of subcommittees to ten and reconfigured several of their jurisdictions .

these changes , however , do not affect the previous organizations for foreign operations and state department / broadcasting programs .

the jurisdiction of the house foreign operations committee remains the same , while state department , broadcasting , and related activities continue to be funded within the re - titled subcommittee on science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies ( ssjc ) .

the senate appropriations committee chose to restructure its subcommittees differently from the house by maintaining twelve sub - panels .

the senate configuration combined foreign operations with the state department , broadcasting , and related agencies , creating a re - titled subcommittee on state , foreign operations and related programs .

subsequently , in late october , house and senate appropriations committees agreed that for fy2006 , appropriation bill jurisdictions would follow the house structure .

consequently , state department funds were removed from the senate - passed legislation ( h.r .

3507 ) and are incorporated in h.r .

2862 , the ssjc measure .

this report covers funding and policy issues related to foreign operations , as addressed in the house and senate , and state department programs as debated in the senate .

the discussion and accompanying tables are designed to track the house foreign operations appropriation measure , as well as the broader senate state , foreign operations spending bill .

to read about state department / broadcasting issues within the context of the house ssjc appropriation measure and the final conference report , see crs report rl32885 , science , state , justice , commerce and related agencies ( house ) / commerce , justice , science and related agencies ( senate ) : fy2006 appropriations , coordinated by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] .

while appropriation bills funding foreign aid , state department operations , embassy construction , public diplomacy , and contributions to international organizations can address the entire range of u.s. foreign policy issues , the fy2006 budget request posed several key matters that the 109 th congress closely examined and debated .

for foreign operations programs , major issues included: the overall size of the request — a 15.7% increase over regular fy2005 foreign operations funds — and whether competing budget proposals for domestic programs and efforts to reduce the deficit would permit full funding of the $22.83 billion recommendation .

foreign aid in support of the global war on terror and whether the fy2006 request fully addressed this high national security priority , including resources for reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan .

the millennium challenge account and whether progress thus far on this new , innovative foreign aid program justified a doubling of its budget in fy2006 .

hiv / aids funding and whether the 12.5% funding increase for fy2006 and the implementation and allocation of resources , including those for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis , and malaria , were fully meeting the vision of the president's $15 billion initiative .

"core" development and humanitarian aid programs and whether proposed funding reductions for some activities and account restructuring to enhance flexibility were justified .

on state department operations , key policy and funding issues included: the u.s. embassy in iraq and funding for ongoing operations , security , and construction .

public diplomacy: educational and cultural exchange funds would increase in fy2006 by 21% and broadcasting operations by 10% .

international peacekeeping contributions would rise by 114% over fy2005 regular appropriation levels for new operations in sudan and elsewhere .

democracy promotion activities , emphasized by president bush and secretary of state rice , was highlighted by a 35% increase in funds for the national endowment for democracy .

arguably , from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s , the underlying rationale for foreign aid and diplomatic efforts was the defeat of communism .

u.s. aid programs were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms , in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances .

other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies and friendly states , some of which faced soviet or soviet - proxy threats .

aid programs also were used to help the united states gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american forces .

diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the soviet threat .

foreign aid and diplomatic programs also supported a number of secondary u.s. policy goals in the developing world , such as reducing high rates of population growth , promoting wider access to health care , expanding the availability of basic education , advancing u.s. trade interests , and protecting the environment .

if these secondary goals were also achieved , u.s. aid programs could be promoted as delivering "more bang for the buck. .

with the end of the cold war , the focus of american foreign policy shifted to support more extensively other u.s. national interests , including stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs , expanding peace efforts in the middle east , seeking solutions to conflicts around the globe , protecting human rights , countering trafficking in persons .

usually , appropriations committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted a budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302 ( a ) allocation process .

section 302 ( a ) is the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act .

following this , house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their subcommittees , staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution .

this second step is referred to as the section 302 ( b ) allocation .

foreign operations and state department funds fall within the international affairs budget function ( function 150 ) , representing in most years about 67% and 30% , respectively , of the function total .

the other major component of function 150 — international food assistance — is funded in the agriculture spending measure .

how much international affairs money to allocate among each of the subcommittees with jurisdiction , and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs , are decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees .

nevertheless , overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the house and senate subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills .

on march 17 , 2005 , both houses approved budget resolutions for fy2006 ( h.con.res .

95 and s.con.res .

18 ) that reduce the amount of discretionary budget authority for international affairs funding compared with the president's request .

the house measure cut function 150 by about $1.6 billion , or 4.7% , while the senate resolution set discretionary spending roughly $350 million , or 1% , below the administration's proposal .

the final agreement on h.con.res .

95 , which cleared both houses on april 28 , cut deeper into the international affairs budget function than either of the earlier resolutions .

as approved , function 150 was set at $31.37 billion for fy2006 , about $2.4 billion , or 7% , less than the president's request .

house and senate appropriations committees , however , can choose to allocate the final amount set out in the budget resolution among the various subcommittees with jurisdiction over the international affairs budget proportionally different than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities .

depending on other competing priorities , the final allocations can diverge significantly from those assumed in the budget resolution .

nevertheless , the size of the reduction compared with the executive request approved in the budget resolution created a challenging budget picture for appropriation subcommittees with jurisdiction over foreign operations and state department / broadcasting programs .

the house appropriations committee announced its subcommittee allocations on may 5 , providing $20.27 billion to the foreign operations subcommittee , a level $2.55 billion , or 11% , below the administration's recommendation .

during each of the past two years , the house foreign operations subcommittee was able to absorb more modest reductions to the president's request largely by paring back large increases proposed by the president for the millennium challenge account .

once again the executive branch sought a substantial increase for the mca — doubling its budget to $3 billion .

as discussed elsewhere in this report , even though the house subcommittee decided on june 16 again to recommend a sizable cut to the mca proposal ( $1.75 billion ) , it also had to make reductions across a number of other programs and accounts in order to meet its allocation target .

for state department and related programs , the implications of the house sec .

302 ( b ) allocations were less clear because these funds are merged with a range of domestic agencies .

however , the $57.5 billion house ssjc subcommittee allocation was 5.2% less than the administration's request .

state department programs absorbed a relatively small portion of this reduction — $272 million , or 3.7% less than the request — when the house appropriations committee ordered reported the ssjc measure on june 7 .

the situation in the senate was much different , where the state , foreign operations subcommittee had significantly more funds than its house counterparts to support international under its jurisdiction .

the senate 302 ( b ) allocations , issued on june 9 , provide $31.67 billion to the subcommittee , $1 billion , or 3.1% less than the combined state department / foreign operations request .

the comparable totals for the house foreign operations and state department / broadcasting components of the ssjc appropriation were $29.837 billion or about 6% less than the senate allocation .

under the senate plan , the decision to reduce the mca request along the lines of the past two years was able to absorb the entire gap between the president's request for fy2006 and the subcommittee allocation .

as noted elsewhere , the senate passed on july 20 a bill providing $1.8 billion for the mca , $1.2 billion less than the request .

prior to finalizing the foreign operations conference agreement , the committees once again revised the 302 ( b ) allocations , setting the budget authority cap for foreign operations at $20.94 billion .

this level was about $670 million higher than the original house amount , but over $1.2 billion below the senate initial mark .

state department / broadcasting funds included in the senate bill were moved to the ssjc appropriation and were not a factor in the foreign operations final conference allocation .

on february 7 , 2005 , the president submitted his fy2006 budget request , including $22.8 billion for foreign operations and $9.8 billion for state department and related agencies appropriations .

these amounts were 15.7% and 12.2% , respectively , higher than fy2005 amounts enacted in regular , non - supplemental appropriations .

the combined foreign operations / state department request of $32.67 billion was 14.6% larger than regular fy2005 funding .

with passage of the fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations ( h.r .

1268 ) , total foreign operations for fy2005 increased to $22.27 billion , while state department / broadcasting funds rose to $10.78 billion .

comparing the fy2006 request with the total amount enacted for fy2005 — regular and supplemental — found foreign operations increasing for fy2006 by about $550 million , or 2.5% , and state department and related programs decreasing by $943 million , or 8.7% .

the 15.7% increase over regular fy2005 appropriations proposed for foreign operations was one of the largest additions in the president's request for discretionary spending in fy2006 .

by comparison , the administration sought increases for two other high priority budget areas — defense and homeland security — of about 5% and 3% , respectively .

despite the large overall increase for foreign operations , much of the added funding was concentrated in a few areas .

the fy2006 budget continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority , with a 9% increase in aid to the front - line states in the war on terrorism and 12% more funds for global counter - terror programs .

resources would continue to grow for the president's two newest foreign aid initiatives — the millennium challenge account ( mca ) and the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) .

the mca request doubled to $3 billion in fy2006 while foreign operations funds for pepfar would rise from $2.28 billion in fy2005 to $2.56 billion in the fy2006 request .

 ( additional pepfar funds were proposed in the labor / hhs appropriation measure , bringing the total fy2005 pepfar request to $3.16 billion. ) .

after failing to win congressional approval the past three years for a contingency fund that could be used in response to unanticipated foreign policy emergencies , the white house again proposed $100 million for a crisis response fund .

the state department's international narcotics and law enforcement program would also receive a significant funding boost of over 60% , almost entirely to support a nearly three - fold increase in programs to stem opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan .

the administration was also seeking the transfer of about $300 million in food assistance , traditionally funded in the agriculture appropriation measure , to foreign operations and usaid's disaster assistance account in order to enhance the flexibility and lower costs for providing timely emergency food relief overseas .

combined , funding for these major elements of the foreign operations request totaled $12.5 billion , or 26% higher than for fy2005 .

by contrast , the $10.3 billion proposed for all other foreign operations activities was just 4.8% higher than fy2005 regular appropriations amounts .

for the first time in many years , the house and senate appropriations committees did not have identical jurisdictions for each of their respective spending measures .

budgets for the department of state and the broadcasting board of governors ( bbg ) , as well as u.s. contributions to united nations ( u.n. ) international organizations , and u.n. peacekeeping , under the house appropriations committee structure , fell within the science , state , justice , commerce and related agency ( ssjc ) appropriations .

under the new divisions of the senate appropriations committee organization , the state department and bbg programs were combined with foreign operations programs as part of the state , foreign operations and related programs appropriations .

prior to conference on either the ssjc or foreign operations bills , however , the committees agreed to include state department and bbg spending for fy2006 in the ssjc appropriation .

intertwined with the annual appropriations process is the biannual foreign relations authorization that , by law , congress must pass prior to the state department's expenditure of its appropriations .

senator lugar introduced a state department authorization bill for fy2006 and fy2007 ( s. 600 ) on march 10 , 2005 .

representative chris smith introduced a house version of the state department authorization bill ( h.r .

2601 ) for fy2006 and fy2007 on may 24 , 2005 .

on february 7 , 2005 , the administration requested a funding level for the department of state of $9.15 billion , representing a 13.6% increase over the fy2005 regular appropriations .

for international broadcasting , the request of $652 million represents a 10.2% increase over the fy2005 enacted amount .

table 13 summarizes regular and supplemental state department and related agencies' appropriations for fy2004 through fy2006 , while table 16 , found at the end of this report , provides details for each spending account .

on february 14 , 2005 , president bush submitted an $82 billion supplemental appropriation request for fy2005 to provide funds for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the global war on terror , reconstruction in afghanistan , tsunami relief and rehabilitation , and other activities .

the request included $6.3 billion to support a broad range of foreign policy activities: u.s. diplomatic costs in iraq afghanistan reconstruction and counternarcotics programs darfur humanitarian relief and peace implementation aid in sudan war on terrorism assistance , including funds for jordan and pakistan palestinian aid ukraine assistance u.n. peacekeeping contributions broadcasting programs in the middle east tsunami recovery and reconstruction as signed by the president on may 11 ( p.l .

109-13 ; h.r .

1268 ) , lawmakers provided $5.78 billion in new appropriations for state department , foreign aid , tsunami relief , and other foreign policy activities .

this represents a $512 million , or 8% reduction to the president's $6.3 billion request .

conferees , as had earlier house - and senate - passed versions of h.r .

1268 , offset part of these costs by rescinding $1 billion in fy2003-appropriated funds for aid to turkey that had not yet been obligated .

as a result , the "net" appropriation for foreign policy programs in h.r .

1268 is $4.78 billion , or $1.5 billion below the request .

the entire amount is designated as emergency appropriations .

beyond congressional decisions to reduce selected supplemental requests , the conference agreement and the $512 million cut may have significant implications for congress's consideration later this year of regular fy2006 appropriations for foreign operations and the state department .

in some cases , house and senate appropriation committees had expressed the view that some supplemental requests did not require immediate funding and could be addressed during the debate on fy2006 appropriation bills .

this is particularly relevant to the funds proposed for afghanistan reconstruction and economic aid programs in southern sudan .

as noted earlier , congress approved a budget resolution for fy2006 ( h.con.res .

95 ) that assumes a reduction in the president's foreign policy funding request of about $2.4 billion , or 7% .

if house and senate appropriation committees add to the pending fy2006 request some of the items not approved in the fy2005 supplemental conference agreement , the challenge of meeting the budget resolution target for international affairs program will be an even greater challenge .

major recommendations in p.l .

109-13 include the following .

afghanistan reconstruction and police training — $1.78 billion , $262 million less than requested .

this level falls between the house - passed measure ( $1.4 billion ) and the senate ( $2.05 billion ) .

the conference agreement fully funded counter - narcotics activities , but reduces police training by $40 million .

darfur humanitarian aid — at least $238 million , roughly the amount proposed by the president .

the conference agreement , however , added $90 million in food aid world - wide , some of which might be available for darfur , and permitted the transfer of $50 million in support of african union peacekeeping operations in the region .

the house measure had increased the funding level for darfur to $342.4 million .

the senate version approved $242 million , as requested , but added an additional $320 million in food assistance , some of which could be used in darfur , and $90 million that could have been transferred to meet humanitarian and peacekeeping needs .

sudan peace implementation aid — $37 million , as had been included in the house measure .

conferees deleted $63 million in rehabilitation and reconstruction funding .

the senate bill had included the entire $100 million request .

palestinian aid — $200 million , as requested and passed in earlier house and senate votes .

the conference measure set aside $50 million , similar to the senate version , for israel to help facilitate the movement of palestinian people and goods in and out of israel .

none of the funds can be used for direct aid to the palestinian authority .

pakistan military aid — $150 million , as requested .

jordan economic and military aid — $200 million , as requested .

iraq embassy — $592 million , $66 million below the request .

this is the same level as in the senate bill , while the house measure included an amendment barring the use of the funds for construction of the embassy .

peacekeeping — $680 million , $100 million below the request .

the conference amount is higher than both the house ( $580 million ) and senate ( $442 million ) .

tsunami relief and prevention — $656 million for relief and $25.4 million for prevention , the same as in the senate bill .

the house - passed amount was slightly higher .

the conference agreement provided authority ( but not the $45 million requested ) to defer and reschedule debt owed by tsunami - affected countries .

the house bill had not granted such authority .

partners fund and solidarity fund — no funds were provided for the partners fund ( $200 million proposed ) , while the full $200 million request for the solidarity fund was included .

in addition , the conference agreements added $30 million for other global war on terror security assistance , as determined by the president .

the house had denied all funding for these purposes , while the senate approved $225.5 million for the two contingency funds .

ukraine aid — $60 million , as requested and including in the senate measure .

the house had approved $33.7 million .

in addition , similar to the senate , the conference agreement provided $10 million for other regional aid requirements in belarus and the north caucasus .

haiti assistance — $20 million , of which $2.5 million for criminal case management , case tracking , and the reduction of pre - trial detention in haiti , similar to the senate position .

the $20 million had not been requested or included by the house .

iraqi families and communities affected by military operations — $20 million for civilians who have suffered losses due to military activities , similar to a senate - added provision .

these funds will be drawn from the $18.44 billion appropriated in p.l .

108-106 , the fy2004 emergency supplemental for iraq reconstruction .
