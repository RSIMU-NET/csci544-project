social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) is a federal social insurance program that provides monthly cash benefits to non - elderly disabled workers and their eligible dependents provided the worker paid into the system for a sufficient number of years and is determined to be unable to perform substantial work because of a qualifying disability .

in the past three decades , the total number of disabled - worker beneficiaries continually increased from 2.7 million in 1985 to 9.0 million in 2014 and then started to decline to approximately 8.7 million in december 2017 .

the size of the beneficiary population has a strong impact on ssdi expenditures and thus the solvency of the program's trust fund .

multiple factors have contributed to the change in the number of ssdi beneficiaries over time .

understanding the importance of each competing factor helps inform predictions of ssdi solvency status and analysis of related legislation .

this report analyzes the relative importance of factors affecting ssdi benefit receipts and terminations over the past 30 years .

 figure 1 shows that between 1985 and 2017 the total number of disabled - worker beneficiaries continually increased before 2014 and has declined for the last three years .

the number of social security disabled - worker beneficiaries has experienced different growth rates in the last three decades .

the disability rolls increased relatively slowly between 1985 and 1989 and then went through two faster - growing periods , 1989-1997 and 2000-2010 .

the number of disabled - worker beneficiaries grew slowly again after 2010 and has declined since 2014 .

among disabled workers , the proportion of female beneficiaries increased from 33% in 1985 to nearly 50% in 2017 .

the number of disabled - worker beneficiaries in current payment status increases with new disability awards and declines with benefit terminations .

in general , to qualify for ssdi , workers must be ( 1 ) insured in the event of disability , ( 2 ) statutorily disabled , and ( 3 ) younger than social security's full retirement age ( fra ) , which is 65-67 , depending on the year of birth .

a disabled worker's ssdi benefits are terminated when they ( 1 ) die , ( 2 ) attain fra ( the age at which unreduced social security retired - worker benefits are first payable ) , ( 3 ) medically improve ( i.e. , no longer meet the statutory definition of disability ) , or ( 4 ) return to work .

the main reason for the decline in the number of ssdi beneficiaries is the decrease in disability benefit awards , which dropped down below the number of terminations starting in 2014 ( see figure 2 ) .

the number of new awards to disabled workers in the ssdi program grew from approximately 416,100 in 1985 to more than 1 million in 2010 .

however , this trend was reversed in 2011 , with a gradual decline in new disability awards to approximately 716,000 in 2017 .

from 1985 to 2017 , the number of disabled - worker beneficiaries whose benefits were terminated rose from 340,000 to 859,000 , which was higher than the number of new disability awards in the recent three years .

multiple factors may have contributed to the trends in ssdi benefit receipts and terminations .

the following sections examine the effects of different factors and discuss the relative importance of competing factors at different time periods .

several factors may affect the change in the number of ssdi disabled - worker beneficiaries , including changes in demographic characteristics of the insured population , changes in employment and compensation , and changes in program rules and implementation .

this section discusses the impact of those factors on ssdi benefit awards and terminations , as well as the roles they have played over time .

the number of ssdi beneficiaries has experienced large growth in the past 30 years , but the trend was reversed starting in 2014 .

the decline in ssdi rolls was driven by two forces: the decrease in new disability awards since 2011 and the continuous increase in the termination of disability benefits .

based on the previous discussion , this section summarizes the possible causes of the recent decline in ssdi enrollment .

since 2010 , new awards to disabled workers have decreased every year , dropping from 1 million to 762,100 in 2017 .

although there has been no definitive cause identified , four factors may explain some of the decline in disability awards .

1 .

avai lability of j obs .

the unemployment rate was as high as 9.6% in 2010 and then gradually decreased every year to about 4.35% in 2017 .

the opportunities for employment make working more attractive than disability benefits for people who could qualify for ssdi .

if the unemployment rate were kept at 6.02% — the average level between 1985 and 2017 — the age - sex - adjusted incidence rate would have been 3.5% ( 0.35 per 1,000 disability - exposed population ) higher in 2016 .

thus about 50,000 more disabled - worker benefits would have been awarded in that year .

2 .

aging of lower - birth - rate cohorts .

the lower - birth - rate cohorts ( people born after 1964 ) started to enter peak disability - claiming years ( usually considered ages 50 to fra ) in 2015 , replacing the larger baby boom population .

this transition would likely reduce the size of the insured population who are ages 50 and above , as well as the number of disability applications .

as the baby boomers reached age 50 between 1996 and 2014 , the growth rate of the insured population ages 50 to fra has been consistently around 5% from 1997 to 2008 .

the growth rate started to decrease in 2009 , dropped down below 1% in 2014 , and became negative ( no growth ) in 2018 .

3 .

availability of the affordable care act ( aca ) .

the aca expanded health insurance opportunities beginning in 2014 .

the availability of health insurance under the aca may lower the incentive to use ssdi as a means of access to medicare , thus reducing the number of disability applications .

the nationwide effect of the aca on disability benefit receipt is still unclear .

4 .

decline in the allowance rate .

the total allowance rate at all adjudicative levels declined from 62% in 2001 to 48% in 2016 .

while this decline may in part reflect the impact of the great recession ( since ssdi allowance rates typically fall during an economic downturn ) , the social security advisory board technical panel suspects that the declining initial allowance rate may be a result of the change in the ssdi adjudication process .

in addition to the factors contributing to a decline in ssdi applications and awards , some others may have the opposite effect of pushing disability benefit receipt upward .

some of those factors may include the increase in the fra , the growth in applications from low - wage workers , and higher incidence rates among young applicants resulting from an expansion of ssdi eligibility rules .

but the effect of those factors was smaller than the ones that decreased new ssdi awards between 2011 and 2017 .

the number of benefit terminations among disabled workers has been increasing from 2001 to 2017 ( see figure 2 ) , and the share of total disabled - worker beneficiaries who terminated benefits also increased from 8% to almost 10% .

the following factors are likely to contribute to the increase in disability terminations .

baby boomers reached fra .

as the relatively large baby boomer population reaches its fra ( gradually increased from 65 to 66 ) between 2012 and 2031 , there is expected to be a growing proportion of disabled workers who terminate disability benefits due to the attainment of fra .

as shown in the previous section , the proportion of terminations that were due to attainment of fra was about 50% before 2012 , but the ratio gradually increased to nearly 60% in 2017 .

the potential increase in the number of terminations may slow down due to the scheduled increase in the fra from 66 to 67 between 2020 and 2027 , which will result in fewer disabled workers exiting the ssdi program due to the attainment of fra .

efforts in cdrs .

with increased program integrity funding in recent years , ssa has increased the number of full medical cdrs completed , and the backlog was reduced to about 64,000 cases at the end of fy2017 .

between 2013 and 2017 , about 147,000 benefits were terminated after cdrs .

the effect of cdrs on ssdi terminations will become relatively smaller , as the ssa eliminated the backlog by the end of fy2018 .

availability of the aca .

the prevalence of the aca after 2014 is likely to cause some ssdi recipients to return to work for two reasons .

first , the aca may reduce beneficiary reliance on ssdi as a path to medicare access .

second , the aca may improve the health conditions of disabled - worker beneficiaries .

the actual magnitude of the effect awaits further analysis .

some factors may work in the opposite direction to decrease disability terminations .

examples include the scheduled further increase in fra from 66 to 67 and the declining mortality rate among disabled - worker beneficiaries .
