president george w. bush issued his administration's fy2004 budget on february 3 , 2003 .

the budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment , but did not state how the increasewould be allocated between the annual and locality adjustments required by fepca in january2004 .

 ( 53 ) the statutory annual pay adjustmentrequired in january 2004 is 2.7% .

if the presidentwants to change the required rate of the annual adjustment , he has to submit an alternative plan forthe annual adjustment to congress by september 1 , 2003 .

the president issued an alternative plan to change the amount of the annual adjustment and locality - based comparability payments on august 27 , 2003 .

the plan called for a 2.0% payadjustment in january 2004 allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay .

the cost of the 2.0%adjustment would be about $2 billion dollars , according to omb and opm .

the alternative planstates that implementation of the annual and locality pay adjustments as required by fepca wouldhave cost about $13 billion .

executive order 13322 , issued by the president on december 30 , 2003,implemented the alternative plan .

 ( 54 ) in the plan , the president states that the pay adjustment should be complemented by a $500 million dollar human capital performance fund which would reward the highest - performing andmost valuable employees in an agency .

the fund is authorized by section 1129 of p.l .

108-136 , thenational defense authorization act for fy2004 ( h.r .

1588 ) , enacted on november24 , 2003 .

 ( 55 ) ( the authorization was section 1111of h.r .

obligation of the funding was contingent upon enactment of the legislationauthorizing the creation of the fund within opm .

no funds would be available until the opmdirector notifies the relevant subcommittees of jurisdiction of the committees on appropriationsof the approval of a performance pay plan for an agency and the prior approval of the subcommitteeshas been attained .

the committee directs opm "to report annually to the committees onappropriations on the performance pay plans that have been approved , and the amounts that havebeen obligated or transferred. .

 ( 57 ) the senatecommittee on appropriations , in reporting its versionof the transportation and treasury appropriations bill ( s. 1589 ) on september 8 , 2003,did not recommend an appropriation for the fund .

"the committee believes that an initiative of thistype should be budgeted and administered within each individual agency," according to the reportaccompanying the bill .

obligation or transfer of the funding was contingent upon the enactment of the legislation toestablish the fund within opm .

funds shall not be obligated or transferred to any federal agency untilthe opm director notifies and receives prior approval from the relevant subcommittees ofjurisdiction of the committees on appropriations of opm approval of an agency's performance payplan .

such amounts as determined by the opm director may be transferred to federal agencies tocarry out the purposes of the fund .

 ( 59 ) thisprovision was enacted in p.l .

108-199 on january 23,2004 .

 ( 60 ) in his alternative plan , the president also said that , "since any pay raise above the 2 percent i have proposed would likely by unfunded , agencies would have to absorb the additional cost andcould have to freeze hiring in order to pay the higher rates. .

he noted that the quit rates for generalschedule employees are at an all - time low of 1.7% per year .

 ( 61 ) federal employee union representatives expressed discouragement about the 2.0% pay adjustment .

 ( 62 ) .

the national commission on the public service , in its january 2003 report , "recommend[ed]that the general schedule classification system be abolished. .

the commission mentioned thesubstantial "resources and effort needed to maintain the general schedule system" and the "constanttinkering [needed] to define equal work so that it can ensure equal pay" as reasons behind theproposal .

"as a default system," the commission suggested a broad - band system under which the 15 pay grades and salary ranges would be consolidated into six to eight broad bands with relatively wide salary ranges.managers would be able to determine individual pay based on competence andperformance .

the commission also acknowledged the possibility that "other agencies might adopt systems with an entirely different form. .

 ( 63 ) currently , pay banding systems are being implemented at several agencies , including the federal aviation administration , the transportation security administration , and the internalrevenue service .

pay parity provisions that "allow the sec [securities and exchange commission]to raise salaries for certain employees to levels comparable to the salaries of federal bank examiners"are included in p.l .

107-123 , enacted on january 16 , 2002 .

108-136 , the national defense authorization act for fy2004 , enacted on november 24 , 2003 .

 ( 65 ) changes to the pay setting systems at both agencies are expected to include broad pay bands .

the size of the federal white - collar pay adjustment is considered annually by congress , whichmay legislate a pay adjustment that is different from the adjustment recommended by the presidentin the budget or that might be authorized by the president in an alternative plan .

the january 1999 ( 3.6% ) , january 2000 ( 4.8% ) , january 2002 ( 4.6% ) , and january 2003 ( 4.1% ) overall pay adjustmentamounts were set by congress .

 ( 66 ) concurrent resolutions introduced in the senate by senator paul sarbanes ( s.con.res .

1 ) on january 9 , 2003 and in the house of representatives byrepresentative steny hoyer ( h.con.res .

19 ) on january 28 , 2003 , expressed the senseof the congress that there should be parity between the pay adjustments for the uniformed militaryand federal civilian employees .

the resolutions noted the longstanding policy of parity between boththe military and civilian pay increases .

such resolutions are effective only in the chamber in whichthey are proposed , express nonbinding opinions on policies , and do not require the president'ssignature .

a number of members of congress from the washington , dc , metropolitan area reportedly wrote letters to president bush and representatives jim nussle and john spratt , jr. , chairman andranking member , respectively , of the house committee on the budget , on february 27 , 2003,urging them to support equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the uniformed military .

 ( 67 ) the fy2004 budget proposes an average 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilianemployees .

 ( 68 ) .

the american federation of government employees ( afge ) and the national treasuryemployees union ( nteu ) endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the uniformedmilitary .

the unions criticized the president's proposal on federal pay as inadequate anddisregarding of fepca .

 ( 87 ) according to afge , bush's budget issues his standard rationale for failing to uphold the federal employees pay comparability act ( fepca ) ... problems with the departmentof labor's methodology in determining the comparability of federal pay with the private sector .

yetnowhere does he ever describe his methodological problems .

i have asked repeatedly - - whatchanges in methodology would you like to implement so that fepca can go forward ? .

previously,the methodological problems appeared to be related to the locality component of federal pay , whichbush has tried to eliminate for the past two years .

yet this year , his methodological problems seemto have spread to the employment cost index ( eci ) component .

the pay agent stated: "this report shows the adjustments wewould recommend for january 2004 if the methodology and rates required by current law wereto be implemented .

given the current national emergency situation and the consequentslowdown in the american economy , however , we believe it would be unwise to allow thelocality pay increases ... to take effect in january 2004. .
