on october 7 , 2019 , after six months of formal negotiations , the united states and japan signed two agreements intended to liberalize bilateral trade .

one , the u.s. - japan trade agreement ( usjta ) , provides for limited tariff reductions and quota expansions to improve market access .

the other , the u.s. - japan digital trade agreement , includes commitments pertaining to digital aspects of international commerce , such as on data flows .

these agreements constitute what president donald trump and prime minister shinzo abe envision as "stage one" of a broader trade liberalization negotiation , which the two leaders first announced in september 2018 .

the two sides have stated their intent to begin second stage negotiations on a more comprehensive deal after these agreements enter into force .

congress will not have a role in approving the two agreements .

the trump administration intends to use delegated tariff proclamation authorities in trade promotion authority ( tpa ) to enact the tariff changes and quota modifications , while the digital trade commitments , which would not require changes to u.s. law , are in the form of an executive agreement .

japan's diet ( the national legislature ) , however , had to ratify the pact , and did so on december 5 , 2019 , paving the way for entry into force on january 1 , 2020 .

the two japan deals raise a number of issues for congress , including their limited coverage and staged approach , as compared to past u.s. free trade agreement ( fta ) negotiations , the trade authorities used to bring them into effect in the united states , questions over their compliance with world trade organization ( wto ) rules , and questions over how they compare with the trade agreement the united states previously negotiated with japan in the former trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) and current tpp - 11 .

given the narrow scope of the agreements , particularly the usjta tariff commitments , their commercial and strategic impact is likely to be determined by whether a more comprehensive bilateral agreement can be achieved .

many members of congress and other stakeholders support the agreements , but view the prospective second stage of trade talks as critical for u.s. interests .

at the same time , some observers have raised questions about the potential coverage of issues in future talks and whether there will be sufficient political support in both countries to make progress , especially during an election year in the united states .

in october 2018 , in line with tpa requirements under the bipartisan congressional trade priorities and accountability act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-26 ; tpa - 2015 ) , the administration provided congress 90 days advance notification of its intent to begin negotiations .

the administration released its negotiating objectives , which included a number of issues beyond tariffs and digital trade , in december of the same year .

the trump administration's interest in a trade agreement with japan is closely tied to its decision to withdraw the united states from the tpp in 2017 , and to pursue bilateral agreements , as opposed to the more regional approach taken under tpp .

it also reflects the administration's strategy of focusing on reaching agreements with major u.s. trade partners , especially those with which the united states runs a trade deficit ( the u.s. goods trade deficit with japan was $67.2 billion in 2018 , the fourth - largest bilateral u.s. deficit ) .

although tpp included 10 countries in addition to the united states and japan , the u.s. - japan component of the agreement was the most economically consequential given existing u.s. trade agreements with 6 of the 10 other participants , and the relatively small economies of the remaining four ( brunei , malaysia , new zealand , and vietnam ) .

in these limited , stage one agreements with japan , the administration has attempted to address concerns raised by tpp proponents , especially agricultural groups , that the u.s. withdrawal placed u.s. exporters at a disadvantage in the japanese market , in particular given japan's recently enacted trade agreements with other trade partners .

following u.s. withdrawal from the tpp , japan led efforts among the remaining 11 tpp countries to conclude the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans - pacific partnership ( cptpp or tpp - 11 ) , which took effect in december 2018 for the first six signatories who ratified , including japan , and for vietnam in early 2019 .

the tpp - 11 includes the comprehensive tariff liberalization commitments of tpp ( near complete elimination among the parties ) , and the majority of tpp rules and disciplines on numerous trade - related issues , though the parties agreed to suspend a small number of nontariff commitments sought largely by the united states , following the u.s. withdrawal .

japan's fta with the european union ( eu ) , which is to eventually remove nearly all tariffs and establish trade rules between the parties , went into effect in february 2019 .

it provides for elimination of the eu's 10% auto tariff , and elimination or reduction of most japanese agricultural tariffs .

additional trade agreements involving japan could take effect in coming years , compounding u.s. exporter concerns , including the possible 2020 conclusion of the regional comprehensive economic partnership ( rcep ) , which includes japan , china , and 13 other asian countries .

given japan's commitment to tpp , prime minister abe was initially hesitant to agree to bilateral u.s. trade negotiations , instead urging the trump administration to reconsider its withdrawal .

japan's decision to participate in bilateral talks came after president trump raised the possibility , based on national security concerns , of imposing unilateral motor vehicle tariffs on japan , an industry of national significance and accounting for one - third of u.s. goods imports from japan ( see " motor vehicles and threat of u.s .

section 232 tariffs " ) .

the importance of the u.s. - japan security relationship may also have factored into japan's decisionmaking .

japan relies heavily on the united states for its military defense .

the two countries' agreement on how to share the costs of the roughly 50,000 u.s. troops stationed in japan is due to be renegotiated in 2020 as the current agreement expires at the end of march 2021 .

president trump has called for japan to significantly increase its contributions , perhaps by as much as fourfold .

japan , some analysts suggest , may see a bilateral trade agreement as way to reduce tension in the bilateral relationship , in light of other pressing security issues .

additionally , the trump administration may try to use the cost - sharing negotiations to extract concessions from japan in proposed stage - two trade negotiations , or vice versa .

as the united states' fourth - largest trading partner and the world's third - largest economy , japan routinely features prominently in u.s. trade policy .

in 2018 , japan accounted for 5% of total u.s. exports ( $121 billion ) and 6% of total u.s. imports ( $179 billion ) .

the united states is arguably even more important to japan , representing its second - largest trading partner after china in 2018 , and accounting for nearly 20% of japan's goods exports .

the two countries are also major investment partners , with japanese foreign direct investment ( fdi ) in the united states valued at $484 billion in 2018 on a historical cost basis , largely in manufacturing , and u.s. fdi in japan valued at $125 billion , concentrated in finance and insurance .

major areas of u.s. focus in the trade relationship include market access for u.s. agricultural goods , given japan's relatively high tariffs in this sector , and the elimination of various nontariff barriers , such as in the motor vehicles and services sectors .

the two agreements included in the "stage one" u.s. - japan trade deal cover tariff and quota commitments on industrial and agricultural goods and commitments on digital trade .

the limited coverage and composition represents a significant departure from recent u.s. trade agreements , which typically are comprehensive and cover additional issues such as customs procedures , government procurement , labor and environment protections , intellectual property rights ( ipr ) , services , and investment .

notably , neither agreement includes a formal dispute settlement mechanism to enforce commitments should either side take fault with the other's implementation .

the trump administration points to article 6 of the usjta , which lays out a 60-day consultation process for resolving issues relating to "the operation or interpretation" of the agreement as a means to resolve disputes relating to tariffs and quota commitments .

a future comprehensive deal could include a formal dispute settlement mechanism , but it is unclear how this would affect the initial agreements .

the stage one agreements with japan on agriculture , industrial goods , and digital trade , as well as the approach the trump administration has taken to negotiate them represent a significant shift in u.s. trade agreement policy .

given its constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce , congress may reflect on whether this shift aligns with congressional objectives .

congress may also consider the impact of the agreements on the u.s. economy , including the implications of completing ( or not completing ) a broader second - stage deal with japan , and how a staged approach affects the countries' ability to achieve additional agreements .

the administration's plan to implement the stage one u.s. - japan agreements without the approval of congress , an unprecedented move for u.s. fta negotiations , has prompted debate among some members over the appropriate congressional role .

in a november 26 , 2019 , letter to the ustr some members sought clarification from the administration regarding its intent to implement the agreements and how section 103 ( a ) trade authorities under tpa allow the administration to enter into a tariff agreement with japan .

some analysts and members cite uncertainties as to whether the delegated authorities also permit implementation of changes in rules of origin and quota modifications under the agreements .

some members further suggest that future debate over potential reauthorization of tpa should consider congressional intent behind these delegated tariff authorities .

at the same time , other members have indicated that they would not object to the administration's plan to implement the agreements with japan without congressional approval .

on procedure , questions have been raised by some as to whether the administration has fulfilled the consultation requirements of tpa throughout the negotiationsâsection 103 ( a ) includes fewer requirements with respect to tariff - only agreements .

the digital trade commitments do not appear to require changes to u.s. law , but the inclusion of certain provisions has prompted some congressional debate .

in the case of past u.s. ftas , such debate would typically play out during congressional debate and formal consideration of legislation to implement the respective agreement under tpa .

key questions for congress may include what role should congress play in limited trade agreements , given the authorities and requirements established in tpa ? .

should congress consider changes to delegated authorities in future consideration of potential tpa reauthorization ? .

congress set negotiating objectives for u.s. trade agreements in statute in its 2015 grant of tpa ( 19 u.s.c .

â§3802 ) .

based on these guidelines and as required by tpa , the trump administration laid out 22 specific areas of focus for its bilateral negotiations with japan .

the stage one u.s. - japan trade agreements , however , include provisions related to two of these areas: a limited reduction of tariffs on trade in goods and digital trade .

the administration has stated its intent to address the remaining issues in future negotiations , but its ability to conclude and implement such negotiations depend on the political landscape and will in both countries , making a second - phase deal an uncertain prospect .

while the u.s. trade advisory committees generally support the initial - stage agreements , some , such as the services sector advisory committee , also argue that the two - stage or perhaps a multi - stage approach could make it more challenging for the united states to achieve the strongest possible overall outcomes in certain sectors .

the staged approach also raises questions over the potential economic impact of the agreement .

due to the administration's intended use of section 103 ( a ) proclamation authorities to enact the agreed tariff changes with japan , an economic assessment by the u.s. international trade commission ( usitc ) will not be required for this stage one deal .

the agreement may have a modest overall effect on the u.s. economy , given that it covers a small share of bilateral trade , but it could be significant for the u.s. agricultural exporters that will enjoy improved access to japan's highly protected market .

key questions for congress may include how do these stage one agreements with japan affect the ability of the united states to negotiate a more comprehensive agreement in the future ? .

do staged trade negotiations adhere to congress's negotiating objectives in tpa , and should congress support this staged approach in future u.s. trade negotiations ? .

congress delegated authority to the president to enact tariffs under section 232 specifically to address possible threats to u.s. national security .

president trump , however , has stated that his use of tariff authorities have been a critical tool in getting u.s. trade partners to the negotiating table , and japan's foreign minister , toshimitsu motegi , who negotiated the phase - one deal for japan , highlighted the importance of avoiding section 232 auto tariffs as a key outcome of the u.s. - japan negotiations .

the administration has yet to publish the commerce department's report outlining the national security threat posed by auto imports , despite direct requests from congress and legal requirement to do so .

some trade analysts caution that u.s. use or threat of trade barriers as negotiating leverage undermines existing global trade rules and could set a precedent used by other countries against the united states in the future .

many members of congress have questioned the security rationale behind the president's proposed and implemented tariff actions , and some support legislation revising section 232 authorities .

key questions for congress may include does the use of section 232 tariff authorities as leverage in broader trade and tariff negotiations represent an appropriate use of the delegated authorities ? .

what are the potential long - term implications to u.s. and global trade policy of using the threat of tariff increases as leverage in trade liberalization negotiations ? .

the limited scope of the usjta commitments ( in particular , the exclusion of auto trade ) , has led several analysts and some members of congress to question the extent to which the agreement adheres to article xxiv of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) under the wto .

this provision requires regional trade agreements outside the wto to eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce on "substantially all trade" between the parties .

as discussed , u.s. market access commitments in the initial deal cover a limited share of u.s. goods imports from japan .

congress has historically taken issue with other countries' partial scope agreements , advocating for better adherence to article xxiv , including within tpa and other trade statutes .

some analysts suggest this concern could be mitigated if the stage one u.s. - japan agreement were to qualify as an "interim agreement" under article xxiv ; but these agreements must include a "plan and schedule" for the formation of the free trade area within a "reasonable length of time. .

in practice , however , wto members have rarely challenged other trading partners' agreements for consistency with these requirements under formal dispute settlement proceedings .

whether or not the agreement ultimately is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of wto rules likely depends on the timeline and scope of the next - stage u.s. - japan talks , which both sides have indicated aim to be comprehensive in scope .

key questions for congress may include are the stage one agreements consistent with u.s. obligations under the wto ? .

does the limited scope of the agreements set precedents for other countries to negotiate other partial trade agreements that liberalize trade on a limited set of products or sectors that could potentially discriminate against the united states , as well as potentially undermine respect and adherence to the letter and spirit of wto rules ? .

the trump administration's bilateral trade agreement negotiations with japan represent an alternative to the u.s. - japan trade agreement negotiated as part of tpp .

given the trump administration's decision to conclude a limited , stage one agreement , the most significant distinction with tpp ( and tpp - 11 ) at this point is that tpp covered a much broader range of commitments .

for example , usjta commits the countries to reduce or eliminate tariffs on small share of each country's overall tariff lines , whereas tpp committed both countries to eliminate tariffs on all but a limited number of agricultural products .

in addition , this phase - one agreement with japan includes one nontariff issue , digital trade , whereas tpp covered issues such as rules on technical barriers to trade , sanitary and phytosanitary measures , state - owned enterprises , labor and environmental standards , investment and intellectual property rights protections , and market access for services , among others .

as discussed , whether the administration will include such commitments in future negotiations with japanâand in what formâremains to be seen .

the trump administration's bilateral approach to negotiations with japan also differs from the obama administration's and the george w. bush administration's multiparty approach to tpp , which may be tied to differing strategic priorities by the administrations .

for example , the obama administration saw the tpp as the economic component of its rebalance to asia and a vehicle to establish rules that reflect u.s. interests and values as the regional framework for commerce , rather than allowing other countries , such as china , to set regional norms .

the broad membership of tpp , arguably , was an important component of this strategy , creating an opportunity to harmonize rules across multiple trading partners , and creating a greater likelihood of attracting additional future participants .

the trump administration , alternatively , has prioritized achieving fair and reciprocal trade , both in its objectives for the u.s. - japan trade agreement and its broader indo - pacific strategy .

the administration argues that a bilateral approach to negotiations allows the united states to take full advantage of its economic heft to secure the most advantageous terms and allows for better enforceability .

key questions for congress may include how has the u.s. withdrawal from tpp affected u.s. economic and strategic interests in japan and the asia - pacific region and what is the best approach to advancing those interests moving forward in the next stage of talks with japan ? .

what are the costs and benefits of bilateral versus regional or multiparty approaches to u.s. trade agreement negotiations ? .

should the united states consider joining tpp - 11 ? .
