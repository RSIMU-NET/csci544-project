this report provides background information and analysis on two amendments to the anti - terrorism act ( ata , 18 u.s.c .

â§â§ 2331 et seq .

 ) : the anti - terrorism clarification act of 2018 ( atca , p.l .

115-253 ) , which became law in october 2018 ; and the promoting security and justice for victims of terrorism act of 2019 ( psjvta , â§ 903 of p.l .

116-94 ) , which became law in december 2019 .

the report focuses on the impact of this legislation on the following key issues: u.s. aid to the palestinians .

whether federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the palestinian authority ( pa ) and palestine liberation organization ( plo ) for terrorism - related offenses .

the ata generally prohibits acts of international terrorism , including the material support of terrorist acts or organizations .

it also provides a civil cause of action through which americans injured by such acts can sue responsible persons or entities for treble damages .

prior to atca , the ata did not dictate personal jurisdiction .

the end of u.s. security assistance and existing economic assistance projects for palestinians in january 2019 , in light of atca , has had implications for u.s. policy .

the enactment of psjvta in december 2019 to partly reverse atca and otherwise amend ata also has policy and legal implications related to u.s. aid and personal jurisdiction over palestinian entities ( see timeline at figure 1 ) .

responses to the following questions could have important implications for u.s. policy and law .

given that acceptance of aid no longer triggers consent to personal jurisdiction , will the pa cooperate with the implementation of u.s. security and economic aid that congress appropriated in december 2019 for fy2020 for the west bank and gaza ? .

will the trump administration provide the appropriated fy2020 security and economic aid to palestinians ? .

if so , when ? .

what are the effects of the cutoffâsince january 2019âof u.s. aid to the west bank and gaza ? .

depending on the timing and other circumstances surrounding a possible resumption of aid , what effects could an aid resumption have ? .

will the pa / plo stop payments to prisoners accused of terrorist acts against americans ( or payments to the prisoners' families ) in order to avoid being deemed to consent to personal jurisdiction under psjvta ? .

if psjvta's provisions on pa / plo consent to personal jurisdiction are challenged in court , will they be upheld as constitutional ? .

will the trump administration comply with the requirement in psjvta for the state department to establish a process for resolving and settling claims against the pa / plo under ata ? .

if so , what would the process look like and what outcomes would it produce ? .
