this report provides an overview of the obama administration's fy2012 budget request and the status of fy2012 appropriations for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the departments of labor , health and human services , education , and related agencies ( l - hhs - ed ) .

this bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to three federal departments: the department of labor ( dol ) , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of education ( ed ) .

in addition , the bill provides annual appropriations for more than a dozen related agencies , including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

discretionary funds represent less than one - quarter of the total funds appropriated in the l - hhs - ed bill .

nevertheless , the l - hhs - ed bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic non - defense federal programs among the various appropriations bills ( the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs ) .

the bulk of this report is focused on discretionary appropriations because these funds receive the most attention during the appropriations process .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , as well as various related issues , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion and for research on human embryos and stem cells .

this report is divided into several sections .

the current section provides an explanation of the scope of the l - hhs - ed bill ( and hence , the scope of this report ) , as well as an introduction to important terminology and concepts that carry throughout the report .

this is followed by a section on the status of the fy2012 appropriations process for the l - hhs - ed bill as a whole .

this section provides a broad overview of the major congressional actions on fy2012 l - hhs - ed appropriations , including house ( h.r .

3070 ) and senate ( s. 1599 ) steps toward full - year funding which culminated in the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ) .

for context , this section also briefly reviews the conclusion of the fy2011 appropriations process .

the next section provides a brief summary and analysis of final mandatory and discretionary fy2012 appropriations , by bill title , compared to proposed funding for fy2012 and comparable funding for fy2011 .

this is followed by a section which provides an overview of discretionary l - hhs - ed funding over the past ten years , placing fy2012 appropriations in an historical context .

the next section provides a summary of budget enforcement activities for fy2012 .

this includes a brief description of the budget control act of 2011 ( and how it relates to l - hhs - ed ) and an overview of house and senate steps toward a budget resolution and 302 ( b ) allocations ( i.e. , budget enforcement caps ) .

finally , the report concludes with detailed sections for each of the major components of the bill: the department of labor , the department of health and human services , the department of education , and related agencies .

note that the fy2012 enacted numbers cited throughout these sections , and the report as a whole , do not yet reflect the 0.189% across - the - board rescission required by section 527 of division f of p.l .

112-74 for most discretionary l - hhs - ed accounts .

 table 1 provides a timeline of major legislative action toward full - year l - hhs - ed appropriations for fy2012 .

the remainder of this section provides additional detail on these and other steps toward full - year l - hhs - ed appropriations .

 table 2 lists the total amount of fy2012 discretionary and mandatory l - hhs - ed funding provided or proposed , by title , compared to comparable funding provided in fy2011 .

the table displays the total amounts enacted for fy2012 to date , which include combined funding provided by the final fy2012 annual appropriations law ( p.l .

112-74 ) and the fy2012 disaster relief law ( p.l .

112-77 ) .

the table also shows proposed funding levels from the fy2012 house ( h.r .

3070 ) and senate ( s. 1599 ) l - hhs - ed appropriations bills , as well as the fy2012 president's request .

table 2 displays funding in two ways: total budget authority provided in the bill ( i.e. , current bill for any fiscal year ) and total budget authority available in the fiscal year ( i.e. , current year funding from any bill ) .

when taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding , hhs received more than three - quarters of the fy2011 and fy2012 l - hhs - ed appropriations ( see figure 2 for the bill composition in fy2012 ) .

this is largely due to the sizable amount of mandatory funding included in the hhs appropriation , the majority of which is for medicaid and payments to health care trust funds .

the department of education accounts for the next largest share of fy2011 and fy2012 appropriations: roughly 10% of total mandatory and discretionary l - hhs - ed funding in each year .

unlike hhs , however , the funds going to the department of education are primarily discretionary dollars .

the related agencies included in the l - hhs - ed bill constitute the next largest share of funding â€” about 9% of total funds in both fy2011 and fy2012 , with the bulk of these funds going toward mandatory benefit payments and administrative costs of the supplemental security income program at the social security administration .

finally , the department of labor accounts for the smallest share of total mandatory and discretionary l - hhs - ed funding: roughly 2% in fy2011 and fy2012 .

when looking only at discretionary appropriations , however , the composition of l - hhs - ed funding is noticeably different ( see figure 2 ) .

for one thing , hhs accounts for a much smaller share of total funding , roughly 42% of all discretionary appropriations in fy2011 and fy2012 .

by contrast , the department of education represents a much larger share , accounting for 41% of discretionary - only funding in each of fy2011 and fy2012 .

this means that hhs and the department of education together account for the dominant shares of discretionary - only l - hhs - ed funding in fy2011 and fy2012 ( roughly 84% combined ) .

meanwhile , discretionary funding for related agencies and the department of labor combined to account for a roughly even split of the remaining 16% of l - hhs - ed funding in fy2011 and fy2012 .

 table 3 shows the trends in discretionary budget authority enacted in the annual ( not including supplementals ) l - hhs - ed appropriations laws for fy2003 through fy2012 .

during these years , l - hhs - ed discretionary appropriations have grown by 24% from $132.4 billion in fy2003 to $163.9 billion in fy2012 , an increase of $31.5 billion .

note , however , that this estimate is based on nominal dollars only and does not reflect effects of inflation over time .

this section of the report provides a brief overview of notable budget enforcement activities , as they relate to the fy2012 appropriations process .

this includes an introduction to the budget control act of 2011 , the house - passed fy2012 budget resolution , and the status of house and senate 302 ( b ) allocations ( i.e. , budget enforcement caps ) for fy2012 l - hhs - ed appropriations .

note that all figures in this section are based on regular l - hhs - ed appropriations only ; they do not include funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process ( eg , direct appropriations for unemployment insurance benefits payments ) .

111-148 ) ) .

the annual fy2012 appropriations law provides $13.4 billion in discretionary funding for related agencies included in l - hhs - ed appropriations .

in addition , the disaster relief appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-77 ) , provides $493 million in discretionary funding for the social security administration ( one of the l - hhs - ed related agencies ) , for a combined fy2012 total of $13.9 billion in discretionary appropriations .

this amount is $12 million ( +0.1% ) more than the comparable fy2011 funding level of $13.8 billion and $1.3 billion ( - 8.7% ) less than the fy2012 president's request of $15.2 billion .

 ( see table 11 . ) .

in general , the largest share of funding appropriated to related agencies in the l - hhs - ed bill goes to the social security administration ( ssa ) .

when taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding , the ssa accounts for 97% of the entire related agencies appropriation in fy2012 ( $64 billion ) and 96% of the appropriation in fy2011 ( $61.4 billion ) .

the bulk of mandatory ssa funding from the l - hhs - ed bill supports the supplemental security income program ( $52.4 billion in fy2012 ; $49.9 billion in fy2011 ) .

when looking exclusively at discretionary funding , the ssa remains the largest component of the related agencies appropriation , constituting roughly 83% of discretionary funds in the fy2012 ( $11.5 billion ) and fy2011 ( $11.5 billion ) .

the majority of discretionary ssa funding covers administrative expenses for social security , ssi , and medicare .

after the ssa , the next largest agency of the related agencies appropriation is the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) , which constitutes roughly 2% of all funding and 8% of discretionary funding in fy2012 ( $1.1 billion ) and fy2011 ( $1.1 billion ) .

typically , each of the remaining related agencies receives less than $1 billion from the annual l - hhs - ed appropriations bill .

the following are some highlights for related agencies from the fy2012 annual appropriations law ( p.l .

112-74 ) , as supplemented by the fy2012 disaster relief appropriations law ( p.l .

112-77 ) , compared to comparable fy2011 funding levels and proposed funding levels for fy2012 from the president's budget .

 ( see table 12 for details. ) .

the house version of the l - hhs - ed appropriations bill would have eliminated funding for a number of corporations for national and community service ( cncs ) programs , such as volunteers in service to america ( vista ) and americorps state grants and would have reduced overall cncs funding for fy2012 by 75% from the fy2011 level .

the final l - hhs - ed appropriations bill , however , includes funding for all but one cncs program .

the learn and serve america program , which did not receive funding in fy2011 , does not receive any funding in the fy2012 l - hhs - ed bill .

the house bill would have also eliminated funding for the corporation for public broadcasting .

the final fy2012 appropriations law provides the cpb with $445 million in two - year advance funding , the same amount it received in fy2011 , but less than the president's request of $451 million .

however , the final law provides no funding for cbp's digitization program , which is a cut of $6 million from fy2011 and the fy2012 president's budget .

the social security administration ( ssa ) will have approximately the same amount to administer its programs and maintain the integrity of the social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs in fy2012 as it did in fy2011 .

the fy2012 annual appropriations law ( p.l .

112-74 ) provides $11.0 billion for limitation on administrative expenses and program integrity activities .

the disaster relief appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-77 ) provides an additional $483 million to the ssa for program integrity activities in fy2012 bringing the total to $11.4 billion , approximately the same funding level as fy2011 .

note that all of this funding , regardless of the bill by which it is appropriated , is expected to be subject to the 0.189% across - the - board rescission of discretionary appropriations required by section 527 of division f of p.l .

112-74 .

the national healthcare workforce commission was created by the patient protection and affordable care act ( p.l .

111-148 ) and its members were appointed by the comptroller general on september 30 , 2010 .

the president requested $3 million for the commission , but no funding is provided in the l - hhs - ed appropriations bill for fy2012 .

the l - hhs - ed bill contains a policy provision prohibiting the national labor relations board ( nlrb ) from using any appropriated funds to issue any new directive or regulation to provide employees with the means to vote electronically for collective bargaining representation .

 table 12 shows the appropriations details for offices and major programs of the l - hhs - ed related agencies .
