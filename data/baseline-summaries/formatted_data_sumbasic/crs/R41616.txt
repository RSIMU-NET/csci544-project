during the first session of the 111 th congress , the economy officially exited its recent recession .

however , the economy and housing markets across the country continued to feel the effects of an economic downturn that featured the largest decline in output , consumption , and investment and the largest increase in unemployment of any post - world war ii recession .

the downturn was , in part , both a cause and a result of issues in the housing finance system and troubles in housing markets .

during the downturn , home prices declined rapidly and home foreclosures reached record - high levels .

given the prominent role housing played in this economic crisis , housing policy issues were active during the 111 th congress , as they had been in the 110 th congress .

in response to concerns about the magnitude of the economic downturn , the 110 th congress had enacted a sweeping economic stabilization program ( p.l .

110-343 ) , including the $700 billion troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) that gave the government the authority to purchase or insure troubled assets owned by financial firms .

some tarp funds were used for programs designed to reduce the number of home foreclosures , an issue that continued to be active during the 111 th congress .

the 110 th congress had also enacted a major housing law , the housing and economic recovery act ( p.l .

110-289 ) , which included the authority for the federal government to place the government sponsored enterprises ( gses ) , fannie mae and freddie mac , into conservatorship ( authority that the government promptly exercised ) .

given the landscape of a troubled financial system and troubled housing markets , the 111 th congress pursued an agenda of reforms to the u.s. financial system , including the housing finance system .

the agenda also included legislation to support fragile housing markets and troubled homeowners .

at the same time , the 111 th congress faced perennial questions about how best to meet the affordable housing needs of low - income and vulnerable populations and whether to make changes to the programs that comprise today's federal affordable housing system , particularly in light of rising budget deficits .

in pursuing this agenda , the 111 th congress enacted a number of laws , ranging from reforming the mortgage origination process to reauthorizing federal homelessness assistance .

in other areas , ranging from gse reform to section 8 voucher program reform , legislation was considered but not enacted before the end of the 111 th congress .

this report provides a brief summary of major housing issues that were considered in the 111 th congress .

it does not provide comprehensive coverage of the issues or closely track active legislation , but it includes references to related crs products that offer more detailed information and analysis .

in response to the severe economic recession , one of the first actions of the 111 th congress was enactment of an economic stimulus law , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) .

it provided almost $800 billion through discretionary spending , mandatory spending , and revenue provisions designed to preserve and create jobs , assist those most affected by the recession , make investments in technology and infrastructure , and stabilize state and local budgets .

arra included several housing - related provisions .

it provided just under $13.7 billion in discretionary appropriations for hud , some through existing hud accounts or programs and some for new programs .

for example , arra provided $4 billion for public housing capital repairs , nearly double the amount the account had typically received in annual appropriations .

it also provided $1.5 billion for a new homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing program , which allocated funds to states and local communities to be used for activities to prevent homelessness or to quickly find housing for those who have become homeless .

this was the first time that significant hud funding was devoted to preventing homelessness .

since fy2008 , congress appropriated $7 billion in neighborhood stabilization program ( nsp ) funds to help state and local governments acquire , rehabilitate , and resell the growing inventory of abandoned and foreclosed homes precipitated by the home mortgage crisis .

the nsp was first authorized with the passage of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-289 ) .

using the framework of the community development block grant ( cdbg ) program , congress appropriated $3.92 billion to help 307 selected state and local governments acquire , rehabilitate , and resell abandoned and foreclosed properties .

in 2009 , congress appropriated an additional $2 billion for nsp - 2 activities when arra ( p.l .

111-5 ) was enacted .

arra revised key elements of the program as a result of a number of issues raised during the early implementation of nsp - 1 .

funds appropriated under arra for nsp - 2 were awarded competitively and included nonprofit and for - profit entities as direct recipients of funds when teamed with a state or local government .

in 2010 , congress appropriated an additional $1 billion for nsp - 3 under the dodd - frank act ( p.l .

111-203 ) .

each of the nsp rounds had specific deadlines that had to be met with respect to the obligation and expenditure of funds .

under nsp - 1 , grantees had 18 months from the date hud signed their grant agreements to obligate these funds and four years to expend allocations .

under nsp - 2 , recipients were required to spend at least half of the funds within two years and 100% within three years of their allocation date .

finally , no obligation deadline was established in legislation for nsp - 3 ; however , 50% of funds must be expended within two years and 100% within three years .

the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) provides temporary housing assistance to disaster victims following an event declared a major disaster by the president .

fema's authority to assist families in need of housing is derived from section 408 of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( p.l .

93-288 ) .

this assistance can take several forms: repairs to make a home habitable , rental assistance , or direct housing ( trailers or mobile homes ) .

assistance is generally provided for an 18-month period in accordance with the stafford act .

the unprecedented experience of addressing hundreds of thousands of disaster victims following hurricanes katrina and rita and subsequent gulf coast storms challenged the traditional administration of the program and provoked interest in new partnerships and approaches in administering the various forms of disaster - related housing assistance .

a prominent change was fema's effort in developing a partnership with hud to provide longer - term housing for displaced families .

using hud's expertise and the resources provided by the president's disaster relief fund ( drf ) , disaster victims have received housing and case management services for an extended period after disasters .

as a result of its experience with katrina , fema has limited its use of manufactured housing and created safety standards for those that are purchased for use , and , as of the end of the 111 th congress , was reviewing ( in partnership with hud ) a pilot program for safer and more affordable temporary housing units .

the review is expected to be completed in 2011 .
