in general , the term appropriations represents total funds available , including regular annual and supplemental appropriations , as well as rescissions , transfers , and deferrals , but excludes permanent budget authorities .

increases and decreases generally are calculated on comparisons between the funding levels appropriated for fy2004 , requested by the president for fy2005 , and recommended and appropriated by congress for fy2005 .

the house committee on appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report .

other sources of information include the senate committee on appropriations , agency budget justifications , and the congressional record .

in the tables throughout this report , some columns of funding figures do not add to the precise totals provided due to rounding .

finally , some of the doi websites provided throughout the report and listed at the end have not been consistently operational due to a court order regarding indian trust funds litigation .

nevertheless , they are included herein for reference when the websites are operational .

for fy2004 , congress enacted a total appropriation of $20.51 billion .

this total was higher than the fy2003 funding level ( $20.11 billion ) .

it reflects an across - the - board cut of 0.646% in the fy2004 interior and related agencies appropriations act ( p.l .

108-108 ) and an additional across - the - board cut of 0.590% in the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-199 ) .

it also reflects a supplemental appropriation of $500.0 million for urgent wildland fire suppression .

many controversial issues arose during consideration of the fy2004 interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

key funding issues included the appropriate levels of funding for wildland firefighting and land acquisition .

in other controversial areas , the fy2004 law ( 1 ) continued the automatic renewal of expiring grazing permits and leases for fy2004 — fy2008 ; ( 2 ) extended the recreational fee demonstration program ; ( 3 ) modified procedures for seeking judicial review of timber sales in alaska , primarily in the tongass national forest ; ( 4 ) capped funds for competitive sourcing efforts of agencies and required documentation on the initiative ; and ( 5 ) led to a stay of a court decision requiring an accounting of indian trust funds and trust asset transactions since 1887 .

however , the fy2004 law dropped language on other contentious issues , including barring funds from being used ( 1 ) to implement changes to blm regulations on recordable disclaimers of interest in land , ( 2 ) for the klamath fishery management council , and ( 3 ) for outer continental shelf leasing activities in the north aleutian basin planning area , which includes bristol bay , alaska .
