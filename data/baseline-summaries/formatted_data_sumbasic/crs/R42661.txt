trade adjustment assistance community college and career training ( taaccct ) grants are competitive grants to institutions of higher education ( ihes ) to support career training programs that can be completed in two years or less .

statute specifies that taaccct - funded programs should target workers who have been adversely affected by international trade and are eligible for the trade adjustment assistance for workers ( taaw ) program .

taaw offers subsidized training and other supports for displaced workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign trade .

while the taaccct program targets taaw - eligible workers , other adults may also be served by programs with taaccct funding .

the program is administered by the department of labor ( dol ) .

taaccct was created as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) and is codified as part of the trade act of 1974 , as amended .

the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-152 ) provided four years of annual mandatory funding through fy2014 .

additional details are in the " legislative and funding histories " section at the end of this report .

the statutory provisions of taaccct are somewhat general .

dol has not established regulations related to the program , so the department's solicitation for grant applications ( sga ) clarifies many details .

to present the most up - to - date information possible , this report will focus on program elements and applicant requirements as they are conveyed in the most recent sga , issued in april 2014 .

statute establishes basic requirements for grant proposals and general criteria for choosing grantees .

the law also specifies that dol will promulgate guidelines for the submission of grant proposals .

these guidelines have been issued through sgas and both clarify and expand upon the requirements established in statute .

statute requires dol to report annually to the senate committee on finance and the house committee on ways and means on each taaccct grant awarded and the impact of each award on taaw - eligible workers .

the sga establishes reporting requirements for grantees .

grantees must provide quarterly financial reports , quarterly progress reports , and annual performance reports .

the last annual performance report will serve as the grant's final performance report and should include annual and cumulative information on the grant's activities .

single institution grantees will submit data directly to dol .

consortium member institutions will submit reports to the consortium's lead institution , which will compile data and submit a single report to dol .

the sga specifies that each taaccct application must also include a budget , design , and implementation plan for a third - party evaluation of the proposed project .

all evaluation designs must include ( 1 ) impact or outcome analysis of participants in grant - funded activities , and ( 2 ) implementation analysis .

grantees must also participate in a national evaluation that will be conducted by a contractor on behalf of dol .
