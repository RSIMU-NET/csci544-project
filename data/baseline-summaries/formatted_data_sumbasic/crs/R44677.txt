t hirty - four temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2016 .

collectively , temporary tax provisions that are regularly extended as a group by congress , rather than being allowed to expire as scheduled , are often referred to as "tax extenders. .

there are several options for congress to consider regarding temporary provisions .

provisions that expired at the end of 2016 could be extended .

the extension could be retroactive .

the extensions also could be short - term , long - term , or permanent .

another option would be to allow expired provisions to remain expired .

congress may also choose to evaluate the extension of certain expiring provisions , in lieu of considering an extenders package that addresses most or all of the provisions scheduled to expire .

certain expiring energy - related provisions have received particular attention , as long - term extensions of certain energy tax benefits were provided for wind and solar , but not other technologies , in legislation enacted at the end of 2015 .

in recent years , congress has chosen to extend most , if not all , recently expired or expiring provisions as part of "tax extender" legislation .

the most recent tax extender package , the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 ( path act ) , enacted as division q of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , broke the typical practice of temporarily extending expiring provisions by making many expiring provisions permanent .

some contend that by making many temporary provisions permanent , the need to address extenders every year or two was negated .

others have suggested that tax extenders might be addressed as part of tax reform .

this report begins by reviewing the concept of tax extenders , and discusses criteria for evaluating expiring tax provisions .

a list of tax provisions that expired at the end of 2016 is then provided .

information on past extensions of these expiring provisions is also provided .

the report also briefly discusses recent tax extender legislation .

as part of that discussion , information is included on provisions that were either made permanent or extended through 2019 in the most recent tax extenders legislation .

the final sections of the report discuss the cost associated with extending expired provisions .

the tax code presently contains dozens of temporary tax provisions .

in the past , legislation to extend some set of these expiring provisions has been referred to by some as the "tax extender" package .

while there is no formal definition of a "tax extender," the term has regularly been used to refer to the package of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by congress .

oftentimes , these expiring provisions are temporarily extended for a short period of time ( eg , one or two years ) .

over time , as new temporary provisions were routinely extended and hence added to this package , the number of provisions that might be considered "tax extenders" grew .

this trend was broken with the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , which made permanent a number of provisions that had been part of previous tax extender packages .

as a result , there are fewer "tax extender" provisions that expired in 2016 than in previous years .

thirty - four temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2016 .

these provisions can be categorized as primarily affecting individuals or businesses , or being energy - related .

these categorizations follow those used in past "tax extender" legislation .

the most recent "tax extenders" legislation was enacted as the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 ( path act ) , enacted as division q of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) .

the path act either extended or made permanent all of the 52 temporary tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014 .

as noted in table 1 , most of the provisions set to expire in 2016 were extended as part of the path act .

the path act , unlike other recent tax extender legislation , provided long - term extensions ( through 2019 ) for a number of provisions , while making many other temporary tax provisions permanent .

these changes are summarized in table 2 .

of the six individual tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 , three were made permanent in the path act .

the provisions that were permanently extended were ( 1 ) the above - the - line deduction for teacher classroom expenses ; ( 2 ) the deduction for state and local sales taxes ; and ( 3 ) a provision providing parity for exclusion of employer - provided mass transit and parking benefits .

a permanent extension of the deduction for teacher classroom expenses had been approved by the house committee on ways and means earlier in the 114 th congress .

the 114 th congress had also passed legislation to make the deduction for state and local sales taxes permanent , before this provision was included in the path act .

of the 30 business tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 , 12 were made permanent in the path act , while another 5 were extended through the end of 2019 .

many of these provisions had been extended multiple times .

the research tax credit , for example , had been extended a total of 16 times since being enacted in 1981 , before being modified and made permanent in the path act .

before being included in the path act , stand - alone legislation was passed in the house in both the 113 th and 114 th congresses that would have modified and made the research credit permanent .

the exception under subpart f for active financing income , which was first enacted in 1997 , was another long - standing temporary provision made permanent in the path act .

the house committee on ways and means had approved stand - alone legislation to make this provision permanent in both the 113 th and 114 th congresses .

provisions that were made permanent in the path act , particularly the business provisions , included those with the largest revenue cost .

the modification and permanent extension of the research credit had an estimated revenue cost of $113.2 billion over the 10-year budget window , while the costs associated with making permanent the exceptions under subpart f for active financing income and the increase in expensing limits under section 179 were $78.0 billion and $77.1 billion , respectively .

by contrast , it would cost no more than $3 billion to make permanent any single business provision scheduled to expire at the end of 2016 .

the path act made permanent all four of the charitable provisions that had expired at the end of 2014 and were previously part of the tax extenders .

the house had passed legislation in both the 113 th and 114 th congresses that would have made these provisions permanent , but permanent extension was not enacted until the path act .

as discussed above , the path act provided a temporary extension for all energy - related provisions that expired at the end of 2016 .

division p of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) included long - term extensions of certain tax benefits for wind and solar .

however , no long - term or permanent extensions of energy - related provisions were included in the path act .

some of the provisions with longer - term extensions in the p.l .

114-113 included phaseouts .

specifically , the extension of 50% first - year bonus depreciation was subject to a phase down .

the 50% bonus depreciation was extended through 2017 , but the amount of qualifying investment that could be expensed is set to be reduced to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019 .

there were also phase downs associated with the longer - term extensions of the tax credits for wind and solar .

the ptc for wind was extended through 2019 , although the credit amount was reduced by 20% for facilities beginning construction in 2017 , 40% for facilities beginning construction in 2018 , and 60% for facilities beginning construction in 2019 .

the 30% itc for business solar was extended through 2019 and the deadline changed from a placed - in - service deadline to a construction start date .

the business solar itc was set to be 26% for facilities beginning construction in 2020 , and 22% for facilities beginning construction in 2021 , so long as these facilities are placed in service before the end of 2023 .

the business solar itc is scheduled to return to 10% in 2022 .

the tax credit for residential solar was extended through 2021 , with a phaseout starting in 2020 .

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-295 ) , passed late in the 113 th congress , made tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2013 available to taxpayers in the 2014 tax year .

the act extended most ( but not all ) expiring tax provisions , and most of the provisions extended in p.l .

114-113 had been included in past tax extenders legislation .

the cost of the tax extenders package enacted as p.l .

113-295 was estimated to be $41.6 billion over the 10-year budget window .

earlier in the 113 th congress , the senate finance committee had reported a two - year extenders package .

the house had also passed legislation that would have made permanent certain expiring provisions .

ultimately , the one - year retroactive extenders legislation is what was passed by the 113 th congress .

the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) extended dozens of temporary provisions that had either expired at the end of 2011 , or were set to expire at the end of 2012 .

the provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 were extended retroactively .

the cost of the tax extenders package enacted as part of arra was estimated to be $73.6 billion over the 10-year budget window .

several provisions that were considered "traditional extenders" — that is , they had been extended multiple times in the past — were not extended under atra .

as lawmakers consider whether to extend expired tax provisions beyond 2016 , cost is one factor .

since many provisions were made permanent in the path act , a temporary extenders package for provisions that expired in 2016 would cost less than past extender packages .

there are fewer provisions to extend , and many provisions with the largest revenue cost were made permanent in the path act .

in total , the extensions of expiring provisions or tax extenders in p.l .

114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025 .

of that cost , nearly one - third ( $202.1 billion ) is attributable to extensions of provisions that were scheduled to expire in 2017 ( the reduced earnings threshold for the refundable portion of the child tax credit ; the american opportunity tax credit ; and modifications to the earned income tax credit ) and the two - year moratorium on the medical device excise tax .

thus , the cost of extending the "tax extender" provisions was an estimated $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025 .

of the total cost of the tax extenders in p.l .

114-113 , $559.5 billion , or 89% of the total cost , was associated with permanent extensions .

the estimated cost of permanent extension of "tax extender" provisions ( provisions that had expired in 2014 and were made permanent in p.l .

114-113 ) was $361.4 billion .

of the total cost of tax extenders in p.l .

114-113 , a small portion , $17.7 billion ( or less than 3% ) was for the two - year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016 .

as discussed above , most provisions that expired at the end of 2016 were previously extended for two years in the path act .

overall , the cost of temporary extensions of extenders provisions in the path act was estimated to be $17.7 billion over the 10-year budget window ( see table 3 ) .

this estimate does not include the cost of temporarily extending provisions set to expire at the end of 2016 that were not extended in the path act .

another option , instead of a short - term extension , is to provide long - term extensions of , or make permanent , tax provisions that are currently temporary .

federal revenues would be reduced by an estimated $158.0 billion over the 10-year budget window , if all temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2016 were made permanent ( see table 3 ) .

this , however , would remove the mechanism that short - term extensions introduce , mainly forcing policymakers to periodically reconsider extension of temporary provisions .

there is no formal definition of "tax extenders" legislation .

over time , "tax extenders" legislation has come to be considered legislation that temporarily extends a group of expired or expiring provisions .

using this characterization , below is a list of what could be considered "tax extenders" legislation .

using this list , tax extenders have been addressed 17 times .

the package of provisions that are included in the tax extenders has changed over time , as congress has added new temporary provisions to the code , and as certain provisions are either permanently extended or given temporary extension in other tax legislation .
