the federal tobacco support program has worked through a combination of commodity pricesupport loans and marketing quotas .

price support loans guaranteed farmers minimum set prices fortobacco ( the 2004 loan prices for the two principal types , flue - cured and burley , are $1.69 and$1.873 / lb .

respectively ) .

these prices were mandated by a formula in the law .

 ( 2 ) marketing quotas,which specified the maximum quantity of tobacco that could be sold , were assigned by the u.s.department of agriculture ( usda ) each year to farms that had a history of tobacco production .

thepurpose of quotas was to limit supplies in order to force buyers to pay the loan prices or more ( the2004 national basic quotas for flue - cured and burley were 471.3 million pounds and 302.1 millionpounds respectively ) .

together , the combination of guaranteed minimum prices and managed supplywas designed to create a stable market for farmers and tobacco product manufacturers .

also , thepattern of assigning quotas to farmland with a history of quotas confined production to the traditionalgrowing regions and farms .

this system of support had operated since the 1930s and was authorizedin permanent law ( 7 u.s.c .

1311 et seq .

 ) .

 ( see crs report 95-129 , tobacco price support: anoverview of the program . ) .

the economic stability that was desired and expected from the tobacco support program was not achieved .

first , the support prices for u.s. tobacco , as mandated by law , were higher than pricesfor competing tobacco in world markets .

as a consequence , u.s. farmers steadily lost both exportand domestic markets to foreign producers .

the declines are pictured in figures 1 and 2 ( based onusda data ) .

second , tobacco support prices were higher than the costs of production .

this createdeconomic profits that were capitalized into the marketing quota lease rates and land prices .

so,marketing quotas became an asset that added substantial value to farmland , and became a source ofrental income for owners choosing not to grow tobacco themselves .

conversely , rent on quotasbecame a sizable expense for active producers renting quota in an attempt to expand or evenmaintain output in the face of shrinking markets .

as with other crops , the number of active tobacco producers has declined over time and production has become concentrated onto fewer but larger farms .

in 1982 there were about 180,000farms producing tobacco .

by 2002 , just 20 years later , the number of active producers was about57,000 , a 68% decline .

 ( 3 ) most of these active tobaccofarmers owned some marketing quotathemselves and also rented quota from about 359,000 other absentee quota owners .

 ( 4 ) in themid - 1990s , burley producers owned about 44% of their effective quota and leased the remaining56% at an average cost of $0.33 / lb .

lease and transfer of quota had been prohibited for flue - curedtobacco since 1986 .

instead , active flue - cured producers rent farmland that had quota attached toit , thereby obtaining the tobacco production rights .

in the mid - 1990s , flue - cured producers ownedabout 33% of their effective quota and rented the remaining 67% at an average cost of $0.37 / lb .

 ( 5 ) newer usda cost of production data put the average rental cost of quota in 2003 at $0.63 / lb .

forflue - cured and $0.57 / lb .

for burley .

 ( 6 ) one reason for increased consolidation and higher quota rental fees was the sharp decline in quota levels after 1997 , as shown in figure 3 and table 1 .

the decline was due to the reversal ofpreviously rapidly growing export markets for u.s. - manufactured cigarettes .

the basic quotas forflue - cured and burley tobacco declined 52% and 57% respectively after 1997 .

farmers needed tomarket enough tobacco to maintain their revenue and to economically utilize their barns , equipment,and labor .

this required renting more quota .

along with these economic pressures to consolidate,several sources of financial aid made it possible for farmers to pay higher rental rates for quota .

first , in conjunction with phase ii of the 1998 master settlement agreement , cigarette manufacturers agreed to distribute $5.15 billion to tobacco producers and quota owners over a12-year period .

 ( 7 ) second , to help offset decreasesin marketing quotas , congress acted to provideassistance .

four separate emergency assistance laws ( p.l .

106-78 , p.l .

106-224 , p.l .

107-25 , p.l.108-7 ) included what the industry called direct "tobacco loss payments ( tlps ) " totaling $860million .

third , congress directed the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) to take ownership ofall 1999 tobacco pledged as price support loan collateral and to assume all financial losses ( p.l.106-387 , as amended ) .

ccc finally completed disposal of this inventory in december 2003 byburying it in landfills .

according to ccc data , the total cost of acquisition , interest on principal,storage , and disposal was about $625 million .

these three sources of financial assistance , rather than income from the sale of tobacco , are the primary reason active producers were able to pay higher rental rates to absentee quota owners as theybid against each other for their share of a declining national tobacco quota .

 ( see crs report rs20802 , tobacco farmer assistance . ) .

the value of tobacco marketing quota depended on several factors , including expectations aboutthe future .

quota owners knew exactly how much rent they earned from active producers .

whatthey did not know was how long the tobacco program would continue to operate , or the size ofnational marketing quotas in future years .

survey data from kentucky revealed that the average sale price of marketing quotas was $2.58 / lb .

in 2001 ( when lease rates averaged $0.62 / lb .

 ) , and $2.08 / lb .

in 2000 ( when lease ratesaveraged $0.58 / lb .

 ) , and $1.75 in 1999 ( when lease rates averaged $0.40 / lb. ) .

 ( 10 ) one would expectto get much higher sale prices with annual rents of these magnitudes .

these sale prices comparedto lease rates implied a time horizon of about five years , based upon a 5% interest rate .

in otherwords , buyers were discounting the purchase price of quota relative to annual rent in anticipation offuture quota reductions or elimination of the program .

most quota buyout bills proposed to pay owners $8 / lb .

this payment was equal to the present value of annual rental income of $0.40 / lb .

in perpetuity at an interest rate of 5% .

the buyout priceof $8 / lb .

was a much higher price than sellers of quota were getting in the marketplace .

also , thebuyout offered to pay active producers an additional $4 / lb .

for all production on the farm .

thepayment to producers typically was described as a "transition payment. .

a buyout program that payed $8 / lb .

to quota owners plus $4 / lb .

to active producers would pay $12 / lb .

for each pound of quota that qualifies for the program .

depending on the crop years usedto calculate payments and some assumptions about participation levels , a rough and unofficialestimate of the buyout and transition payments ranged from about $11 to $19 billion .

how muchwould a typical tobacco farmer receive ? .

the average north carolina tobacco farmer harvested about 21 acres in 2002 , producing about 45,000 pounds .

buying out this average north carolina producer , who owned 33%of the quota and rented 67% , would cost $298,800 ( $118,800 in quota payments and $180,000 intransition payments ) .

in south carolina , the average tobacco farmer harvested 35 acres in 2002,bringing in about 66,000 pounds .

buying out this average south carolina producer , who owned 33%of the quota and rented 67% , would cost $438,240 ( $174,240 in quota payments and $264,000 intransition payments ) .

kentucky tobacco farms averaged 4 acres , producing about 7,500 pounds in2002 .

buying out this average kentucky producer , who owned 44% of the quota and rents 56%,would cost $56,400 ( $26,400 in quota payments and $30,000 in transitionpayments ) .

the president's commission recommended that federal excise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products serve as the source of revenue for the proposed buyout ( estimated at $0.17 per packon cigarettes for five years ) .

however , all of the legislative proposals described in this reportincluded an assessment on manufacturers and importers of tobacco products , or the use of u.s.treasury funds , rather than an increase in excise taxes on cigarettes .

certainly , manufacturers could benefit from a buyout if the support price for tobacco were reduced .

one tobacco manufacturer , philip morris , stated its willingness to help pay for a tobaccobuyout program .

if u.s. manufacturers could save $0.60 / lb .

on their 2004 purchase intentions ofabout 450 million pounds , the savings would amount to $270 million .

additional savings wouldaccrue if a drop in the price of u.s. tobacco pushed down the price of foreign supplies .

additionally,overseas operations also would save on the lower prices for both us .

leaf and foreign leaf .

onetobacco analyst estimated it would take about 14 years for manufacturers to recover the cost of a $15billion quota buyout program .

 ( 11 ) philip morris ( 12 ) had coupled its offer to participate in a buyoutwitha proposal for fda regulation of tobacco products .

health groups also advocated fda regulation .

 ( 13 ) philip morris was the only major manufacturer known to support fda regulation or a quota buyout .

 ( see identical bills h.r .

4433 and s. 2461 ) .

doubts about whether strong divisions in congress over proposed fda regulatory authority could be overcome encouraged sponsors of h.r .

4033 ( jenkins ; march 25 , 2004 ) toseek about $9.6 billion in funding out of the u.s. treasury , rather than from assessments onmanufacturers .

the bill was cosponsored by most supporters of the so - called house consensus bill .

this bill provided $1 / lb .

lower quota buyout and transition payment rates ( $7 / lb .

and $3 / lb.respectively ) .

in contrast to other proposals , phase ii payments to growers would continue andprovide an additional benefit of about $2.6 billion .

the jenkins bill also was included as title viiin the house - passed h.r .

4520 , a tax bill called the american jobs creation act of2004 .

following the lead of the house in using the tax bill as the legislative vehicle for the tobacco quota buyout , the senate retrieved its previously adopted s. 1637 , the jumpstart ourbusiness strength ( jobs ) act , and amended it by attaching the slightly modified mcconnell buyoutbill ( s. 1490 ) and the dewine - kennedy fda tobacco product regulation authority ( s. 2461 ) .

conferees took up the tax legislation ( the differing house and senate versions of h.r .

4520 ) on october 5 , 2004 .

the chairman's mark for the conference committeeincluded tobacco quota buyout provisions ( title vi ) .

the tobacco provisions largely reflected thehouse version , but funded the buyout with an assessment on manufacturers and importers of tobaccoproducts rather than from the u.s. treasury .

like the house version of h.r .

4520 , thechairman's mark contained no authority for fda regulation of tobacco products .

the chairman's mark , like both the house and senate proposals , eliminated tobacco marketing quotas , acreage allotments , and nonrecourse loan price support authority .

it contained no provisionsto control how much tobacco might be grown in the future , who could produce it , or where it couldbe produced .

as compensation , the roughly 416,000 current quota owners would be paid $7 perpound ( in 10 equal annual installments ) on their 2002 basic marketing quotas ( totaling about $6.7billion ) .

similarly , the roughly 57,000 active producers would be paid $3 per pound on their 2002effective marketing quotas ( totaling about $2.9 billion ) .

nearly all of the active producers also werequota owners , and they would get both payments on that portion of the effective quota they alsoowned .

total expenditures were limited to a maximum of $10.140 billion .

the expenditures would be made over a 10-year period from fy2005 through fy2014 .

if domestic cigarette consumptionremained at the current level of about 19.75 billion packs , the cost to manufactures would be about5ï¿½ per pack each year for 10 years .

remaining phase ii payments of about $2.6 billion frommanufacturers to farmers ( adopted in conjunction with the master settlement agreement betweenmajor manufacturers and states ) would terminate .
