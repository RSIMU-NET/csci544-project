on february 20 , 2003 , the president signed into law the fy2003 omnibusappropriations act ( p.l .

108-7 , h.j.res .

2 ) , which includes $74.25billion in regular fy2003 funding for usda and related agencies .

of this amount,$17.545 billion is for discretionary programs .

not included in the total is $3.1 billionin supplemental disaster assistance provided by the measure , primarily for farmersand ranchers affected by a natural disaster in 2001 or 2002 .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) carries out its widely variedresponsibilities through approximately 30 separate internal agencies and officesstaffed by some 100,000 employees .

usda is responsible for many activitiesoutside of the agriculture budget function .

hence , spending for usda is notsynonymous with spending for farmers .

usda gross outlays for fy2002 ( the most recently completed fiscal year ) were $79.95 billion , including regular spending and supplemental spending forhomeland security following the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .

the missionarea with the largest gross outlays ( $37.5 billion or 50% of spending ) was for foodand nutrition programs - - primarily the food stamp program ( the costliest of allusda programs ) , various child nutrition programs , and the women , infants andchildren ( wic ) program .

the second largest mission area in terms of total spendingis for farm and foreign agricultural services , which totaled $22.9 billion , or 31% ofall usda spending .

within this area are the programs funded through thecommodity credit corporation ( eg , the farm commodity price and income supportprograms and certain mandatory conservation and trade programs ) , crop insurance,farm loans , and foreign food aid programs .

figure 1 u.s. department of agriculture actual gross outlays , fy2002 usda spending in fy2002 also included $7.0 billion ( 9% ) for an array ofnatural resource and environment programs , approximately three - fourths of whichwas for the activities of the forest service , and the balance for a number ofdiscretionary conservation programs for farm producers .

 ( usda's forest service isfunded through the interior appropriations bill , and is the only usda agency notfunded through the annual agriculture appropriations bill. ) .

usda programs for ruraldevelopment ( $2.72 billion in gross outlays for fy2002 ) ; research and education ( $2.2 billion ) ; marketing and regulatory activities ( $1.5 billion ) ; meat and poultryinspection ( $717 million ) ; and departmental administrative offices and otheractivities ( $454 million ) account for the balance of usda spending .

administration's request .

as the first step in the fy2003 appropriations process , the bushadministration released its budget request on february 4 , 2002 .

within the budget,the administration requested fy2003 budget authority of $74.062 billion for the u.s.department of agriculture and related agencies ( which includes all of usda exceptthe forest service , and also includes the food and drug administration and thecommodity futures trading commission. ) .

the $74.062 billion requested forfy2003 is $814 million above the fy2002 enacted appropriation of $73.187 billion .

 ( the fy2002 enacted level includes two supplemental appropriations acts ( p.l.107-117 and p.l .

107-206 ) , making nearly $500 million in net supplementalappropriations to various usda programs , and fda and cftc ,in response to theseptember 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks. ) .

the requested $17.421 billion for discretionary accounts was $1.145 billionabove the total fy2002 discretionary appropriation of $16.276 billion .

accountingfor $368 million of the requested increase in discretionary spending for usda andrelated agencies is the administration's assumption of a legislative proposal thatwould require all federal agencies to assume the full cost of accruing employeepensions and retiree health benefits beginning in fy2003 , which ultimately was notadopted by appropriators .

the bill ( h.r .

5263 ) and report ( h.rept .

107-623 ) werefiled by the full committee on july 26 , 2002 .

no floor action was held on the bill .

total appropriations in h.r .

5263 , as reported , were $74.306billion , of which $17.601 billion were for discretionary programs , and $56.705billion for mandatory usda programs .

the $17.601 billion for discretionaryprograms was exactly equal to the 302b allocation given to the subcommittee by thefull committee , and $180 million above the president's request for fy2003 .

thediscretionary level in the house bill was $1.325 billion higher than the regularfy2002 appropriations , including supplementals .

when the 108th congress convened in early january 2003 , the full houseadopted a continuing resolution ( h.j.res .

2 ) , which also was intendedto serve as a vehicle for completing final funding decisions on the 11 remainingregular appropriations bills , including agriculture .

although the house - adoptedversion of h.j.res .

2 was a temporary resolution extending fundingthrough january 31 , 2003 , the senate - amended version was an omnibusappropriations measure that included the full - text of each of the outstanding regularbills , as amended .

until h.j.res .

2 was enacted , fy2003 spending forusda and related agencies was governed temporarily by eight continuingresolutions enacted periodically over the first five months of fy2003 , senate action .

the senateappropriations committee completed subcommittee and full committee markupduring the week of july 22 , 2002 , and reported its version of the fy2003 agricultureappropriations bill ( s. 2801 , s.rept 107-223 ) on july 25 .

s. 2801 , as reported , provided total funding of $74.66 billion , which was$354 million above the house bill , $598 million above the administration request,and $1 billion above the fy2002 enacted level including supplementals .

of the totalamount provided in s. 2801 , $17.98 billion was for discretionaryprograms , compared with $17.6 billion in the house bill , $17.4 billion in theadministration's request and $16.55 billion provided in fy2002 .

the 107th congress adjourned without completing action on s. 2801 or any other fy2003 agriculture spending bill .

in early january 2003 , senateappropriators combined the fy2003 agriculture appropriations bill with ten otherunresolved appropriations bills , as amended , into an omnibus package which wasadopted as a substitute amendment ( s.amdt .

however , separate adopted amendments in h.j.res .

conference action .

conferenceaction on the fy2003 omnibus appropriations bill ( h.j.res .

2 ) wascompleted on february 13 , 2003 , when the conference report ( h.rept .

108-10 ) wasadopted by the house by a vote of 338-83 , and later the same day by the senate bya vote of 76-20 .

the president signed the measure into law ( p.l .

108-7 ) on february20 , 2003 .

the final omnibus law combines the 11 appropriations bills that were notcompleted by the 107th congress , with various other spending provisions , includinga supplemental $3.1 billion disaster assistance package for farmers and ranchers .

forthe regular annual appropriations for usda and related agencies , p.l .

108-7 containsbudget authority of $74.25 billion , of which $17.55 billion is for discretionaryprograms and $56.70 billion is for mandatory programs .

the discretionaryappropriation in the final measure is $56 million below the house - reported ( h.r .

5263 ) level and $805 million below the senate - passed level ( h.j.res .

2 ) , but $124 million above the administration request and$1.27 billion above the enacted fy2002 level including supplementals .

the fy2003totals do not include the $3.1 billion in disaster assistance that was adopted in aseparate title of the bill .

spending for disaster assistance was offset by a comparablereduction in estimated spending for a mandatory conservation program over a 10-yearperiod .

the appropriated totals do not reflect the effect of a 0.65% across - the - boardin almost all discretionary programs in the omnibus measure , which if appliedequally to all usda and related agency programs , would reduce appropriations byapproximately $85 million .

 ( the wic program is the only usda discretionaryaccount that is specifically exempted from the rescission. ) .

the following sections compare the enacted conference agreement on thefy2003 omnibus appropriations bill ( p.l .

108-7 ) , with the senate - passed version ofthe bill ( h.j.res .

2 ) , the house - reported agriculture appropriations billin the 107th congress ( h.r .

108-8 , the house and senate measures , the fy2003 request , and the fy2002 enacted appropriation levels , includingsupplementals .

this report will continue to track congressional action on fy2003agriculture appropriations as the process continues .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency in the department ofhealth and human services ( dhhs ) , is responsible for the regulation and safety offoods , drugs , biologics ( mainly vaccines ) , and medical devices .

the agency isfunded by a combination of congressional appropriations and user fee revenues,assessed primarily for the pre - market review of pharmaceuticals and medical deviceproducts .

the amount of drug user fees to be collected each year is set in fda'sannual appropriations act .

the fy2003 omnibus appropriations act ( p.l .

108-7 ) provides $1.661 billion to fund fda for fy2003 .

this amount includes a totalappropriation of $1.391 billion ( including $1.383 billion for salaries and expensesand $8 million for the maintenance of buildings and facilities .

the balance of $270.5million is for various user fee collections .

by comparison , the house - reported bill ( h.r .

5263 ) , including salaries and expenses , drug user fees , andfacilities came to $1.608 billion .

the senate omnibus measure ( h.j.res .

2 ) , which also added revenues from a new medical device user fees , provided$1.665 billion .

the prescription drug user fee act ( pdufa ) , reauthorized in 2002 as partof the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of2002 ( p.l .

107-188 ) , allows fda to collect user fees for the review of drug andbiologic applications .

p.l .

108-7 set these fees at $222.9 million for fy2003 .

also,the new medical device user fee and modernization act ( mdufa ) of 2002 ( p.l.107-250 ) , signed by the president in october 2002 , authorized fda to charge userfees for medical device applications as well .

p.l .

108-7 set the fy2003 user feeassessments for medical devices at $25.1 million .

the agency also collects user feesfrom mammography clinics and export certificates , and p.l .

108-7 set their fy2003total at $22.5 million .

for fda counter - terrorism activities , the conference report mirrors thepresident's fy2003 budget request , and provides $159 million to continue activitiesinitiated by the agency during the previous year relating to the safety of food,pharmaceutical products , and physical security .

conferees also provided fy2003 funding for a number of specific budgetcategories .

for instance , conferees provided $3 million to continue support for theoffice of women's health and directed the agency to provide concise information towomen and health professionals about hormone replacement therapy .

moreover , theconferees urged the fda to work with physicians , women's health groups , andfederal agencies to conduct a public awareness campaign about the use of hormonetherapy , including the treatment of menopausal symptoms .
