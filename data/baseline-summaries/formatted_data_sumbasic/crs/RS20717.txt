rs20717 - - vietnam trade agreement: approval and implementing procedure updated december 17 , 200 .

after protracted negotiations and a one - year delay after its adoption in principle , the united states and vietnam signed , on july 13 , 2000 , a comprehensivebilateral trade agreement .

the key statutory purpose of the agreement is the restoration of nondiscriminatory tarifftreatment ( 2 ) ( "normal - trade - relations" ( ntr ) ,formerly "most - favored - nation" treatment ) to u.s. imports from vietnam , suspended since 1951 .

hence , theagreement contains a provision reciprocallyextending the ntr treatment and certain other provisions required by law for trade agreements with nonmarketeconomy ( nme ) countries .

in addition , it containscomprehensive specific commitments by vietnam in matters of market access ( eg , reduced tariff rates on importsfrom the united states ) , intellectual propertyrights , trade in services , and investment , such as the united states already has in force as a matter of general tradepolicy .

to enter into force , the agreement mustbe approved by the enactment of a joint resolution of congress .

restoration of ntr treatment to vietnam as an nme country is also contingent on vietnam's compliance with the freedom - of - emigration requirement of thejackson - vanik amendment ( section 402 ) of the trade act of 1974 .

 ( 3 ) in the case of vietnam , such compliance is achieved by an annual presidential waiver of fullcompliance under specified statutory conditions ; such waiver may be disapproved by the enactment of a jointresolution of congress .

the president has issuedsuch waivers for vietnam since mid - 1998 , but in no instance has a disapproval resolution , if introduced , been passedby congress , allowing the waiver to continuein force .

the statutory requirements and legislative procedure leading to the enactment and entry into force of a trade agreement with a nonmarket economy ( nme ) country , including vietnam , are set out in detail in sections 151 , 404 , 405 , and 407 of the trade act of 1974 ( p.l.93-618 ) , as amended .

section 151 has beenenacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house and supersedes its other rules to the extent that theyare inconsistent with it .

its provisions can bechanged by either house with respect to its own procedure at any time , in the same manner and to the same extentas any other rule of that house ( section 151 ( a ) ; 19 u.s.c .

2191 ( a ) ) .

all alphanumerical statutory references cited in this report are to sections of the trade act of 1974 .

while care has been taken to reflect accurately the meaning ofthe statutes , consulting the actual language of any statute is recommended in case of any ambiguity .

functionally , the consideration and enactment of the approval resolution and the implementation of the agreement follow a specific expedited ( "fast - track" ) procedure explained below .

additional information , based on past practice of implementing trade agreements withnme countries in general , but applicable alsoto vietnam , is provided in footnotes ( 1 ) enactment necessary .

the agreement can take effect only if approved by enactment of a joint resolution ( section 405 ( c ) ) ; 19u.s.c.2435 ( c ) ) .
