the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .

it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .

in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .

the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .

as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .

annual u.s. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period .

when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .

in the first of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2019 , ers projects that u.s. net farm income will rise slightly in 2019 to $69.4 billion , up $6.3 billion ( +10% ) from last year .

net cash income ( calculated on a cash - flow basis ) is also projected higher in 2019 ( +4.7% ) to $95.7 billion .

however , the initial 2019 net farm income forecast is below ( - 18% ) the 10-year average of $84.8 billion and represents continued agriculture - sector economic weakness since 2013's record high of $123.8 billion .

u.s. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income , especially since 2005 .

as a result , the downturn in those exports that started in 2015 ( figure 22 ) deepened the downturn in farm income that had started in 2013 ( figure 1 ) .

the u.s. farm income and asset - value situation and outlook suggest a relatively stable financial position heading into 2019 for the agriculture sector as a whole — but with considerable uncertainty regarding the downward outlook for prices and market conditions for the sector and an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses farm asset values — which reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investments — are projected to be up 1.5% in 2019 to a nominal $3.1 trillion ( table a - 3 ) .

in inflation - adjusted terms ( using 2017 dollars ) , farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( figure 26 ) .

nominally higher farm asset values are expected in 2019 due to higher real estate values ( +1.8% ) , which offset a slight decrease in nonreal estate values ( - 0.1% ) .

real estate is projected to account for 83% of total farm sector asset value .

crop land values are closely linked to commodity prices .

the leveling off of crop land values since 2015 reflects mixed forecasts for commodity prices ( corn , soybeans , and cotton lower ; wheat , rice , and livestock products higher ) and the uncertainty associated with international commodity markets ( figure 27 ) .

total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $426.7 billion in 2019 ( +3.9% ) ( table a - 3 ) .

farm equity — or net worth , defined as asset value minus debt — is projected to be up slightly ( +1.1% ) at $2.7 trillion in 2019 ( table a - 3 ) .

the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.9% , the highest level since 2002 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 28 ) .

a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt .

thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy .

average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $115,588 in 2019 ( table a - 2 ) , up 4.3% from 2018 and below the record of $134,164 in 2014 .

about 18% ( $20,365 ) of total farm household income is from farm production activities , and the remaining 82% ( $95,223 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) .

the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 29 ) .
