the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact , p.l .

109-58 ) established a renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) , requiring the use of biofuels ( such as ethanol ) in the nation's fuel supply .

the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa , p.l .

110-140 ) significantly expanded this mandate .

the rfs mandate has been a major impetus to the development of u.s. biofuels industries , especially the ethanol industry .

as a result , ethanol production capacity and the demand for corn as a biofuel feedstock have grown dramatically over the past few years .

in 2005 , the united states produced 3.9 billion gallons of ethanol , requiring roughly 1.4 billion bushels of corn ; in 2007 , those numbers had increased to 6.5 billion gallons and 2.3 billion bushels .

in 2007 , roughly one - quarter of the u.s. corn crop was directed to ethanol production .

in 2013 , production had increased to roughly 14 billion gallons using approximately 5 billion bushels of corn or roughly 40% of the 2013 crop .

increasing demand for corn for biofuels , the rise in energy prices , and other supply concerns in international grain markets led to rapid increases in corn and other grain prices in 2008 .

these higher grain prices raised concerns globally over food prices and availability .

because of these concerns , as well as the capacity for the u.s. industry to meet the growing rfs mandates , there is continuing interest among some policy makers to amend or eliminate the rfs .

under the provisions of epact and eisa , the administrator of the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has the authority to waive the rfs requirements in whole or in part , in response to a petition by a state or a fuel provider , or on her own motion .

in april 2008 , texas governor rick perry sent a letter to epa administrator stephen johnson petitioning for a 50% waiver from the rfs requirements .

in his letter , governor perry stated that he initiated the petition because of the negative effect of the requirements on the texas economy and on global food prices .

in august 2008 , epa denied the waiver request because the agency found that the effects of the rfs on food , feed , and fuel prices was minimal , and thus the economic effects of the rfs "could not be categorized as severe. .

in august 2012 , arkansas governor mike beebe and north carolina governor beverly eaves perdue submitted petition letters to epa requesting full or partial waivers of the 2012 and 2013 rfs mandates .

governors of several other states joined that petition .

the governors cited the effects of the 2012 drought , further compounded by the increased grain demand from the rfs , as leading to severe economic harm to their states , especially their livestock producers .

however , epa denied these petitions for similar reasons as in 2008 .

another factor that could lead the epa administrator to waive certain parts of the rfs is the "blend wall. .

the vast majority of the rfs is met using ethanol blended into gasoline at the 10% level ( e10 ) .

however , there is a limit to the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline at this level , and other options for supplying ethanol ( eg , higher - level ethanol blends such as e15 and e85 ) are currently constrained because of infrastructure and other impediments .

in prior years this had not been a problem because the volume of biofuels needed to meet the rfs mandate was below the maximum amount of ethanol that could be supplied as e10 ; but stakeholders were especially concerned about the possibility of facing this "blend wall" in either 2013 or 2014 .

in november 2013 epa proposed using its general authority to lower the rfs mandates in cases of "inadequate supply. .

epa proposed an overall mandate of 15.21 billion gallons for 2014 , instead of the 18.15 billion gallons of biofuels scheduled for 2014 in eisa , and below the 2013 mandate of 16.55 billion gallons .

within the overall rfs there are sub - mandates for the use of cellulosic biofuels , biomass - based diesel fuels , and other advanced biofuels .

however , questions have been raised over whether there is enough feedstock supply and production capacity to meet some of these carveouts , especially the cellulosic biofuel carveout .

epa waived most of the 2010 cellulosic biofuel carveout — eisa set the mandate at 100 million gallons but epa only required 6.5 million gallons , more than 90% less than scheduled by eisa .

epa cited a lack of then - current and expected production capacity , driven largely by delays in production plans and a lack of investment in commercial - scale refineries .

similarly , epa finalized cellulosic biofuel mandates of 6.0 million and 10.45 million gallons for 2011 and 2012 , respectively — 97% and 98% lower than the amounts scheduled in eisa .

because of a lack of commercial cellulosic biofuel production capacity — only about 20,000 gallons were registered in 2012 — gasoline and diesel fuel producers challenged the lowered mandates in court .

in january 2013 , the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c .

circuit vacated the 2012 cellulosic mandate and remanded the rule back to epa .

epa subsequently set the 2012 level at zero and has proposed doing the same for 2011 .

for 2013 , epa finalized a cellulosic mandate of 6.0 million gallons ( instead of 1 billion gallons ) , and this lowered mandate is also subject to a court challenge , and epa granted petitions from two oil industry groups to reconsider the 2013 rule .

for 2014 , epa has proposed a cellulosic mandate of between 8 million and 30 million gallons , instead of 1.75 billion gallons scheduled in the statute .

the rfs requires the use of 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuel in transportation fuels in 2013 — corn ethanol is limited to 13.8 billion gallons of the 2013 mandate .

the rfs is scheduled to increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022 with an increasing share coming from "advanced biofuels" — biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch — including cellulosic biofuel and bio - based diesel substitutes .

as has been the case in previous years , in 2013 the vast majority of the mandate was met with u.s. corn ethanol ( and a smaller amount of biodiesel , as well as sugarcane ethanol from brazil ) .

for 2014 , the overall mandate is scheduled to increase to 18.15 billion gallons , with up to 14.4 billion gallons coming from corn ethanol and 3.75 billion gallons coming from advanced biofuels , and 1.75 billion gallons of the advanced biofuel mandate coming from cellulosic biofuels .

in november 2013 , epa proposed lowering all three of the mandates , to 15.21 billion gallons , 13.0 billion gallons , 2.20 billion gallons , and roughly 17 million gallons , respectively .

by 2015 corn ethanol's share of the rfs is effectively capped at 15 billion gallons per year .

the eisa amendments to the rfs specifically mandate the use of cellulosic biofuel ( 16 billion gallons by 2022 ) and biomass - based diesel fuel ( at least 1.0 billion gallons annually by 2012 ) .

however , some advanced biofuels , especially cellulosic fuels , have been slow to develop and fuel production lags eisa's mandated schedule .

as amended by eisa , section 211 ( o ) ( 7 ) of the clean air act gives the epa administrator the authority to waive , in whole or in part , the total volume of renewable fuel mandated by the rfs if , in her determination , there is inadequate domestic supply to meet the mandate , or if "implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state , a region , or the united states. .

further , under certain conditions , the epa administrator may waive ( in whole or in part ) the specific carve - outs for cellulosic biofuel and biomass - based diesel fuel .

questions have been raised over how a waiver approval would affect food and fuel markets .

as these markets are extremely complex , there is no simple answer .

the effects of a waiver would likely depend on many factors: the degree to which the rfs requirements are relaxed under the waiver ; the duration of the waiver ; the scope of the waiver ( cellulosic biofuel , biomass - based diesel , or the entire program ) ; whether the waiver is extended ; and prevailing supply and prices for oil , gasoline , biofuels , and feedstock commodities .

in the specific case of the 2010 waiver for cellulosic biofuel , a key question was whether this waiver would undermine the credibility of the mandates in future years and undercut investment .

as epa noted in the final rule establishing the expanded rfs , "in the proposal , we did a preliminary assessment of the cellulosic biofuel industry to arrive at the conclusion that it was possible to uphold the 100 million gallon standard in 2010 based on anticipated production. .

in the final rule on the rfs expansion , epa did not state whether or not the agency believed there would be sufficient capacity to meet the cellulosic mandates in coming years ( 250 million gallons in 2011 , 500 million gallons in 2012 , and 1 billion gallons in 2013 ) , although epa stated that "it is remarkable how much progress the industry has made in such a short time , and there is a tremendous growth opportunity for cellulosic biofuels over the next several years. .

ultimately , for 2010 thorough 2013 , epa found that there was insufficient production capacity to meet the scheduled levels of cellulosic biofuel , a situation likely to be continued in 2014 .

if epa continues to find that mandates in later years likewise are unachievable , and if investors assume that future waivers are unavoidable , further investment in cellulosic biofuel refineries may be limited .

similarly , epa's proposal to partially waive the overall rfs requirements for 2014 may hamper investment in biofuels production capacity .

on the other hand , requiring smaller amounts of biofuels in 2014 may put downward pressure on corn demand and corn prices , which could affect many other markets .
