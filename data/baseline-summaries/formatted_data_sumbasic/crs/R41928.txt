the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill , which began its consideration as h.r .

2584 and ended as division e of the consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

112-74 ) , funds agencies and programs in parts of three federal departments ( interior , agriculture , and health and human services ) , as well as numerous related agencies and bureaus , including the environmental protection agency .

among the more controversial agencies represented in the bill is the fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , in the department of the interior ( doi ) .

house floor consideration of interior and environment appropriations was not completed , and the senate first considered these programs in the context of division e of the conference report on a bill whose original subject was appropriations for military construction .

the house next considered fws appropriations in the context of the conference report for the same measure .

as a result , the legislative history of interior and environment appropriations in general , and fws specifically , is truncated relative to most years , and the emphasis below is largely on the final bill .

congress approved $1.48 billion for the agency for fy2012 .

the president had requested $1.69 billion ( up 13% from fy2011 ) ; on july 12 , 2011 , the house committee approved $1.19 billion ( down 21% from fy2011 ) .

 ( see table 1 . ) .

most accounts and subaccounts were reduced relative to fy2011 levels .

at the account level , percentage changes from fy2011 to fy2012 ranged from a reduction of 20.4% for the cooperative endangered species conservation fund to an increase of 10.8% for construction .

this report analyzes fy2012 appropriations in a policy context , with reference to past appropriations .

floor action on interior and environment appropriations began on july 25 , 2011 , when the house began consideration of h.r .

2584 .

consideration continued to july 28 , 2011 , when the house rose , leaving h.r .

2584 as unfinished business .

during floor consideration , there were three amendments affecting fws ; two were adopted , and one was rejected .

the first amendment ( h.amdt .

732 ; bass , nh ) increased land acquisition funding by $4 million for fws , as well as making increases for specified other agencies , with offsetting reductions in funds for the office of the doi secretary .

it was adopted by voice vote .

 ( in the end , p.l .

112-74 contained funding for land acquisition , though at a lower level than in fy2011 .

see " land acquisition ." ) .

the second amendment ( h.amdt .

735 ; dicks , wa ) was also adopted ; it removed certain restrictions in the bill concerning funding limitations for endangered species protection .

 ( p.l .

112-74 contained some limits on listing ; see discussion " endangered species funding ." ) .

a third amendment ( h.amdt .

750 ; dicks , wa ) , affecting judicial review of wolf management , was rejected ; p.l .

112-74 contained no language regarding wolf management and judicial review .

 ( see " wolf delisting ," below. ) .

by far the largest portion of the fws annual appropriation is the resource management account , for which congress approved $1.23 billion for fy2012 , down 1.5% from fy2011 .

among the programs included in resource management are endangered species , the refuge system , law enforcement , fisheries , and cooperative landscape conservation and adaptive science ( formerly called climate change adaptive science capacity ) .
