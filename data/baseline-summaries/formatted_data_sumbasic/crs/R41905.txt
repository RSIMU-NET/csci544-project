with a campaign to significantly reduce the budget deficit , some in the 112 th congress see foreign affairs funds , particularly for foreign aid programs , as expenditures that can be cut in order to reduce the deficit .

foreign affairs spending typically amounts to about 1% of the total budget .

others , including some members of congress in both political parties and former secretary of defense robert gates , view a robust foreign affairs budget as essential to promoting u.s. national security and foreign policy interests , perhaps even saving long - term spending by preventing the much costlier use of troops overseas .

the 112 th congress began formal consideration of the annual state department , foreign operations and related agencies appropriations ( state - foreign ops ) legislation with a house subcommittee markup of draft legislation on july 27 .

the senate full committee reported out its state - foreign ops bill on september 22 .

the consolidated appropriations act , fy2012 , was approved by congress in december 2011 and signed into law on december 23 , 2011 .

state - foreign operations appropriations for fy2012 were included as division i of the act .

the state - foreign ops appropriation funds most programs and activities within the international affairs budget account , known as function 150 , including foreign economic and security assistance , contributions to international organizations and multilateral financial institutions , state department and u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) operations , public diplomacy , and international broadcasting programs .

the bill does not align perfectly with the international affairs budget , however .

food aid , which is appropriated through the agriculture appropriations bill , and the international trade commission and foreign claims settlement commission , both funded through the commerce - science - justice appropriation , are international affairs ( function 150 ) programs not funded through the state - foreign operations appropriations bill .

furthermore , a number of international commissions that are not part of function 150 , such as the international boundary and water commission , are funded through the state - foreign operations bill .

a chart illustrating the organizational structure of the state - foreign operations appropriations bill is provided in appendix a .

this report focuses on only the accounts funded through the state - foreign operations appropriations bill , but provides appropriations figures for the entire international affairs ( function 150 ) budget in appendix e .

recent events and congressional activity related to the state - foreign operations appropriations include the following: congress passed the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( h.r .

2055 ) , in mid - december 2011 , and the president signed it into law ( p.l .

112-74 ) on december 23 .

the law provides a 10% increase over fy2011 in state department , foreign operations and related program funds — a 12% increase for state operations , 1% increase for international broadcasting , and 9% increase for foreign operations .

the enacted funding is 10% below the administration's request .

 ( see appendix c and appendix d for account - by - account details. ) .

on november 21 , 2011 , the joint select committee on deficit reduction announced it had failed to meet the deadline to produce a plan for reducing the security and nonsecurity budgets required by the budget control act ( bca , p.l .

112-25 ) .

the next step identified by the bca is sequestration ( a trigger of defense and nondefense automatic budget cuts ) .

sequestration is to take effect january 2013 .

congress passed and the president signed two continuing resolutions: h.j.res .

94 ( p.l .

112-67 , signed december 16 , 2011 ) continued funding through december 17 , and h.j.res .

95 ( p.l .

112-68 , signed december 17 , 2011 ) continued funding through december 23 .

h.r .

2017 ( p.l .

112-33 , signed september 30 , 2011 ) continued fy2011 government funding , reduced by 1.503% through october 4 , 2011 ; h.r .

2608 ( p.l .

112-36 , signed october 5 , 2011 ) continued the reduced fy2011 funding through november 18 , 2011 ; and h.r .

2112 ( p.l .

112-55 , signed november 18 , 2011 ) continues the reduced fy2011 funding through december 16 , 2011 .

this law provides full - year fy2012 foreign food aid funding at $1,630.0 million .

on september 22 , the senate appropriations committee reported out its state - foreign operations bill ( s. 1601 ; s.rept .

112-85 ) with a total discretionary funding level of $45.1 billion plus $8.7 billion in oco funding for a total of $53.8 billion in fy2012 .

 ( in addition , the foreign service retirement fund is mandatory spending amounting to $158.9 million in fy2012. ) .

this is 14% more than the house funding level .

 ( see below. ) .

on september 7 , the senate appropriations committee voted for a $1.043 trillion government spending plan as called for in the budget control act of 2011 .

within this action , the senate provided $44.6 billion in 302 ( b ) allocations ( excluding oco funds ) to state - foreign operations .

congress approved and the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 ( s. 365 / p.l .

112-25 ) on august 2 , 2011 , legislation to raise the debt ceiling .

the measure requires specific funding reductions in security and nonsecurity discretionary spending through fy2013 .

section 102 of the act defines all 150 budget accounts , including the department of state and foreign operations accounts , as security spending , putting them in direct funding competition with the departments of defense , homeland security , and veterans affairs ; the national nuclear security administration ; and the intelligence community .

the law contains additional annual discretionary fund reductions through fy2021 , without differentiating between security and nonsecurity categories .

on july 27 , 2011 , the house appropriations subcommittee on state , foreign operations , and related programs marked up its fy2012 state - foreign operations appropriation , proposing a total discretionary appropriation of $39.7 billion base and $7.6 billion in oco funds for a total of $47.3 billion .

 ( in addition , the foreign service retirement fund is mandatory spending amounting to $158.9 million in fy2012. ) .

the subcommittee total is $1.6 billion ( 3.4% ) below the enacted fy2011 total and more than $12.3 billion ( 20.7% ) below the president's fy2012 request .

this bill remains unnumbered .

the house appropriations committee announced on may 11 , 2011 , the subcommittee allocations , or "302 ( b ) s," which set the state - foreign operations funding ceiling at $39.6 billion , 22% below the president's request of $50.95 billion .

these figures exclude funds for overseas contingency operations , which do not count toward the 302 ( b ) allocation .

earlier , on april 15 , 2011 , the house budget committee passed a budget resolution ( h.con.res .

34 ) recommending $36.6 billion in new budget authority for the international affairs account , and an additional $8.7 billion in overseas contingency funds for state department and foreign operations programs accounted for under a separate "global war on terrorism" budget function .

at $45.3 billion , total budget authority approved under the resolution for international affairs accounts would be 26% less than the administration requested .

on february 14 , 2011 , the obama administration submitted its fy2012 budget request to congress .

hearings on various aspects of the international affairs budget request were held throughout march and april .

on february 14 , 2011 , the obama administration sent its fy2012 budget request to congress , with a total of $59.65 billion requested for the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs .

the budget , which the administration was compiling a year before the 112 th congress began focusing on reducing the deficit , represents an 8.2% increase from enacted fy2010 funding , including the fy2010 supplemental , and a 21.8% increase over the fy2011 enacted level .

figure 1 provides a breakout of the request by assistance type .

figure 1 shows the major categories of foreign affairs funding requested for fy2012 and what percentage of the total foreign affairs request each comprises .

the administration's priorities on foreign affairs funding for fy2012 as compared with those in fy2011 would have state department administration of foreign affairs funding increase from 22% in the fy2011 request to 25% , bilateral economic aid funding decrease from 46% in the fy2011 request to 39% , and security aid funding increase from 12% in the fy2011 request to 19% .

these three categories make up more than 80% of the total foreign affairs funding requested .

u.s. national security , trade promotion , and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities .

during the cold war , foreign aid and diplomatic programs had a primarily anti - communist focus , while concurrently pursuing other u.s. policy interests , such as promoting economic development , advancing u.s. trade , expanding access to basic education and health care , promoting human rights , and protecting the environment .

after the early 1990s , with the cold war ended , distinct policy objectives — including stopping nuclear weapons proliferation , curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs , expanding peace efforts in the middle east , achieving regional stability , protecting religious freedom , and countering trafficking in persons — replaced the cold war - influenced foreign policy objectives .

a defining change in focus came following the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .

since then , many u.s. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have emphasized national security objectives , frequently cast in terms of contributing to efforts to counter terrorism .

in 2002 , president bush released a national security strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of u.s. national security , along with defense and diplomacy .

development was again underscored in the administration's 2006 and 2010 national security strategy .

also in 2002 , foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority , emphasizing u.s. assistance to 28 "front - line" states — countries that cooperated with the united states in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves .

large reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq exemplified the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism .

state department efforts focused extensively on diplomatic security and finding more effective ways of presenting american views and culture through public diplomacy , particularly in muslim communities .

the obama administration has carried forward many bush foreign aid initiatives , including usaid's development leadership initiative ( dli ) , the millennium challenge corporation , and robust assistance to iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan .

the obama administration has also largely sustained bush administration investments in global health and hiv / aids treatment , though its global health initiative shifts the emphasis away from a focus on discrete diseases and toward comprehensive health systems .

in the fy2011 and fy2012 requests , the administration further defined its international priorities , with an emphasis on building state department and usaid capacity , supporting multilateral food security and global climate change initiatives , and shifting responsibility for assistance programs in iraq and elsewhere from military to civilian authorities .

table 2 and figure 2 show state - foreign operations appropriations for the past decade in both current and constant dollars .

table 3 and figure 3 show appropriations for the state department and related agencies over the past decade in both current and constant dollars .

table 4 and figure 4 show appropriations for the state department and related agencies over the past decade in both current and constant dollars .

prior to the wars in afghanistan and iraq , israel and egypt typically received the largest amounts of u.s. foreign aid every year since the camp david peace accords in 1978 .

the reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan moved those countries into the top five , though assistance to iraq has declined significantly in the past couple of years , with the completion of many reconstruction activities .

meanwhile , a combination of security assistance and economic aid designed to limit the appeal of extremist organizations has moved pakistan up the list in recent years .

funding for iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan includes overseas contingency operations ( oco ) temporary appropriations .

in the fy2012 request , afghanistan tops the list at $3,213.4 million , including $1.2 billion in economic support fund - oco funds .

israel ranks second , with all of the $3,075 million requested for foreign military financing ( fmf ) .

pakistan ranks third at $2,965 million , 80% of which is for activities supported by the economic support fund ( esf ) and the pakistan counterinsurgency capability fund - oco ( pccf ) .

iraq moves up from sixth in fy2010 to fourth in the fy2012 request .

this is largely because of $1.0 billion for incle - oco and $1.0 billion for fmf - oco .

haiti , which was a top recipient in fy2010 as a result of supplemental funds for post - earthquake relief and reconstruction , would not be among the top 10 recipients in fy2012 under the administration's proposal .

as shown in figure 5 , under the fy2012 budget request , africa ( $7.8 billion ) , near east ( $8.8 billion ) , and south central asia ( $6.8 billion ) would receive the most u.s. foreign assistance .

aid to africa primarily supports hiv / aids and other health - related programs while 88% of the aid to south central asia is requested for afghanistan and pakistan .

the near east region continues to be dominated by assistance to israel ( $3.0 billion ) , iraq ( $2.4 billion ) , egypt ( $1.6 billion ) , and jordan ( $0.7 billion ) .

the western hemisphere's projected relative decline in fy2012 is attributable mostly to the $1.4 billion in supplemental funds for haiti's humanitarian crisis in 2010 .

assistance to europe and eurasia would decline , according to the administration , partly due to a reduction of funds in aeeca to reflect progress made by many countries in the region and other more pressing global priorities .

aid to east asia and pacific remains relatively low and consistent with past years' levels .

over the years , congress has expressed interest in various discrete aid sectors , such as education , building trade capacity , maternal and child health , and biodiversity , that are funded across multiple accounts and / or agencies .

administrations have begun presenting their respective budget requests with a section showing what portion of the request would address some of these "key interest areas. .

unlike the account funding tables in the budget request , however , the key interest area breakout does not show prior year allocations , limiting year - to - year comparison to requested funds rather than actual funding .

this provides an indication of the administration's interests and priorities , but not necessarily those of congressional appropriators .

table 6 compares the fy2011 and fy2012 budget requests for key interest areas identified by the administration .

the administration requested less for most sectors than it did in fy2011 .

perhaps surprisingly , two of the administration's major initiatives — food security and global climate change―show declines in the fy2012 request , as does the request for microenterprise and microfinance , trade capacity building , pandemic influenza , and other public health threats .

sectors with increased funding include family planning , maternal and child health , and water .

the administration emphasized two new focus areas , adding gender funding and science , technology , and innovation to the key interests list .
