on november 29 , 1999 , president clinton signed into law the consolidatedappropriations act for fy2000 ( h.r .

3194 ; p.l .

106-113 ) , legislationthat enacts by reference h.r .

3422 , the foreign operationsappropriations act , fy2000 .

h.r .

3422 was the third foreignoperations measure debated by congress in 1999 and represented the results ofextensive negotiations between congress and the white house to resolve fundingdifferences .

president clinton had vetoed the first foreign operations measure ( h.r .

2606 ) because it cut $1.92 billion from his request .

h.r .

3422 provides $13.5 billion for regular foreign aid programs , plus$1.8 billion over three years for the wye river / middle east peace accord , for a totalpackage of $15.3 billion .

h.r .

3422 remains about $900 million belowthe president's amended budget proposal .

in addition to including the wye river money , the new foreign operations measure adds $799 million for several accounts that congress had reduced earlier,including the world bank's international development association and funds for thepresident's counter - proliferation expanded threat reduction initiative in the formersoviet union .

new funding is offset by delaying the transfer beyond fy2000 of $550million of israel's military aid .

this will not reduce israel's $1.92 billion militaryaid , but because the funds would have been placed in an interest bearing account,it will result in the loss to israel of interest earned on the early disbursement .

the most significant administration funding priority not included in the revised foreign operations measure is multilateral debt relief for poor developing countries .

congressional negotiators agreed to an additional $90 million for bilateral debtrelief - - bringing the debt reduction total to $123 million - - and they adopted amodified authorization ( in h.r .

3425 , also enacted by reference in p.l.106-113 ) for the u.s. to support the imf off - market sale of gold .

congress,however , would not add another $250 million to forgive debt owed to multilateralinstitutions or $600 million requested for debt relief in fy2001-2003 .

on the mostcontentious issue , the administration further accepted abortion - related internationalfamily planning policy restrictions in exchange for congressional approval of nearly$1 billion in u.n. arrears payments .

on november 30 , president clinton exercisedhis waiver authority to exempt the abortion conditions from applying to $15 millionof the $385 million population aid appropriation and said he would oppose inclusionof these restrictions in future spending measures .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislativevehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the u.s. foreign assistancebudget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally .

 ( 1 ) it containsthe largest share - - about 70% - - of total international affairs spending by the unitedstates ( see figure 1 ) .

the legislation funds all u.s. bilateral development assistanceprograms , managed mostly by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies , such as thepeace corps and the inter - american and african development foundations .

foreignoperations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union ( also referred to as the new independent states ( nis ) account ) and central / easterneurope , activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department .

security assistance ( economic and military aid ) for israel and egypt is also part of theforeign operations spending measure , as are smaller security aid programsadministered largely by the state department , in conjunction with usaid and thepentagon .

u.s. contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateraldevelopment banks , managed by the treasury department , and voluntary paymentsto international organizations , handled by the state department , are also funded inthe foreign operations bill .

finally , the legislation includes appropriations for threeexport promotion agencies: the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) ,the export - import bank , and the trade and development agency .

from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in u.s. foreign aid policy making , the foreign operations bill has taken on even greatersignificance during the past decade .

congress has not enacted a foreign aidauthorization bill since 1985 , leaving most foreign assistance programs withoutregular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees .

as aresult , foreign operations spending measures increasingly have expanded their scopebeyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping , authorizing , and guidingboth executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives .

it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united stateshas modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the coldwar .

the legislation has also been a key tool used by congress to apply restrictionsand conditions on administration management of foreign assistance , actions thathave frequently resulted in executive - legislative clashes over presidentialprerogatives in foreign policy making .

president clinton submitted his fy2000 federal budget request to congress onfebruary 1 , 1999 , including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriationsprograms .

subsequently , house and senate foreign operations subcommittees have held a series of hearings , including testimony from secretary of state albright,treasury secretary rubin , and usaid administrator atwood .

skipping a formalsubcommittee markup , the senate appropriations committee reported on june 17 , s. 1234 .

the full senate approved the bill on june 30 by a vote of 97-2 .

the house foreign operations subcommittee marked up its bill on july 14 , followedby full committee approval of h.r .

2606 on july 20 .

the houseapproved the legislation on august 3 .

the following day , the senate took up h.r .

2606 , deleted all of the house - passed text , substituted language in s. 1234 , passed h.r .

2606 , as amended , and requested aconference with the house .

house and senate conferees met on september 22 , 1999 , agreeing to all issues in dispute except international family planning .

members resolved this final issuein disagreement on september 27 and filed a conference report .

with presidentclinton threatening to veto h.r .

2606 because of reductions to hisbudget request , the house ( 214-211 ) and senate ( 51-49 ) agreed on october 5 and 6,respectively , to the conference report , clearing the measure for the white house .

president clinton vetoed the legislation , however , on october 18 , because of lowfunding levels and the absence of appropriations for several initiatives , including thewye river / middle east peace package and an expansion of the heavily indebtedpoor country ( hipc ) debt relief program .

the house , on november 5 , approved a revised foreign operations measure ( h.r .

3196 ) that was acceptable to the white house .

furthernegotiations yielded a few additional changes to h.r .

as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to a post - coldwar environment , one of the major foreign assistance challenges for congress andexecutive branch policymakers has been to formulate the most effective foreign aidprogram amidst a tightening resource base .

after peaking at $20.7 billion in fy1985 , foreign operations appropriations began a period of decline , falling to about $12.3 billion in fy1997 .

foreign aidspending cuts were especially sharp in fy1996 when congress cut funding by $1.15billion , nearly 9% from the previous year .

many government and non - governmentexperts argued that these budget reductions seriously undermined u.s. foreign policyinterests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events .

after foreign operations funding levels fell again in fy1997 - - although by muchsmaller amounts - - the state department and other executive agencies launched anaggressive campaign in to reverse the decade - long decline in the foreign policybudget .

this effort coincided with congressional approval of a near $1 billionincrease for fy1998 , setting foreign operations appropriations at $13.15 billion .

foreign operations funds rose again to $13.8 billion in fy1999 when lawmakers , atthe urging of the white house , added nearly $900 million in the final days of the105th congress .

as shown in table 2 , the amount for fy1999 was the highest in five years , bolstered especially by $2.1 billion supplemental funding for central americahurricane relief , kosovo humanitarian aid , and several other foreign assistanceemergencies .

for fy1999 , foreign operations represented 0.87% of the entirefederal budget and 2.6% of total discretionary budget authority .

by comparison,these same figures in fy1985 were 2% and 4.6% , respectively .

it excludes , however,$17.861 billion for the imf .

over the past 20 years , foreign operations spending has experienced three distinct trends when calculated in real terms , taking into account the effects ofinflation .

the first period was marked by a steady growth in foreign operationsappropriations levels during the early 1980s when the united states rapidly expandedsecurity - related aid programs in central america , pakistan , and to countriesproviding the u.s. with military bases .

funding peaked in fy1985 at $31.9 billion ( in fy1999 dollars ) followed by a sharp cut in fy1986 as the effects of thegramm - rudman deficit reduction initiative took hold and limited federal spendingin most areas .

for the next five years , during a second phase of foreign operationsbudget trends , appropriations remained relatively stable at about $19.5 billion peryear ( real terms ) .

towards the end of the cold war , foreign aid spending in real terms began to fall steadily - - from about $16.7 billion in fy1992 , to $15 billion in fy1995 , to $13billion in fy1997 .

appropriations for fy1997 were the lowest since 1975 whencongress slashed foreign assistance spending during the u.s. withdrawal fromvietnam .

fy1999 foreign operations spending is about 29% below the averageappropriation level approved by congress during the late 1980s , 17% less thanfy1992 , a year that might be considered the first post - cold war foreign aid budget,and 8% less than fy1995 when the majority in congress changed .

foreign operations appropriations: discretionarybudget authority ( millions of dollars ) a .

the fy2000 request includes amendments made since the initial submission on feb. 1 , 1999 , as well as the complete three year request for the wye river / middle east peace accord .

b .

the account structure for development aid differs among various versions of the bills .

this tableshows a consistent and comparable account structure based on the conference agreement fordevelopment aid , fy2000 .

c. amounts reflect the transfer of $12.5 million from development assistance / population aid to childsurvival due to the president's exercise of his waiver authority to exempt abortion restrictionsfrom applying certain population funds .

d. for fy2000 , the administration requested a separate account under development assistance forafrica ( the development fund for africa , or dfa ) .

african aid was also proposed within thechild survival account .

the total amount requested for africa - - dfa plus africa childsurvival - - was $745 million .

this compares to an fy1999 level of $730 millionappropriated within the child survival and development assistance fund accounts .

e. the administration requested $1.9 billion in esf and fmf funds to support the wye riveraccord over the period fy1999-2001 .

congress approved $100 million of the total for fy1999and an additional $1.825 billion that is available through fy2002 .

f. the administration request included the ireland fund as part of the economic support fund .

g. on september 21 , 1999 , the administration amended its pending budget request for debtreduction , seeking $250 million more for debt reduction in fy2000 , and $600 million forfy2001-2003 .

h. of this amount , however , $21 million is not available until september 30 , 2000. i. imf funding occurs only occasionally - - about every five years .

there was no request forfy2000 .

j .

the "base" appropriation refers to amounts funded in the regular foreign operationsappropriations for fy1999 , as included in division a of the omnibus appropriations act,fy1999 ( p.l .

105-277 ) .

congress approved additional foreign operations funds in twosupplemental measures: $411 million for child survival programs , aid to russia , victims ofthe kenya / tanzania embassy bombings , counter - narcotics , counter - terrorism , and y2kupgrades ( division b of p.l .

105-277 ) ; and $1.641 billion for central america hurricane relief,kosovo humanitarian assistance , counter - narcotics , and the administration of three foreignaffairs commissions .

all but about $5 million of the supplementals were declared"emergencies" and do not count against the foreign operations fy1999 allocation limits .

under special allowances provided in the balanced budget act of 1997 , foreign operationsappropriations for multilateral development bank arrearage payments and imf funds also donot count against the fy1999 allocation limits .
