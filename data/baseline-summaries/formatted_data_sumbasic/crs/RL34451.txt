on june 30 , 2008 , president bush signed h.r .

2642 ( p.l .

110-252 ) , a bill which makes supplemental appropriations for fy2008 and fy2009 for military operations in iraq and afghanistan and for other purposes .

the bill also extends unemployment payments , and expands veterans' educational benefits .

the house had passed the bill on june 19 , and the senate approved it june 26 by a vote of 92-6 .

in floor action on the bill on june 19 , the house adopted two amendments to a version of the bill previously approved by the senate .

amendment #1 , agreed to by a vote of 268-155 , included $162.4 billion for military operations , the same amount as in the same title of the senate - passed bill .

amendment #2 , agreed to by a vote of 416-12 , reduced the defense total by $3.6 billion and incorporated all of the other key measures to be included in the final bill .

because the house agreed on june 19 to the defense total in the version of the bill previously approved by the senate , the issue before the senate on june 26 was concurrence in the house - passed amendment #2 .

before clearing the bill for the president , the senate voted 77-21 to waive the budget act concerning the bill , thus disposing of a point of order against the bill raised by senator coburn , who contended that the bill improperly designated as "emergency" spending — thus exempt from spending ceilings set by the congressional budget resolution — $210 million for the census bureau .

as enacted , the bill would cost an estimated $202 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 and almost $60 billion more through fy2018 , of which $183.5 billion is supplemental appropriations for defense , international affairs , disaster relief , and some other domestic programs , including $2.65 billion of newly added funds to respond to midwest flooding earlier in the month ; $14 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 is for extended unemployment benefits , with a net cost , following savings in future years , of $10 billion over eleven years through fy2018 ; $796 million in fy2008 and fy2009 and $63 billion through fy2018 is for expanded veterans educational benefits ; and $1.2 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 is due to medicaid rules changes .

the final bill reflects compromises with the white house on several issues .

on major issues the bill extends unemployment benefits for 13 weeks but not for 26 weeks ; expands veterans' educational benefits as in earlier house and senate bills and adds a provision allowing benefits to be transferred to spouses and dependents , as the white house had proposed ; does not include a surcharge on high income taxpayers to offset costs of expanded educational benefits as in the earlier house - passed bill ; delays six , rather than seven , new medicaid rules ; does not approve the bulk of unrequested funds for domestic programs included in the senate - passed bill ; and adds $2.65 billion in new funds , partly at the request of the president , to replenish emergency accounts expected to be used to respond to recent midwest floods .

the final bill also drops most iraq - related policy provisions that were in the original house - passed bill , except for provisions requiring iraq to match u.s. economic assistance , prohibiting permanent bases in iraq , and applying mandatory fraud reporting requirements to contractors working abroad .

in earlier action , on may 15 , 2008 , the house approved an initial version of the bill that provided $21 billion for military construction , international affairs , and domestic programs , but did not include $162.5 billion that the house leadership had proposed for operations in iraq and afghanistan .

the house bill also approved extended unemployment compensation payments , expanded veterans educational benefits , and medicaid rules changes .

procedurally , as a vehicle for considering supplemental appropriations without a committee markup , the house brought to the floor the senate - passed version of h.r .

2642 , the fy2008 military construction / veterans' affairs appropriations bill that had been incorporated into the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act .

the house then considered three amendments as substitutes for the text of the bill .

by a vote of 141-149 with 132 voting present , the house rejected the first amendment to provide $96.6 billion in fy2008 and $65.9 billion in fy2009 funding for military operations .

by a vote of 227-196 , the house approved a second amendment to require the withdrawal of combat forces from iraq within 18 months ; establish readiness requirements for the deployment of u.s. troops ; require that any agreement on the status of u.s. forces in iraq be authorized by congress ; mandate that iraq match u.s. reconstruction aid dollar - for - dollar and agree to subsidize fuel costs for u.s. forces ; make contractors in war zones subject to prosecution for offenses that would violate u.s. law ; prohibit the establishment of permanent bases in iraq ; and prohibit interrogation techniques not authorized in the army field manual .

and , by a vote of 256-166 , the house approved a third amendment providing $21 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 for military construction , domestic , and international affairs programs .

the amendment also included expanded veterans educational benefits at an estimated cost of $52 billion over ten years , with an offsetting increase in taxes on those with incomes above $500,000 for an individual or $1,000,000 for a couple .

and the amendment included an extension of unemployment benefits and medicaid rules changes .

a week later , on may 22 , 2008 , the senate approved an amended version of h.r .

2642 , providing $194 billion in supplemental appropriations for fy2008 and fy2009 , and also approving extended unemployment payments , expanded veterans' educational benefits , medicaid rules changes , and adding a limit on medicare payments to new specialty hospitals .

on key roll call votes , all of which required 60 votes for approval , the senate rejected by a vote of 34-63 an amendment to the house bill to provide funding for defense programs and to establish various iraq policy provisions ; approved by a vote of 75-22 an amendment providing defense funding without policy restrictions ; and approved by a vote of 70-26 an amendment providing funding for domestic programs , international affairs , and military construction .

earlier , on may 2 , the white house sent congress an amendment to its fy2009 budget formally requesting $70 billion in emergency fy2009 funding , including $66 billion for the department of defense and $4 billion for international affairs programs .

the $66 billion request for the defense department constituted a "bridge fund" sufficient to allow the services to carry on both day - to - day peacetime activities and military operations overseas until the middle of 2009 .

approval of a bridge fund — which the appropriations committees had planned to provide before the white house made its formal request — would allow congress to avoid a debate over war funding during the fall election period , and also provide the 111 th congress time to act on a full - year war supplemental after the next president takes office .

the $4 billion fy2009 emergency international affairs request included $770 million in emergency food - related assistance announced on may 1 ( though fy2009 funding would not be available until october 1 , 2008 ) , $1.4 billion for aid to iraq , $1.1 billion for aid to afghanistan , $350 million for the middle east , $193 million for pakistan , $123 million for stabilization operations in africa , $36 million for security for diplomats in the middle east , sudan , and somalia , and $15 million for the six party agreement on north korean nuclear programs .

on may 1 , the president announced a new request for $770 million in fy2009 emergency supplemental appropriations for international food aid .

the administration had requested $350 million for p.l .

480 international food assistance in its october , 2007 , budget amendment to the fy2008 supplemental request .

senators durbin and casey had proposed adding $200 million in food aid to the supplemental .

the enacted version of h.r .

2642 provides $96.1 billion for military operations in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere in fy2008 and $65.9 billion in fy2009 ; $4.2 billion for military construction programs in the united states and abroad ; $10.1 billion for international affairs programs ; and $10.3 billion for domestic programs , including $2.65 billion , added after the house , on may 15 , and the senate , on may 22 , passed earlier versions of the bill , to respond to midwest floods .

on key issues , the final bill expands gi bill veterans' education benefits to provide a full four years of college education for service members who serve 36 or more months abroad , as provided in the house and senate bills , and also permits benefits to be transferred to spouses and dependents , as the administration requested , which increases the estimated ten - year cost from $52 billion to $62.8 billion ; does not include a house - passed 0.5% income tax surcharge on incomes of $500,000 or more for individuals and $1,000,000 or more for couples — the surcharge was intended to offset the cost of the gi bill provisions ; provides 13 weeks of extended unemployment compensation in all states , but not 26 weeks in some states as in the house and senate bills , reducing the estimated ten - year cost from $11 billion to $8.2 billion .

adds $2.65 billion to replenish accounts expected to be used for midwest flood relief — the white house had reportedly requested $1.8 billion ; delays implementation of six of seven administration changes in medicaid regulations that would reduce federal payments to the states , rather than of all seven as in the house and senate bills ; drops most iraq - related policy provisions that were in the house - passed version of the bill , including a provision requiring withdrawal of combat troops within 18 months and others requiring that troops meet targets for readiness and for dwell time at home between deployments — the bill includes measures requiring the iraqi government to match amounts of some reconstruction assistance and prohibiting the use of funds to establish permanent bases in iraq , and it extends mandatory fraud reporting requirements to contractors working abroad ; provides $5.8 billion for gulf coast hurricane protection levees , as the administration requested , and deletes $4.6 billion in additional flood - relief funding in the senate bill , though the final bill also adds $73 million for housing vouchers ; provides $4.2 billion for military construction , which is $2.2 billion above the administration request , $1.2 billion above the senate level , and $0.4 billion below the house may 15-passed bill ; provides $400 million in unrequested funds for science programs rather than $1.2 billion as in the senate bill ; provides $150 million to bolster food and drug administration safety programs , compared to $275 million in the senate bill ; and provides $178 million for the bureau of prisons and $210 million for the bureau of the census , as requested by the agencies , though not formally included in the administration's may 2 , 2008 , supplemental request , and as included in both the house and senate bills .

in advance of additional fy2008 supplemental funding , the defense department had available funds provided ( 1 ) in the regular fy2008 defense appropriations act ( p.l .

110-116 ) and ( 2 ) in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations action ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

defense officials had calculated that funding for the army appropriated in those two bills would begin to run out some time in june — by about the middle of june for army military personnel accounts and by the end of june for army operation and maintenance .

on may 27 , however , the defense department requested congressional approval to transfer $9.7 billion of funds to the army , sufficient , officials said , to extend operations through the end of july .

dod requested that congress include in a supplemental bill authority to replenish the accounts from which the transfers of funds were to be made .

section 9103 of the final supplemental bill provides dod authority to transfer up to $2.5 billion of fy2008 funds in the bill between accounts and section 9203 provides authority to transfer up to $4 billion of fy2009 funds .

in addition to , or instead of , transferring funds from other accounts , the defense department could have extended army operations beyond june by invoking the feed and forage act , which allows the defense department to obligate funds in advance of appropriations for transportation , housing , subsistence and other purposes .

the defense department might also have extended operations by using other standing authorities to shift funding between the services .

on june 26 , hours before the senate passed the amended bill , defense secretary robert m. gates said during a press conference that , until the bill was enacted , dod would continue planning for a possible shutdown of all nonessential operations in july .

in addition to funding for defense and international affairs , the administration's original fy2008 supplemental request included a limited amount of funding for domestic programs , including counter - terrorism - related programs of the justice department particularly the fbi .

along with its regular fy2009 budget , the administration requested emergency fy2009 appropriations of $5.8 billion for gulf coast hurricane protection measures carried out by the corps of engineers .

individual agencies , including the census bureau , the federal prison system , and the u.s .

marshals office , also reported shortfalls in funds to the appropriations committees .

in action on the 2 nd fy2008 supplemental , h.r .

2642 , the house and senate supplemental bills chambers provided requested funding for these programs .

in addition , the senate bill added $4.6 billion for hurricane and other disaster relief programs , $1.2 billion for a science r&d initiative across several agencies , $1 billion for low income energy assistance , $590 million for state and local law enforcement grants , and $400 million for secure rural schools .

also , most significantly , both the house and the senate approved three major measures that the administration did not request .

the are an expansion of veterans' educational benefits , initially estimated to cost $52 billion over the next ten years ; extended unemployment benefits , initially estimated to cost a total of about $11 billion over ten years , net of reduced payments in future years ; and a moratorium on new medicaid rules that would reduce payments to the states , for which the house and senate supplemental bills include $450 million in fy2008 and $1.15 billion in fy2009 .

the senate bill also provides $80 million in fy2008 and $75 million in fy2009 for increases in the schip children's health insurance program net of offsetting savings from limiting medicare payments to new specialty hospitals .

the following sections provide background on some of the major congressional additions .

both the house - and senate - passed bills included provisions that would enhance veterans' educational benefits .

the benefit enhancements were based on the post - 9 / 11 veterans educational assistance act of 2008 ( s. 22 ) , sponsored by senator webb , which has broad bipartisan support , with 56 co - sponsors in the senate ; and the house companion bill , h.r .

5740 , sponsored by representative mitchell , which has 261 cosponsors .

s. 22 and h.r .

5740 would offer 36 months of tuition ( limited to in - state tuition charged at the most expensive public institution in the state in which the veteran is enrolled ) , a monthly stipend to cover living expenses ( based on average housing prices in the area in which the veteran is enrolled ) , and a $1,000 annual stipend for books and required educational expenses .

provisions for funds for tutorial assistance , licensing , and certification tests are also included .

the bills would apply to active duty , reserve , and national guard members who serve some period of active duty beginning on or after september 11 , 2001 .

servicemembers and veterans who serve 36 months on active duty would be eligible for full benefits .

individuals who serve less than 36 months on active duty would be eligible for benefits calculated as a percentage of the total maximum benefits .

the bills also establish a new program under which the government would match dollar for dollar ( up to 50% of the tuition difference ) any voluntary additional contributions to veterans from institutions whose tuition is more expensive than the maximum educational assistance provided under the bills .

differing views on the pros and cons of s. 22 were offered at a hearing before the senate committee on veterans' affairs on may 9 , 2007 .

senator webb argued that s. 22 was comparable to the post - world war ii gi bill , would lead to similar economic growth and expansion , and would also have a positive effect on military recruitment and on the readjustment experience of veterans .

in the same hearing , daniel cooper , the department of veterans' affairs ( va ) under secretary for benefits , stated the va's opposition , criticizing the bill's complexity , cost , and administrative burden .

he also argued that it might lead to lower rates of reenlistment in the military services .

an alternative to s. 22 and h.r .

5740 was proposed by senator graham on april 29 , 2008 .

s. 2938 , the enhancement of recruitment , retention , and readjustment through education act of 2008 , proposed somewhat more limited increases in gi bill educational benefits for servicemembers and veterans .

for individuals with 12 or more years of active duty service , the benefits would be $1,650 per month in fy2009 , in addition to a $500 annual stipend for books and supplies ( for those attending on at least a half - time basis ) .

as under the current montgomery gi bill ( mgib ) , servicemembers would have accept a pay reduction of $100 per month for the first 12 months of pay , the benefits would be for 36 months and would have to be used within 10 years of discharge or release from active duty , and provisions for tutorial assistance and licensing and certification tests are included .

in addition , active duty servicemembers would be able to use up to $6,000 per year of educational benefits to repay federal student loans , and eligibility would be extended to certain individuals not currently eligible for mgib , including service academy graduates and senior reserve officers' training corps officers ( under some conditions and with some stipulations ) .

the bill also proposed a matching grants program , the 'college patriots grant program,' in which up to an additional $3,000 per year could be paid by the department of veterans affairs in return for schools , through the use of institutional or other non - federal aid , making a matching reduction in cost of attendance for a servicemember .

additionally , s. 2938 included a transferability of benefits provision .

servicemembers would be allowed to transfer up to half of their education benefits to dependents after six years of service and to transfer all of their education benefits after 12 years of service .

under existing law , the different service branches were authorized to operate limited transferability programs , but only the army offers one at this time .

the army's program allowed servicemembers in designated critical skills areas with at least six years of service who re - enlist for at least four years to transfer up to 18 months , or half , of their educational benefits to dependents .

president bush proposed expanding the transferability of veterans' educational benefits to dependents in his state of the union address and repeated it in his may 8 address commemorating military spouse day .

the gi bill enhancements became major issue in congressional consideration of the fy2008 supplemental , holding up action on the entire measure for some time .

in the house , members of the democratic "blue dog" caucus initially warned that they would not support a rule on the bill because the cost was not offset as the rules of the house required .

at the beginning of the 110 th congress , the new democratic majority agreed to changes in house rules to require that increases in mandatory spending or cuts in revenues be paid for either by cuts in other mandatory programs or by increases in revenues .

these requirements , which are based on provisions initially included in the budget enforcement act of 1990 , are known as "pay as you go" or paygo rules .

the house leadership subsequently agreed to support an income tax surcharge as an offset to the costs of the bill .

the senate , however , did not concur .

in addition , the defense department was consistently critical of the webb and mitchell bill because of concern that it might weaken retention of military personnel .

because the bill would provide full benefits to servicemembers after as little as 36 months of service , dod officials feared the program would encourage personnel to leave for college rather than to reenlist in the military .

secretary of defense gates raised these issues in an april 29 letter to senator levin and in a pentagon press conference on may 8 , at which chairman of the joint chiefs , admiral michael mullen , echoed his concerns .

in the may 8 press conference , secretary gates and admiral mullen both emphasized their preference , as well , for a bill that would permit servicemembers to transfer educational benefits to family members .

on may 6 , president bush announced that he was sending legislation to congress to permit benefit transfers as well .

the may 15 house - passed version of the fy2008 / fy2009 supplemental included expanded gi bill benefits as in the original webb / mitchell proposals .

the bill also included a measure that would raise an estimated $52.3 billion in revenues through fy2008 by imposing a surcharge on the tax bills of individuals earning over $500,000 a year and couples earning over $1 million .

the senate approved a similar expansion of benefits in its may 22-passed version of the bill , but did not agree to an offsetting increase in revenues .

although house blue dog democrats insisted on offsetting the cost of expanded gi bill benefits it to the very end , the house leadership ultimately decided not to include offsets in the amendments brought to the floor on june 19 — and only 12 representatives voted against amendment # 2 that included the gi bill expansion .

the final version of h.r .

2642 , as passed by the house on june 19 and the senate on june 26 , includes a version of the initial webb / mitchell expansion of veterans educational benefits , with a provision added to allow benefits to be transferred to spouses or other dependents , as the white house had urged .

the inclusion of a transfer provision increased the estimated cost by $11.6 billion , to a total of $63.8 billion from fy2008 through fy2018 .

the administration's fy2009 budget included a request for $5.761 billion in emergency supplemental funds for the army corps of engineers for hurricane protection programs on the gulf coast .

the corps is responsible for much of the repair and fortification of the hurricane protection system of coastal louisiana , particularly in the greater new orleans area .

since hurricane katrina , most of the corps' work on the region's hurricane protection system has been funded through emergency supplemental appropriations , not through the annual appropriations process .

congress has provided about $7 billion in emergency funding to date .

the administration estimated that the $7 billion in previously appropriated funds were insufficient to complete required measures because of increased costs , improved data on costs , and other factors .

the corps anticipated that available funds would be used by the end of fy2008 , but that much remaining work was required to reduce the hurricane flooding risk to the new orleans area to a 100-year level of protection ( i.e. , 1% probability of flooding in any given year ) and to restore and complete hurricane protection in surrounding areas to previously authorized levels of protection by 2011 .

the house and senate differed significantly on emergency funding for hurricane related programs .

both bills provided $5.761 billion in emergency fy2009 funding for the corps of engineers , as the administration requested .

the senate - passed bill provided $4.6 billion in net additional funding for hurricane and other natural disaster - related programs .

senate additions included $3.0 billion more than requested for the corps of engineers , $500 million for wildland fire fighting , $451 million for the emergency highway relief program , $350 million for emergency medicare and medicaid services , and $146 million , offset by rescissions , for housing programs and community development block grants .

after the senate approved its version of the supplemental on may 22 , large rain storms caused extensive flooding in many parts of the midwest .

in response , the white house informally urged congress to add $1.8 billion or more to the supplemental to replenish emergency accounts expected to be depleted by flood - related federal relief and recovery expenditures .

the house added about $2.7 billion for flood relief to the june 19-passed version of the bill , which the senate approved on june 26 and the president signed on june 30 .

the final bill did not , however , included the $4.6 billion that the senate had added .

the final bill provides $8.4 billion for disaster relief , as opposed to $5.8 billion in the request and the initial house bill and $10.4 billion in the senate may 22-passed bill .

several other , smaller domestic programs also received funding in the pending supplemental .

as a result of newly discovered difficulties with equipment planned to be used in various aspects of the 2010 decennial census , the census bureau faced substantial shortfalls in funding for fy2008 .

at hearings , the secretary of commerce stated that the shortfall for fy2008 would be between $160-$230 million , which the agency proposed to pay for through internal transfers within the department of commerce .

both the house - and senate - passed supplemental bills provided $210 million in emergency fy2008 supplemental appropriations for the bureau of the census , and that amount is included in the final , enacted bill .

other agencies also reported shortfalls of funds to the appropriations committees .

the initial may 15 house - passed bill included $178 million to make up shortfalls in the federal prison system , and the may 22 senate - passed bill included that amount and also added $50 million for the federal marshals service and $275 million for food and drug administration enforcement activities .

the final , enacted bill includes $178 million for prisons and $150 million for the fda .

in all , excluding fy2008 and fy2009 costs of extended unemployment compensation , enhanced gi bill education benefits , and the delay of medicaid rules , the may 15 house - passed bill included $6.6 billion for domestic programs , the may 22 senate - passed bill $15.1 billion , and the final , enacted bill $10.3 billion .

of the senate additions to the house bill , $4.6 billion was for disaster recovery programs .

the remaining senate additions included a $1.2 billion science initiative that provides $200 million for the nasa return to flight program , $200 million for the national science foundation , $400 million for department of energy defense and non - defense cleanup and science programs , and $400 million for the national institutes of health , $1 billion for the low - income heating emergency assistance program ( liheap ) ; $590 million for state and local law enforcement assistance grants ; $400 million for the secure rural schools homeland security program .

the final , enacted bill included $2.7 billion more than the initial request and the initial house bill for disaster recovery .

that amount was for accounts expected to be used in response to midwest floods .

the final bill also added to the initial house bill $400 million for science programs , and , as noted earlier , $150 million for the food and drug administration .

in all , however , the final bill did not included nearly as much as the senate bill for unrequested domestic programs .

appendix a .

status of fy2008 supplemental funding through december 2007 status of fy2008 supplemental funding during the first session of the 110 th congress , which ended on december 31 , 2007 , the administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year ( fy ) 2008 , including $189.3 billion for military operations , $6.9 billion for international affairs , and $325 million for other purposes .

through the end of december , congress had approved $86.8 billion of the total requested for defense and $2.4 billion for international affairs , of which the state department calculated that $1.5 billion was for requested programs .

of the president's total emergency request , $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs remained outstanding .

for defense , much of the remaining requested funding was to repair , replace , and upgrade weapons and other equipment used in the war .

for foreign operations , remaining funding included additional sums for reconstruction assistance to iraq and afghanistan and for a major new counter - narcotics initiative in mexico and central america .

for state department operations , outstanding requests included additional amounts for diplomatic and consular program security upgrades and for contributions to international peacekeeping activities in darfur and elsewhere .

congressional action on fy2008 supplemental appropriations through december 2007 administration requests between february and october of 2007 , the administration submitted requests for fy2008 emergency supplemental appropriations in three blocks .

along with the regular fy2008 budget that the white house sent to congress on february 5 , 2007 , the administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the defense department , $3.3 billion for the state department and international affairs , and $325 million for other agencies .

by submitting the defense request along with the president's fy2008 budget , the administration complied with section 1008 of the fy2007 national defense authorization act ( p.l .

109-364 ) , which required the president's budget to included a request for estimated full year costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan and a detailed justification of the funds .

the request constituted a defense department estimate of the full year costs of continuing operations in iraq and afghanistan at about the same pace as in 2006 .

the defense department acknowledged , however , that the estimate was only a rough , straight - line projection of current costs .

by the time the budget was submitted , the administration was proposing a surge in troops to iraq that was not reflected in the budget , and it was expected that the administration would later provide revised cost projections .

these were submitted in october .

on july 31 , 2007,the white house requested an additional $5.3 billion for the department of defense to procure , outfit , and deploy 1,520 mine resistant ambush protected ( mrap ) vehicles for the army and marine corps .

on october 22 , 2007 , the president proposed an amendment to the fy2008 budget requesting an additional $45.9 billion in emergency funding for military operations , economic and reconstruction assistance , embassy security , and other activities mainly related to ongoing conflicts in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere .

the request included $42.3 billion for the department of defense for military operations and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs .

in all , the administration requested $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for fy2008 , mainly for military operations in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere and for related foreign affairs programs .

congressional action congressional action on fy2008 emergency supplemental funding began in earnest in september 2007 and was not completed until shortly before christmas .

at the end of september , congress included $5.2 billion in emergency funding for mine resistant ambush protected ( mrap ) vehicles ( $5.3 billion was requested in july ) in a provision attached to the first fy2008 continuing resolution , h.j.res .

52 , that the president signed on september 29 , p.l .

110-92 .

on november 8 , 2007 , the house and senate approved a conference agreement on the fy2008 defense appropriations bill , h.r .

3222 , and the president signed the bill into law , p.l .

110-116 , on november 13 .

the measure provided $460 billion for baseline defense department activities in fy2008 , including $27.4 billion for army and $4.8 billion for marine corps operation and maintenance , which may be used to finance both peacetime activities and military operations abroad .

the bill also provided an additional $11.6 billion in emergency funding for mrap vehicles .

except for the mrap money , however , the bill did not include funding to cover additional costs associated with ongoing military operations in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere .

on november 14 , 2007 , by a vote of 218-203 , the house approved the "orderly and responsible iraq redeployment appropriations act , 2008," h.r .

4156 , providing $50 billion for u.s. military operations in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere .

the bill included enough money in army and marine corps operating accounts to sustain military operations in iraq and elsewhere through about april 2008 .

it also ( 1 ) required the president to commence the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq within 30 days of enactment of the legislation and to provide within 60 days a plan for withdrawing most troops from iraq by december 15 , 2008 ; ( 2 ) limited the mission of remaining u.s. forces in iraq to force protection , training , and pursuit of international terrorists ; ( 3 ) prohibited deployment of units that are not fully trained and equipped ; and ( 4 ) extended prohibitions on torture to all u.s. government agencies .

on november 16 , 2007 , by a vote of 53-45 , with 60 votes required , the senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of h.r .

4156 as passed by the house , effectively killing the measure .

the senate also rejected , by a vote of 45-53 , a motion to proceed to consideration of h.r .

2340 , a substitute offered by senator mcconnell , to provide $70 billion for the defense department without requiring withdrawal from iraq .

 ( ultimately , however , with some revisions in the allocation of funds , the mcconnell amendment was approved as part of the final consolidated appropriations act — see below. ) .

meanwhile , in a november 15 , 2007 , pentagon press conference , secretary of defense robert gates warned that the army and marine corps would have to begin implementing steps to limit operations unless congress approved additional funding very soon .

without additional money , he said , the army would have to cease operations at all army bases by mid - february 2008 , which would require furloughs of about 100,000 government employees and a like number of contractor personnel .

plans would have to begin to be implemented in mid - december , he said .

on november 20 , the defense department announced that it was transferring $4.5 billion to the army and to the joint ied defeat organization to extend their operations .

the army , dod said , would only be able to operate with available funds , including the transfer , until february 23 , 2008 .

senior defense officials continued to warn that the army and marine corps would have to halt all but essential operations very soon unless congress approved additional funding .

on december 17 , 2007 , the house brought up the foreign operations appropriations bill , h.r .

2764 , that had earlier been passed by the house and then amended by the senate , as a vehicle for fy2008 "omnibus" or "consolidated" appropriations .

the house approved two amendments to the senate - passed bill .

the first amendment , approved by a vote of 253-154 , struck the senate foreign operations language and inserted the text of conference agreements on 11 of the 12 fy2008 appropriations bills .

in all , it provided $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for programs covered by all of the regular , annual appropriations bills except for defense , for which appropriations had already been enacted .

the second amendment , approved by a vote of 206-201 , provided $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations , mostly restricted to operation enduring freedom ( oef ) , which encompasses operations in afghanistan and elsewhere , excluding iraq .

funding for army and marine corps operation and maintenance was made available only for oef , except for amounts for force protection that could be allocated to any area .

on december 18 , 2007 , the senate took up the house - passed consolidated appropriations bill and , by a vote of 70-25 , adopted an amendment by senator mcconnell to delete the house - passed $31 billion for oef and to provide , instead , $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the department of defense for overseas operations , without limits on where the money could be used and without requiring a withdrawal of forces from iraq .

on december 19 , 2007 , the house considered h.r .

2764 as amended by the senate .

by a vote of 272-142 , the house approved a motion to agree to the senate amendment to the house - passed bill , thus clearing the measure for the president .

the president signed the bill into law , p.l .

110-161 , on december 26 .

remaining fy2008 and additional fy2009 defense request the administration requested a total of $189.3 billion in emergency fy2008 supplemental appropriations for the department of defense .

through december 2007 , congress had approved $86.8 billion , which leaves $102.5 billion still pending .

since december , the defense department has made some adjustments in its budget request .

table 1 shows by title and account ( 1 ) total fy2008 supplemental funding requested for dod through the october 22 , 2007 , budget amendment ; ( 2 ) the amount congress has approved to date ; ( 3 ) adjustments to the remaining amounts that the defense department proposed — though not with a formal budget amendment — as of the end of march , 2008 , and ( 4 ) the remaining adjusted dod budget request .

in preparing a bill to provide remaining fy2008 defense funds , the congressional appropriations committees decided to add a "bridge fund" for fy2009 that would provide enough money to sustain both day - to - day peacetime activities and war - related operations until well into calendar year 2009 .

this would leave it to the next administration to decide what it will request in total supplemental funding to cover war costs based on any planned changes in strategy .

the committees discussed with the defense department how to allocate funds among accounts so as to sustain critical operations through about june of 2009 .

on may 2 , the office of management and budget formally sent congress a request for $70 billion in fy2009 supplemental funding , of which $66 billion was for defense and intelligence and $4 billion was for international affairs .

along with the pending fy2008 supplemental request , table a - 1 shows the breakdown of the may 2 administration request for a $66 billion defense bridge fund .

crs calculates that a bridge fund of about $57 billion , if allocated by account to maximize the amount of time critical operating accounts would last , could allow the services to operate through the end of july , 2009 , at dod's planned monthly rates of obligations .
