the federal government has no juvenile justice system of its own .

instead , starting in the 1960s , the federal government began establishing federal juvenile justice entities and grant programs in order to influence the states' juvenile justice systems .

eligibility for some of these grant programs is tied to certain mandates that the states must adhere to in order to receive federal funding .

this report provides a brief overview of the juvenile justice grant programs and the overall appropriation administered by the department of justice's ( doj's ) office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) .

the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act ( jjdpa ) was first passed by congress in 1974 and was most recently reauthorized in 2002 by the 21 st century department of justice appropriations authorization act .

the jjdpa's provisions are currently unauthorized , having expired in fys 2007 and 2008 , although congress continues to provide appropriations for some of the act's activities .

the jjdpa as originally enacted had three main components: it created a set of institutions within the federal government that were dedicated to coordinating and administering federal juvenile justice efforts ; it established grant programs to assist the states with setting up and running their juvenile justice systems ; and it promulgated core mandates that states had to adhere to in order to be eligible to receive grant funding .

while the jjdpa has been amended several times over the past 30 years , it continues to feature the same three components .

the jjdpa has been a primary channel through which the federal government provides juvenile justice funding to the states ; nonetheless , other congressionally authorized and administratively established programs , administered by ojjdp , have contributed to the overall package of federal juvenile justice funding .

the following section outlines various congressionally authorized juvenile justice grant programs , including those authorized by the jjdpa .

 figure 1 shows overall appropriations for juvenile justice programs within doj .

this juvenile justice appropriation includes funding allocated within the purview of the jjdpa , as well as other grant programs that are administered by ojjdp but that are not within the jjdpa .

examples of these types of non - jjdpa programs include the jabg program and the victims of child abuse act grant , which have sometimes been included in different parts of the doj appropriation but nevertheless are tailored to juveniles and administered by ojjdp .

prior to fy2002 , overall funding for juvenile justice within the doj appropriation gradually increased , peaking at $565 million in fy2002 .

from fy2002 to fy2007 , however , overall juvenile justice funding fell by 38% to $348 million .

the majority of this reduction came from the jabg program .

appropriations for jabg fell from a high of $250 million in fy2002 to $49 million in fy2007 .

in fy2008 , the overall appropriation for juvenile justice programs increased by about 10% from fy2007 to $384 million .

between fy2007 and fy2010 , funding for juvenile justice programs increased by almost 22% to $424 million in fy2010 .

during this time , funding for jjdpa programs increased by 27% from $260 million in fy2007 to $331 million in fy2010 .

funding for juvenile justice programs began to decline once again beginning in fy2011 , and that decline continued through fy2015 .

the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ) provided $275 million for doj's juvenile justice programs for fy2011 .

of these funds , $199 million was for jjdpa programs .

funding for juvenile justice programs continued to decline in fy2012 .

the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-55 ) provided $262.5 million for juvenile justice programs .

of this $262.5 million , $138 million was for jjdpa programs .

additionally , more than 25% of the juvenile justice program funding provided for fy2012 was designated for activities that had not been funded previously under the juvenile justice programs account ( including funding for missing and exploited children programs , child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and practitioners , and grants and technical assistance in support of the national forum on youth violence prevention ) .

the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 ( p.l .

113-6 ) provided $279.5 million for juvenile justice programs for fy2013 .

of note , section 3001 of the act provided for a series of rescissions of fy2013 budget authority .

after applying these rescissions and the sequestration ordered by president obama on march 1 , 2013 , doj reports that juvenile justice programs were funded at nearly $261.0 million for fy2013 .

juvenile justice funding continued to decline in fy2014 ; through the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-76 ) , congress appropriated $254.5 million for juvenile justice programs .

one notable change to the juvenile justice funding pattern was an elimination of jabg funding in fy2014 .

funding for juvenile justice programs dropped again in fy2015 ; through the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 ) , congress appropriated $251.5 million for these programs .

most recently , through the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , congress increased juvenile justice funding and appropriated nearly $270.2 million for these programs for fy2016 .

most programs saw an increase in funding levels relative to fy2015 amounts .

in addition , specific funding was added to support improvements in juvenile indigent defense .

for detailed juvenile justice programs account information , see table 1 .

 table 1 provides a summary of juvenile justice appropriations by program .

the programs appropriated for juvenile justice have varied somewhat from year to year .

for example , the 21 st century department of justice reauthorization act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-273 ) , among other things , repealed a number of pre - existing grant programs and consolidated many of their purpose areas within the juvenile delinquency prevention block grant program .

however , this block grant has not been appropriated since its inception .

instead , the appropriators have continued to fund some of the pre - existing grant programs ( chiefly , the victims of child abuse , gang - free schools and communities grant , and juvenile mentoring programs grants ) either as separate line - items or with funding set aside from the title v incentive grants for local delinquency prevention .

table 1 also shows that appropriations for specific programs can vary from year to year and that some programs are specifically appropriated in one year but may not be specifically identified in other years , such as the community based violence prevention initiative and the national forum on youth violence prevention , which have received stand - alone appropriations some fiscal years and have been set aside from the title v incentive grants program in other years .

in addition , some programs receive funding from larger accounts ; for example , ojjdp's tribal youth program has received a set - aside appropriation from the title v grant program every year since fy1999 .
