l. 107-56 , 15 stat .

272 ( 2001 ) , ( 1 ) which became law on october26 , 2001 , includes as title iii , the "international money laundering abatement and financialanti - terrorism act of 2001. .

title iii derives from h.r .

3004 , ( 2 ) as passed by the house,and title iii of s. 1510 , as passed by the senate .

although each of the last severalcongresses has examined the adequacy of united states laws targeting money laundering , there wasinsufficient support for any legislation until the september 11 attacks focused attention on thefinancing of international terrorism and the role that financial institutions could play in identifyingand cutting off its source of funding .

this legislation , which has been deemed "the most significant anti - money - laundering legislation in more than 30 years," ( 3 ) is designed toprevent terrorists and others from using the u.s.financial system anonymously to move funds obtained from or destined for illegal activity .

it seeksto impose new requirements on banks , the institutions that have heretofore been the focus of theanti - money laundering record keeping and reporting requirements , and on other participants in thefinancial services industry - brokers and dealers , investment companies , and informal moneytransmitting networks .

although its main target is international money laundering and terrorists , itsreach is broader .

among the purposes of the legislation are: increasing the strength of u.s. measures to prevent , detect , and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism .

another aimis to provide a national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny foreign jurisdictions , financialinstitutions operating outside the united states , and classes of international transactions or types ofaccounts that pose particular opportunities for criminal abuse .

another significant purpose of thelegislation is to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject toappropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities .

the legislation contains over forty separate sections , each of which is summarized in this report .

some of them are technical in the sense that they address criminal and civil judicial or administrativeproceedings ; others enhance criminal penalties for various types of financial crimes .

among theprovisions that have garnered the most attention are those that affect financial institutions such assection 311' s grant of authority to the secretary of the treasury to impose special measures onfinancial institutions upon finding a jurisdiction , class of transactions , or institution to be of "primarymoney laundering concern" that could include opening or maintaining accounts .

in addition , thereare provisions that specifically address and specify increased due diligence for correspondentaccounts , payable - through accounts , and private banking accounts for non - u.s. persons as well asaccounts with off - shore or foreign shell banks .

there are requirements and standards for increasedcooperation by financial institutions in responding to government requests for information and newrequirements for regulations mandating standards for identifying persons opening accounts .

thelegislation also requires financial institutions to institute anti - money laundering programs and thesecretary of the treasury , within 3 months , to issue regulations setting minimum requirements .

since much of the legislation requires implementing regulations , the full impact will emerge over the course of time .

because many of its provisions impose requirements for studies and reports,congress has indicated that it is prepared to conduct fine tuning should the need arise .

this legislation builds on existing law , which includes substantive criminal statutes definingand prohibiting money laundering and statutes calling for a regulatory regime of record keeping andreporting on various financial transactions and prescribing civil and criminal penalties for violationsof that scheme and its regulations .

the major components of this array of anti - money launderinglaws are presented below .
