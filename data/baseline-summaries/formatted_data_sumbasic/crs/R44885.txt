the mission of the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) is to "enhance the health and well - being of americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound , sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine , public health , and social services. .

hhs is currently organized into 11 main agencies , called "operating divisions," which are responsible for a wide variety of health and human services and related research ( see a list of these agencies in the g lossary below ) .

in addition , hhs has a number of "staff divisions" within the office of the secretary ( os ) .

these staff divisions fulfill a broad array of management , research , oversight , and emergency preparedness functions in support of the entire department .

eight of the hhs operating divisions are part of the u.s. public health service ( phs ) .

phs agencies have diverse missions in support of public health , ranging from the provision of health care services and supports ( eg , ihs , hrsa , samhsa ) , to the advancement of health care quality and medical research ( eg , ahrq , nih ) , to the prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases and environmental health hazards ( eg , cdc , atsdr ) , and the regulation of food and drugs ( eg , fda ) .

the three remaining hhs operating divisions are not phs agencies: acf , acl , and cms .

acf and acl largely administer human services programs focused on the well - being of vulnerable children , families , older americans , and individuals with disabilities .

cms — which accounts for the largest share of the hhs budget by far — is responsible for administering the medicare and medicaid programs , and some aspects of the private health insurance market .

the hhs budget request for fy2018 was affected by two notable circumstances .

the first was a presidential transition , from the administration of president barack h. obama to the administration of president donald j. trump , occurring in late january 2017 .

as a result of this transition , the full fy2018 budget submission was delayed until may 22 , 2017 .

the second notable circumstance affecting the fy2018 hhs budget request is that final fy2017 appropriations ( p.l .

115-31 ) were not enacted until may 5 , 2017 , about two weeks before the fy2018 budget was submitted .

consequently , final appropriations levels for fy2017 were largely unknown during the formulation of the fy2018 budget proposal , and the hhs budget does not include a display of fy2017-enacted levels .

the hhs budget instead displays fy2017 estimates derived from two sources: for discretionary spending programs , the hhs budget displays annualized estimates of funding provided under the second fy2017 continuing resolution ( cr , p.l .

114-254 ) .

generally , this cr was a formulaic extension of fy2016 funding levels with an across - the - board adjustment and exceptions for particular accounts and activities .

for mandatory spend ing programs , the hhs budget displays estimates of the amounts expected to be needed for fy2017 based on criteria outlined in authorizing law .

 ( for related discussion , see " budgetary resources versus appropriations ." ) .

while the estimates of annualized spending under the fy2017 cr may have informed fy2018 budget negotiations within the administration , these estimates ( in particular ) should not be treated as fy2017 "final" or enacted levels for the purposes of comparison to prior years or the fy2018 proposal .

under the budget request , hhs would spend an estimated $1.131 trillion in outlays in fy2018 ( see table 1 ) .

this is $422 million ( +0.04% ) more than the fy2017 estimate ( based on the annualized cr and current services mandatory spending ) , and about $28 billion ( +2.55% ) more than fy2016 actual .

the office of management and budget ( omb ) estimates that hhs will account for more than a quarter of all federal outlays ( nearly 28% ) in fy2018 .

hhs has accounted for at least 20% of all federal outlays in each year since fy1995 .

figure 1 displays proposed fy2018 hhs outlays by major program or spending category in the president's request .

as this figure shows , mandatory spending typically accounts for the vast majority of the hhs budget .

in fact , two programs — medicare and medicaid — are expected to account for 88% of all estimated hhs spending in fy2018 .

medicare and medicaid are "entitlement" programs , meaning the federal government is required to make mandatory payments to individuals , states , or other entities based on criteria established in authorizing law .

this figure also shows that discretionary spending accounts for only about 7% of fy2018 hhs outlays in the president's request .

although discretionary spending represents a relatively small share of total hhs spending , the department nevertheless receives more discretionary money than most federal departments .

according to omb data , more than half of the president's request for discretionary budget authority in fy2018 would go to the department of defense ( 56% ) , with the second largest share going to the department of veterans affairs ( 7% ) .

hhs would receive the third largest share ( nearly 6% ) of all discretionary budget authority requested by the president , followed by the department of education ( 5% ) .

 table 3 displays budgetary totals for each hhs operating division .

these totals are inclusive of both mandatory and discretionary spending .

the fy2016 actual , fy2017 estimate ( based on the annualized cr and current services mandatory spending ) , and fy2018 request figures are taken from the hhs bib for fy2018 ; the fy2015 actual figures are taken from the fy2017 bib .

the remainder of this section provides a brief summary of the mission of each operating division , the fy2018 budget request , and links to additional resources related to that request .

 ( links are also provided to resources on amounts enacted for fy2017 in the consolidated appropriations act , 2017. ) .

a table of key policy staff is included at the end of the report .

the figures in this section are provided in terms of budget authority and outlays .

budget authority ( ba ) is the authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or other financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures involving federal government funds .

outlays occur when funds are actually expended from the treasury and could be the result of either new budget authority enacted in the current fiscal year or unexpended budget authority that was enacted in previous fiscal years .

as a consequence , the ba and outlays in this table represent two different ways of accounting for the funding that is provided to each hhs agency through the federal budget process .

the acf mission is focused on promoting the "economic and social well - being of children , youth , families , and communities. .

acf administers a wide array of human services programs , including temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , head start , child care , the social services block grant ( ssbg ) , and various child welfare programs .
