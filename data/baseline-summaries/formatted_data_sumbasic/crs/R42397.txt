since opening to the public on december 2 , 2008 , the capitol visitor center ( cvc ) has had more than six million visitors .

located beneath the east front plaza , the cvc was designed to enhance the security , educational experience , and comfort of visitors to the u.s. capitol .

the decision to build a subterranean facility largely invisible from an exterior perspective was made so the structure would not compete with , or detract from , the appearance and historical architectural integrity of the capitol .

the project's designers sought to integrate the new structure with the landscape of the capitol grounds and ultimately recreate the park - like setting intended by landscape architect frederick law olmsted sr. in his 1874 design for the site .

the cost of the center was an estimated $621 million .

the footprint of the center covers approximately five acres ( 196,000 square feet ) and is larger than that of the capitol ( 175,000 square feet ) .

the square footage of the three levels of the center ( 580,000 square feet ) is nearly two - thirds that of the capitol itself ( 780,000 square feet ) .

a number of factors delayed the project's completion date and increased its cost .

unusually wet weather in 2003 , the discovery of asbestos in the part of the capitol connected to the center , and an undocumented century - old well under the construction site were unanticipated .

added expenses were incurred because of higher - than - expected bids ; several design changes ; security upgrades following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ; necessary changes to the air filtration system ; house and senate expansion space costs ; and extra costs associated with working around the capitol , such as security screening for the thousands of construction workers and vehicles that entered the construction site .

this report addresses the rationale and planning for the cvc , an overview of construction and funding , and subsequent legislation related to its operations and design .

the idea for a center dates at least to the mid - 1970s , when the architect of the capitol issued toward a master plan for the united states capitol .

by the turn of the 21 st century , the capitol faced the challenge of welcoming as many as 3.5 million visitors per year while simultaneously serving congress and its staff as a working office building .

although the idea for a cvc had existed for more than three decades , it did not gain momentum until after a gunman with a history of mental illness killed two u.s. capitol police officers stationed near a public entrance to the capitol in july 1998 .

the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks at the pentagon and in new york , and the subsequent discovery of anthrax in congressional office buildings , also highlighted concerns regarding the potential vulnerabilities of the capitol and the need for improved security on capitol hill .

at a hearing on security updates one year after september 11 , 2001 , architect of the capitol alan m. hantman ( hereinafter architect hantman ) testified that the center was designed to provide a secure environment for managing a large number of visitors while protecting the capitol building , its occupants , and guests .

improvements to the screening of delivery vehicles and additional safety benefits of the center were also cited at subsequent house and senate hearings .

in addition to serving as the security screening entry for visitors to the capitol , the center was designed to provide improved accessibility for disabled persons and enhanced visitor services and educational exhibits .

today , these include historic documents from the library of congress and the national archives chronicling legislative achievements as well as house and senate orientation theaters presenting brief films about the two chambers .

the cvc also houses 24 statues from the national statuary hall collection as well as other works of art .

in 1991 , the architect of the capitol ( aoc ) was authorized to use funds to develop a design concept .

in 1993 , the united states capitol preservation commission , an 18-member bipartisan , bicameral , board of congressional leaders , allocated $2.6 million to translate the concept into a formal design , which was prepared by rtkl associates inc .

in november 1995 , the architect published a report reflecting rtkl's work .

the 1995 report emphasized that the center had three main goals: ( 1 ) enhance the visitor experience by providing a structure , located under the east front plaza of the capitol , which would afford improved visitor orientation and facilities , including full accommodation for persons with disabilities , other related programs , and support services ; ( 2 ) strengthen capitol security while ensuring the preservation of an atmosphere of public access ; and ( 3 ) integrate the design concepts of the center with aesthetically and functionally appropriate improvements to the east front plaza .

multiple attempts to authorize construction preceded the appropriations eventually provided in 1998 .

for example , during the 104 th congress , bills were introduced in both the house ( h.r .

1230 ) and senate ( s. 954 ) which would have authorized a capitol visitor center , with one house hearing held on june 22 , 1995 .

in the 105 th congress , bills were again introduced ( h.r .

20 , h.r .

4347 , and s. 1508 ) , with one house hearing held on may 22 , 1997 .

during the fy2000 house and senate legislative branch appropriations hearings , concern was raised about the architect's projected construction schedule .

on march 3 , 1999 , another cvc bill ( h.r .

962 ) was introduced , but no further action was taken .

in march 1999 , the architect received approval to use $2.8 million to review and revalidate the 1995 design study , briefing the united states capitol preservation commission on its findings on october 15 , 1999 .

the 1999 revalidation study reiterated the four fundamental goals for the cvc , including ( 1 ) security , ( 2 ) visitor education , ( 3 ) visitor comfort , and ( 4 ) functional improvements , including "modern , efficient facilities for such functions as truck loading and deliveries , constituent assembly rooms , and improved connection to the senate and house office buildings. .

in november 1999 , the united states capitol preservation commission approved a revised conceptual design , and a design and engineering obligation plan was approved by the house and senate legislative appropriations subcommittees in november 1999 and january 2000 , respectively .

on january 31 , 2000 , design development work was begun , and in mid - october 2000 , the united states capitol preservation commission approved the final design plan .

gao also began to serve as a permanent consultant for the project and made frequent reports to congress on the construction schedule and project costs .

on june 20 , 2000 , members of the commission gathered on the east front plaza of the capitol for a symbolic groundbreaking ceremony .

below is an overview of some of the issues discussed at hearings of the house and senate appropriations committees , the house administration committee , and house transportation and infrastructure during construction of the cvc .

a september 25 , 2007 , hearing of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on economic development , public buildings , and emergency management held a hearing on examined h.r .

3315 , which proposed to name the "great hall" of the cvc "emancipation hall. .

the committee filed a report on november 8 , 2007 ( h.rept .

president george w. bush signed the bill into law ( p.l .

as the opening of the cvc neared , congress considered legislation related to its administration , management , oversight , and use .

on january 29 , 2008 , representative robert brady introduced the capitol visitor center act of 2008 .

provisions in the bill addressed the establishment the office of the capitol visitor center within the office of the architect of the capitol , headed by the chief executive officer for visitor services ; transferred the guide service to this office ; established the office of congressional accessibility services ; and established a revolving fund .
