in a nationwide address on september 7 , 2003 , the president announced that he would requestan additional $87 billion for reconstruction assistance to iraq and afghanistan and for ongoingmilitary operations there and elsewhere .

 ( 1 ) onseptember 17 , the white house submitted a formalrequest for the funds to congress .

on september 21 , the defense department provided backupmaterial to congressional committees .

 ( 2 ) onseptember 23 , the coalition provisional authority thatis administering iraq provided information on the details of its request for reconstruction aid .

congressional consideration of the request was completed on november 3 , when the senate approved a conference agreement on h.r .

3289 providing supplemental appropriationsof $87.5 billion for fy2004 .

earlier , congressional committees held a number of hearings on issuesraised by the administration request .

readers in congressional offices may click on the highlightedhearings listed below ( in the .html version of this report ) to link to hearing transcripts .

during congressional debate , a wide range of legislative proposals addressing costs , burdensharing , and other issues were considered , including measures to require the administration to provide reports on iraq policy , giving details of plans to establish security and restore basic services ; roll back reductions in the top income tax rate from 2005 through 2010 enoughto offset costs ; encourage greater allied contributions of troops and reconstruction aid ; transfer control of iraq reconstruction from the defense department to the statedepartment ; and require fair and open competition on contracts in iraq .

the major issue in congress was whether to provide iraq reconstruction funds as grants , as the administration proposed , or as loans .

the following discussion ( 1 ) briefly reviews the basic elements of the request ; ( 2 ) discusses the debate about long - term costs ; ( 3 ) discusses congressional action on key legislative proposals ; ( 4 ) provides an overview of funding for ongoing military operations in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere ; and ( 5 ) provides an overview of funding for reconstruction and security in iraq , for reconstructionin afghanistan , and for other foreign policy initiatives .

of the $87 billion that the administration requested , $65.6 billion was for defense , and $21.4billion for foreign policy programs .

of the $65.6 billion for defense , $51.5 billion was for ongoingmilitary operations in iraq , $10.5 billion for u.s. forces in afghanistan , and the remaining $3.6billion for homeland defense and support to allies .

 ( 3 ) of the $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs,$20.3 billion was for security and reconstruction in iraq , about $800 million for afghanistan , andabout $200 million for other global war on terrorism foreign policy initiatives .

table 1 providesan overview of the request .

table 1 .

basic elements of the administration request for additional funding for iraq , afghanistan , and other activities ( amounts inbillions of dollars ) sources: congressional briefing material provided by the office of management and budget,thedepartment of defense , the department of state , and the office of the coalition provisionalauthority , september 8 , 2003 ; office of management and budget , supplemental appropriationsrequest , september 17 , 2003 ; department of defense , fy2004 supplemental request , september21 , 2003 .

note: a .

includes $61 million for u.s. diplomatic facilities and security and $50 million for multinationaldivision peacekeeping costs .

administration officials said that the request was designed to cover only pressing requirements through the next year to fifteen months - - the defense money through fy2004 , which ends onseptember 30 , 2004 , and the iraq reconstruction money through december 2004 .

the request formilitary operations assumed that current troop levels and the current pace of operations in iraq,afghanistan , and elsewhere would continue unchanged through the fiscal year .

the request did notaddress ongoing military costs after fy2004 .

presumably , if the number of troops deployed in iraqwere to change , costs would change as well .

the $20 billion requested for reconstruction and security in iraq finances only a part of what administration officials estimate will be needed in the long run .

current estimates , from a varietyof sources , including the u.s. government , put the figure in the $50-75 billion range .

a needsassessment released by the world bank and the u.n. development program ( undp ) puts the costof reconstruction in 14 key sectors at $36 billion over four years , not including $19.4 billionestimated by the u.s. - led coalition provisional authority ( cpa ) for security , oil , and other criticalsectors not covered by the bank assessments .

 ( 4 ) totalbank / cpa projected reconstruction coststhrough 2007 amount to $55 billion , $17.5 billion in 2004 alone .

the white house says that theiraqi oil revenues and "recovered assets," along with additional international support , are expectedto contribute to meet remaining needs .

officials have also said , however , that iraqi oil revenues areexpected to total about $12 billion in the next year , and that government operations will cost aboutas much , ( 5 ) leaving no iraq oil money forreconstruction efforts in the near term .

the request for $87 billion for defense and reconstruction assistance comes on top of more than$110 billion provided for those purposes since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

congresshas provided $100 billion in defense funding , over and above regular defense appropriations , formilitary operations in afghanistan , for other global counter - terrorism military and intelligenceoperations , for homeland defense , and , most recently - - in last april's emergency wartimesupplemental appropriations bill - - for the war in iraq .

table 2 provides a summary of defensefunding by appropriations bill .

defense funding for iraq , afghanistan , and other global war on terrorism activities: fy2001-fy2003 ( amounts in billionsof dollars ) *notes: total may not add due to rounding .

the fy2004 defense appropriations act rescinded$3.5 billion of funds provided in the fy2003 emergency wartime supplemental .

since september 11 , congress has appropriated about $12 billion for iraqi and afghan reconstruction and for foreign aid to the "front - line" states in the global war on terrorism .

of that,congress has provided $1.4 billion in reconstruction assistance to afghanistan , with another $600million pending in regular fy2004 appropriations bills .

for iraq , the april fy2003 emergencywartime supplemental provided $2.5 billion in foreign operations funding for relief andreconstruction .

additional funding for iraq reconstruction totals $1.6 billion , of which $1.1 billionis from department of defense funds ( part of the $62.6 billion shown above in table 2 from thefy2003 emergency wartime supplemental ) , and the remainder from the regular u.s. agency forinternational development ( usaid ) budget ( see below for a further discussion ) .

a large part of the debate in congress about the administration's $87 billion request focused on cost issues , including the impact of the new funding on the overall federal budget ; whether the administration was adequately forthcoming in its previousstatements about costs ; how accurate and complete the current cost projections are ; and how great costs will be in future years .

the following sections review each of these issues in turn .

a number of issues were a focus of legislative attention , including both issues directly relatedto the supplemental request and some not directly related .

legislative measures that were proposedor acted on include proposals to assert congressional oversight ; measures on taxes and domestic priorities ; proposals to provide additional funding for variousprograms ; a measure to provide health insurance for militaryreservists ; competitive contracting and limitations on profits of corporations withcontracts in iraq ; and proposals to provide loans rather than grants for iraq reconstruction .

the senate appropriationscommittee provided the full funding requested for defense , though it added funds for armyoperation and maintenance and weapons procurement and made offsetting reductions in air force,navy , and defense - wide operation and maintenance .

the house appropriations committee cutabout $289 million from the defense total .

several aspects of the request are worth noting , including basis of the cost projections , funding flexibility , authority to train and equip foreign military forces , and military personnel benefits .

the administration sought a total of $21.44 billion in its fy2004 supplementalfor reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan and for other foreign policyprograms related to the global war on terrorism .

as shown in table 4 $20.4 billionwould be allocated for iraq .

to put the amount of resources in some perspective,congress appropriated about $9.6 billion in fy2003 for similar activities , includingiraq reconstruction and aid to the "front - line" states in the global war on terrorism,and has been considering funding requests totaling roughly $4.9 billion in thepending fy2004 foreign operations appropriation bill ( h.r .

2800 / s. 1426 ) .

c. the administration proposed to use funds previously appropriated for baghdadfacilities in p.l .

108-11 for urgent usaid needs in afghanistan and requestedin this supplemental additional resources for iraq facilities to replace thosediverted to afghanistan .

the senate bill appropriated funds for usaid inafghanistan separately , thereby making funds provided in p.l .

108-11 availablefor u.s. diplomatic facilities in baghdad , without the need for newappropriations in this supplemental .

the senate bill and the conference agreementprovided $40 million for usaid operating expenses in afghanistan only .

g. instead of funding the emergency account , the house bill provided $100 millionin disaster and famine relief aid for liberia and sudan , below .

the senate billprovided $200 million in the emergency crises fund account , but designatedall of it for liberia and required that $100 million be drawn by transfer from anyother account in the bill .

the conference agreement provided $210 million forliberia and sudan , funds drawn from the iraq relief and reconstructionaccount and from a new account for international disaster and famineassistance , as shown below .

h. under the account for diplomatic and consular services ( d&cs ) , theadministration proposed $11 million for additional security operations inafghanistan and $29.5 million to cover a projected shortfall in machinereadable visa ( mrv ) fees that had been expected to fund border securityinitiatives .

the senate bill provided $35.8 million as a rescission andreappropriation for security operations in afghanistan and iraq , and addedfunding under the separate account of emergencies in the diplomatic andconsular services to cover the mrv shortfall .

the administration requestedfunds under this latter account only for rewards related to osama bin laden andsaddam hussein .

the house bill provided $156.3 million in the d&csaccount , of which $109.5 million was for mrv fees and consular services , $11million for security measures in afghanistan , and $35.8 million for a diplomaticmission in iraq .
