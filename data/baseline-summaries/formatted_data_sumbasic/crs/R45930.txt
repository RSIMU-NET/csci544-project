many members of congress have demonstrated an interest in the mandates , effectiveness , and funding status of u.n. peacekeeping operations in africa as an integral component of u.s. policy toward africa and a key tool for fostering greater stability and security on the continent .

as a permanent member of the u.n. security council ( the council ) with veto power , the united states plays a key role in establishing , renewing , and funding individual operations , including those in africa .

the united states is the largest financial contributor to u.n. peacekeeping .

this report provides an overview of active u.n. peacekeeping operations in africa , including their mandates , budget and funding mechanisms , key challenges , and u.s. policy toward each mission .

it does not address broader u.n. peacekeeping issues or missions elsewhere , non - u.n. peacekeeping and stabilization efforts in africa , or the activities of the u.n. support office in somalia ( unsos ) , which is a u.n. - authorized logistics mission that supports the african union ( au ) mission in somalia ( amisom ) .

as of august 2019 , the united nations conducts 14 peacekeeping operations worldwide comprising more than 100,000 military , police , and civilian personnel .

of these operations , seven are in africa ( figure 1 ) : the u.n. multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic ( minusca ) , established by the council in 2014 ; the u.n. multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali ( minusma ) , established in 2013 ; the u.n. interim security force for abyei ( unisfa ) , established in 2011 ; the u.n. mission in south sudan ( unmiss ) , established in 2011 ; the u.n. organization stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo ( drc , monusco ) , established in 2010 to succeed the u.n. organization mission in the drc ( monuc ) ; the u.n. - african union mission in darfur ( unamid ) , established in 2007 ; and the u.n. mission for the organization of a referendum in the western sahara ( minurso ) , established in 1991 .

these include the world's four largest u.n. peacekeeping operations by actively deployed uniformed personnel : monusco , unmiss , minusma , and minusca .

the africa operations illustrate how u.n. peacekeeping has significantly evolved since the first mission was established in the middle east in 1948 .

u.n. peacekeeping once involved implementing cease - fire or peace agreements ( as is the case for minurso , the oldest of the current africa operations ) .

since the 1990s , however , the u.n. security council has increasingly authorized operations in complex and insecure environments where there may be no peace to keep and little prospect of a near - term resolution .

peacekeepers , particularly those operating in african missions , are increasingly asked to protect civilians , help extend state authority , disarm rebel groups , work with humanitarian actors , assist in restoring the rule of law , and monitor human rights , often in the absence of a comprehensive or effective cease - fire or peace settlement .

u.s. support for expanding or maintaining individual u.n. peacekeeping operations in africaâor for approving new operations in response to emerging conflicts on the continentâhas fluctuated over time .

during the obama administration , the united states backed new operations in the central african republic ( car ) and maliâboth times at the urging of france , an ally and fellow permanent member of the u.n. security councilâwhile overseeing the closure of long - standing operations in liberia and cã´te d'ivoire as those countries stabilized in the aftermath of internal conflicts .

u.n. security council members have not formally proposed new u.n. - conducted operations in africa during the trump administration to date , although some have voiced support for authorizing u.n. assessed contributions and / or logistical support for an ongoing african - led operation in the sahel region ( see "african - led operations" below ) .

despite shifts in policy and on the ground , several overarching policy issues and debates continue to arise regarding u.n. peacekeeping in africa .

these fall into several categories discussed below .

civilian p rotection m andate fulfillment .

policymakers have debated what changes , if any , can or should be made to enable u.n. peacekeeping operations in africa to fulfill mandates to protect civilians .

this issue has been particularly salient with regard to monusco ( in drc ) and minusca ( in car ) .

both missions' mandates place a high emphasis on civilian protection amid ongoing conflicts and severe logistics and personnel protection challenges .

armed groups have repeatedly massacred civilians at close proximity to u.n. operating sites .

restrictions ( or "caveats" ) imposed by troop - contributing countries on their forces' deployments , often attributable to force protection concerns , may imp ede civilian protection efforts in some cases .

mass atrocities .

some experts and observers have debated whether u.n. peacekeeping operations are an effective tool for preventing or addressing mass atrocities .

u.s. support for minusca's creation was nested within a high - level effort to prevent further mass atrocities in car ; fulfilling this goal has proven challenging .

in mali , militias have engaged in a spate of civilian massacres in the center of the country , a region that was largely outside the purview of minusma until the 2019 mandate renewal ( as discussed below ) .

role of host governments .

a key challenge is how and to what extent u.n. peacekeeping operations should pursue positive working relationships with host governments whose interests may not align with international stabilization efforts .

in practice , peacekeeping personnel may require approvals from host governments to acquire entry visas or access certain parts of the country , for example .

pursuit of positive relations may , however , undermine perceptions of u.n. neutrality or trustworthiness in the context of an active conflict and / or state abuses .

u.n. operations in car , drc , and mali , among others , are mandated to support the extension of state authority , although state security forces are a party to internal conflicts .

these same u.n. missions are also tasked with facilitating peace talks between the government and rebel groups .

operations in sudan and south sudan have faced obstructions and threats from government officials and security forces , and the role of state security forces in attacks on civilians complicates the missions' civilian protection and reporting mandates .

counter t errorism .

some policymakers have questioned what role , if any , u.n. peacekeeping operations should play in addressing transnational terrorism in africa .

this debate has repeatedly arisen in the context of mali , and may become relevant in other places ( such as drc , where the islamic state has claimed ties to a local militia group ) .

despite calls from the malian government and other regional leaders , the security council has declined to mandate minusma explicitly to conduct counterterrorism operations , notwithstanding the mission's civilian protection and stabilization mandates .

sexual exploitation and abuse by u.n. peacekeepers .

members of congress have demonstrated an ongoing interest in how the united nations might better address sexual abuse and exploitation by u.n. peacekeepersâparticularly in monusco and minusca , which have the highest rates of substantiated allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation .

congress has enacted several provisions to address the issue .

for example , sfops bills since fy2008 have prohibited the obligation of u.n. peacekeeping funding unless the secretary of state certifies that the united nations is implementing effective policies and procedures to prevent u.n. employees and peacekeeping troops from engaging in human trafficking , other acts of exploitation , or other human rights violations .

african troop - contributing countries ( tccs ) .

experts and policymakers have debated the advantages and drawbacks of relying on african countries to contribute the bulk of military and police personnel to u.n. peacekeeping operations in africa .

african troop contributors may be willing , but they often display capacity shortfalls and / or poor adherence to human rights standards .

for example , in car , in a single year ( 2016 ) , peacekeepers from the republic of congo and drcâamong othersâwere implicated in the abuse of minors , while burundi's police contingent was repatriated due to abuses by its police services at home .

in mali , which has been the deadliest environment for u.n. peacekeepers since minusma's establishment , top troop contributors include burkina faso , chad , senegal , and togoâwhich are among the world's poorest countries .

moreover , troop contributors that border the host country may have bilateral political interests that complicate their participation in peacekeeping operations .

some countries may also wield their contributions to such missions to deflect international criticism of their domestic political conditions .

african - led operations .

how and whether to fund and sustain african - led regional stabilization operations in lieu of , or as a complement to , u.n. peacekeeping operations has been debated in u.n. fora , in africa , and among u.s. policymakers .

stabilization operations initiated by the african union ( au ) or sub - regional organizations are often superseded by u.n. peacekeeping missions .

while african regional organizations can authorize rapid military interventions , they are generally unable to finance or sustain them , and donor governments may be reluctant to fund them over long periods .

amisomâestablished in 2007 and mandated to take offensive action in support of somalia's federal government and against islamist insurgentsâhas remained the sole african - led military intervention to benefit from a u.n. support operation funded through assessed contributions .

at times , u.n. and au officials , france ( a permanent security council member ) , and african heads of state have proposed a similar mechanism for other regional missions ( notably in the sahel ) , but successive u.s .

administrations have declined to support such proposals , preferring to provide funding on a voluntary and bilateral basis .

in recent years , the au has sought the use of u.n. assessed contributions to help fund its operations directly ( see text box ) .

the following sections provide background on each active u.n. peacekeeping operation in africa , including u.s. policy and key issues .

operations are presented in reverse chronological order of their establishment by the u.n. security council ( starting with most recently authorized ) .

members of congress have examined u.n. peacekeeping operations as a core element of u.s. - africa policy , and in the context of overarching appropriations and oversight activities .

congressional deliberations on fy2020 sfops appropriationsâin the context of the administration's proposal to cut u.s. funding for u.n. peacekeeping overall , and for the africa missions in particularâhave coincided with u.n. security council consideration of potentially significant changes to the mandates of several missions , including in mali , darfur ( sudan ) , and drc , due to evolving conditions on the ground .

the senate appropriations committee report on the fy2020 department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations bill ( released on september 18 , 2019 ) , leads with the observation that: weak governance and conflict in africa , the middle east , and central and south america are causing historically unprecedented population movements as refugees and internally displaced persons [idps] seek safer lives .

[â¦] the humanitarian requirements of the united nations [un] and other entities to address this global emergency have consistently exceeded the willingness and generosity of donors to respond .

as congress continues to shape the u.s. approach toward peacekeeping missions' mandates and budgets , it may consider issues such as: how and whether u.n. peacekeeping operations in africa align with u.s. foreign policy priorities in the region and in individual countries ; the impact that decisions on u.s. funding for peacekeeping may have on these countries , and the relative cost of other potential u.s. responses ; and the role of other donors and actors in responding to security crises in africa .
