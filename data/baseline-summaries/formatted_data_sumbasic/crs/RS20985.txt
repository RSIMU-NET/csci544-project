rs20985 - - stewardship contracting for federal forests updated april 10 , 200 .

procurement contracts are used by federal agencies to perform a wide variety of tasks , and could be used for many forest stewardshipservices .

typically , a contract proposal identifies the tasks to be performed: the unmerchantable trees or underbrushto be cut and thetreatment of the cut ( and possibly additional ) materials - - left as is , piled and burned , lopped and scattered toaccelerate rotting or forprescribed burning , or even removed from the site .

it is also possible , though not commonly used , to specify thedesired resultingcondition of the area to be treated , rather than specifying the tasks to be performed .

currently , federal agenciesaward contracts to thelowest bidder ; however , congress could specify other factors to consider - - for example , local employment orquality of a bidder'spast performance - - in directing or further authorizing procurement contracting for stewardship services .

in addition , some have suggested that any commercially valuable material could be collected under a procurement contract and soldseparately , at least by the forest service .

 ( 4 ) thisapproach , commonly known as log sales , is common in europe and has beendiscussed sporadically for the national forests for at least 40 years .

the authorization for forest service timber salesalso permits logsales , but the agency has not used this authority extensively .

advantages of traditional procurement contracting .

the principal advantage ofusing current contracting methods for forest stewardship is that it is the system the federal agencies currently usefor procuring mostservices .

it is a simple , straightforward approach , well - known to agency personnel and to the potential privatecontractors , andnumerous private contractors exist to bid on such contract proposals .

another advantage of using the current contracting system is the opportunity for congressional control and oversight .

annual budgetjustifications for forest stewardship , under the current structure or a new structure designed to enhance oversightof federal foreststewardship , could give congress a way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of agency efforts , while theappropriations for suchefforts could be targeted to areas of greatest need .

limitations of traditional service contracting .

one major limitation of usingtraditional service procurement contracting for federal forest stewardship is the potentially enormous federalexpenditures on such aprogram .

the forest service has identified 36 million federal acres of frequent - fire forest ecosystems , and 39million federal acres ofother forest ecosystems , as having a high risk of significant ecological damage from catastrophic wildfires due toaccumulations ofexcess biomass .

 ( 5 ) with treatment costs averagingabout $300 per acre ( ranging from $100 to $1,000 ) , ( 6 ) treating these 75 millionacres could cost more than $20 billion - - possibly less but also possibly substantially more .

if the lands at moderaterisk of ecologicaldamage from catastrophic wildfires - - another 90 million federal acres of frequent - fire forest ecosystems and 66million federal acresof other forest ecosystems - - are also to be treated , the total cost for all 231 million federal acres could be around$70 billion .

suggested modifications to traditional service procurement contracting for forest stewardship could also hamper efforts at improvingfederal forest health .

using resulting desired conditions ( instead of tasks to be performed ) would probably bestimprove foreststewardship , because it would focus on what's left on the site , rather than on the activities performed or on thebiomass ( wood ) removed from the site .

however , no standardized measures of desired forest conditions for contracting ( or forreporting on agencystewardship efforts ) have been developed , making this approach difficult to implement .

in addition , proponentsadvocate separate logsales for any commercially valuable wood to be removed .

however , log values often depend on how the log is cut ( log lengths andlocations of major knots ) ; the independence of the service contractors from the potential log purchasers would bedifficult to assure,but important to avoid possible conflicts - of - interest ; and the agency has little experience with log sales .

thus,traditional serviceprocurement contracting has limitations for improving federal forest health .

most observers believe that , to improve forest health , it is necessary to combine various activities ( e.g .

 , salvage sales withmixed - species planting , or prescribed burning after precommercial thinning ) .

 ( 7 ) because of this need and the high cost of manyactivities , some have proposed a different approach to contracting for forest stewardship: trading goods ( commercially valuabletimber ) for services ( other activities in the same area ) .

called land management service contracts , stewardshipcontracts , end - resultscontracts , and other terms , these goods - for - services contracts are essentially highly modified timber sales , wheretimber purchasers arerequired to perform other , typically related , services ( e.g .

 , precommercial thinning or watershedrestoration ) , and in return pay less forthe timber harvested .

various federal laws prohibit federal agencies from retaining and using the receipts from selling assets ( e.g .

 , from timber sales ) without congressional authorization .

a few pilot tests of goods - for - services contracts were authorized in thefy1992 and fy1993interior appropriations acts ( p.l .

102-154 and p.l .

102-381 , respectively ) .

in 1998 , congress established a broader test of goods - for - services contracting .

section 347 of the fy1999 interior appropriationsact ( p.l .

105-277 ) authorized 28 "stewardship end result contracting demonstration projects" with substantialdirection on thelocations and procedures to be followed .

another 28 projects were authorized in the fy2001 interiorappropriations act ( p.l.106-291 ) , and 28 more in the fy2002 interior appropriations act ( p.l .

107-63 ) .

goods - for - services stewardship contracting was considered in the 2002 farm bill .

the house - passed version of h.r .

2646 would have authorized goods - for - services contracting for the forest service through fy2007 , without limitson numbers of suchcontracts ( although limited by appropriations ) , but otherwise consistent with �347 of the fy1999 interiorappropriations act .

thesenate - passed version would have authorized 28 contracts consistent with �347 ( through fy2006 ) , but would haverequired that 14 ofthose contracts be traditional service contracts with separate log sales , and would have required reports comparingthe twoapproaches .

the differences could not be resolved , and the final bill ( p.l .

107-171 ) included no provision ongoods - for - servicescontracting .

following the severe 2002 fire season , president bush proposed goods - for - services stewardship contracting as a way to reduce forestfuels in his healthy forests initiative .

 ( 8 ) the senatedebated stewardship contracting as part of wildfire management funding in thefy2003 interior appropriations act ( h.r .

5093 ) .

the protracted debate over this and other provisions toenact much ofthe healthy forests initiative eventually forestalled action on the bill , and interior appropriations were containedin continuingresolutions without such provisions .

finally , interior appropriations for fy2003 were enacted as division f of p.l.108-7 , theconsolidated appropriations resolution .

section 323 amended �347 of the fy1999 interior appropriations actin several ways: it authorized "stewardship end result contracting" through fy2013 ; it extended the program to blm lands as well as to the national forests ; it deleted "demonstration" from the provision ; it modified one of the identified goals to remove "noncommercial" from cutting or other objectives ; and it authorized the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to select a contracting officer withoutconstraints .

 ( 9 ) the goods - for - services demonstration projects , and the general expectations of the approach , have been modified timber sales toallow the agencies to impose non - timber harvesting requirements on the purchasers .

however , no provision in thestatute directlyspecifies commercial timber sales and harvesting .

rather , the statute authorizes removing vegetation and applyingthe value oftimber or other forest products removed to offset the cost of services received .

it is not clear whether stewardshipcontracts could beused in areas where commercial timber harvesting is prohibited by statute or administrative decision .

advantages of goods - for - services contracting .

one possible advantage ofgoods - for - services contracting is greater efficiency , and thus lower cost , in forest stewardship activities .

the desiredservices mayrequire some of the same equipment as timber harvesting and removal , and the same personnel might be used forboth tasks .

relyingon the same equipment and personnel for multiple tasks on a site seems likely to reduce the total cost of performingthe tasks .

thus,one contractor and one contract for multiple , related tasks that encompass both sale of goods and performance ofservices might bemore efficient than multiple , independent , traditional contracts for the tasks .

some proponents also claim that goods - for - services contracting is beneficial because it is off - budget financing for forest stewardship .

concerns over the adequacy of appropriations for forest stewardship have led some to search for alternative fundingmechanisms , andgoods - for - services contracting is one approach that has been proposed .

essentially , the federal agencies would beable to buystewardship services with timber assets , as part of modified timber sale contracts , instead of with appropriations .

limitations of goods - for - services contracting .

one limitation of using goods - for - services contracts to improve forest stewardship may be higher contracting costs from combining severalactivities in onecontract .

one observer noted that the forest service procedures for the pilot tests of goods - for - services contractingwere acomplicated combination of traditional service contracting with standard timber sale contracting: "the result is anextremelycumbersome process which requires more up - front effort than if the activities were done separately" ( 10 ) - - and thus higher costs thanfor two separate contracts .

this critic also suggested that a longer - term authorization and simpler contractingprocedures were neededto realize the benefits of goods - for - services contracting ; the provision as enacted at least provides the longer - termauthorization .

another possible limitation is that , in bypassing the annual appropriations process , goods - for - services contracting is likely to receiveless congressional oversight and control .

other congressionally authorized federal "off - budget" financingmechanisms ( technically,permanent appropriations of receipts for specific purposes ) , such as the forest service's knutson - vandenberg ( kv ) fund and brushdisposal funds , have received very little congressional oversight .

the agencies might be able to usegoods - for - services contracting formany years with little or no public participation in or congressional control over its use .

some interests have questioned the appropriateness of goods - for - services contracting generally .

observers have noted thatexchanging goods for services creates an incentive for managers to increase the sale of goods ( timber ) to generatevalue to provideservices ( e.g .

 , precommercial thinning ) .

in another context , the incentive to increase timber sales togenerate value to provide services - - mitigating and enhancing other resource values in timber sale areas under the kv fund - - has been described as"perverseincentives," where managers support an allegedly environmentally damaging activity ( timber harvests ) to generatefunds to be usedfor environmental restoration , including to mitigate damage caused by generating the funds .

 ( 11 ) exchanging timber for foreststewardship activities might create similar incentives , especially when the needed stewardship activities for wildfireprotectioninvolve cutting and removing non - commercial woody biomass on or near the ground ( since timber harvestingexacerbates the wildfirethreat in the short run by bringing combustible and quickly decaying material , such as tree limbs and tops , to groundlevel ) .

inaddition , dominant or exclusive use of goods - for - services contracts would emphasize stewardship on lands withcommercial timber,and might limit the opportunities for stewardship on other federal forests that need treatment .

finally , some observers have questioned whether a broad - scale , long - term program was appropriate .

two proponents have noted thatthe success of goods - for - services contracts has been difficult to evaluate .

 ( 12 ) others have concluded that the goods - for - services pilotprojects provide "an important experimental opportunity to test alternative contracting arrangements under 'realworld' conditions. .

 ( 13 ) however , although there were tests in the early 1990s and in several recent years , the effectiveness and efficiencyofgoods - for - services stewardship contracting has not been evaluated in an independent audit .
