on june 18 , 2008 , the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-246 , the2008 farm bill ) became law when the house and senate voted to override president bush's veto of h.r .

6124 .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) has begun the process of implementing the new law .

this report describes the farm commodity programs in the 2008 farm bill for the major crops such as wheat , corn , cotton , rice and soybeans .

it also discusses the important policy developments in the new law compared to prior law .

for more details on the legislative history of the farm bill and a side - by - side summary of its provisions and changes , see crs report rl34696 , the 2008 farm bill: major provisions and legislative action , by [author name scrubbed] et al .

the farm commodity price and income support provisions in the 2008 farm bill include three primary types of payments: direct payments unrelated to production or prices ; counter - cyclical payments which are triggered when ( a ) prices are below statutorily - determined target prices , or ( b ) revenue for a commodity falls below a historical guaranteed level , and marketing assistance loans that offer interim financing and , if prices fall below loan prices set in statute , additional income support , sometimes paid as loan deficiency payments ( ldp ) .

the first two types of payments are subject to payment limits on the size of payments .

all three types of payments may be subject to income eligibility limits , depending on the size of farm and non - farm income .

the 2008 farm bill generally continues the farm commodity price and income support framework of the 2002 farm bill , with modifications .

it continues the direct payment , counter - cyclical payment , and marketing loan programs for the 2008-2012 crop years , but adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities .

the law also creates a pilot revenue - based counter - cyclical program ( "acre" ) beginning with the 2009 crop year .

it revises payment limitations by tightening some limits and relaxing others .

the new law also has a pilot program for planting flexibility , new restrictions on base acres developed for residential use , and elimination of benefits to farms with fewer than 10 acres of program crops .

for the 2008 crop year , the programs are essentially unchanged from the 2002 farm bill .

figure 1 illustrates the three types of commodity payments in relation to market prices .

of the counter - cyclical payments , only traditional price - triggered counter - cyclical payments are included in the figure .

using corn as an example , if market prices are above $2.35 / bushel , neither counter - cyclical nor marketing loan benefits ( eg , ldp ) would apply .

if market prices are between $1.95 and $2.35 / bushel , a counter - cyclical payment would accrue , but no ldp would be available .

if market prices are below the loan rate of $1.95 / bushel , the maximum counter - cyclical payment of $0.40 / bushel is made , and an ldp would be available equal to the difference between the $1.95 loan rate and the market price .

regardless of market prices , however , the direct payment of $0.28 / bushel is paid .

an important consideration for the farm commodity programs is how they are classified for trade purposes .

as a member of the world trade organization ( wto ) , the united states made agricultural policy commitments under the wto's agreement on agriculture .

all wto members agree to submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the wto , and these outlays are subject to specific limits .

for the united states , its total spending limit for programs that are considered to be trade distorting is $19.1 billion per year .

other types of payments are not subject to limits if they are "decoupled" or not considered to be trade distorting .

because spending on the farm commodity programs is a combination of fixed decoupled payments and market - driven counter - cyclical payments , outlays may be highly variable from year to year .

figure 2 shows that , from 1981 to 2007 , commodity program outlays ( including dairy and sugar , but excluding disaster payments ) have ranged from a low of $3.3 billion in 1981 to a high of $27 billion in 2000 .

the average over the period was $11.1 billion per year .

from 1981-1990 , the average annual outlay was $11.4 billion ; from 1991-2002 , the average was $10.6 billion , and from 2003 to 2007 ( roughly the years of the 2002 farm bill ) , the average was $11.7 billion .

the cbo forecast for the 2008-2017 period is about $7.4 billion annually , well below the historical averages due to the record high commodity prices at the time that the 2008 farm bill was enacted .

compared to the baseline of continuing the provisions of the 2002 farm bill , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) cost estimate ( score ) of the new provisions in title i of the farm bill is a five - year savings of $1.726 billion and a 10-year savings of $1.658 billion .

if the scores of these changes are added to the 2007 baseline of budget outlays used to write the farm bill , then cbo's expected cost of title i is $41.628 billion for fy2008-2012 and $85.521 billion over 10 years ( table 3 ) .

this includes the program crop commodities , dairy , and sugar .

the 5- and 10-year savings that are scored for all of title i are the net result of various provisions that both score savings or cost more than prior law .

the largest savings is the result of a shift in the timing of direct payments .

making advance payments of a portion of direct payments is ended beginning with the 2012 crop year ( table 3 ) .

this shifts about $1.1 billion of payments into a later fiscal year , which achieves savings in the budget window but does not reduce the total amount eventually paid to farmers .

other savings are scored by reducing the proportion of base acres on which direct payments are paid , reducing direct payments and marketing loan rates for participants in the new acre revenue counter - cyclical program , replacing some counter - cyclical payments with acre payments , eliminating advance counter - cyclical payments beginning in crop year 2011 , and by tightening payment limits ( table 3 ) .

some of these savings are offset with costs of the new acre payments , economic assistance for cotton users , and higher target prices and loan rates for certain covered commodities , dairy , and sugar .

cbo combines the effect of some of these provisions into a single score ( eg , raising counter - cyclical target prices and eliminating traditional counter - cyclical payments for acre participants ) .

thus , a provision - by - provision score is not possible .
