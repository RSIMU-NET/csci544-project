intercity passenger rail in america dates to the rail industry's origins in the 19 th century .

as common carriers engaged in interstate commerce , railroad companies built hundreds of thousands of miles of track across the country offering both freight and passenger transportation , making the distinction between a freight railroad and a passenger railroad a relatively recent one .

federal regulation was important in the industry's development .

the hepburn act of 1906 ( 34 stat .

584 ) authorized the interstate commerce commissi on ( icc ) to regulate maximum interstate passenger fares to ensure that they were "just and reasonable. .

the transportation act of 1958 ( p.l .

85-625 , 72 stat .

571 ) gave the icc authority to allow a railroad to discontinue passenger service on a line while continuing freight service .

by the mid - 20 th century , passenger services faced increased competition from jet airliners offering faster travel times and private automobiles offering convenient access to a network of new federally funded highways .

the rail industry's worsening financial health meant that infrastructure conditions also worsened as maintenance was deferred , contributing to reduced speeds and reliability .

with ridership declining , the icc permitted railroads to discontinue many passenger services and focus on carrying freight .

in an effort to shore up flagging passenger rail service , congress passed the high speed ground transportation act of 1965 ( p.l .

89-221 ) , creating an office in the department of commerce to foster research and development of new transportation technologies ( the department of transportation did not yet exist ) .

this contributed to the establishment of the nation's fastest rail service , the metroliner , on the washington , dc , to new york city portion of the northeast corridor ( nec ) , when that line was still under private ownership .

in the years since , congress has taken an active role in preserving and improving passenger rail service .

although ridership is much lower than in the heyday of long - distance trains , the federal government continues to support passenger rail through a variety of grants , loans , and tax preferences .

there continues to be debate over whether federal subsidies for passenger rail are justified , given competing alternatives by air or highway that dominate most intercity travel markets ( though these alternatives may also receive subsidies ) .

the trump administration has called for "the end of the [federal] government subsidizing operating losses" on passenger trains , shifting decisionmaking and cost responsibility to states .

as several freight railroads , including the pennsylvania central , the nation's largest , entered bankruptcy in 1970 , congress created amtrakâofficially , the national railroad passenger corporationâto preserve a basic level of intercity passenger rail service , while relieving private railroad companies of the obligation to run passenger trains that had lost money for decades .

amtrak is structured as a private company , but virtually all of its shares are held by the u.s. department of transportation ( u.s .

dot ) .

amtrak owned no infrastructure at the time of its creation .

it was originally structured as a contracting agency , and amtrak trains were operated by private railroads over tracks they owned .

under the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act ( 4r act ) of 1976 , ownership of the nec was transferred from the bankrupt penn central railroad to amtrak .

at the same time , congress initiated the northeast corridor improvement program , which required travel times of 3 hours and 40 minutes between new york and boston , and of 2 hours and 40 minutes between new york and washington , by 1981 .

while the act funded many improvements along the corridor , these goals were not achieved .

the law that created amtrak also stipulated that amtrak pay host railroads for the incremental costs specific to amtrak's usage of tracksâfor instance , the additional track maintenance costs required for passenger trains .

amtrak is not required to contribute to a freight railroad's overhead costs .

then , in 1973 , congress granted amtrak "preference" over freight trains in using a rail line , junction , or crossing ( p.l .

93-146 , â§10 ( 2 ) , 87 stat .

548 ) , but amtrak has been unable to enforce this preference to ensure that host railroads operate its trains on schedule .

several railroads continued to operate long - distance passenger services after 1970 rather than contracting with amtrak .

the last of these services was discontinued in 1983 .

amtrak itself discontinued a number of the routes it originally operated , but has been required by congress to maintain a "national network" of long - distance trains .

amtrak has received federal funds to cover operating losses and capital expenditures since its creation .

most recent attempts to improve intercity passenger rail have involved making improvements to infrastructure and equipment on existing routes , rather than the planning and implementation of new routes .

however , the geography of existing lines can constrain efforts to increase speeds , and the freight railroads that control most of the lines amtrak uses have little incentive to allow higher speeds or more frequent passenger service without concessions in return , such as capital improvements that also serve to improve freight flows .

this section describes federally funded programs to improve amtrak's route network in order to extend the life of existing infrastructure , improve reliability , increase service frequency , and / or reduce scheduled trip times .

projects to retain or improve existing amtrak services , as described in the previous section , routinely require investments amounting to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars .

high - speed rail systems of the type in use in europe and asia , which can make only limited use of infrastructure designed for conventional rail , require significant investments in new infrastructure .

even when built for conventional rail equipment compatible with existing lines , establishing new rail service is a capital - intensive , time - consuming process .

for example , a federally funded study of rail options in new york state estimated that instituting 125-mph service from new york city to albany and buffalo would require $14.7 billion in capital funding .

a list of active or recently completed corridor plans and their cost estimate ranges can be found in appendix b .

many hsipr grants funded studies of new or improved passenger rail corridors .

a few of these studies were ultimately canceled before reaching completion , but others have resulted in near - finished plans to enhance intercity passenger rail .

these plans often feature capital cost projections in the billions of dollars , even for projects with comparatively conservative speed and frequency objectives .

the federal government's current approach to funding passenger rail differs from its approach to funding highways and transit .

although priia and the fast act set authorized spending levels over multi - year periods , amtrak funding is subject to the annual appropriations process , while many highway and transit programs are funded automatically out of highway trust fund balances .

likewise , the hsipr program lacked predictable funding in part because there was no dedicated revenue source for the program .

in the context of the federal appropriations process it is difficult to provide significant amounts of funding on a predictable basis to a grant program that depends on the treasury general fund , as it must compete with many other programs for funding each year .

this problem is exacerbated by the limits on overall discretionary spending that were imposed by the budget control act of 2011 .

supporters of passenger rail service have long called for a dedicated funding source for rail projects , and previous administrations have echoed such calls .

to date , however , congress has not taken such a step .

rail planning in the united states is not centralized , relying on project sponsors ( usually states ) to formulate their own plans .

congress and several presidents have , at times , identified corridors as investment priorities or set out trip time goals for certain routes , but these have usually not been backed by any financial commitment or implementation plan .

the lack of reliable funding for passenger rail capital projects and operations is one obstacle to rail planning , as some states may not wish to invest time and resources into a plan that may not be achievable without additional federal support .

priia contained a requirement for fra to develop a national rail plan ( nrp ) , which has not taken the form of a standalone document .

instead , fra has issued guidance for states to follow when drafting their own rail plans , as well as cost estimation and cost - benefit analysis guidance for project sponsors to follow when planning new or improved rail lines .

fra has also worked with groups of states to create regional rail plans , identifying service goals and rough cost estimates for passenger rail service between major cities .

a rail study in the southwest is complete , while rail studies in the midwest and southeast are ongoing .

regional rail plans are nonbinding and have no construction funding attached .

follow - on policies , including new dedicated funding for rail investment programs , were contained within u.s .

dot legislative proposals that were not enacted .

the short - lived experiment contracting with an equipment provider for the hoosier state and the failure of the long - distance competitive pilot program to generate any applications show that efforts to foster competition have not resulted in improvements to intercity passenger rail .

part of this may be attributed to the de facto monopoly status enjoyed by amtrak since its private sector competitors ended their passenger businesses .

amtrak has statutory privileges that currently would not extend to startup passenger rail operating companies hoping to compete over existing routes .

under current laws and regulations , a new entrant to passenger rail not wishing to negotiate with amtrak or freight railroads for track access must either have a prior affiliation with an existing freight railroad ( as with all aboard florida ) or must plan to construct its own tracks ( as with texas central ) .

congress could re - impose some obligation to accommodate passenger service on freight railroads .

the freight rail industry would likely be opposed to such a step .
