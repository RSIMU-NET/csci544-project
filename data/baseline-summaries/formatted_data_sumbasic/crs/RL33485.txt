on november 13 , 2007 , the president signed the fy2008 department of defense appropriations ( p.l .

110-116 ) into law , which included not less than $8 million for department of defense global hiv / aids activities .

on december 26 , 2007 , the president signed the fy2008 consolidated appropriations into law ( p.l .

110-161 ) , which includes the state / foreign operations and labor / hhs appropriations .

the act includes $6.3 billion for global hiv / aids , tuberculosis ( tb ) , and malaria initiatives , of which $5.8 billion is appropriated to international hiv / aids initiatives , including $840.3 million for u.s. contributions to the global fund to fight hiv / aids , tb , and malaria .

congress exceeded the president's fy2008 request for global hiv / aids , tb , and malaria programs by $570.1 million ( most of which was provided to the global fund ) and by $4.7 billion for pepfar's entire five - year term .

it is estimated that hiv / aids , tb , and malaria together kill more than 6 million people each year .

according to the joint united nations program on hiv / aids ( unaids ) , at the end of 2007 , an estimated 33.2 million people were living with hiv / aids , of whom 2.5 million were newly infected , and 2.1 million died in the course of that year .

more than two million of those living with hiv / aids at the end of 2007 were children and some 330,000 of those who died of aids that year were under 15 years old .

nearly 90% of all children infected with hiv reside in sub - saharan africa , which is home to 2.2 million of the estimated 2.5 million children living with hiv worldwide .

on each day of 2007 , some 1,000 children worldwide became newly infected with hiv , due in large part to little access to drugs that prevent the transmission of hiv from mother to child .

an estimated 9% of pregnant women in low - and middle - income countries were offered services to prevent hiv transmission to their newborns .

the world health organization ( who ) estimates that at the end of 2004 , more than 14 million people were infected with tb , of whom almost 9 million were newly infected .

more than 80% of those living with tb in 2004 were in southeast asia and sub - saharan africa , with the greatest per capita rate found in africa .

according to who , each year there are about 300 million acute malaria cases , which cause more than one million deaths annually ; in 2004 , the disease killed about 2 million people .

health experts believe that between 85% and 90% of malaria deaths occur in africa , mostly among children , killing an african child every 30 seconds .

appropriations for combating the global spread of hiv / aids have grown considerably since president bush entered office .

u.s. contributions to the global fund and the launching of two initiatives — the prevention of mother and child transmission initiative and the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) — have contributed to this growth .

in june 2005 , president bush launched the president's malaria initiative ( pmi ) , a plan to increase support for u.s. international malaria programs by more than $1.2 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 in 15 countries .

since launching pmi , the administration has requested that all support for bilateral malaria efforts be provided to the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) as the coordinating agency for the initiative .

when the administration shifted leadership for bilateral malaria programs to usaid in fy2005 , it determined that ogac would no longer include malaria spending in its annual reports to congress and that budgetary requests for the disease would be made separately from hiv / aids and tb requests .

for comparability , and because p.l .

108-25 considers efforts to combat malaria as a critical part of pepfar , table 1 includes appropriations to malaria programs .

in fy2006 and fy2007 , appropriators provided $102 million and $248 million for bilateral malaria efforts , respectively .

according to the pmi website , in fy2006 , $30 million of the $99 million that usaid spent on malaria programs was allocated to pmi , and an estimated $135 million was spent on the initiative in fy2007 .

the administration requested $387.5 million for malaria initiatives in fy2008 , of which $300 million would be for pmi ; congress appropriated $347.2 million to usaid and $36.0 million to cdc for international malaria efforts .

according to a december 2007 press release , through september 30 , 2007 , pepfar has supported the provision of anti - retroviral treatment for approximately 1.4 million people ; prevention of mother - to - child hiv transmission services for women during more than 10 million pregnancies and an estimated 152,000 infant infections ; care for nearly 6.7 million people , including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children ; and counseling and testing services for over 30 million people .

lines 1 and 2 refer to usaid's bilateral hiv / aids and tb programs in the non - focus countries , which are funded through a number of accounts , including the child survival and health account ( csh ) , economic support fund aid ( esf ) , assistance for the former soviet union under the freedom support act ( fsa ) , assistance for eastern europe and the baltics ( seed ) , and food aid .

line 3 refers to funds provided to usaid from all accounts for its bilateral malaria programs , including the president's malaria initiative ( see above ) .

line 4 refers to contributions to the global fund provided through usaid accounts .

in fy2004 , $87.8 million of the amount appropriated to the global fund was withheld per legislative provisions limiting u.s .

global fund contributions to 33% of the amount contributed by all donors , as indicated in line 5 .

p.l .

108-447 , fy2005 consolidated appropriations , directed that these withheld funds be transferred to the global fund in fy2005 , subject , like the remainder of the u.s. contribution , to the 33% proviso .

congress provides funds for pepfar's 15 focus countries to the state department's global hiv / aids initiative ( ghai ) , as indicated in line 6 .

u.s. contributions to other global aids efforts , such as international microbicide research , the international aids vaccine initiative ( iavi ) , and the united nations joint program on hiv / aids ( unaids ) , are also provided through ghai .

ghai funds transferred to the global fund are reflected in line 7 .

line 8 refers to funds appropriated to the foreign military financing ( fmf ) account for equipment purchases that support the dod's global hiv / aids efforts .

dod's bilateral hiv / aids programs , referred to in line 15 , offer hiv / aids prevention education , primarily to african armed forces .

line 10 refers to the centers for disease control and prevention's ( cdc ) global aids program ( gap ) .

cdc spends additional funds on international hiv / aids , tb , and malaria activities that are not earmarked by congress , though they are included in the table ( lines 11 - lines 13 ) .

line 14 reflects grants provided by the national institutes of health ( nih ) for international hiv / aids research , which focus primarily on the development of an aids vaccine .

nih also transfers funds to the global fund , as indicated on line 15 .

the administration has not requested funds for the department of labor's global aids in the workplace initiative since fy2002 ( line 16 ) .

congress funded the initiative , however , until fy2006 .

the department received additional funds from ghai in support of its hiv / aids programs .

in fy2008 , the administration did not request funds to support dod's bilateral hiv / aids prevention programs , as indicated in line 18 .

congress provided $8.0 million , however , for the activities .
