the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 ( p.l .

97-253 ; september 8 , 1982 ) suspended previously existing permanent law pertaining to cost - of - living adjustments ( colas ) for federal civilian and military retirees .

much of the legislative and executive branch activity related to military retirement colas since 1983 has involved efforts to repeal or extend provisions of this legislation .

prior to enactment of the 1982 act , military retirement colas had been paid on an annual basis , effective on march 1 of each year , and based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index ( cpi ) of december of the preceding year over that of the december before that .

for example , the 8.7% cola , effective march 1 , 1982 , was based on the percentage increase in the cpi of december 1981 over that of december 1980 .

the 1982 act provided that colas for fy1983 , fy1984 , and fy1985 would be effective on april 1 , 1983 , may 1 , 1984 , and june 1 , 1985 , respectively .

it also provided for the colas of nondisabled military retirees under age 62 to be calculated according to a different formula designed to lower them relative to those of all other military retirees .

a cola of 3.3% was accordingly paid to nondisabled military retirees under 62 , and a 3.9% cola was paid to all other military retirees , effective april 1 , 1983 .

in addition , the 1982 act required deductions equal to the colas in their military retired pay from the pay of most federal civil servants who had previously retired from the military .

this report examines executive and congressional cola - related initiatives associated with each of the fiscal year budgeting processes from calendar year 1982 ( fy1983 ) through calendar year 2000 ( fy2001 ) .

the cola situation for military retirees remained unchanged during fy1984 legislative activity ( that which took place during calendar year 1983 ) , despite efforts from the administration and in the congress .

the reagan administration's budget request for fy1984 , submitted to the congress in early 1983 , contained several measures related to military retirement colas .

the administration proposed to: cancel the fy1984 cola scheduled for may 1 , 1984 .

the fy1983 ( april 1 , 1983 ) and fy1985 ( june 1 , 1985 ) colas would occur as mandated by the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 ; beginning in fy1986 , limit colas for nondisabled retirees under age 62 to one - half of the actual percentage increase in the cpi ( frequently referred to as a "half - cola" or "diet cola" ) .

nondisabled retirees 62 or older , retirees receiving disability retired pay , and survivor annuitants would continue to receive full colas .

the first concurrent resolution on the fy1984 budget ( h.con.res .

91 ) , approved by the house and senate on june 23 , 1983 , assumed that the effective date of the fy1984 cola would be delayed until december 1 , 1984 , with all subsequent annual colas also effective on december 1 .

this would have had the effect of canceling the fy1984 cola , while advancing the effective date of the fy1985 cola by seven months .

however , congress adjourned on november 18 , 1983 , without enacting the proposed changes in substantive authorizing legislation .

the cola situation therefore remained as enacted in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 , under which the next military retirement cola was to be effective on may 1 , 1984 .

two other cola - related legislative proposals in 1983 received substantial attention but were not passed by the congress: ( 1 ) the administration proposal to institute a permanent "half - cola" for nondisabled military retirees under 62 , and ( 2 ) a provision of the senate version of the fy1984 reconciliation bill that would have repealed the requirement instituted in the 1982 act that most federally employed military retirees have an amount equal to the cola they received be deducted from their civil service salaries .

in fy1985 legislative action ( calendar year 1984 ) , the cola provisions in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 were largely negated .

the reagan administration's fy1985 budget request , submitted in early 1984 , contained several measures related to military retirement colas .

the administration proposed to: repeal the provisions of the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 ( 1 ) authorizing colas effective may 1 , 1984 , and june 1 , 1985 , and ( 2 ) providing for the colas of nondisabled retirees under age 62 to be calculated on a different basis from all other retirees' colas ; permanently shift the payment date for federal civilian and military retirement colas to january 1 of each year , beginning with january 1 , 1985 .

 ( this proposal , in conjunction with that described in the preceding paragraph , would therefore have resulted in no cola being paid between april 1 , 1983 , and january 1 , 1985. ) .

at the same time , the period of time over which the cpi was measured to determine the extent of the cola increase would have been modified to reflect the increase in the average cpi between the third quarters of successive years ( i.e. , the cola paid to federal retirees on january 1 , 1985 , would be based on the percentage increase in the average cpi for the period june - september 1984 over the average for june - september 1983 ) .

the omnibus reconciliation act of 1983 ( p.l .

98-270 ; april 18 , 1984 ) was the legislative vehicle for these proposals and therefore for practical purposes repealed comparable provisions of the omnibus reconciliation act of 1982 .

the deficit reduction act of 1984 ( p.l .

98-369 ; july 18 , 1984 ) repealed the provisions of the 1982 act which required most military retirees working for the federal government to forfeit their military retired pay colas .

it also changed the technical payment date for military retired pay ( checks or electronic fund transfers ) from the last business date of the current month ( i.e. , the 30 th or 31 st of most months ) to the first business day of the next month .

by pushing the twelfth monthly military retirement payment for fy1985 from september 30 to october 1 , 1985 — the first day of fy1986 — this provision provided a one - time paper savings in fy1985 of $1.6 billion in military retirement outlays .

the second supplemental appropriation act for fy1984 ( p.l .

98-396 ; august 22 , 1984 ) had the practical effect of negating the provision of the 1982 act which would have provided nondisabled military retirees under 62 a smaller cola on january 1 , 1985 , than those granted all other military retirees .

thus , on january 1 , 1985 , all military retirees received a 3.5% cola .

the reagan administration's fy1986 department of defense ( dod ) budget proposed to eliminate the military retired pay cola scheduled for january 1 , 1986 ; there would thus have been no cola between that paid on january 1 , 1985 , and that scheduled for january 1 , 1987 , under existing law .

the final concurrent resolution on the budget ( s.con.res .

32 ; approved by both the house and the senate on august 1 , 1985 ) rejected the administration's recommendation to cancel the fy1986 cola , indicating initially that it would be paid as permanent law provided on january 1 , 1986 .

however , the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 , also known as the gramm - rudman - hollings ( grh ) act ( p.l .

99-177 ; december 12 , 1985 ) provided that payment of the fy1986 cola was to be at least temporarily suspended until other provisions of the grh act took effect , no earlier than march 1 , 1986 .

specifically , subsection 252 ( a ) 6 ( c ) of grh provided that "the amounts that would otherwise be expended" during this period for colas would be withheld .

payment of the fy1986 cola was accordingly suspended between january 1 , 1986 , and march 1 , 1986 .

the president , according to other provisions of grh , then determined that payment of the fy1986 cola had to be completely eliminated to assist in reducing the fy1986 federal deficit .

it was therefore permanently canceled .

on july 7 , 1986 , the supreme court held that the automatic spending provisions of grh were unconstitutional ; however , the court stayed the effects of its decision for 60 days to give the congress and the president time to enact the fy1986 grh - mandated budget cuts into effect through the regular , pre - grh legislative process if it so desired .

on july 31 , 1986 , the president signed p.l .

99-366 , which ratified and affirmed the fy1986 grh budget cuts , including the fy1986 cola cancellation .

the reagan administration's fy1987 dod budget proposed to eliminate the military retired pay cola scheduled for january 1 , 1987 .

if accepted , this proposal would have meant that there would have been no cola between that paid on january 1 , 1985 , and the one scheduled , under permanent law , for january 1 , 1988 .

the final concurrent resolution on the fy1987 budget ( s.con.res .

120 ; passed both house and senate on june 26 , 1986 ) assumed that full military retirement colas would be paid in fy1987 on the basis of permanent law .

the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 ( sec .

7001 , title vii , p.l .

99-509 ; october 21 , 1986 ) also provided that full colas would be paid according to permanent law in calendar years 1987 through 1991 , inclusive , to military retirees ( and retirees covered by other federal retirement programs as well ) , if grh - mandated spending cuts occur .

 ( because grh - mandated spending cuts did not take place for the fy1987 budget , however , this latter provision of law was not required to guarantee the payment of a military retirement cola for fy1987. ) .

accordingly , based on the percentage increase in the average consumer price index for the third quarter of 1986 over the average cpi for the third quarter of 1985 , military retirees received a 1.3% cola on january 1 , 1987 .

the reagan administration's fy1988 and fy1989 dod budgets did not propose any changes in military retirement cola provisions contained in permanent law .

as this report indicates , this was a major change from previous years .

reagan administration dod budget requests from 1983 ( fy1984 ) through 1986 ( fy1987 ) all contained cola - related proposals , which usually had the aim of postponing or eliminating colas to save money .

the congress also did not enact any restrictions on colas in 1987 and 1988 as part of its consideration of the fy1988 and fy1989 budgets .

the house budget committee , full house , senate budget committee , full senate , and final versions of the concurrent resolutions on the fy1988 and fy1989 budgets all assumed the payment of full colas in fy1988 in accordance with permanent law .

in addition , the 1987 amendments to the gramm - rudman - hollings ( grh ) deficit reduction process ( p.l .

100-119 ; september 29 , 1987 ) provided for the exclusion of military retirement colas from any automatic sequestrations ( across - the - board budget reductions ) resulting from grh .

this contrasts with the original grh act , which , as noted above on page 3 , canceled the fy1986 military retirement cola originally scheduled for payment on january 1 , 1986 , and would have allowed cancellation of future colas under certain circumstances .

finally , no other legislation enacted in 1987 and 1988 affected the operation of the permanent - law cola formula .

accordingly , based on the percentage increase in the average consumer price index for the third quarter of calendar year 1987 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1986 , military retirees received a 4.2% cola on january 1 , 1988 .

based on the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1988 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1987 , military retirees received a 4.0% cola on january 1 , 1989 .

the original fy1990 budget of the incoming bush administration ( and that of the outgoing reagan administration ) , unlike the budgets the reagan administration submitted for fy1988 ( 1987 ) and fy1989 ( 1988 ) , but very much like those the reagan administration did submit for fy1984 ( 1983 ) through fy1987 ( 1986 ) , did propose reducing military retirement colas .

the bush administration's cola reduction program had two components .

first , it proposed to cancel the cola that would be paid on january 1 , 1990 .

second , through at least 1994 , all military retirees ( not just those who first entered military service after august 1 , 1986 , as provided for in the military retirement reform act of 1986 ) would , beginning with the january 1 , 1991 cola , have their cola calculated on the basis of one percentage point below the actual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index - related formula described above .

however , the bipartisan budget agreement reached between congress and president bush in the spring of 1989 assumed that colas would be paid to military retirees based on permanent law .

although there were no explicit statements to that effect stated in the documents associated with the agreement , no savings from cola cancellations were included in the budgetary calculations released to the public as part of the agreement .

the bush administration thus implicitly abandoned the idea of proposing cola reductions for either fy1990 or later fiscal years .

in addition , the house , senate , and final versions of the fy1990 concurrent resolution on the budget all assumed the payment of full colas in accordance with permanent law .

finally , the various statutes described above which prevented sequestration under grh from affecting military retirement and other federal retirement colas remained in effect .

based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula , therefore ( the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1989 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1988 ) , military retirees received a 4.7% cola on january 1 , 1990 .

the original fy1991 budget of the bush administration , submitted in early 1990 , proposed military retirement cola reductions identical in nature to those the administration had proposed a year earlier for fy1990 .

the fy1991 cola reduction proposal of the administration had two components .

first , it proposed to cancel the cola that would be paid on january 1 , 1991 .

second , through at least 1995 ( fy1995 ) , all military retirees ( not just those who first entered military service after august 1 , 1986 , as provided for in the military retirement reform act of 1986 ) would , beginning with the january 1 , 1992 cola , have their cola calculated on the basis of one percentage point below the actual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index - related formula described above .

in addition to the administration's cola reduction proposal , it was reported that the ongoing budget summit negotiations between the congressional leadership and the administration , during august - october 1990 considered reductions in cola benefits similar , but deeper , than those proposed by the administration .

these reductions allegedly included the following elements: ( 1 ) canceling the fy1991 cola scheduled for payment on january 1 , 1991 ; ( 2 ) limiting colas in fy1992 and thereafter to the cpi minus one percentage point for military retirees age 62 and over ; ( 3 ) providing no colas for military retirees under age 62 ; and ( 4 ) restoring the purchasing power of under - 62 retirees with a one - time recomputation of their retired pay .

after the one - time recomputation , the purchasing power of retirees over age 62 would , however , still decline due to their future colas being determined on the basis of the cpi - minus one formula .

however , the final budget agreement reached by the congressional leadership and the administration in late october 1990 included no such cola reductions .

the house , senate , and final versions of the fy1991 concurrent resolution on the budget all assumed the payment of full colas in accordance with permanent law .

finally , the various statutes described above which prevented sequestration under grh from affecting military retirement and other federal retirement colas remained in effect .

based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula , therefore ( the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1990 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1989 ) , military retirees received a 5.4% cola on january 1 , 1991 .

the original fy1992 and fy1993 budgets of the bush administration , submitted in early 1991 and 1992 , respectively , proposed no military retirement cola reductions .

the house , senate , and final versions of the fy1992 concurrent resolution on the budget all assumed the payment of full colas in accordance with permanent law .

the various statutes described above which prevented sequestration under grh from affecting military retirement and other federal retirement colas remained in effect in fy1992 and fy1993 .

the bush administration did propose , as part of its fy1993 budget , to allow military retirement colas to be subject to a grh budget sequestration if one took place , but congress took no action on this proposal and it was not enacted .

based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula ( the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1991 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1990 ) , military retirees received a 3.7% cola on january 1 , 1992 .

similarly , based on the permanent statutory cola computation formula ( in this case , the percentage increase in the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1992 over the average cpi for the third quarter of calendar year 1991 ) , military retirees received a 3.0% cola on january 1 , 1993 .

the military retirement reform act of 1986: summary of 1998-1999 congressional action leading to its near - complete repeal .

throughout 1998 and into 1999 , there was increasing discussion of whether some or all of the future retired pay cuts contained in the military retirement reform act of 1986 ( p.l .

99-348 , july 1 , 1986 ; 100 stat .

682 et .

seq .

 ) , also known as the "redux" cuts , should be repealed .

eventually , the redux retirement reductions were almost completely repealed by the fy2000 national defense authorization act ( sections 641-44 , subtitle d - retired pay reform , title vi , - compensation and other personnel benefits , p.l .

106-65 , october 5 , 1999 ; 113 stat .

512 at 662-64 ) .

the redux statute would have substantially cut the retired pay for those retirees who first entered military service on or after august 1 , 1986 .

with very few exceptions , military personnel do not become eligible for retired pay until completing 20 years of service .

the redux formula , therefore , would not have been used to compute any significant number of retirees' pay until mid - 2006 ( it applied to a very small number of disability retirees starting upon its enactment ) .

redux: changing the cola formula .

for military personnel not affected by redux ( i.e. , who entered service before august 1 , 1986 ) , each december a cola equal to the percentage increase in the cpi between the third quarters of successive years is applied to military retired pay for the annuities paid beginning each january 1 .

for example , assume that the cpi rises from an average of 500.0 in the third quarter of 2008 ( the average of the cpi for the months of july , august , and september 2008 ) to an average of 520.0 in the third quarter of 2009 , an increase of 20.0 points , or 4.0% of 500.0 .

the military retired pay that accrues during december 2009 , and is actually paid to retirees on january 1 , 2010 , would be increased by 4.0% above the amount paid the previous month .

for military personnel whose retired pay would have been computed in accordance with redux , the 1986 act modified the above formula by providing that annual colas would have been held to one percentage point below the actual inflation rate for retirees under age 62 .

retirees covered by the redux formula would thus have received a 3.0% increase , rather than 4.0% , in the hypothetical example described in the paragraph immediately preceding this one .

however , under redux , when the retiree reached age 62 , there would have been a one - time recomputation of his or her annuity to make up for lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to the inflation rate minus one percentage point .

after this one - time recomputation , however , future redux colas would have continued to be computed on the basis of the cpi minus one percentage point .

repeal of the 1986 redux legislation: beginnings and the administration proposal .

most discussion about repealing redux in 1998 and early 1999 revolved around changing its non - cola aspects .

however , the legislative process , including the administration's own proposal , which eventually led to the repeal , included variations in the original redux cola formula from the beginning .

in late december 1998 , the administration announced that it would propose a repeal of redux that would replace the cola formula for redux - eligible retirees with the formula used for federal civil service retirees covered by the federal employee retirement system ( fers ) — the pension plan for those federal civil servants who were first employed by the government on or after january 1 , 1984 .

the fers formula is less generous than the formula for pre - august 1 , 1986 entrant retirees , but more generous than the original redux cola provision .

fers currently operates for civil service retirees by giving them a cola of the cpi minus one percentage point , if the annual cpi increase is over 3% ; a flat 2% cola if the annual cpi increase is between 2 and 3% ; and the full cpi if the actual cpi increase is less than 2% .

early legislative action: the senate bill .

on january 27 , 1999 , the senate armed services committee reported out s. 4 , the soldiers' , sailors' , airmen's , and marines' bill of rights act of 1999 ( s.rept .

106-1 ) , which would have offered a military member two choices regarding retirement , of which one would have to be chosen at the 15-year mark: ( 1 ) decide to retire under the pre - redux formula , with full pre - redux cola protection , or ( 2 ) decide to retire under redux , including the original redux cola formula , but receive an immediate $30,000 cash bonus .

the full senate passed the bill on february 4 , 1999 .

redux repeal in the fy2000 national defense authorization act .

there was no house action on s. 4 , noted above ; after the senate passed s. 4 the legislative vehicle for military retirement changes shifted to the fy2000 defense authorization bill .

on may 17 , 1999 , the senate armed services committee reported out its version of the authorization bill ( s.rept .

106-50 ) , and the bill passed the full senate on may 27 , 1999 .

the cola provisions of the senate bill were identical to those of s. 4 — an option for the individual to select either redux or pre - redux cola formulae .

however , the house version of the fy2000 defense authorization was quite different .

the house armed services committee's bill , reported may 19 , 1999 ( h.rept .

106-162 ) , and the full house bill , passed june 10 , 1999 , provided the same two options as the senate — retirement under redux with a $30,000 bonus or retirement under pre - redux and no bonus — but the house cola provisions were less generous than those of the senate .

the house in fact adopted the administration's proposal for the option involving the $30,000 bonus ; members who selected this would have their cola computed on the same formula as used in the federal employee retirement system ( fers ) as described above .

the final version of the bill , however , ( p.l .

106-65 , october 5 , 1999 , sec .

641 ) , contained the house plan — the fers formula was rejected , and those retirees covered by the 1986 act will have the option of a redux or pre - redux cola formula , depending on whether or not they opt for the $30,000 cash bonus .

in each of the seven fiscal years fy1999-fy2005 , all military retirement colas were first paid on january 1 of those years .

the percentage increases were 1.3% for 1999 , 2.4% for 2000 , 3.5% for 2001 , 2.6% for 2002 , 1.4% for 2003 , 2.1% for 2004 , and 2.7% for 2005 .

there were no proposals in the administration budgets and no congressional actions directed at any cola changes in these years .

these seven years are the longest period since military retirement colas were first authorized in 1963 in which no legislative changes in the cola mechanism have been even proposed .

similarly , the eight fiscal years fy1997-fy2005 ( calendar years 1996-2004 ) , contained no changes in the cola formula , the longest such period since 1963 in which no actual changes were made .
