on june 30 , 2013 , the election assistance commission released the 10 th biennial report on the impact of the national voter registration act of 1993 on the 2011-2012 election cycle .

on june 17 , 2013 , the united states supreme court , by a vote of 7-2 , held that the national voter registration act of 1993 preempts the state of arizona law requiring proof of citizenship as part of the voter registration process for those individuals using the "federal form," arizona , et .

v. the inter tribal council of arizona , inc. et .

al. , no .

12-71 , june 17 , 2013 .

on june 4 , 2013 , the house committee on house administration held a hearing on the voter registration efficiency act ( h.r .

2115 ) .

the bill is intended to reduce the number of voters registered in multiple states , among other things .

the bill would amend the national voter registration act of 1993 to require individuals registering to vote in a state to indicate if the state will be the individual's residence for the purpose of voting and for other purposes .

efforts to establish a national voter registration system followed closely on the heels of passage of the voting rights act in 1965 .

in the early 1970s , a substantial effort was made to establish a national "postcard" or mail registration system .

in the 92 nd congress , both the senate and the house held hearings on a proposal to establish a national voter registration system , with the census bureau conducting postcard registration for federal elections .

the proposal came to the senate floor for a vote but was tabled .

in the 93 rd congress , both the senate and the house again considered much the same proposal ; a national postcard voter registration system , administered by a new national voter registration administration located in the census bureau .

the senate passed the bill ( s. 352 , s. rept .

93-91 ) on may 9 , 1973 ( vote: 57-37 ) .

the house , on may 8 , 1974 , refused to take up the bill ( h.r .

8053 , h. rept .

93-778 ) to establish a national postcard voter registration system by rejecting the rule under which the measure was to be debated on the floor ( vote:197-204 ) .

in 1975 , the house passed a modified version of the postcard voter registration measure , eliminating the required mass mailing of postcards to every household ; the postcards were to be made available at post offices and other public offices ( h.r .

11552 ; august 9 , 1975 , h. rept .

94-798 , vote: 239-147 ) .

the measure , however , stalled in the senate .

during the first year of the carter presidency , reform efforts focused on passage of a national voter registration standard that would have allowed citizens to register to vote on election - day ( h.r .

5400 , h. rept .

95-318 ) .

although the proposal initially received strong support , negative reactions from local election officials appear to have caused support to erode .

the house version never came up for a vote on the floor .

like the house version , the senate bill ( s. 1072 , s. rept .

95-171 ) was reported out of committee but never came up for a vote .

by mid - 1977 , election - day voter registration was essentially defeated , and there was little or no effort to revive it for the rest of the carter presidency .

between 1983 and 1988 various measures to reform voter registration were proposed .

some proposals would have established a national voter registration system based on postcard registration or election - day registration , or both .

some bills proposed providing financial incentives to the states to encourage a more uniform and open registration system .

but , while some hearings on voter registration reform were held during the period , no measure ever reached the floor of either the senate or the house .

while various bills proposing voter registration reform were introduced during the early 1980s , election reform efforts became more narrowly focused .

in 1984 , congress passed the voting accessibility for the elderly and handicapped act ( p.l .

98-435 , 98 stat .

1678 ) .

the act established national requirements for making polling places accessible to the elderly and the handicapped .

in addition , the act required each state to provide "a reasonable number of accessible permanent registration facilities," to "make available registration and voting aids for federal elections for handicapped and elderly individuals," and to require "no notarization or medical certification ... of handicapped voters with respect to an absentee ballot or application for such ballot. .

the act was signed into law september 28 , 1984 .

in 1986 , congress passed and the president signed the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act ( uocava ) ( p.l .

99-410 , 100 stat .

924 ) .

among other things , the act required the creation of an official postcard form containing a voter registration and absentee ballot application , required each state to "permit absentee uniformed services voters and overseas voters to use absentee registration procedures and to vote by absentee ballot" in all federal elections , and required states to "permit overseas voters to use federal write - in absentee ballots in general elections for federal office" except when the state provides a state absentee ballot approved by the presidential designee and made available at least 60 days in advance of the election .

the act was signed into law august 28 , 1986 .

both p.l .

98-435 and p.l .

99-410 established national voter registration and election standards .

perhaps considered modest by some , these two acts established a much stronger federal presence in state electoral activities than had been the case in the past .

the nvra was not supported by most republicans in the 103 rd congress , and a similar bill had been vetoed by president bush in 1992 .

with the ascendancy of the republican party in the 104 th congress , and given the criticism of the nvra as an "unfunded mandate" of the federal government by several prominent republican governors from large states , attempts to repeal or modify the nvra appeared certain .

however , while the republican party controlled both the house and senate , its control in the senate would not have prevented democratic senators from mounting a filibuster against proposals to change the nvra .

further , with the white house in the hands of a democrat ( president clinton ) who supported the nvra , any changes in the nvra that were not bipartisan would almost certainly have been vetoed .

the 112 th congress saw the introduction of bills aimed at requiring states to establish same - day or election - day voter registration in all federal elections ( h.r .

108 , h.r .

3317 , h.r .

3163 , h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 ) ; be able to update voter registration records at the polling place on election day ( h.r .

3163 ) ; allow for internet voter registration and use of the internet to update statewide voter registration records ( h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 , h.r .

6632 ) ; and , provide for the establishment of an automatic registration system based on information taken directly from state and federal agency database systems ( h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 ) .

in addition , legislation was proposed to require each voter registration agency ( as defined under nvra ) within a state to insure that every registered voter , without charge , was issued a voter id card if such voter id was required by state law as a condition for voting in a federal election ( h.r .

4126 ) .

legislation also was proposed that would prevent any interference with voter registration ( h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 ) , require the eac to develop best practices for states to prevent such interference ( h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 ) , and provide major penalties for promoting voter registration fraud ( h.r .

6593 / s. 168 ) .

additionally , one bill , the voter empowerment act of 2012 ( h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 ) , provided that states must accept voter registration applications from otherwise qualified citizens 16 years of age and older , but the states were not required to make any changes in the age requirement for voting in state law .

the same legislation specified that by 90 days after the end of every year , states must submit to the eac specified statewide voter registration statistical information .

it extended nvra provisions and other provisions specific to the act to the district of columbia , puerto rico , the u.s. virgin islands , guam , and america samoa .

the voter empowerment act of 2012 also established a pilot program to allow persons with disabilities to register ( and to vote ) from their residencies .

other proposed legislation in the 112 th congress , among other things , provided for funding to states to explore appropriate technological changes to simplify the voter registration process within a state ( h.r .

6590 / s. 3635 ) ; required the secretary of the department of veterans affairs to specify local facilities within the department as voter registration agencies as defined under nvra ( s. 1264 ) ; and designated a "national month of voter registration ( h.res .

758 / s.res .

572 ) .

thus far in the 113 th congress , much of the proposed legislation introduced duplicates legislative proposals introduced in the 112 th congress .

this is true of the voter empowerment act of 2013 ( h.r .

12 / s. 123 [ h.r .

5799 / s. 3608 in the 112 th ] ) , the fair , accurate , secure , and timely voting act or fast voting act ( h.r .

97 / s. 85 [ h.r .

6590 / s. 3635 in the 112 th ] ) , the same day registration act of 2013 ( h.r .

280 / s. 532 [ h.r .

3317 in the 112 th ] ) , the value our time elections or vote act ( h.r .

289 [ h.r .

6632 in the 112 th with a different title] ) , the voter fraud prevention act ( h.r .

1280 [ h.r .

6593 / s. 168 in the 112 th ] ) , and the voter registration efficiency act ( h.r .

2115 [ h.r .

6386 in the 112 th with a slightly different title] ) .

on june 4 , 2013 , the house committee on house administration held a hearing on the voter registration efficiency act ( h.r .

2115 ) .

the bill is intended to reduce the number of voters registered in multiple states , among other things .

the bill would amend the national voter registration act of 1993 to require individuals registering to vote in a state to indicate if the state will be the individual's residence for the purpose of voting and for other purposes .

the proposal is similar to an arizona program , interstate cross - check , in existence since 2009 , matching records from 21 cooperating states .

according to arizona secretary of state ken bennett , in 2012 , the cross - check located 45,000 duplicate voter registration records in arizona from the other states .

new legislative proposals in the 113 th congress direct the eac to conduct a pilot program to provide funds to local educational agencies to instruct high school seniors about the voter registration process , the students voicing opinions in today's elections ( vote ) act ( h.r .

653 ) , applies directly all nvra provisions to puerto rico , american samoa , the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands , guam , and the u.s. virgin islands ( h.r .

1018 ) , amends the nvra to permit states to require documentary evidence to prove citizenship ( h.r .

2409 ) , and calls on the congress to strengthen the "nation's electoral system by ensuring clean and fair elections" ( s. 9 ) .

the national voter registration act of 1993 has been the law of the land for over 20 years and has been in effect for 18 years .

the courts have resolved many of the initial issues .

a review of the fec / eac reports appears to indicate that the states have come to terms with the provisions , despite the fact that state election officials continue to advocate that the federal government should provide funding for the implementation of aspects of the act .

there may still be some problems with implementation at the local levels and with the training of nonelection officials who are responsible under the nvra for providing voter registration services .

as noted above , some opponents would like to curtail parts of the nvra ; proponents , however , do not think the nvra has gone far enough .

some are calling for voter registration reform that would include what has been called "universal voter registration," where the government is responsible for registering all citizens to vote unlike the system used in the united states that relies on individuals to register themselves .

others have suggested minor changes in nvra , like making it "opt - out" instead of "opt - in" ( i.e. , automatic registration when an applicant receives a driver's license or benefits at designated state voter registration agencies , unless specifically deciding to "opt - out" ) , but with more enforcement of the provisions that are currently in place .

how and whether the congress decides to respond to these calls for reform remains to be seen .

appendix a .

supporting tables appendix b. post - nvra voter registration legislative history , 104 th to 111 th congresses in the 105 th congress , as in the 104 th , bills were introduced to repeal the nvra ( h.r .

345 ) , to make the provisions voluntary ( h.r .

2115 ) , and to modify the provisions in some fashion .

the modifications proposed consisted of the following: ( 1 ) requiring citizens to produce a social security number in order to register to vote ( h.r .

224 , h.r .

2076 , and s. 1561 ) ; ( 2 ) requiring proof of citizenship in order to register to vote ( h.r .

1139 , h.r .

2076 , and s. 1561 ) ; ( 3 ) allowing states to require photographic identification in order to cast a ballot ( h.r .

1139 and s. 1561 ) ; ( 4 ) repealing the mail voter registration provisions of nvra ( h.r .

2076 and s. 1561 ) ; ( 5 ) changing purge rules in the nvra to make it easier and less expensive for states to purge their voter registration rolls of ineligible persons ( h.r .

2076 , h.r .

3485 , and s. 1561 ) ; and , ( 6 ) making optional for the states the requirement to allow registrants who change their address to vote at the polling place for their old address , the "failsafe voting" provision ( h.r .

2076 and s. 1561 ) .

in addition , representative horn introduced legislation that would have required the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) and the social security administration , at the request of federal , state , or local election officials , to provide information on the citizenship status of persons attempting to register to vote ( h.r .

1428 ) .

the house oversight committee ( renamed the committee on house administration in the 106 th congress ) held hearings on h.r .

224 , h.r .

1139 , h.r .

1428 , and h.r .

2076 on november 6 , 1997 .

on february 12 , 1998 , h.r .

1428 was brought up for a vote under suspension of the rules in the house of representatives , a procedure that requires a two - thirds majority to pass , and was defeated ( vote: 210-200 ) .

on march 18 , 1998 , representative thomas , then chairman of the committee on house oversight , introduced legislation ( h.r .

3485 ) that , in part , would have established a pilot project in five states ( california , new york , texas , florida , and illinois ) of the program proposed in h.r .

1428 .

h.r .

3485 was reported out of the committee on house oversight on march 23 , 1998 ( h.rept .

105-457 ) .

on march 30 , 1998 , h.r .

3581 , a revision of h.r .

3485 , was introduced and brought up for a vote in the house , under suspended rules , and was defeated ( vote: 74-337 ) .

on may 6 , 1998 , the house passed ( 414-4 ) the higher education amendments of 1998 , h.r .

6 , which contained an amendment offered by representative clayton ( h. amdt .

583 ) , requiring institutions of higher learning to distribute the nvra mail voter registration application form to each student during enrollment , unless the student , in writing , declined such a form .

the senate version of h.r .

6 passed without this provision .

in conference , the amendment was modified to require institutions in states covered by the nvra to make "a good faith effort to distribute a mail voter registration form ... to each student enrolled in a degree or certified program. .

in addition , the revised language required the institutions to request voter registration forms from the state 120 days prior to the deadline for registering to vote , but it allowed an institution to implement its own program without interference from state officials .

the conference report ( h.rept .

105-750 ) passed the house by voice vote september 28 and passed the senate ( vote: 96-0 ) september 29 .

the legislation was signed by president clinton ( p.l .

105-244 ) october 7 , 1998 .

as the 106 th congress began , two voter registration related bills were introduced in the house .

on january 6 , 1999 , representative stump , as he did in the 105 th congress , introduced a bill ( h.r .

38 ) to repeal the nvra .

on the same day , representative mccollum introduced h.r .

180 , a duplicate of the bill he introduced in the 105 th congress ( h.r .

224 ) .

in may , senator warner introduced legislation to deal with campaign finance reform ( s. 1107 ) .

s. 1107 , essentially a duplicate of s. 1561 , introduced in the 105 th congress , see above ) .

this bill amended parts of the nvra by ( 1 ) repealing the mail voter registration requirements , ( 2 ) requiring states to obtain an applicant's social security number when attempting to register to vote , ( 3 ) requiring applicant's registering at a state motor vehicle office to submit proof of citizenship , ( 4 ) allowing states to purge names from voter registration lists because the registrants had failed to vote for period of time after the registrant was notified , and ( 5 ) repealing the limited provisional voting provisions of the nvra .

in september , 1999 , representative luther introduced legislation to amend the nvra by requiring states to provide citizens the right to register at the polling place on election - day ( h.r .

2864 ) .

there was no action on any of these bills in the 106 th congress .

in reaction to the events of the 2000 presidential election , a number of bills were introduced in the 107 th congress to reform the election administration process .

while some of these bills focused solely on voter registration ( h.r .

128 , h.r .

189 , h.r .

829 , h.r .

2687 , s. 2226 ) , much of the effort was focused on a more comprehensive response .

the efforts culminated in the passage of the help america vote act of 2002 ( hava ) ( p.l .

107-252 ) .

hava addressed voter registration in four areas: ( 1 ) it created the election assistance commission ( eac ) and transferred fec's responsibilities with respect to nvra to eac ( §201 ; §202 ; §209 ; §803 ) , specifically with respect to the development and maintenance of the federal mail voter registration form ( §303 ( b ) ( 4 ) ) and the biennial reports on the impact of the nvra ; ( 2 ) it specified that each state "shall implement , in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner , a single , uniform , official , centralized , interactive computerized statewide voter registration list defined , maintained , and administered at the state level that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the state and assigns a unique identifier to each legally registered voter in the state" ( §303 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) ) and "perform list maintenance with respect to the computerized list on a regular basis" in accordance with the provisions of nvra ( §303 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) ; ( 3 ) it required the use of the driver's license number or the last four digits of the social security number of the applicant on all voter registration applications ( §303 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( a ) ) , as well as requiring that the social security administration develop relationships with the departments of motor vehicles in each state to assist in list verification ( §303 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( b ) ; and , ( 4 ) it expanded the "fail safe voting" provisions of nvra to provisional voting ( §303 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( a ) - ( b ) ) .

in the 108 th congress , legislation was introduced to repeal nvra ( h.r .

2139 ) , to require proof of citizenship to register to vote ( h.r .

4174 , h.r .

4530 ) , to standardize the treatment of ex - felons with respect to their right to register to vote ( h.r .

1433 , h.r .

4758 ) , to require states "to provide notice and an opportunity for review prior to removing any individual from the official list of eligible voters by reason of criminal conviction or mental incapacity" ( h.r .

4250 ) , to require same - day or election - day voter registration ( h.r .

1510 , h.r .

3153 ) , and to allow pre - registration to individuals to register to vote prior to meeting the age requirement ( h.r .

4972 ) .

none of the bills reached beyond the committee assignment .

in the 109 th congress , legislation was introduced to require states to institute same - day or election - day voter registration ( h.r .

496 , h.r .

533 , h.r .

939 , h.r .

3557 , s. 17 .

s. 450 ) , to require proof of citizenship when registering ( h.r .

4989 ) , to require a photo - identification when registering to vote ( h.r .

2250 ) , to allow removal from registration lists for failure to vote ( h.r .

2778 ) , to prohibit removal from voter registration lists due to correctable errors and removal for felony conviction or death unless the comparison database meet standards set by the director of the national institute of standards and technology ( h.r .

3094 ) , to delay the implementation of the state voter registration database requirement in hava for four years ( h.r .

3163 ) , to require states to keep the name and addresses of victims of domestic violence that appeared on state voter registration databases confidential ( h.r .

4462 ) , and to require states to produce durable voter registration cards ( h.r .

4989 ) .

one other bill , s. 414 , had several goals .

it would have required the use of the social security number in registering voters , required that all states synchronize all state voter registration databases , eliminated third party voter registration , modified conditions for removal of names from voter registration databases , and clarified procedures for first - time registrants .

none of the bills reached the floor of the house or the senate .

the legislative activity in the 110 th congress , in many ways , reproduced that in the 109 th .

same - day or election - day voter registration was introduced in a variety of bills ( h.r .

2457 , h.r .

5628 , h.r .

1381 , h.r .

5946 , s. 730 , s. 804 , s. 2959 ) .

three bills contained provisions aimed at requiring notice before any names could be removed from voter registration lists ( h.r .

7244 , s. 730 , s. 804 ) .

legislation also was introduced to control by whom and how voter registration forms were distributed ( h.r .

301 ) , to require the acceptance of any type of voter registration form sent by overseas military or civilians ( s. 3073 ) , to require the acceptance of a newly created official federal voter registration and ballot application from overseas citizens ( h.r .

4237 ) , to make institutions of higher education state voter registration agencies as specified in nvra ( s. 3390 , h.r .

6704 ) , to require the addition of a statement on voter registration application forms that stated that any alien who used the form to register was deportable under the immigration and nationality act ( h.r .

5695 ) , to prohibit states from not accepting voter registration forms from third parties ( s. 1487 ) , to require photographic identification to register to vote ( h.r .

879 ) , to promote pre - registration for students under 18 ( s. 3100 ) , and to have the eac study internet voter registration ( s. 730 , s. 804 ) .

the only legislation that passed the house , however , was a bill that required the department of veterans affairs to designate all of its public facilities as state voter registration agencies as defined under nvra ( h.r .

6625 ) .

this bill was not acted upon in the senate .

the 111 th congress saw the introduction of bills aimed at requiring states to establish same - day voter registration or election - day registration ( h.r .

105 , h.r .

3957 , s. 1986 ) .

bills were introduced containing provisions aimed at requiring notice before names could be removed from statewide voter registration databases ( h.r .

105 , h.r .

3416 , h.r .

3835 ) .

also , bills were introduced requiring or promoting states to adopt on - line or internet voter registration procedures ( h.r .

105 , h.r .

1719 , h.r .

4449 , s. 3301 ) .

bills were also introduced to add to the list of official voter registration agencies , as designated in nvra , by adding universities ( h.r .

1729 , s. 1125 ) , or by adding department of veterans administration facilities ( s. 1556 ) , or by designating an office on each military installation as a voter registration agency ( h.r .

3274 , s. 1265 ) .

other bills were introduced to regulate or minimize challenges to voter registration status on election - day at the polling place ( h.r .

103 , h.r .

105 ) .

one bill , which concerned various aspects of the election process , required states and the eac to replace specific questions on voter registration application forms about either age or citizenship or both with a signed affidavit on the form ( h.r .

105 ) .

another bill ( h.r .

3489 ) would have amended hava to prevent any challenge to eligibility to register to vote due to foreclosure proceedings being brought against the voter .

another proposal ( s. 1103 ) would establish standards for the distribution of voter registration forms , and would require organizations to register with the state prior to distributing such forms .

while a few of the above proposed bills were discussed in hearings , none came to the floor or were voted on by either chamber .

however , on october 28 , 2009 , the president signed into law the military and overseas vote empowerment ( move ) act ( s. 1415 , p.l .

111-84 , 123 stat .

2190 ( 2009 ) ) , which , in part amended the uniform and overseas citizens absentee voting act ( uocava ) .

signed into law as part of the national defense authorization act of 2009 ( h.r .

2647 / s. 1390 , §575 , p.l .

111-84 , 123 stat .

2318 , [42 u.s.c.a .

§1971] ) , the move act made changes to certain absentee voting laws and procedures that apply to military and overseas voters .

with respect to changes in voter registration procedures , the act established procedures for absent uniform service voters and overseas voters to request and for states to send voter registration applications and absentee ballot applications by mail and electronically ( p.l .

111-84 , §577 ( a ) , [42 u.s.c.a .

§1973ff - 1] ) .

the act also prohibited refusal to accept voter registration applications , absentee ballot applications , marked absentee ballots and federal write - in absentee ballots for failure to meet certain requirements ( "notarization requirements," "restrictions on paper type , including weight and size," and "restrictions on envelope type , including weight and size" ) ( p.l .

111-84 , §582 ( a ) - ( c ) , [42 u.s.c.a .

§1973ff - 1 ( i ) , §1973ff - 2 ( f ) ] ) .

in addition , the act amends chapter 80 , of title 10 , united states code , pertaining to the military , by requiring that "the secretaries of the military departments shall designate offices on installations under their jurisdiction to provide absent uniformed service voters , ..." " ( 1 ) information on voter registration procedures and absentee ballot procedures...." " ( 2 ) information and assistance , if requested , including access to the internet where practicable , to register to vote in an election for federal office , ..." ( p.l .

111-84 §583 ( b ) , 10 u.s.c.a .

§1566a ( a ) - ( d ) ) .

also , the secretaries of the military departments may designate these voter assistance offices as "voter registration agencies" on military installations under section 7 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the nvra of 1993 ( p.l .

103-31 .

[42 u.s.c .

1973gg - 5 ( a ) ( 2 ) ] ) ( p.l .

111-84 , §583 ( b ) , [10 u.s.c.a .

§1566 ( e ) ] ) .

in other words , the act requires that all installations of the military have voter assistance offices to help absent uniformed service voters with voter registration applications as well as with assistance acquiring absentee ballots .

at the discretion of the secretaries of each military department , these offices may be designated as voter registration agencies .

if so designated , these offices would be authorized to accept voter registration applications and transmit to the appropriate state election officials within the specified time frame indicated in the nvra .

however , the secretary of defense has the authority to changes these procedures through regulations ( p.l .

111-84 , §583 ( b ) , [10 u.s.c.a .

§1566a ( f ) ] ) .

in the process leading up to the passage of the move act , several bills were also introduced to modify uocava that would have modified voter registration practices as well ( h.r .

1659 , h.r .

1739 , h.r .

2823 , h.r .

3416 , h.r .

3473 ) .

the bills either never reached the floor or provisions were incorporated into the move act .
