for the most controversial fy2001 foreign operations issue - internationalfamily planning - congress increased spending to $425 million .

lawmakers,however , restricted the obligation of funds until after february 15 , 2001 .

onjanuary 22 , 2001 , two days after taking office , president george w. bush issued amemorandum to the usaid administrator directing him to "reinstate in full all ofthe requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 , 1993. .

aseparate statement from the president's press secretary stated that president bushwas "committed to maintaining the $425 million funding level" for populationassistance "because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is byproviding quality voluntary family planning services. .

on february 15 , 2001,usaid released specific policy and contract guidelines to implement the president'sdirective .

these guidelines were re - issued by the white house on march 28 in orderto block an early congressional vote to overturn the mexico city restrictions .

previously , on november 6 , 2000 , president clinton signed into law a $14.9 billion foreign operations appropriations for fy2001 ( p.l .

106-429 ; h.r .

4811 ) .

the spending measure includes both regular fy2001requested programs as well as selected fy2000 supplemental funding proposals thatcongress had rejected earlier in the year .

the enacted legislation falls about $550million , or 3.5% , below the president's combined fy2000 supplemental / fy2001requests , but is substantially higher than the roughly $13.4 billion spendingmeasures passed by the house and senate during the summer .

moreover , p.l.106-429 fully funds several top administration priorities , including $435 million forinternational debt relief under the heavily indebted poor country ( hipc ) initiative .

congress further boosted funding for several global health programs , including $315million for hiv / aids and $60 million for malaria control .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislativevehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the u.s. foreign assistancebudget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally .

 ( 1 ) it containsthe largest share - - about two - thirds - - of total international affairs spending by theunited states ( see figure 1 ) .

the legislation funds all u.s. bilateral developmentassistance programs , managed mostly by the u.s. agency for internationaldevelopment ( usaid ) , together with several smaller independent foreign aidagencies , such as the peace corps and the inter - american and african developmentfoundations .

most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations,including usaid's disaster program and state department's refugee relief support .

 ( 2 ) foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former sovietunion ( also referred to as the independent states account ) and central / easterneurope , activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department .

security assistance ( economic and military aid ) for israel and egypt is also part of theforeign operations spending measure , as are smaller security aid programsadministered largely by the state department , in conjunction with usaid and thepentagon .

u.s. contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateraldevelopment banks , managed by the treasury department , and voluntary paymentsto international organizations , handled by the state department , are also funded inthe foreign operations bill .

finally , the legislation includes appropriations for threeexport promotion agencies: the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) ,the export - import bank , and the trade and development agency .

from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in u.s. foreign aid policy making , the foreign operations bill has taken on even greatersignificance during the past 15 years .

congress has not enacted a foreign aidauthorization bill since 1985 , leaving most foreign assistance programs withoutregular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees .

as aresult , foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriationscommittees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues andplayed a major role in shaping , authorizing , and guiding both executive andcongressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives .

it has been largelythrough foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aidpolicy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war .

thelegislation has also been a key tool used by congress to apply restrictions andconditions on administration management of foreign assistance , actions that havefrequently resulted in executive - legislative clashes over presidential prerogatives inforeign policy making .

subsequently , house and senate foreign operations subcommittees heldhearings , including testimony from secretary of state albright , treasury secretarysummers , and usaid administrator anderson .

the senate appropriationscommittee bypassed subcommittee markup , and ordered reported s. 2522 on may 9 .

because of disputes over scheduling and the opportunity by theminority to offer amendments to other legislation , the senate delayed taking up s. 2522 .

those problems were settled and the senate approved s. 2522 on june 22 .

as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to a post - coldwar environment , one of the major foreign assistance challenges for congress andexecutive branch policymakers has been to formulate the most effective foreign aidprogram amidst a tightening resource base .

a dominant characteristic of foreignoperations funding trends in the most recent years has been the degree to which foreign policy contingencies and international disasters have created demands foradditional resources beyond those originally requested by the president .

congress approved substantial amounts for fy1999 and fy2000 through "emergency" orsupplemental appropriation mechanisms , amounts that are over and above what isenacted in "regular" foreign operations bills .

after peaking at $20.7 billion in fy1985 , foreign operations appropriations began a period of decline , falling to about $12.3 billion in fy1997 .

foreign aidspending cuts were especially sharp in fy1996 when congress cut funding by $1.15billion , nearly 9% from the previous year .

many government and non - governmentexperts argued that these budget reductions seriously undermined u.s. foreign policyinterests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events .

after foreign operations funding levels fell again in fy1997 - - although by much smaller amounts - - the state department and other executive agencieslaunched an aggressive campaign to reverse the decade - long decline in the foreignpolicy budget .

this effort coincided with congressional approval of a near $1 billionincrease for fy1998 , setting foreign operations appropriations at $13.15 billion .

foreign operations funds rose again to $15.4 billion in fy1999 when lawmakers , atthe urging of the white house , added nearly $900 million in the final days of the105th congress and another $2.1 billion for central american hurricane relief andkosovo emergency assistance in supplemental funding .

amounts enacted for fy2000 - $16.5 billion - were also augmented by late - year "emergency" add - ons recommended by the president , including $1.8 billionfor the wye river / middle east peace accord and $1.1 billion supplementalassistance , mostly for a new counternarcotics initiative in colombia .

as shown in table 2 , the amount for fy2000 is the highest in six years and the largest fundinglevel , in nominal terms , for foreign operations since fy1985 .

nevertheless , whencalculated using constant dollars - taking into account the effects of inflation - fy2000 foreign operations amounts are 47% less than the high point of fy1985,15% less than the annual average appropriation during the late 1980s , and 3% lessthan fy1992 , a year that might be considered the first post - cold war foreign aidbudget .

fy2000 foreign operations spending level represents 0.91% of the entirefederal budget and 2.8% of total discretionary budget authority .

by comparison,these same figures in fy1985 were 2% and 4.6% , respectively .

table 2 .

foreign operations appropriations , fy1994 to fy2000 ( discretionary budget authority in billionsof current dollars ) * fy1999 excludes $17.861 billion for the imf .

in february 2000 president clinton asked congress to appropriate $15.1 billionfor fy2001 foreign operations .

there were two basic ways in which to compare theproposal with existing spending for fy2000 .

the first was to make a straightcomparison between enacted fy2000 foreign operations levels and the fy2001request .

using these reference points , the fy2001 budget recommendation wasabout $1.4 billion , or 8% less than total fy2000 appropriations .

another means ofcomparison , and one that was frequently used by congressional budget andappropriations committees , was to compare funding for foreign aid programscontinuing from year to year , that would deduct appropriations provided underspecial circumstances , such as emergency requirements , one - time , unique initiatives,or supplemental funding .

for fy2000 , congress approved under an emergencydesignation a one - time , $1.8 billion aid package for israel , jordan , and palestiniansin support of the november 1998 wye river / middle east peace accord .

congressfurther enacted in p.l .

106-246 an additional $1.1 billion in fy2000 foreignoperations supplemental spending , mostly for counternarcotics in colombia .

underthis second comparison approach , which adjusts the fy2000 appropriation level from$16.5 billion to $13.5 billion , the fy2001 foreign operations request was 12% higher than fy2000 spending .

table 3 .

summary of foreign operations appropriations ( discretionary funds - in millions of dollars ) note: for comparative purposes and to conform to the account structure of the fy2000 and fy2001 enacted foreign operations , some funding in the fy2001request and senate bill have been shifted: unicef , gavi , inter - americanfoundation , and african development foundation amounts requested for fy2001are included in development aid under title ii .

senate funding for unicef , approvedin title iv , is also shifted to development aid in title ii .

* pursuant to the consolidated appropriations act , fy2001 ( h.r .

4577 ) , signed into law on dec. 21 , 2000 , most fy2001 appropriation bills , includingforeign operations , are reduced by 0.22% .

for foreign operations , there will be acut of about $33 million from the $14.897 billion level .

** fy2001 includes combined fy2000 supplemental and fy2001 requests for debtrelief .

in addition to funding decisions made by congress in the foreign operationsappropriation bill , the annual spending measure also includes a wide range of policyprovisions that frequently raise contentious foreign policy disagreements between thepresident and congress .

as mentioned above , because congress has not enactedforeign aid authorization bills for over a decade , the foreign operationsappropriations legislation often becomes the vehicle for debate on the conduct ofu.s .

foreign policy more generally .

many of these policy provisions take the formof conditions or restrictions on how the president can use money included in thespending bill .

many of these provisions are opposed by the administration asexcessively limiting its ability to manage american foreign policy .

thelegislative - executive policy differences have in the past delayed the enactment of theforeign operations bill or have prompted a presidential veto .

among the most significant funding and policy issues raised during congressional debate in 2000 on the foreign operations appropriation measure wereconflicting executive - legislative branch development assistance strategy prioritiesand new administration initiatives , restrictions on international family planningprograms , regional and country aid allocations , and efforts by the administration tosecure funding to reduce debt burdens of the poorest developing countries .

b .

the account structure for development aid differs among versions of the bill .

this table showsa consistent and comparable account structure based on the fy2001 conference agreement .

forthe administration's request , this means adding amounts to development aid for theinter - american and african development foundations , gavi , and unicef , which arerequested in other accounts .

for the senate it means the addition of $110 million for unicefwhich s. 2522 funded under the international organizations account in title iv .

c. for fy2001 , the administration requested a separate account under development aid for africa ( the development fund for africa , or dfa ) .

africa aid is also proposed within the childsurvival account .

the total amount requested for africa - - dfa plus africa / child survival - - is $837 million .

this compares to $738 million appropriated for africa in fy2000 withinthe child survival and development assistance fund accounts .

d. initially requested and / or approved by the house or senate as an fy2000 emergencysupplemental appropriation .

included in title vi of p.l .

106-429 as an emergency fy2001appropriation .

e. transition initiative funds included in disaster assistance account for fy2000 , fy2001 request,and senate fy2001 bill .

h. fy2000 supplemental enacted in p.l .

106-246 .

the president's fy2001 request included $256million for plan colombia .

congress incorporated portions of the follow - on $256 millionfy2001 plan colombia proposal in the fy2000 supplemental .

because additional plancolombia funding had already been accommodated and was not part of the final fy2001debate , the $256 million has been removed from the president's fy2001 request .

i. ifad was funded in fy2000 , fy2001 request and the senate bill out of development assistanceand international organizations and programs accounts .

the house and fy2001 enacted billsestablished ifad as a separate account .

j .

for comparative purposes and to conform to the account structure enacted for fy2000 andfy2001 , unicef funds ( $110 million ) have been deducted here and added in the developmentaid subtotal in title ii .

the administration's $50 million fy2001 request for gavi has alsobeen shifted from here to title ii , as enacted .

k. pursuant to sequestration requirements in p.l .

106-113 , the amounts for fy2000 are reduced by$19 million .
