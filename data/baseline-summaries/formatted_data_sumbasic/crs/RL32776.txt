some observers have proposed procuring navy ships using funding approaches other than the traditional full funding approach that has been used to procure most navy ships since the 1950s .

these alternative funding approaches include incremental funding , which has been used to fund a few navy ships in recent years , and advance appropriations , which has not been used for navy ship procurement .

supporters of these alternative funding approaches believe they could increase stability in navy shipbuilding plans and perhaps increase the number of navy ships that could be built for a given total amount of ship - procurement funding .

the issue for congress is whether to maintain current practices for funding navy ship procurement or change them by , for example , increasing the use of incremental funding or starting to use advance appropriations .

congress's decision on this issue could be significant because the full funding policy relates to congress's power of the purse and its responsibility for conducting oversight of department of defense ( dod ) programs .

consequently , the issue can be alternately expressed as how to procure navy ships economically while maintaining key congressional prerogatives .

congress's decision on ship funding approaches could also affect future navy capabilities , annual navy funding requirements , and the shipbuilding industrial base .

portions of this report are adapted from another crs report that discusses the full funding policy in dod procurement generally .

options for congress that arise out of proposals to make greater use of incremental funding or begin using advance appropriations for procuring navy ships include ( but are not limited to ) the following: maintain current ship - procurement funding practices ; strengthen adherence to the full funding policy in ship procurement ; increase the use of incremental funding in ship procurement ; begin using advance appropriations in ship procurement ; and shift lead - ship detailed design / nonrecurring engineering ( dd / nre ) costs to the navy's research and development ( r&d account ) .

each of these is discussed below .

the house armed services committee , in its report ( h.rept .

110-146 of may 11 , 2007 ) on the fy2008 defense authorization bill ( h.r .

the senate armed services committee , in its report ( s.rept .

110-77 of june 5 , 2007 ) on the fy2008 defense authorization bill ( s. 1547 ) , approved the navy's fy2008 request for the second of two increments of procurement funding for the amphibious assault ship lha - 6 , the second of two increments of procurement funding for the first two ddg - 1000 destroyers , and ( with a recommended $20-million reduction ) the first of two increments of procurement funding for the aircraft carrier cvn - 78 .

109-364 ( fy2007 defense authorization act ) house in its report ( h.rept .

109-452 of may 5 , 2006 ) on h.r .

5122 , the house armed services committee recommended approval of the navy's proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring lha - 6 , but did not recommend approval of the navy's proposal to use split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the two lead ddg - 1000s .

the committee for fy2007 instead recommended full funding for one ddg - 1000 , and design funding for a second .

the committee's report states: the budget request recommends incremental funding for 3 of the 7 ships in the request , including for the first time construction of a surface combatant , the next - generation destroyer dd ( x ) .

furthermore , during the consideration of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 ( p.l .

109-163 ) , the navy sought and was granted the authority to use incremental funding for the next aircraft carrier [cvn - 78] , which will be recorded as procured in 2008 .

the committee remains concerned that the use of incremental funding is not a solution to the navy's problem in funding shipbuilding .

while incremental funding can allow the navy to smooth out the dramatic spikes in shipbuilding funding required as a result of aircraft carrier construction every four or five years , it does not fundamentally increase the number of ships that a given amount of money will purchase .

during the committee's hearings on shipbuilding , all witnesses emphasized the importance of program and funding stability as the top priority for reducing the cost of shipbuilding and sustaining the shipbuilding industrial base .

the committee notes that congress adopted the full funding policy in the 1950s in part because of a concern that incremental funding was detrimental to funding stability .

future congresses may find themselves unwilling , or unable , to fund completion of ships begun in prior years and only partially funded .

the committee remains convinced that the full funding policy is the correct policy for funding shipbuilding .

the committee understands that the department of defense this year considered submission of a legislative proposal that would permanently authorize the use of "split funding" for aircraft carriers and large deck amphibious ships , and the navy's fiscal year 2007 shipbuilding plan already assumes such authority for the second lha class amphibious assault ship .

the committee has approved the use of split funding for certain ships in certain cases .

however , the committee does not believe that a blanket policy supporting incremental funding for any class of ship is appropriate , and has not included such a provision in the bill .

 ( pages 68-69 ) senate section 121 of the senate version of the fy2007 defense authorization bill ( s. 2766 ) would authorize the use of four - year incremental funding for procuring cvn - 78 and future aircraft carriers , rather than split funding ( i.e. , two - year incremental funding ) as proposed by the navy .

under four - year incremental funding , the main portion of the procurement cost of cvn - 78 , for example , would be divided into four increments that would be provided in fy2008 , the ship's year of procurement , and the three following years .

section 121 would also authorize the navy to contract in fy2007 for the procurement long - lead items for cvn - 79 and cvn - 80 , aircraft carriers that the navy plans to procure in fy2012 and fy2016 , respectively .

this authority resembles an economic order quantity ( eoq ) arrangement , except that eoqs normally take place within the context of a multiyear procurement ( myp ) .

these ships have not been approved for myp , and under past practice would not qualify for it under the requirements set forth in the law governing myp arrangements .

myp arrangements are permitted to cover items to be procured over a period of up to five years , while the authority granted under section 121 would cover three ships that the navy wants to procure over a period of nine years ( fy2008-fy2016 ) .

in its report ( s.rept .

109-254 of may 9 , 2006 ) on s. 2766 , the senate armed services committee recommended approval of the navy's proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring lha - 6 and the two lead ddg - 1000s .

the report states: the committee recommends a provision that would authorize the secretary of the navy to incrementally fund procurement of cvn - 21 class aircraft carriers over four year periods , commencing with cvn - 78 procurement in fiscal year 2008 .

the budget request included $739.1 million in shipbuilding and conversion , navy ( scn ) for cvn - 78 advance procurement and $45.1 million in scn for cvn - 79 advance procurement .

the provision would also authorize advance procurement for cvn - 80 , commencing in fiscal year 2007 .

in reviewing the budget request for fiscal year 2006 , the committee received testimony from the navy and industry that the low rate of shipbuilding was driving higher costs , which in turn further reduced shipbuilding rates , creating a downward spiral .

the committee believes that stable ship requirements , increased funding in the shipbuilding budget , and increased flexibility for funding large capital ships are critical elements of any strategy to reverse this trend .

the secretary of the navy's fiscal year 2007 report to congress on the long - range plan for the construction of naval vessels identifies a requirement to procure the cvn - 21 class aircraft carriers at 4-year intervals , commencing in fiscal year 2008 .

the navy originally planned to procure the first cvn - 21 class aircraft carrier , cvn - 78 , in fiscal year 2006 .

since then , the navy has delayed procurement to 2008 , which has delayed fielding this vital capability , while significantly increasing the aircraft carrier's procurement cost .

the committee believes that procuring and delivering the cvn - 21 class aircraft carriers over 4-year periods in accordance with the navy's long - range plan is vital to the national defense strategy , and is vital to the affordability of these capital ships .

elsewhere in this report , the committee has expressed concern with cost growth on the cvn - 77 program , and has urged the navy and the shipbuilder to identify opportunities to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers .

procurement delays , excess inflation , and material escalation have been reported as significant contributors to cvn - 77 cost growth .

the shipbuilder has proposed to achieve significant cvn - 21 class program savings through a stable procurement plan , and through procurement of economic order quantity material for cvn - 79 and cvn - 80 in conjunction with cvn - 78 procurement .

in view of the potential for significant program savings , the committee recommends an increase of $50.0 million in scn for cvn - 21 class advance procurement , and directs the secretary of the navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the cvn - 21 class .

the secretary is to submit a report to the congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2008 budget request , outlining the advance procurement requirements to potentially optimize economic order quantity savings and escalation avoidance ( to include offsetting factors ) for the first three vessels of the cvn - 21 class .

of the amount authorized to be appropriated for advance procurement for cvn - 79 and cvn - 80 , none of the funds are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the secretary's report .

109-702 of september 29 , 2006 ) authorizes four - year incremental funding for the cvn - 21 class aircraft carriers cvn - 78 , cvn - 79 , and cvn - 80 .

section 124 authorizes the procurement of the first two ddg - 1000 destroyers in fy2007 using split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 , as requested by the navy .

the section states in part: ( c ) sense of congress on funding for follow - on ships. — it is the sense of congress that there is sufficient benefit to authorizing the one - time exception provided in this section to the full funding policy in order to support the competitive procurement of the follow - on ships of the ddg - 1000 next - generation destroyer program .

however , it is the expectation of congress that the secretary of the navy will structure the ddg - 1000 program so that each ship , after the first two ships , is procured using the method of full funding in a single year .

109-289 ( fy2007 defense appropriations act ) house in its report ( h.rept .

109-504 of june 16 , 2006 ) on h.r .

5631 , the house appropriations committee recommended approval of the administration's proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the amphibious assault ship lha - 6 , but did not recommend approval of the administration's proposal to use split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the two lead ddg - 1000 destroyers .

the committee for fy2007 instead recommended full funding for one ddg - 1000 .

the committee's report states: for fiscal year 2007 , the committee faces several challenges in recommending appropriations for the department of defense and the intelligence community .

first , the president's budget proposes an unorthodox approach to funding two major procurement programs , the f - 22 fighter of the air force and the dd ( x ) destroyer of the navy .

in both cases , the budget request includes incremental or partial funding , for these two programs .

in the case of the f - 22 , incremental funding is requested in the middle of the production run .

the use of incremental funding mortgages the future of the procurement budget of the defense department in a manner that is not acceptable to the committee .

in addition , the precedent of incremental funding for these programs could be applied to a variety of other procurements , leading to a loss of budget transparency and reducing the ability to perform oversight .

therefore , the recommendations in this bill include full funding for one dd ( x ) destroyer and the f - 22 fighter program .

funding of $2,568,111,000 is recommended to complete full funding of one dd ( x ) vessel .

this is the same level as the funding request for this item , but under the president's budget these funds would have been allocated on an incremental basis against two ships .

 ( page 4 ) the report also states: the committee recommends $2,568,111,000 for the procurement of 1 dd ( x ) destroyer .

the budget requested $2,568,111,000 to incrementally fund 2 ships , with the balance of funding to be provided in fiscal year 2008 .

the committee cannot support such a far - reaching policy change which has implications beyond the navy's shipbuilding program .

further , the navy's proposal requires special legislative authority to be executed , and this authority is not included in the house - passed national defense authorization act , 2007 ( h.r .

5122 ) .

 ( page 139 ) senate in its report ( s.rept .

109-292 of july 25 , 2006 ) on h.r .

5631 , the senate appropriations committee recommends approving the navy's request for fy2007 procurement funding for the first two ddg - 1000 destroyers .

the report states: consistent with the senate - passed authorization bill and the navy's current acquisition strategy , the committee recommendation supports the budget request of $2,568,111,000 for dual lead ships .

the committee reminds the navy that this is a unique acquisition strategy and should not be used as a precedent for incrementally funding any future ddg — 1000 or any other shipbuilding program .

 ( page 115 ) the report recommends funding the procurement of one littoral combat ship , or lcs ( rather than the requested two ) in fy2007 , and rescinding funding ( in section 8043 ) for one of the three lcss procured in fy2006 .

the report states: with the fiscal year 2007 budget submission of $520,670,000 for the fifth and sixth lcs flight 0 ships , the navy revealed the lcs unit cost estimate used as a basis for last year's appropriation was exclusive of contract change orders , planning and engineering services , program management support and other costs not included in the ship construction contract ... as a result , the navy is unable to procure both the third and fourth lcs flight 0 ships without the availability of additional funding .

the committee is troubled by this revelation and recommends rescinding the insufficient fiscal year 2006 funds currently allocated to the fourth lcs flight 0 vessel .

the committee is further troubled by reports that the first two lcs flight 0 ships under construction are exceeding their cost as previously budgeted.... as a result , the committee believes the fiscal year 2007 budget request is insufficient to procure two ships and recommends $300,670,000 to fully fund procurement of one lcs seaframe , which is a reduction of $220,000,000 and one seaframe from the request .

the committee notes that this recommendation puts the navy on its previously established path of procuring four lcs flight 0 ships by the end of fiscal year 2007 .

 ( pages 115-116 ) conference report the conference report on h.r .

5631 ( h.rept .

109-676 of september 25 , 2006 ) approves the navy's request for the initial ( fy2007 ) increment of procurement funding for the lha ( r ) amphibious assault ship , which the navy wants to procure in fy2007 using split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 .

the conference report approves the navy's request for the initial ( fy2007 ) increment of procurement funding for the first two ddg - 1000 destroyers , which the navy wants to procure in fy2007 using split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 .

the report states: the conferees agree to provide $2,568,111,000 for the ddg - 1000 ( formerly ddx ) destroyer program , and agree to delete language proposed by the house requiring full funding of a single lead ship .

the effect of the conference agreement would allow the navy to split fund twin lead ships of the ddg - 1000 class , if authorized in separate legislation by the congress .

this action is being taken based upon the expectation that the total cost of these two ships is well understood and low risk .

the conferees are willing to make this one - time exception to the full funding principle because of the unique situation with the shipbuilding industrial base and with the ddg — 1000 program .

the conferees will not entertain future requests to fund ships other than under the full funding principle , except for those historically funded in this manner ( aircraft carriers and some large deck amphibious ships ) .

the unusual procurement of twin lead ships raises the risk that future design changes or production problems will impact two ships under construction simultaneously .

this could raise costs significantly compared to other lead ship programs .

however , the navy believes the cost and schedule risk in the ddg - 1000 program is low enough to permit the twin lead ship acquisition strategy .

the navy has identified the total cost to procure the twin lead ships of the ddg — 1000 class as $6,582,200,000 .

the conferees insist that the navy manage this program within that total cost , and will be unlikely to increase funding through a reprogramming or an additional budget request except in the case of emergency , natural disaster , or other impact arising from outside the navy's shipbuilding program .

109-163 ( fy2006 defense authorization bill ) house in its report ( h.rept .

109-89 of may 20 , 2005 ) on h.r .

1815 , the house armed services committee states: [chief of naval operations] admiral [vernon] clark , in his posture statement before the house committee on appropriations , subcommittee on defense stated , "we need to partner with congress and industry to regain our buying power .

acquisition and budget reforms , such as multi - year procurement , economic order quantity , and other approaches help to stabilize the production path , and in our view , reduce the per unit cost of ships and increase our shipbuilding rate. .

the committee does not agree that creative financing methodologies that delay recognizing the true cost of shipbuilding or that provide ever - increasing amounts of funding to cover the explosion in ship costs are responsible actions .

incremental funding , advanced procurement , multiyear procurement , and various creative shipyard work allocation arrangements have failed to control the cost growth of vessel classes such as the virginia class submarine , the replacement amphibious assault ship ( lha ( r ) ) , the future major surface combatant ship ( dd ( x ) ) , and the future aircraft carrier cvn - 21 .

 ( page 63 ) section 1004 of the bill as reported by the committee states: senate section 122 of the fy2006 defense authorization bill ( s. 1042 ) as reported by the senate armed services committee ( s.rept .

109-69 of may 17 , 2005 ) would permit the aircraft carrier cvn - 78 to be procured with split funding ( i.e. , incremental funding ) during the period fy2007-fy2010 .

the section states: section 123 of the bill would permit an amphibious assault ship lha ( r ) to be procured with split funding ( i.e. , incremental funding ) in fy2007 and fy2008 .

the section would also permit fy2006 funding to be used for advance construction of the ship .

the section states: s.rept .

109-69 states: the cvn - 78 will be a new class of aircraft carrier , incorporating numerous new technologies .

this budget request reflects the second one - year slip in the program in recent years .

this slip would cause a delay in the delivery of the cvn - 78 until fiscal year 2015 , with the ship it is scheduled to replace , the uss enterprise ( cvn - 65 ) , scheduled to be decommissioned in fiscal year 2013 .

additionally , this slip translates into a cost growth for cvn - 78 of approximately $400.0 million , according to the navy .

the committee is concerned about this delay .

the committee has been told there is no technical reason for the delay , but that the delay was driven by budget considerations .

both the secretary of the navy and the chief of naval operations testified that large capital assets such as aircraft carriers are difficult to fund under the traditional full - funding policy , and that more flexible methods of funding must be found and used .

the program of record for cvn - 78 has the detail design and construction funding split between two years .

this provision would authorize that same funding to be split over four years , thereby allowing needed funding flexibility .

the committee directs the navy to provide an updated funding profile , fully funding the remaining costs of the ship from fiscal years 2007 through 2010 , with delivery of the fiscal year 2007 budget request .

 ( page 146 ) senate in its report ( s.rept .

109-141 of september 29 , 2005 ) on h.r .

2863 , the senate appropriations committee stated: the committee remains gravely concerned about the overall health and stability of navy shipbuilding .

fleet inventory and capability requirements remain unstable as do program performance and costs .

of primary concern are soaring cost overruns .

the committee finds unanticipated cost overruns to be the root cause of much of the instability in the program .

until budget estimates become more realistic , requirements stabilize and penalties for exorbitant cost overruns are exercised , ship construction costs are unlikely to improve .

the committee is aware that the new chief of naval operations [cno] is actively reviewing shipbuilding programs and is considering several options for controlling long - term costs .

in an effort to assist the navy in the short - term , the committee recommends providing the navy financial management authorities that have previously been denied .

for fiscal year 2006 , the committee recommends providing the navy additional reprogramming authority .

this authority allows the navy , through above threshold reprogramming procedures , to increase funding for programs experiencing unforeseen shortfalls .

the committee understands that in fiscal year 2005 after exhausting the $100,000,000 of the transfer authority the congress provided , the navy sought to use dollars specifically appropriated for outfitting and post delivery to address funding shortfalls .

the committee is concerned about this change in navy policy as it will only further obscure actual program costs .

the new reprogramming authority is provided only with the understanding that this change will not be implemented in the future .

the additional reprogramming authority essentially provides the navy a reactive mechanism or approach to cost management .

the committee believes the situation requires more proactive program , budgetary and contract management and encourages the department of defense to consider whether using advance appropriations in future budgets will improve the shipbuilding program .

 ( page 126 ) the committee also stated: the fiscal year 2006 president's budget requests $225,427,000 for [the]ddg - 51 [destroyer program] for what the navy describes as "program completion requirements and shutdown costs. .

these funds are requested for a mix of class and ship specific plan , basic construction , ordnance , certification , and inspection costs .

such costs are traditionally included in the budget request for each ship .

however , when signing the multiyear contract for the construction of the final ddgs of the class , the department decided to change its policy and budget for these costs after the last ship was appropriated .

the committee finds this decision troubling .

first , budgeting for such costs after procurement of the last vessel obscures the actual cost to procure each ship and overstates savings attributable to the multiyear contract authority under which these ships were purchased .

the congress approved the navy's request for multiyear procurement authority in fiscal year 2002 assuming a level of savings to the taxpayer that are now not being realized .

most disconcerting about this change in policy and resultant budget request is the navy's assertion that if these costs are not funded , the navy will not be able to meet its contractual obligations and the chief of naval operations will not be able to accept delivery of these ships .

the committee is alarmed that the navy would knowingly sign a multibillion dollar contract for ships that would be both non - operational and undeliverable unless additional dollars , outside the contract , were provided .

the committee directs the secretary of the navy to provide a detailed report of all the costs required to complete each of the remaining 11 ships and a rationale for such a contractual arrangement by december 1 , 2005 .

until sufficient explanation is provided , the committee recommends only providing funds for plans and those costs directly attributable to ships scheduled to deliver in the near - term .

as such the committee recommends reducing the budget request by $195,654,000 .

appendix c. recent ships procured with incremental funding this appendix discusses navy and dod ships that have been procured in recent years or are currently being procured using incremental funding .

dod lmsr - type sealift ships as part of its action on the fy1993 defense budget , congress created the national defense sealift fund ( ndsf ) — a revolving fund in the dod budget for the procurement , operation , and maintenance of dod - owned sealift ships — and transferred procurement of new military sealift ships and certain navy auxiliary ships from the shipbuilding and conversion , navy ( scn ) appropriation account , where they traditionally had been procured , to the ndsf .

since the ndsf is outside the procurement title of the defense appropriation act , sealift ships procured since fy1993 , including dod's large , medium - speed , roll - on / roll - off ( lmsr ) ships ( as well as navy lewis and clark ( take - 1 ) dry cargo ships procured since fy2003 ) have not been subject to the full funding policy as traditionally applied to dod procurement programs .

as discussed in a 1996 crs report , although individual lmsrs were ostensibly fully funded each year by congress , like ships procured in the scn account , dod in some cases actually applied lmsr funding provided in a given year to partially finance the construction of lmsrs authorized in various years .

for example , although congress ostensibly approved $546.4 million in fy1995 for the procurement of two lmsrs , the fy1995 funds were actually applied to help finance portions of 16 lmsrs whose construction contracts were awarded between fy1993 and fy1997 .

in explaining its use of funds in the lmsr program , dod stated: the national defense sealift fund ( ndsf ) is not a procurement appropriation but a revolving fund .

dollars appropriated by congress for the fund are not appropriated to purchase specific hulls as in the case of , for example the navy's ddg - 51 program .

rather , dollars made available to the ndsf are executed on an oldest money first basis .

therefore , full funding provisions as normally understood for ship acquisition do not apply .

ssn - 23 attack submarine the jimmy carter ( ssn - 23 ) , the third and final seawolf ( ssn - 21 ) class attack submarine , was originally procured in the fy1992 defense budget , which congress passed in 1991 .

in early 1992 , the george h. w. bush administration terminated procurement of further seawolf - class submarines and proposed rescinding funds for both the second seawolf - class boat ( ssn - 22 , which had been procured in fy1991 ) and ssn - 23 .

in acting on this proposal , congress rejected the request to rescind funding for ssn - 22 ( i.e. , congress affirmed the procurement of ssn - 22 ) , effectively suspended the procurement of ssn - 23 , and gave the secretary of the navy the choice of whether to reinstate procurement of ssn - 23 .

in 1993 , as part of its bottom - up review ( bur ) of u.s. defense policy and programs , the clinton administration decided to reinstate procurement of ssn - 23 in fy1995 or fy1996 ( it later settled on fy1996 ) .

by this point , $382.4 million had already been obligated and expended on ssn - 23 .

congress's action on the 1992 rescission proposal also made an additional $540.2 million in funding available for obligation to ssn - 23 .

as a consequence , completing the approximate $2.4 billion cost of ssn - 23 would require about $1.5 billion in additional funding .

the administration requested $1,507.5 million in fy1996 to complete the cost of ssn - 23 .

congress approved the procurement of ssn - 23 in fy1996 , but provided only $700 million in procurement funding , leaving about $807.5 million to complete the cost of the ship .

rather than requesting all $807.5 million or so in fy1997 , the administration requested $699.1 million in fy1997 for ssn - 23 and deferred the final $105 million or so needed to complete the cost of the ship ( as adjusted ) to fy1998 .

congress , as part of its action on the fy1996 defense budget , approved $649.1 million ( rather than $699.1 million ) for ssn - 23 , leaving about $155 million to complete the cost of the ship .

the administration requested $153.4 million in fy1998 to complete the cost of ssn - 23 ( as adjusted ) ; congress approved this amount .

thus , of the approximately $2.4 billion cost of ssn - 23 as then estimated , a total of $802.5 million — about one - third of the total estimated cost of the ship — was appropriated by congress in the two years ( fy1997 and fy1998 ) following the year ( fy1996 ) in which ssn - 23 was ( for a second time ) procured .

during the conference , however , competition among various programs for defense funding resulted in an agreement in which lhd - 6 was approved for procurement in fy1993 but only $305 million in fy1993 funding was provided .

the conference report on the bill stated: the conferees agree to provide $305,000,000 in funds to initiate the purchase of one lhd - 1 class amphibious assault ship .

the conferees have provided authority for the navy secretary to enter into a contract for this ship even though full funding has not yet been provided to the navy .

the conferees request that the navy award a contract for the construction of this vessel and include the additional funds required for this program in its fiscal year 1994 budget request .

the $893.8 million needed to complete the funding of the ship ( as adjusted ) was requested by the administration in fy1994 and approved by congress .

thus , lhd - 6 was split - funded , with about three - quarters of the cost of lhd - 6 provided the year after the ship's year of procurement .
