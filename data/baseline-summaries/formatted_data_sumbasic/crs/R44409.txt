the annual cjs appropriations act provides funding for the departments of commerce and justice , the science agencies , and several related agencies .

appropriations for the department of commerce include funding for agencies such as the census bureau , the u.s. patent and trademark office , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , and the national institute of standards and technology .

appropriations for the department of justice ( doj ) provide funding for agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation ; the bureau of prisons ; the u.s .

marshals ; the drug enforcement administration ; and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives , along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state , local , and tribal governments .

the vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .

the annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the legal services corporation and the equal employment opportunity commission .

 figure 1 shows the total appropriations , in both nominal and inflation - adjusted dollars , for cjs for fy2007-fy2016 ( more detailed historical appropriations data can be found in table 2 ) .

the data show that nominal appropriations for cjs increased between fy2007 and fy2010 .

appropriations for cjs peaked in fy2009 at $76.782 billion if emergency supplemental appropriations from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) are included .

if arra funding is not considered , appropriations peaked in fy2010 at $69.146 billion .

arra provided a substantial increase in appropriations for fy2009 .

the $15.992 billion congress appropriated for cjs under arra was equal to approximately 25% of the amount congress provided for cjs through regular appropriations .

appropriations for cjs decreased from fy2010 to fy2013 .

nominal appropriations for cjs were relatively flat in fy2014 and fy2015 , though appropriations in both fy2014 and fy2015 were higher than they were in fy2013 .

if not for sequestration , which cut nearly $4 billion out of the total amount congress appropriated for cjs for fy2013 , funding for cjs would have held steady at approximately $61 billion between fy2011 and fy2015 .

cjs appropriations increased by approximately $4 billion in fy2016 , largely due to the fact that congress increased the discretionary budget cap when it passed , and the president signed , the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-74 ) .

figure 2 shows total appropriations for cjs for fy2007-fy2016 by major component ( i.e. , the departments of commerce and justice , nasa , and the nsf ) .

the data indicate that the increases in cjs appropriations in fy2009 ( not including arra funding ) and fy2010 resulted from congress appropriating more funding for the department of commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census .

although decreased appropriations for the department of commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in cjs appropriations between fy2010 and fy2013 ( a 47.4% reduction ) , cuts in funding for doj ( - 8.7% ) and nasa ( - 9.8% ) also contributed to the decrease .

however , despite the reductions in funding for doj and nasa during these fiscal years , their appropriation in fy2013 , even after sequestration , was greater in nominal terms than their appropriation in fy2007 .

appropriations for both the departments of commerce and justice and nasa have generally increased in the three fiscal years since fy2013 .

nominal funding for the nsf has , for the most part , steadily increased over the past 10 fiscal years .

the nsf's appropriation increased in seven of the ten fiscal years from fy2007 to fy2016 .

the decrease in the nsf's funding for fy2013 was the result of sequestration .

increased appropriations for the nsf have mostly resulted from congress increasing funding for the nsf's research and related activities account .
