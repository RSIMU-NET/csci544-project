this report provides an overview of the development of the process for appointing the director of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , briefly discusses the history of nominations to this position from 1973 through 2017 , and identifies related congressional hearing records and reports .

federal statute provides that the director of the fbi is to be appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate .

when there is a vacancy or an anticipated vacancy , the president begins the appointment process by selecting and vetting his preferred candidate for the position .

the vetting process for presidential appointments includes an fbi background check and financial disclosure .

the president then submits the nomination to the senate , where it is referred to the committee on the judiciary .

the committee on the judiciary usually holds hearings on a nomination for the fbi director .

the committee may then vote to report the nomination back to the senate favorably , unfavorably , or without recommendation .

once reported , the nomination is available for senate consideration .

if the senate confirms the nomination , the individual is formally appointed to the position by the president .

prior to the implementation of the current nomination and confirmation process , j. edgar hoover was director of the fbi for nearly 48 years .

he held the position from may 10 , 1924 , until his death on may 2 , 1972 .

the current process dates from 1968 , when the fbi director was first established as a presidentially appointed position requiring senate confirmation in an amendment to the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 .

the proposal for a presidentially appointed director had been introduced and passed in the senate twice previously , but had never made it through the house .

floor debate in the senate focused on the inevitable end of hoover's tenure ( due to his advanced age ) , the vast expansion of the fbi's size and role under his direction , and the need for congress to strengthen its oversight role in the wake of his departure .

in 1976 , the 10-year limit for any one incumbent was added as part of the crime control act of 1976 .

this provision also prohibits the reappointment of an incumbent .

as with the previous measure , the senate had introduced and passed this provision twice previously , but it had failed to pass the house .

from 1973 through 2017 , eight nominations for fbi director were confirmed , and two other nominations were withdrawn .

due to a 2011 statute allowing for the reappointment of a specific incumbent , two of the eight confirmed nominations were of the same person , robert s. mueller iii .

each of these nominations is shown in table 1 and discussed below .

l. patrick gray iii .

on the day after the death of long - time director j. edgar hoover , l. patrick gray was appointed acting director .

president richard m. nixon nominated gray to be director on february 21 , 1973 .

over the course of nine days , the senate committee on the judiciary held hearings on the nomination .

although gray's nomination was supported by some in the senate , his nomination ran into trouble during the hearings as other senators expressed concern about partisanship , lack of independence from the white house , and poor handling of the watergate investigation .

the president withdrew the nomination on april 17 , and gray resigned as acting director on april 27 , 1973 .

clarence m. kelley .

clarence m. kelley was the first individual to become fbi director through the nomination and confirmation process .

a native of missouri , kelley was a 21-year veteran of the fbi , becoming chief of the memphis field office .

he was serving as kansas city police chief when president nixon nominated him on june 8 , 1973 .

during the three days of confirmation hearings , senators appeared satisfied that kelley would maintain nonpartisan independence from the white house and be responsive to their concerns .

the senate committee on the judiciary approved the nomination unanimously the following day .

he was sworn in by the president on july 9 , 1973 .

kelly remained fbi director until his retirement on february 23 , 1978 .

frank m. johnson jr. with the anticipated retirement of clarence kelley , president jimmy carter nominated u.s. district court judge frank m. johnson jr. of alabama , on september 30 , 1977 .

johnson faced serious health problems around the time of his nomination , however , and the president withdrew the nomination on december 15 , 1977 .

william h. webster .

in the aftermath of the withdrawn johnson nomination , president carter nominated u.s. court of appeals judge william h. webster to be director on january 20 , 1978 .

prior to his service on the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit , webster had been u.s. attorney and then u.s. district court judge for the eastern district of missouri .

after two days of hearings , the senate committee on the judiciary unanimously approved the nomination and reported it to the senate .

the senate confirmed the nomination on february 9 , 1978 , and webster was sworn in on february 23 , 1978 .

he served as director of the fbi until he was appointed as director of the central intelligence agency ( cia ) in may 1987 .

william s. sessions .

on september 9 , 1987 , president ronald w. reagan nominated william s. sessions , chief judge of the u.s. district court of western texas , to replace webster .

prior to his service on the bench , sessions had worked as chief of the government operations section of the criminal division of the department of justice and as u.s. attorney for the western district of texas .

following a one - day hearing , the senate committee on the judiciary unanimously recommended confirmation .

the senate confirmed the nomination , without opposition , on september 25 , and sessions was sworn in on november 2 , 1987 .

sessions was the first of two fbi directors to be removed from office .

president william j. clinton removed sessions from office on july 19 , 1993 , citing "serious questions ... about the conduct and the leadership of the director," and a report on "certain conduct" issued by the office of professional responsibility at the department of justice .

some members of congress questioned the dismissal , but they did not prevent the immediate confirmation of sessions's successor .

louis j. freeh .

president clinton nominated former fbi agent , federal prosecutor , and u.s. district court judge louis j. freeh of new york as fbi director on july 20 , 1993 , the day following sessions's removal .

the senate committee on the judiciary held one day of hearings and approved the nomination .

the nomination was reported to the full senate on august 3 , and freeh was confirmed on august 6 , 1993 .

he was sworn in on september 1 , 1993 , and served until his voluntary resignation , which became effective june 25 , 2001 .

robert s. mueller iii .

on july 18 , 2001 , president george w. bush nominated robert s. mueller iii to succeed freeh .

the senate committee on the judiciary held two days of hearings , and the nomination was reported on august 2 , 2001 .

the nomination was confirmed by the senate on the same day by a vote of 98-0 .

mueller had served as the u.s. attorney for the northern district of california in san francisco , and as the acting deputy u.s. attorney general from january through may 2001 .

the former marine had also been u.s. attorney for massachusetts and served as a homicide prosecutor for the district of columbia .

under president george bush , mueller was in charge of the department of justice's criminal division during the investigation of the bombing of pan am flight 103 and the prosecution of panamanian leader manuel noriega .

from 1973 through 2016 , mueller was the only fbi director to be appointed to more than one term .

p.l .

112-24 , enacted on july 26 , 2011 , allowed the incumbent director to be nominated for , and appointed to , an additional two - year term .

after the bill was signed , mueller was nominated for this second term by president barack obama , and he was confirmed the following day by a vote of 100-0 .

mueller's two - year term expired on september 4 , 2013 .

james b. comey jr. as mueller's unique two - year term drew to a close , president obama nominated james b. comey jr. to succeed him .

comey had previously served as u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york , from january 2002 to december 2003 , and as deputy attorney general , from december 2003 to august 2005 .

the president submitted comey's nomination on june 21 , 2013 .

the senate committee on the judiciary held a hearing on the nomination on july 9 and voted unanimously to report the nomination favorably to the full senate on july 18 .

the senate confirmed the nomination by a vote of 93-1 on july 29 .

comey began his term of office on september 4 , 2013 .

comey was removed from office by president donald j. trump on may 9 , 2017 .

christopher a. wray .

seven weeks after comey was removed from office , president trump nominated christopher a. wray to succeed him .

from 1997 until 2005 , wray served in several leadership positions at the department of justice , including principal associate deputy attorney general and assistant attorney general for the criminal division .

he later worked in private practice at a law firm .

the president submitted wray's nomination on june 26 , 2017 .

the senate committee on the judiciary held a hearing on the nomination on july 12 and voted unanimously to report the nomination favorably to the full senate on july 20 .
