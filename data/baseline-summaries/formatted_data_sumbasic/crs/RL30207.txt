status of energy and water appropriations,fy200 .

the energy and water development appropriations bill includes funding for civil projects of the army corpsof engineers , the department of the interior'sbureau of reclamation , most of the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , includingthe tennessee valley authority ( tva ) andthe nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) .

the administration requested $22 billion for these programs forfy2000 , compared with $21.2 billion appropriatedfor fy1999 .

as with other fy2000 appropriations bills , the energy and water subcommittees had difficulty meeting the spending allocations assigned them under section 302 ( b ) of the budget act .

for the corps of engineers , the administration requested $3.9 billion in fy2000 , about the same as appropriated in fy1999 .

the senate bill , s. 1186 , would have reduced this figure to $3.76 billion , with most of the reductions in the construction budget .

thehouse bill ( h.r .

2605 ) recommended raising the corps appropriation to $4.19 billion .

the bureau of reclamation would have receivedan increase of more than 10% ( excluding offsets ) ,to $857 million .

the senate bill would have reduced this to $761 million , below the fy1999 level .

the houserecommendation was $785 million .

the houseand senate conference settled on $4.14 billion for the corps of engineers and $769.3 million for the bureau ofreclamation .

doe programs funded by the senate bill would have risen about 4% to $17.1 billion , about what the administration requested .

the major activities in the doebudget are research and development on energy and general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weaponsprograms .

the house would have reducedfunding for these programs to $15.6 billion , with most of the cuts coming in the cleanup and weapons programs .

the house and senate conference agreed tofund doe programs at $16.6 billion .

the remaining $1.2 billion of doe's fy2000 net appropriations request ( forfossil fuels programs , energy efficiency , andenergy statistics ) is included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .
