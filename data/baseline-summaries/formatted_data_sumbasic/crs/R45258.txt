the fy2019 budget request proposed substantial reductions from the fy2018 level for doe energy research and development ( r&d ) programs , including a cut of $1.320 billion ( 65.5% ) in energy efficiency and renewable energy , $224.7 million ( 30.9% ) in fossil fuels , and $448.0 million ( 37.2% ) in nuclear energy .

doe science programs would have been cut by $868.9 million ( 13.9% ) .

programs targeted by the budget for elimination or phaseout included energy efficiency grants , the advanced research projects agency — energy ( arpa - e ) , loan guarantee programs , and arc .

funding would have been reduced for the corps by $2.042 billion ( 29.9% ) , and reclamation and cup by $423.0 million ( 28.6% ) .

the house appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2019 energy and water development appropriations bill ( h.r .

5895 was subsequently combined into a "minibus" with the fy2019 legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bills and passed the house 235-179 on june 8 , 2018 .

the energy and water development division of the house - passed bill ( division a ) had total funding of $44.751 billion without scorekeeping adjustments — $1.533 billion above the fy2018 enacted level and $8.411 billion above the administration request .

the house - passed bill would have provided more than the administration's proposed funding increase for doe weapons activities , funding for yucca mountain , and continued funding for doe's loan programs and energy efficiency grants .

most of the administration's proposed reductions in r&d on energy efficiency and renewable , nuclear , and fossil energy were not agreed to by the house .

the senate appropriations committee approved its version of the energy and water development appropriations bill ( s. 2975 ) on may 24 , 2018 .

the senate passed h.r .

5895 on june 25 , 2018 , after substituting the text of s. 2975 in division a , with total funding of $43.872 billion — $653 million above fy2018 and $7.531 billion above the administration request , before rescissions and offsets .

the senate - passed version of the bill would have increased funding for doe's weapons activities , established a pilot interim storage facility for nuclear waste , provided nearly level funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy r&d , and continued the title 17 loan guarantee program .

the senate bill did not eliminate arpa - e , instead providing an increase from the fy2018 enacted level .

the final energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act , 2019 ( division a of p.l .

115-244 ) increases corps funding by $171.5 million ( 3% ) over the fy2018 enacted level ( excluding supplemental appropriations ) , reclamation and cup by $85 million ( 6% ) , and doe by $1.139 billion ( 3% ) .

the administration's proposals to eliminate energy efficiency grants , arpa - e , and loan guarantee programs were not adopted .

the enacted measure did not provide funding for the yucca mountain nuclear waste project .

funding for doe nuclear weapons activities was increased by $457.9 million ( 4.3% ) over the fy2018 level .

several issues generated controversy during congressional consideration of energy and water development appropriations for fy2019 .

the issues described in this section — listed approximately in the order the affected agencies appear in the energy and water development bill — were selected based on the total funding involved and the percentage of proposed increases or decreases , the amount of congressional attention received , and potential impact on broader public policy considerations .

 table 1 indicates the steps taken during consideration of fy2019 energy and water development appropriations .

 ( for more details , see the crs appropriations status table at http: / / www.crs.gov / appropriationsstatustable / index . ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2010 through fy2019 .

the annual energy and water development appropriations bill includes four titles: title i — corps of engineers — civil ; title ii — department of the interior ( central utah project and bureau of reclamation ) ; title iii — department of energy ; and title iv — independent agencies , as shown in table 3 .

major programs in the bill are described in this section in the approximate order they appear in the bill .

previous appropriations and recommendations for fy2019 are shown in the accompanying tables , and additional details about many of these programs are provided in separate crs reports as indicated .

for a discussion of current funding issues related to these programs , see " funding issues and initiatives ," above .

independent agencies that receive funding in title iv of the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the defense nuclear facilities safety board .

nrc is by far the largest of the independent agencies , with a total budget of more than $900 million .

however , as noted in the description of nrc below , about 90% of nrc's budget is offset by fees , so that the agency's net appropriation is less than half of the total funding in title iv .

the recent appropriations history for all the title iv agencies is shown in table 7 .

the following hearings were held by the energy and water development subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees on the fy2019 budget request .

testimony and opening statements are posted on most of the web pages cited for each hearing , along with webcasts in many cases .
