president george w. bush signed the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ; p.l .

109-435 ; 120 stat .

3198 ) on december 20 , 2006 .

the paea was the first broad revision of the 1970 statute that replaced the u.s. post office , a federal agency dependent upon appropriations , with the u.s .

postal service ( usps ) , a self - supporting , independent agency of the executive branch .

the usps is expected to operate like a business , but it must do so within various statutory confines and serve various public purposes .

the 112 th congress is considering additional major postal reforms , including reductions in service , expansion of the usps's authority to provide products and services , and alterations to the postal employees pension and healthcare plans .

the proximate cause for the recent efforts at postal reform is the usps's troubled financial condition .

after running modest profits from fy2004 through fy2006 , the usps lost $25.4 billion between fy2007 and fy2011 .

were it not for congressional action to reduce a statutorily required payment to the usps's retirees health benefits fund ( rhbf ) , the usps would have lost an additional $9.5 billion .

the current year has brought further losses .

in the first half of fy2012 , the usps had an operating loss of $6.4 billion , which included a $6.1 billion charge for payments due to the rhbf in fy2012 .

as the usps's finances have deteriorated , its ability to absorb operating losses has been diminished .

since fy2005 , the usps's debt has risen to $13 billion from $0 , $2 billion below its maximum statutory borrowing authority ( 39 u.s.c .

2005 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( c ) ) .

the usps is due to pay $11.1 billion to its rhbf before the end of fy2012 .

the agency does not have sufficient cash to make those payments .

at the conclusion of the second quarter of fy2012 , the usps had $818 million in cash , which is a low level for an agency with an average weekly operating expense of nearly $1.4 billion .

according to one media report , the usps may exhaust its cash in october 2012 .

however , the usps has not suggested that a short - term , zero - cash scenario would produce a suspension of operations this autumn .

postmaster general patrick donahoe stated in an interview that the usps could preserve sufficient cash to maintain operations until "late next year," although he did not clarify whether he was referring to calendar or fiscal year 2013 .

the usps's recent deficits are the product of the significant decline in revenue , caused by declining mail volume , and rising costs .

in the past five years , revenues have fallen 12.2% , to $65.7 billion from $74.8 billion .

 ( see figure 1 . ) .

this is the result of mail volume falling 20.9% , to 167.9 billion pieces ( fy2011 ) from 212.2 billion pieces ( fy2007 ) .

concurrently , the usps's operating expenses have declined but nonetheless exceed the agency's revenues .

 ( see figure 2 . ) .

these deficits are particularly problematic because congress designed the usps to be self - supporting ( p.l .

91-375 ; 84 stat .

725 ) .

most federal agencies rely on annual appropriations ; since 1971 , the usps has largely covered its expenses through the sales of postal services .

the usps , an "independent agency of the executive branch," does go through the appropriations process each year .

however , the approximately $100 million it receives in annual appropriations is only to reimburse the usps for the costs it bears to provide free mailing privileges to blind persons and overseas voters .

to help stem its losses , the usps has taken a number of steps .

foremost , the postal service has downsized its workforce through attrition .

since fy2006 , the number of career postal workers has shrunk 21.9% , to about 544,000 from 696,138 .

the agency also has increased its productivity and reduced its workhours ( eg , the hours employees spend on the job ) , even though the number of usps delivery points has grown .

 ( see table 1 . ) .

the agency has moved , albeit haltingly , to close post offices and reduce their operating hours .

it also may shutter 146 mail processing plants by early 2013 .

the postal service has proposed to further reduce its operating costs by eliminating "the expectation of overnight service for significant portions of first - class mail and periodicals. .

these proposals have been criticized and it is unclear whether they will proceed further .

however , the usps has stated that it cannot rectify its financial problems without congressional assistance .

the agency has requested congress to abolish the annual rhbf payment ; permit the usps to move its workforce off the federal employee health benefits program ( fehb ) ; recalculate the usps's contributions to the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) and refund to the usps $75 billion ; recalculate the usps's contributions to the federal employees retirement system ( fers ) and refund to the usps $12 billion ; authorize the usps to override collective bargaining prohibitions on layoffs so as to enable the usps to eliminate an additional 120,000 positions by fy2015 ; require arbitrators during collective bargaining between the usps and postal unions to consider the financial condition of the usps when rendering a decision ; permit the usps to reduce mail delivery to five days per week ; increase the usps's authority to raise its prices ; and allow the usps to offer a wider range of products and services .

numerous postal reform bills have been introduced in the 112 th congress .

of these , h.r .

2309 and s. 1789 have progressed the furthest toward enactment .

representative darrell e. issa , chair of the house oversight and government reform committee ( h - ogr ) , introduced h.r .

2309 , the postal reform act of 2011 , on june 23 , 2011 .

h - ogr reported h.r .

2309 with amendments on january 17 , 2012 ( h.rept .

112-363 , part 1 ) .

the house rules committee reported h.r .

2309 on march 29 , 2012 ( h.rept .

112-363 , part 2 ) .

the full house may consider the bill in july or august of 2012 .

senator joseph i. lieberman , chair of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee , introduced s. 1789 , the 21 st century postal service act of 2012 , on november 11 , 2011 .

the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee reported the bill with amendments on january 26 , 2012 ( s.rept .

112-143 ) .

the senate passed s. 1789 amended by a vote of 62-37 on april 25 , 2012 .

as noted earlier , the usps's financial condition is troubled .

the agency has asked congress to enact a variety of reforms to improve the usps's financial condition .

table 2 shows that h.r .

2309 and s. 1789 incorporate some of the usps's proposals .

at present , the usps appears to be suffering from both a short - term liquidity crisis ( i.e. , dwindling cash and borrowing authority ) and a long - term structural deficit ( i.e. , stagnating revenues and rising overhead costs ) .

assuming congress wants to maintain the present usps model â€” addressing these financial challenges will require ( 1 ) improving the usps's liquidity immediately ; ( 2 ) fortifying usps's long - term revenues ; and ( 3 ) controlling the growth of usps's long - term costs , all while ( 4 ) having usps continue to provide universal postal service to the public .

table 3 maps these four major objectives to the relevant major provisions of h.r .

2309 and s. 1789 .

as table 3 indicates , both h.r .

2309 and s. 1789 contain provisions intended to make progress toward each of these four goals .

liquidity: h.r .

2309 would provide more immediate liquidity to the usps than s. 1789 , as s. 1789 would require the usps to use some of the fers refund for buyouts .

long - term revenues: s. 1789 advances two proposals to incrementally improve the usps's long - term revenues while h.r .

2309 provides one .

long - term costs: h.r .

2309 would attempt to achieve major cost reductions by authorizing the usps to cut 12 delivery days , mandating postal facility closures to save $3 billion annually , and enacting changes to curb employee compensation growth .

however , h.r .

2309 would not greatly alter the rhbf payment schedule , which the usps has found onerous .

s. 1789 would attempt to control long - term cost growth by reducing the usps's annual rhbf outlays over a 10-year period , shrinking the usps's employee cohort through buyouts , and cutting workers' compensation costs .

universal service: h.r .

2309 would allow usps to deliver 12 fewer days per year and would close many post offices .

s. 1789 would keep six - day delivery , forbid post office closures in the short - term , and prohibit the usps from reducing mail delivery speeds .

in summation , both bills look to reduce the usps's operating costs by reducing its employment costs .

 ( approximately 77% of the usps's operating costs are employee compensation. ) .

and it would appear that h.r .

2309 would attempt to improve the usps's short - term and long - term financial condition by enacting policies to more immediately reduce the usps's major cost drivers ( eg , six - day mail and facilities ) , whereas s. 1789 proposes more incremental cost - cutting reforms as it preserves the present levels of postal services .
