several issues were identified during the current debate over ntsb reauthorization the central issue during this reauthorization cycle was the adequacy of the ntsb's staff size .

the ntsb requested a staff increase of roughly 22% starting in fy2008 , an increase it believes is necessary to adequately carry out its mission .

other issues considered during the ntsb reauthorization process included the mission , operations , and funding of the ntsb academy ; relief from certain contracting requirements for investigation - related services ; the designation of various reimbursements to the ntsb as offsetting collections ; and payment for department of transportation inspector general investigations and audits of the ntsb .

besides the issues specifically identified during the ntsb reauthorization debate , two other prominent , and related , issues involving the ntsb may come under congressional scrutiny .

first , some have expressed concerns over possible industry stakeholder lobbying of ntsb officials in attempts to influence the scope or language of ntsb investigative findings .

second , concerns have also been raised about the ntsb's heavy reliance on experts from transportation entities with a vested interest in the outcome of an investigation , such as airlines and aircraft manufacturers , for fact gathering and data analysis .

some experts argue that the ntsb should instead create stronger ties with government laboratories and academic institutions for expertise to lessen the chances that bias , or the perception of bias , could creep into the accident investigation process .

these issues were not specifically addressed in reauthorization legislation .

the ntsb reauthorization act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-443 ) also served as a vehicle for enacting other transportation - safety related legislation outside the jurisdiction of the ntsb .

these include a mandate for the faa to complete a safety review examining runway safety area alternatives at juneau international airport , juneau , alaska ; a provision directing the dot inspector general , in cooperation with the department of justice and the attorney general of massachusetts , to conduct investigations of criminal and fraudulent activities related to the construction of the boston central artery tunnel project ; a provision directing the dot inspector general to provide oversight to the project - wide safety review of the boston central artery tunnel that was initiated in response to the july 10 , 2006 collapse of a section of the tunnel's roof resulting in a fatality to a motor vehicle occupant ; and a provision requiring the dot inspector general to provide periodic reports to congress regarding the findings of its oversight , audits , and investigations of the boston central artery tunnel project .
