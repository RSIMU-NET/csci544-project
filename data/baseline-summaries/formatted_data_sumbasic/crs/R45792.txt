both legislators and regulators have expressed concern about the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs prescribed for "off - label uses"âpurposes other than those for which the food and drug administration ( fda ) has approved their sale .

two recent incidents illustrate the bases for those concerns .

the first involves a drug already on the market .

safety experts raised concerns about ketamine , a drug available as an injectable anesthetic .

they noted that physicians have created outpatient clinics to administer intravenous ketamine in an off - label use to treat depression and migraines .

fda has not reviewed clinical data that could support the clinics' promotional claims of safety and effectiveness .

in august 2018 , a second incident occurred in a texas courtroom .

astra zeneca settled a case concerning its alleged promotion of seroquel for uses other than those for which it had sought and obtained fda approval for sale in the united states .

the core of the complaint by the state of texas was that the company promoted the drug's use in children , although the fda - approved labeling of the drug was for adult use .

it was one of a number of settlements since 2000 resulting in payments by drug companies for the promotion of off - label uses .

to help understand the issues involving off - label use , and how these issues might concern congress , this report addresses five questions: what is drug labeling ? .

what is off - label use ? .

how are off - label prescriptions used in medicine today ? .

what are the risks and benefits associated with off - label prescriptions ? .

what concerns , if any , does congress have about such prescriptions ? .

if congress wanted to do something about off - label prescriptions , what would be some of the options ? .

to market a prescription drug in the united states , a manufacturer needs fda approval .

to obtain that approval , the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations .

it must also ensure that its manufacturing plant passes fda inspection .

finally , it must obtain fda approval for the drug's labelingâa term that covers all written material about the drug , including , for example , packaging , prescribing information for physicians , and patient brochures .

fda , thus , approves the drug and its labeling for a specific use .

that use specifies the disease or condition , the population , and the way the drug is packaged and administered .

when a physician prescribes a drug for reasons other than those specified in the fda approval and labeling , the medical profession considers this to be off - label use .

fda regulates the drug and the manufacturer .

each state regulates clinicians and pharmacies .

a licensed physician mayâexcept in highly restricted circumstances âprescribe the approved drug without limitation .

a prescription to an individual whose demographic or medical characteristics differ from those indicated in a drug's fda - approved labeling is accepted medical practice .

in a 2006 study of drug prescribing by office - based physicians , 21% of prescriptions were written for off - label uses .

of those off - label prescriptions , the study's authors found that 27% were backed by strong scientific support .

a 2016 canadian study of primary care clinics found an overall rate of 12% of prescriptions for off - label uses .

the percentage varied , however , by therapeutic class , ranging from 5% for ear , nose , and throat medications to 25% for central nervous system medications .

an econometric model from the national ambulatory medical care survey estimated a 38% rate of off - label use .

research has shown that more than half of oncology drug use is off - label .

a 2018 study examined 43 fda - approved cancer drugs and compared their 99 labeled uses with the acceptable uses published by a national compendium medicare relies on to make coverage decisions .

of the 451 compendium - accepted uses , 56% were off - label .

of the off - label uses , the authors deemed 91% as "well - accepted off - label use. .

why has congress given fda the authority to regulate whether a drug may be on the u.s. market ? .

two key reasons: to protect patients and to encourage research in a competitive pharmaceutical industry .

by statute and regulation , fda now approves a drug for a specific use once its sponsor ( usually the manufacturer ) has provided sufficient evidence that the drug is safe and effective for that use .

fda has developed procedures for the review of that evidence .

the fda - approved labeling , which informs the clinician about dosing and likely and unlikely adverse events , helps protect the individuals for whom the drug is prescribed .

labeling also helps protect the interests of the manufacturers who invest in the clinical trials that demonstrate safety and effectiveness .

for new drugs and new uses of already approved drugs , the sponsor receives a period of market protection , in the form of regulatory exclusivity for the sale of the drug for those uses .

payorsâsuch as private health insurers or medicareâbenefit from fda - approved labeling in their evaluation of whether to pay for a drug's use .

but use of a drug evolves as clinicians ( and the manufacturer ) share their experiences regarding off - label uses , which , by definition , were not part of the premarket clinical studies used to obtain fda approval .

off - label use can benefit patients .

in some instances , such as in the treatment of rare diseases , clinical practice may use drugs approved for other indications .

a manufacturer may choose not to invest in trials for such a small patient group .

a patient whose physician is already prescribing the drug off - label may not want to enroll in a clinical trial where there is a chance he or she may be assigned to the placebo group .

once drugs are well - established in off - label uses , manufacturers rarely design studies to determine or verify the safety and effectiveness of such uses .

individuals and groups wanting to conduct such studies may find it hard to obtain funding .

examples of adverse events ( aes ) associated with the use of drugs for specific off - label uses include heart valve damage from the use of fenfluramine and phentermine ( fen - phen ) for weight loss , and seizures from the use of tiagabine hydrochloride for depression .

using a canadian primary care database that captured all prescriptions , the reason for each prescription , and adverse events , researchers looked at the rate of aes for on - label use , off - label use associated with "strong scientific evidence," and off - label use without such evidence .

they found more aes for off - label prescriptions than for on - label prescriptions .

however , off - label use associated with strong scientific evidence had similar rates of aes as did on - label uses .

the increased risk of aes for off - label use was concentrated in those uses without strong scientific evidence .

manufacturers benefit from sales for off - label uses .

however , they risk losing that market should a competitor complete studies to obtain fda approval and labeling for those uses .

researchers who are not supported by the manufacturer who try to assess the safety and effectiveness of off - label uses are hampered by the inexact nature of secondary data sources: the standard clinical trial data collection in preparation for an fda application is not available for off - label uses .

what may begin as hopeful and intermittent off - label use may gain momentum and offer opportunities for planned studies .

drug and device companies argue that current regulations prevent them from distributing important information to physicians and payors about unapproved , off - label uses of their products .

in november 2016 , fda held a two - day public meeting to hear from various groups regarding off - label uses of approved or cleared medical products .

in june 2018 , fda issued final guidances explaining the agency's policy about medical product communications that include data and information not contained in fda - approved labeling .

one fda guidance document , in particular , described the types of information that a manufacturer could provide payors and formulary committees about unapproved uses of approved products .

fda made two points especially relevant to off - label uses .

first , fda differentiates among its audiences in its presentation of information .

the material it allows in product labeling is directed to a clinical audience .

fda staff have reviewed the information and require that it be presented in a way that is understandable by individual clinicians , who often do not have the statistical sophistication or data analysis skills or resources to fully evaluate the claims of manufacturers .

this guidance notes , though , that payors and formulary committees do have such expertise and resources .

fda also acknowledges that it is useful for payors to have information in their decisions on coverage , but it wants to ensure that the information manufacturers provide is not misleading .

second , the fda guidance describes what harm could come from allowing more sharing of information about off - label use .

some firm communications regarding unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved / cleared / licensed medical products may potentially undermine substantial government interests related to health and safety .

these interests include motivating the development of robust scientific data on safety and efficacy ; maintaining the premarket review process for safety and efficacy of each intended use in order to prevent harm , to protect against fraud , misrepresentation , and bias , and to develop appropriate instructions for use for medical products ; protecting the integrity and reliability of promotional information regarding medical product uses ; and preventing the diversion of health care resources toward ineffective treatments .

the concerns fda raised in the june 2018 final guidance documents might explain why congress may be interested in exploring the issue of off - label use further .

congress has developed a system to protect the public by ensuring that drugs sold in the united states have met clinical and manufacturing standards of safety and effectiveness .

labeling is the mechanism that bridges the regulated drug and the use of that drug in clinical practice .

the labeling establishes the uses for which the manufacturer has demonstrated safety and effectiveness to fda's satisfaction .

congress and the fda have tried several approaches , using labeling as a tool , to reduce the risk to patients .

table a - 1 includes examples of congressional and fda actions to expand the information provided in a drug's labeling .

the actions have addressed topics such as content labeling , directions for use , permissible and prohibited advertising , research incentives to support labeling specific to population subgroups ( eg , children ) , criteria for medicare coverage , required and permissible labeling changes , and balance of benefit and risk information in labeling and advertising .

manufacturers , meanwhile , want to be able to provide information to insurers and other entities ( such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services [cms] and hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees ) that decide whether to cover a drug in a policy and whether to limit reimbursement for specific uses .

congress has provided some leeway relative to its earlier prohibition on promotional activities .

for example , in 2016 , it broadened the types of health care economic information drug and device manufacturers could provide to payors ( eg , insurance companies ) .

although the underlying ffdca section continues to exclude information related only to an off - label use , it now requires "a conspicuous and prominent statement describing any material differences between the health care economic information and the labeling approved for the drug. .

several bills concerning off - label use have been introduced that would have expanded the information that manufacturers could provide about off - label uses .

for example , the subcommittee on health of the house committee on energy and commerce marked up h.r .

2026 ( 115 th congress ) , the pharmaceutical information exchange act , in january 2018 , which would have allowed the provision of scientific information to payors , in addition to health care economic information .

then - subcommittee chair michael burgess , in commenting on the bill's effort to clarify how manufacturers can share "if it is based on competent and reliable evidence," expressed strong support for the bill .

he noted "the importance of cutting edge information in medicine and science to optimize patient care and outcomes â¦ and [how the bill] could have the potential to save patients' lives. .

then - ranking member ( now , chair ) frank pallone , jr. , though , argued that the ability to communicate about off - label use "had great potential to undermine" fda's approval process and to "hamstring" its enforcement efforts .

h.r .

2026 passed the subcommittee , although it did not reach the floor in the 115 th congress .

off - label use presents both opportunities and risks to clinicians , patients , manufacturers , and researchers .

at times , those interests clash .

academics , public health organizations , and journals have suggested what actions congress might take based on their particular concerns regarding off - label prescriptions .

these actions include both direct legislation and oversight activities to encourage action by other entities .

the 116 th congress might consider some of these varied approaches , summarized in the issues described below .

disclosure to patients .

most individuals , unaware of the nuances of fda regulation , may not know that physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that fda has not reviewed for safety and effectiveness .

several potential opportunities for providing this information exist .

congress could require or work with the states to require that the prescriber inform the patient about the off - label use and describe the meaning of off - label use ; the prescriber note in the prescription why the drug is being prescribed ; or the pharmacist inform the patient that the use is off - label .

data collection and availability .

fda , under federal law , determines whether a drug requires a prescription .

the states , under their individual laws , determine what information the prescription order contains .

because clinicians do not need to note on the prescription order why they are prescribing a drug ( eg , simvastatin for high cholesterol or citalopram for depression ) , the information in pharmacy , administrative , and clinical databases often cannot directly identify off - label uses .

therefore , as congress and other public policy groups consider whether and how to address off - label drug prescribing , they do not have adequate information on the scope and details of the practice .

congress could require or work with the states to encourage clinicians to note on prescriptions the reason for medication use ( eg , the specific condition , disease , or symptom ) , thereby allowing that information to appear in pharmacy databases , which would enable focused analysis of off - label uses ; the establishment of confidential registries of off - label prescribing and follow - up information that fda ( or other designated scientifically appropriate agencies ) could use in its electronic surveillance systems to identify associated adverse events and other drug use problems ; or fda to increase its surveillance of available data sources , such as registries and administrative and clinical databases , to identify patterns of off - label use and evidence suggesting effectiveness and associated adverse events .

dissemination .

because some information may be valuable to clinicians and entities that influence prescribing decisions ( such as insurers and pharmacy and therapeutics committees ) , congress could allow manufacturers to disseminate information about off - label uses that they have developed or of which they are aware , perhaps subject to certain limitations or accompanying reporting requirements .

possibilities include broader sharing of clinical analyses of off - label use with coverage deciders ( eg , cms , insurers , pharmacy and therapeutics committees ) to support requests that they cover a particular use of the drug ; and dissemination of clinical analyses of off - label use at clinical and pharmaceutical conferences .

oversight .

with an estimated 12% to 38% of all prescriptions' ( and 56% of oncology prescriptions' ) being written for uses not listed on fda - approved labeling , valid information on the extent of off - label use and the effect of such use on manufacturer , insurer , and clinician behavior could potentially better inform debate on how to best protect the public's health .

congress could direct the government accountability office ( gao ) to study the extent of off - label use in government - provided care ( eg , department of veterans affairs , bureau of prisons , and indian health service ) and in government - funded care ( eg , medicare and medicaid ) ; the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) to contract with the national academy of medicine or a similar organization to assemble management or industrial policy experts to study the costs and rewards to industry of off - label prescriptions ; or fda and the federal trade commission to investigate drugs whose off - label prescriptions account for a particularly high percentage of all prescriptions or that generate a particularly high percentage or high dollar value of sales .

pricing .

the decision to use a drug off - label based solely or primarily on price introduces a new element to study .

for example , the pricing difference between avastin and lucentis , both made by the same manufacturer with the same active ingredient , is so large that many ophthalmologists use the lower priced avastin in their treatment of macular degeneration , despite its being an off - label use .

the manufacturer included the treatment of macular degeneration in its application to fda for lucentis .

to explore the ramifications of a traditionally nonclinical element in prescribing decisions , congress could require the hhs secretary to study the relationship among pricing , access , and prescribing and its effect on patient safety .

reimbursement .

although fda approval of a drugânot for each use of a drugâis a requirement for sale in the united states , the decision to reimburse a physician or patient for a drug is made by entities such as the cms and private insurers .

such decisions , therefore , influence what drugs are prescribed and , in part , for what uses drugs are prescribed .

congress could direct the hhs secretary to study such coverage decisions or to contract with the national academy of medicine or a similarly equipped entity to do so ; or hhs to form a task force to include cms and fda , along with private insurers and others involved in coverage decisions , and patient and clinician groups representing those affected by coverage decisions , to identify areas in need of action and to recommend steps in those directions .

congress also could encourage payors to require safety and effectiveness evidence before covering off - label uses .

research .

the traditional path toward adding an indication ( reason for use ) to the labeling of a drug already approved for other uses has been for the sponsor of the drug to conduct clinical trials and submit a supplemental new drug application ( nda ) to fda .

the widespread extent of off - label use suggests that relying on that model is not helping prescribers get better information .

congress could consider assigning responsibility ( and funding ) to the national institutes of health and the patient - centered outcomes research institute for safety and effectiveness evaluations of off - label uses ; or requiring , for a drug that has substantial ( to be defined ) off - label sales , that the manufacturer fund studies , such as clinical trials , to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the off - label use and submit evidence to the hhs secretary .

depending on the secretary's assessment of the evidence , the secretary could request that the manufacturer amend the drug's labeling either to add the off - label use to the label as an approved use or to add a statement that clinical evidence does not support the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the off - label use .

research transparency .

fda regulations describe standards for the design and analysis of clinical trials that a sponsor uses in an nda .

studies done by or for the manufacturer or by other groups or individuals are not always made public , in which case their findings cannot be reviewed and evaluated .

because the results of such studies may be used in support of off - label uses , by providing positive and negative incentives , congress could consider requiring or encouraging prospective posting of the designs and statistical plans of studies of off - label uses ; or public reporting of studies of off - label use .

clinical guidance .

professional societies and other clinical groups often supplement the information available to prescribers from fda - approved labeling , medical journals , and information from manufacturers .

they can issue guidelines and recommend best practices .

congress could engage such groups and encourage professional societies to develop evidence - based clinical guidelines and training regarding off - label use .

precedents from other countries .

the united states is not alone in facing the health care and economic implications of off - label use .

for example , the member countries of the european union have addressed measures involving reimbursement , guidance for prescribers , professional standards , and informed consent .

congress could require hhs to contract with the national academy of medicine or a similarly equipped entity to review measures taken by the european union and other regulatory bodies and recommend legislative or administrative actions as appropriate .

concerns over off - label use overlap with questions raised by some legislators and regulators in other contexts .

in addition to clearly related issues such as what is allowable information in direct - to - consumer advertising , promotion to clinicians , and material shared with payors and insurers , off - label use also affects the entire basis of fda regulation of drugs through its authority to approve drugs .

that means it directly or indirectly affects research , clinical innovation , transparency , patents and exclusivities , pricing , and access .

changes in law or regulation in any one area may have benefits in some areas and drawbacks in others .

for example , fda's initiative to encourage research in drugs used traditionally but never reviewed and approved by fdaâso - called legacy drugsâstems from its desire for evidence of safety and effectiveness .

such evidence helps protect patients from possible use of ineffective , unsafe , or misdosed drugs .

that initiative , in turn , helps enable sponsors to conduct the clinical trials , submit new drug applications , obtain regulatory exclusivity with the new drug approvalâand then raise the price of the new branded product while expecting fda to honor the exclusivity and block the sale of the drug by others .

for example , clinicians had been prescribing a compounded version of progestin for use in preventing preterm delivery .

such use had never been adequately tested in clinical trials .

one company conducted those trials , and fda approved its new drug application .

the initial price for the new drug , makena , was $30,000 for a 20-week course ; patients had been paying pharmacists $200-$400 for the same course .

unanticipated price increases can also arise from the apparent following of fda procedures .

for example , a new owner of the fda - approval of an old antiparasitic generic drug raised the price from $14 per tablet to $750 , daraprim's initial price .

such sudden and large price increases become a barrier to patient access and , therefore , a potential threat to health .

in the case of off - label prescribing , actions in any directionâwhether by congress , fda , or the courtsâcould have both intended and unanticipated effects .

actions to limit off - label prescribing could have the intended effects of reducing safety risks and the economic cost of using drugs ineffective for their prescribed purposes .

such limits , however , could also stifle informed clinical exploration .

similarly , incentives to mount clinical trials needed to add an indication to the label could help identify and disseminate information on dosing and contradictions .

such incentives , however , could also hurt .

for example , a brand drug that added a new indication to its labeling could prevent , through exclusivities , generics from similarly modifying their labeling .

patients could need to pay more .

the recent debates over the right - to - try movement regarding use of investigational drugs by terminally ill patients may preview discussion about any proposed restrictions on off - label use .

the goldwater institute , considered a key impetus to development and passage of the 2018 enactment of a right - to - try act , looks to diminish government's role in an individual's choice and has supported dissemination of off - label information .

congress has built a process in which a robust fda can regulate drugs to protect the public's health .

is there cause for concern that perhaps a third of prescriptions are for off - label uses and that , in at least one study , three - quarters of those had minimal or no accepted scientific evidence to support their use ? .

policy tension exists over the line between wanting to ensure individuals' freedom to take drugs for off - label uses and wanting to protect the public from the risk of unsafe or ineffective drugs .

where to draw that lineâand how to know when it may be time to move the lineâis of continuing interest to regulators and legislators .
