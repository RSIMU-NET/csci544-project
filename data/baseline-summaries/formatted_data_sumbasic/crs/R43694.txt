in an effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate billions of dollars in improper payments made by federal agencies each year , congress passed the improper payments information act ( ipia ) in 2002 .

ipia established an initial framework for identifying , measuring , and reporting on improper payments at each agency .

under ipia , an improper payment is defined as a payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount , including both overpayments and underpayments .

this definition includes payments made to ineligible recipients , duplicate payments , payments for a good or service not received , and payments that do not account for credit for applicable discounts .

in fy2010 , congress amended ipia to require improvements in agency improper payments estimation and reporting processes , among other changes .

under ipia , as amended , agencies are required to identify programs susceptible to significant improper payments , to estimate the amount of improper payments issued under those programs , and to notify congress of the steps being taken to address the root causes of the improper payments .

generally , a program is deemed susceptible to "significant" improper payments if it has ( 1 ) improper payments that exceed both $10 million and 2.5% of total program payments , or ( 2 ) more than $100 million in total improper payments .

for fy2013 , agencies determined that 85 programs were susceptible to significant improper payments , and that those programs issued more than $106 billion in improper payments that year .

since fy2004 , when agencies first began reporting improper payments , the government has identified approximately $800 billion in erroneous payments .

table 1 shows annual improper payment amounts for the 85 risk - susceptible programs from fy2004 through fy2013 .

the data in table 1 show that the amount of improper payments reported was relatively flat through fy2007 , after which it increased rapidly — nearly tripling by fy2010 — and has then slowly declined .

the increase in improper payments between fy2007 and fy2010 can be partially attributed to the inclusion of new programs .

a number of programs with billions of dollars in annual outlays lacked valid improper payments estimates and did not begin reporting until fy2008 .

the department of health and human services ( hhs ) first reported on medicaid , for example , in fy2008 , estimating $19 billion in improper payments out of $178 billion in outlays that fiscal year .

in addition , government expenditures for public assistance increased between fy2007 and fy2010 as the economy weakened , which further increased the amount of improper payments issued under many risk - susceptible programs .

expenditures under the medicare fee - for - service program , for example , increased from $276 billion in fy2007 to $326 billion in fy2010 , while the program's improper payments increased from $11 billion to $30 billion during that same time .

as suggested in the previous section , a relatively small number of programs with annual improper payments of $1 billion or more account for a significant portion of the government's total improper payments .

with this in mind , in november 2009 , president obama signed executive order 13520 , which required the director of the office of management and budget ( omb ) to work with agencies to identify "high priority" programs ( those which account for the "highest dollar value or majority of improper payments" across the government ) , establish annual targets for reducing improper payments under high priority programs , and submit a report to the agency's inspector general that detailed how the agency planned to meet those targets .

the executive order also required agencies to publish data on improper payments estimates and targets for the high priority programs they administer .

in response to e.o .

13520 , omb created a central website , paymentaccuracy.gov , which includes data for all high priority programs , as the executive order required .

omb also revised omb circular a - 123 , appendix c , to incorporate the new requirements for high priority programs .

under the revised circular , a program is deemed high priority if it has reported more than $750 million in improper payments in the most recent fiscal year ; not reported an improper payments amount for the most recent fiscal year , but has reported more than $750 million in improper payments in a previous fiscal year ; or not yet reported on improper payments for the program as a whole , but has determined that the total amount of improper payments for program components that have been measured exceeds $750 million .

as of july 2014 , omb had identified 13 high priority programs , 12 of which reported improper payment amounts for fy2013 .

according to omb , data on the one high priority program that has not yet reported any improper payments amounts , the children's health insurance program ( chip ) , may be available at the end of fy2014 when a valid error rate is anticipated to be established .

five other high priority programs did not begin reporting improper payments data in fy2004 , as required under ipia , due to difficulties developing estimates .

these programs were the national school lunch program , which first reported improper payment amounts for fy2007 ; medicaid , medicare part c , and pell grants , each of which first reported for fy2008 ; and medicare part d , which first reported improper payment amounts for fy2011 .

data on high priority programs are thus incomplete , as the number of programs reporting improper payments amounts and rates varied over time .

table 2 , below , identifies the amount of improper payments issued by each high priority program from fy2004 through fy2013 .

the data in table 2 show that 12 high priority programs issued $738 billion in improper payments in the past 10 fiscal years .

the data also show that a subgroup of four of the high priority programs — medicare fee - for - service , earned income tax credit ( eitc ) , medicaid , and medicare advantage — accounted for a large proportion of the government's total improper payments each of those years .

in fy2013 , those four programs accounted for $77 billion of the government's total improper payments of $106 billion .

restated , four programs accounted for an estimated 73% of all of the government's improper payments in the most recent fiscal year for which data are available .

three of those programs have seen their improper payments increase significantly since they first started reporting: improper payments for the medicare fee - for - service program increased 64% , eitc 50% , and medicare advantage 71% .

overall , just 2 of the 12 high priority programs that have reported improper payments data so far , medicaid and rental housing assistance , have seen a decrease in the amount of annual improper payments between their first year of reporting and fy2013 .

taken as a whole , high priority programs have accounted for a large percentage of the government's total annual improper payments each fiscal year .

as table 3 shows , high priority programs accounted for 85% to 96% of the improper payments reported by agencies annually from fy2004 through fy2013 .

the data in table 3 show that after some fluctuation during the first five years of reporting , high priority programs have accounted for a relatively stable portion of the government's total improper payments .

between fy2004 and fy2008 , high priority programs accounted for as much as 96% and as little as 85% of the government's total improper payments , a variance of 11 percentage points .

by comparison , between fy2009 and fy2013 , high priority programs accounted for as much as 95% and as little as 92% of the government's total improper payments — a variance of 3 percentage points .

the first five years of reporting may have displayed greater variance because three new high priority programs were added during that time , while one new high priority program was added between fy2009 and fy2013 .

when new programs begin reporting data it may take time for agencies to refine their improper payments estimates .

this could , in turn , increase year - to - year variations in total improper payments — variations that should theoretically diminish over time as agencies develop more accurate measures .

should the current trend continue into future fiscal years , high priority programs would account for 9 out of every 10 dollars reported as improper payments .

omb's guidance on high priority programs was intended to focus agency efforts on the subset of programs with the highest dollar amounts of improper payments .

as the data in table 4 show , however , the results have been mixed .

while some high priority programs have seen a steady decline in their improper payments error rates , others have shown little or no improvement — and some have seen their error rates increase over time .

the data show that the government - wide error rate has decreased steadily over the past five fiscal years .

in fy2013 , the government - wide error rate stood at 3.5% , a decline from its peak of 5.4% in fy2009 .

notably , the error rate declined every year between fy2009 and fy2013 , which may indicate that agency efforts to address the root causes of improper payments are yielding lasting results .

the data also indicate , however , that several high priority programs have shown little or no improvement .

the error rate for eitc — by far the highest of any high priority program — has remained virtually unchanged over 10 years of reporting .

in fy2004 , eitc's error rate stood at 24.5% , and at the end of fy2013 it stood at 24.0% .

two other high priority programs ended fy2013 with the same error rates that they had 10 years ago — medicare fee - for - service ( 10.1% ) and retirement , survivors , and disability income rsdi ( 0.3% ) .

moreover , the error rates for two high priority programs have increased over time .

the error rate for supplemental security income ( ssi ) increased from 7.3% in fy2004 to 8.1% in fy2013 , and the error rate for medicare part d increased from 3.2% in fy2011 — the first year it was reported — to 3.7% in fy2013 .

with regard to the latter program , only three years of data are available so a sustained trend is not yet established .

the error rates for six high priority programs have decreased over time .

for two of these programs , however , reduced error rates may not indicate improved program management .

the error rate for unemployment insurance ( ui ) decreased from 10.3% in fy2004 to 9.3% in fy2013 — but exceeded 10.0% in each of the intervening years .

the fy2013 error rate may therefore be an anomaly .

similarly , the national school lunch program has reported a small reduction in its error rate over seven years , dropping from 16.3% in its first year of reporting ( fy2007 ) to 15.7% in fy2013 .

this equates to an average reduction of one - tenth of one percentage point per year .

at that rate , it would take more than 50 years for the program's error rate to reach single digits .

by contrast , four high priority programs showed consistent , sustained reductions in their error rates .

the error rate for the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) fell from 6.6% in fy2004 to 3.4% in fy2013 , and medicaid's fell from 10.5% in fy2008 — its first reporting year — to 5.8% in fy2013 .

in addition , the error rate for the pell grants program was cut in half between fy2004 and fy2013 , and the error rate for the rental housing assistance program declined from 6.9% to 4.9% over that same period .

in sum , while the government - wide error rate has fallen each of the past four fiscal years , there has been little progress made reducing the error rates for a number of high priority programs .

as a consequence , 10 years after agencies first reported improper payment rates and amounts , the government still issues more than $100 billion a year in improper payments .
