t he financial services and general government ( fsgg ) appropriations bill includes funding for the department of the treasury ( title i ) , the executive office of the president ( eop ; title ii ) , the judiciary ( title iii ) , the district of columbia ( title iv ) , and more than two dozen independent agencies ( title v ) .

the bill typically funds mandatory retirement accounts in title vi , which also contains additional general provisions applying to the funding provided to agencies through the fsgg bill .

title vii typically contains general provisions applying government - wide .

fsgg bills have often also contained provisions relating to u.s. policy toward cuba .

the house and senate fsgg bills fund the same agencies , with one exception .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is funded through the agriculture appropriations bill in the house and the fsgg bill in the senate .

this structure has existed in its current form since the 2007 reorganization of the house and senate committees on appropriations .

although financial services are a major focus of the bills , fsgg appropriations bills do not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies , which are instead funded outside of the appropriations process .

president trump submitted his fy2018 budget request on may 23 , 2017 .

the request included a total of $45.2 billion for agencies funded through the fsgg appropriations bill , including $250 million for the cftc .

on july 17 , 2017 , the house committee on appropriations reported a financial services and general government appropriations act , 2018 ( h.r .

3280 , h.rept .

115-234 ) .

total fy2018 funding in the reported bill would have been $42.5 billion , with another $248 million for the cftc included in the agriculture appropriations bill ( h.r .

3268 , h.rept .

115-232 ) .

the combined total of $42.7 billion would have been about $2.5 billion below the president's fy2018 request , with most of this difference in the funding for the general services administration ( gsa ) .

nearly all of h.r .

3280 's text was included as division d of h.r .

3354 when it was considered by the house of representatives beginning on september 6 , 2017 .

the bill was amended numerous times , shifting funding among fsgg agencies but not changing the fsgg totals .

h.r .

3354 passed on september 14 , 2017 .

the senate committee on appropriations released an fy2018 chairmen's recommended fsgg draft bill along with an explanatory statement on november 20 , 2017 .

funding in the recommended bill totaled $43.3 billion , about $1.9 billion below the president's fy2018 request with most of this difference in funding for the gsa .

with the end of fy2017 approaching and no permanent fy2018 appropriations bills enacted , congress passed , and the president signed , h.r .

601 / p.l .

115-56 .

division d of this act provided for continuing appropriations through december 8 , 2017 , generally termed a continuing resolution ( cr ) .

p.l .

115-556 provided funding for most fsgg agencies based on the fy2017 funding rate .

in addition , the cr contained a number of deviations or "anomalies" from the general formula .

the fsgg anomalies focused on decreasing funding related to the presidential transition , which had been increased in fy2017 .

four additional crs were enacted â€” on december 8 , 2017 ( p.l .

115-90 ) , december 22 , 2017 ( p.l .

115-96 ) , january 22 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-120 ) , and february 8 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) .

p.l .

115-123 also included an additional $127 million for the gsa and $1.66 billion for the small business administration ( sba ) , largely to address disaster costs from hurricanes in 2017 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( h.r .

1625 , p.l .

115-141 ) was enacted on march 23 , 2018 .

the bill , originally focused on eradication of human trafficking , was amended with the appropriations measure , passed in the house on march 22 , 2018 , and passed in the senate on march 23 , 2018 .

the c ongressional record for march 22 , 2018 , includes an explanatory statement which is to have the same effect as a joint explanatory statement of a conference committee .

fsgg appropriations are included in division e , with the cftc funded in the agriculture appropriations in division a .

additional legislative language affecting financial regulation is in division s , titles viii and ix .

fy2018 enacted appropriations in both p.l .

115-141 and p.l .

115-123 totaled $47.7 billion for the fsgg agencies , $2.5 billion above the original request with much of this difference resulting from the emergency funding for the sba .

the gsa , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , and the election assistance commission ( eac ) also had substantial funding differences between requested and enacted amounts .

most of the eac funding was for grants to states for the election reform program .

table 1 reflects the status of fsgg appropriations measures at key points in the appropriations process .

table 2 lists the broad amounts requested by the president and included in the various fsgg bills , largely by title , and table 3 details the amounts for the independent agencies .

specific columns in table 2 and table 3 are fsgg agencies' enacted amounts for fy2017 , the president's fy2018 request , the fy2018 amounts from h.r .

3554 as passed by the house , from the senate appropriations chairmen's draft bill , and the enacted amounts combined from p.l .

115-141 and p.l .

115-123 .

although financial services are a focus of the fsgg bill , the bill does not actually include funding for the regulation of much of the financial services industry .

financial services as an industry is often subdivided into banking , insurance , and securities .

federal regulation of the banking industry is divided among the federal reserve , the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) , the office of comptroller of the currency ( occ ) , and the bureau of consumer financial protection ( generally known as the consumer financial protection bureau , or cfpb ) .

in addition , credit unions , which operate similarly to many banks , are regulated by the national credit union administration ( ncua ) .

none of these agencies receives its primary funding through the appropriations process , with only the fdic inspector general and a small program operated by the ncua currently funded in the fsgg bill .

insurance generally is regulated at the state level , with some oversight at the holding company level by the federal reserve .

there is a relatively small federal insurance office ( fio ) inside the treasury , which is funded through the departmental offices account , but fio has no regulatory authority .

federal securities regulation is divided between the sec and the cftc , both of which are funded through appropriations .

the cftc funding is a relatively straightforward appropriation from the general fund , whereas the sec funding is provided by the fsgg bill , but then offset through fees collected by the sec .

although funding for many financial regulatory agencies may not be provided by the fsgg bill , legislative provisions affecting financial regulation in general and some of these agencies specifically have often been included in fsgg bills .

h.r .

3280 and h.r .

3354 as passed by the house include many provisions , particularly in title ix and title x , that would amend the 2010 dodd - frank act and other statutes relating to the regulation of financial institutions and the authority and funding of financial regulators .

many of these provisions were included in other legislation , notably h.r .

10 , which passed the house on june 8 , 2017 .

of particular interest from the appropriations perspective , h.r .

3280 and h.r .

3354 as passed by the house would bring several financial regulators under the fsgg bill instead of receiving funding from outside of the appropriations process , as is currently the case .

p.l .

115-141 included the texts of h.r .

4267 and h.r .

4792 , both of which address small business access to capital .

h.r .

4267 was also included in h.r .

10 , but had not been originally included in h.r .

3280 or h.r .

3354 .

the texts of h.r .

4267 and h.r .

4792 , however , were not included in the fsgg portion of the bill .

instead they were in titles viii and ix in a separate division s. none of the language bringing financial regulators under the appropriations process was included in the law as enacted .

the house and senate committees on appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures in early 2007 .

each chamber created a new financial services and general government subcommittee .

in the house , the jurisdiction of the fsgg subcommittee is composed primarily of agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on transportation , treasury , housing and urban development , the judiciary , the district of columbia , and independent agencies , commonly referred to as tthud .

in addition , the house fsgg subcommittee was assigned four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies subcommittee: the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) .

in the senate , the jurisdiction of the new fsgg subcommittee is a combination of agencies from the jurisdiction of three previously existing subcommittees .

most of the agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the transportation , treasury , the judiciary , and housing and urban development , and related agencies subcommittee were assigned to the fsgg subcommittee .

in addition , the district of columbia , which had its own subcommittee in the 109 th congress , was placed under the purview of the fsgg subcommittee , as were four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies subcommittee: the fcc , ftc , sec , and sba .

as a result of this reorganization , the house and senate fsgg subcommittees have nearly identical jurisdictions , except that the cftc is under the jurisdiction of the fsgg subcommittee in the senate and the agriculture subcommittee in the house .

 table 4 below lists various departments and agencies funded through fsgg appropriations and the names and contact information of the crs expert ( s ) on these departments and agencies .
