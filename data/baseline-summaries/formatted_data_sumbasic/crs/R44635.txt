this report presents background information and potential issues for congress on the question of whether to increase the navy's force - level goal ( i.e. , the planned size of the navy ) to something more than the current goal of 308 ships .

some observers have advocated adopting a new a force - level goal of about 350 ships .

the issue for congress is whether to increase the planned size of the navy to something more than 308 ships , and if so , what the new force - level goal should be .

congress's decisions on this issue could substantially affect navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base .

there have also been proposals in recent years for future navy fleets of less than 308 ships .

several of these proposals are summarized in another crs report that provides an overview discussion of navy force structure and shipbuilding plans .

this other crs report also summarizes current legislative activity relating to navy force structure and shipbuilding .

several additional crs reports discuss individual navy shipbuilding programs .

potential oversight issues for congress concerning the possibility of increasing the planned size of the navy to something more than 308 ships include the following: how large a navy , consisting of what mix of ships , will be needed in coming years to adequately perform navy missions , including responding to china's naval modernization , responding to resurgent russian naval operations , and meeting u.s. regional combatant commander requests for forward - deployed navy ships ? .

how might the answer to the preceding question be affected by developments such as greater use of unmanned vehicles , potential new fleet architectures , or expanded use of forward homeporting ? .

to what degree can contributions from u.s. allies and partners offset a need for additional u.s. navy ships ? .

what are the potential operational risks of relying on u.s. allies and partners to reduce requirements for u.s. navy ships ? .

what would be the additional cost for achieving and maintaining a fleet of more than 308 ships ? .

in a situation of constraints on defense spending , what impact would this additional cost have on funding available for other defense programs ? .

if funding for other defense programs would need to be reduced to help pay for a fleet of more than 308 ships , what would be the net effect on u.s. military capabilities and operational risks ? .

appendix a .

adjustments leading to notional 349-ship plan this appendix discusses the adjustments that were made to the force - level goals for certain ship types in converting the proportional 350-ship fleet shown in the fifth column of table 2 to the notional 349-ship fleet shown in the sixth column of table 2 .

the adjustments were as follows: ssbns .

the number of ssbns was left unchanged from the figure of 12 in the navy's 308-ship plan because discussions about the possibility of a bigger navy have centered on changing demands for general - purpose ships rather than on changing demands for strategic nuclear deterrent ships .

ssgns .

the figure of 0 ssgns derived from scaling up the 308-ship plan was left unchanged .

as under the 308-ship plan , today's 4 ohio - class cruise missile submarines ( ssgns ) would eventually retire without being replaced in kind .

discussions about compensating for the eventual retirement of the ssgns' strike capability have centered more on building virginia - class submarines equipped with the virginia payload module ( vpm ) than on building replacement ssgns .

see also the next bullet .

ssns .

the scaled - up figure of 55 ssns , which happens to equal a figure shown in certain navy force structure plans prior to 2005 , was increased to 59 in the notional plan to create a figure equal to the combined total of 4 ssgns and 55 ssns shown in the navy's 2002-2004 plan for a fleet of 375 ships .

aircraft carriers .

the scaled - up figure of 13 carriers was reduced to 12 because navy force structure plans for fleets of between 300 and 400 ships since 1993 have not shown more than 12 carriers .

cruisers and destroyers .

the scaled - up figure of 100 cruisers and destroyers ( i.e. , large surface combatants ) was left unchanged .

frigates and lcss .

the scaled - up figure of 59 frigates and lcss ( i.e. , small surface combatants ) was reduced to 56 , which is the number of lcss in the navy's 2002-2004 plan for a 375-ship fleet .

in addition , navy plans for crewing and operating lcss call for organizing lcss into four - ship divisions , and 56 is evenly divisible by four .

navy force structure plans from 2006 through 2012 included a total of 55 lcss .

amphibious ships .

the scaled - up figure of 39 ships was reduced to 38 , a number that navy and marine corps officials have testified would be able to meet the requirement for having enough amphibious lift for the assault echelons of 2.0 marine expeditionary brigades ( mebs ) with less risk than the currently planned 34-ship amphibious force .

mine warfare ships .

the scaled up figure of 0 mine warfare ships was left unchanged .

as under the current 308-ship plan , missions now carried out by mine warfare ships would in the future be performed instead by lcss equipped with the lcs mine warfare mission package .

combat logistics force ( clf ) ships and support ships ( including expeditionary fast transports [epfs] ) .

the scaled - up figures for these two categories were left unchanged .

appendix b .

additional ships needed in 30-year shipbuilding plan this appendix discusses in further detail the additional ships added to the 30-year shipbuilding plan that are shown in the final column of table 3 .

ssns — notional objective of 59 industrial - base capacity permitting , an ssn force of 59 boats could be achieved by inserting 12 additional ssns into the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , for a total procurement of 56 ssns rather than 44 during the 30-year period .

a notional profile could insert these 12 additional ssns into the 12 years ( fy2021 , fy2024 , and fy2026-fy2035 ) where the current plan would procure 1 ssn rather than 2 .

 ( these are the 12 years when the 12 columbia class [ohio replacement] ssbns are to be procured. ) .

under this profile , the ssn force would reach a minimum of 43 boats around fy2028-fy2029 and then grow to 59 boats in fy2041 .

it would continue to grow after that , reaching 63 boats by about the end of the 30-year period , unless older ssns are retired before the ends of their service lives to keep the force at 59 .

aircraft carriers — notional objective of 12 under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , carriers are to be procured every five years ( fy2018 , fy2023 , and so on ) .

carriers would enter service nine years after the year in which they are procured , and the resulting carrier force is projected to remain at 11 ships , except for the three - year period fy2022-fy2024 , during which it would increase to 12 , and the final seven years of the 30-year period ( fy2040-fy2046 ) , during which it would decline to 10 as a long - term consequence of procuring carriers every five years .

a total of four carriers would be procured from fy2018 through fy2034 , in fy2018 , fy2023 , fy2028 , and fy2033 .

given this projection , a 12-ship carrier force could be achieved and maintained by procuring a total of 6 carriers , rather than 4 , from fy2018 through fy2034 .

the 6 carriers would be procured at mostly three - year intervals , in fy2018 , fy2021 , fy2024 , fy2028 , fy2031 , and fy2034 .

the resulting force would continue include a total of 12 ships during the three - year period fy2022-fy2024 .

it would then decline to 11 ships , return to 12 ships in fy2030 , and remain at 12 ships through the end of the 30-year period , except for fy2032 and fy2042 , when it would dip to 11 ships .

under this scenario , fy2030 could be viewed as the year when the navy attained a 12-ship carrier force .

cruisers and destroyers — notional objective of 100 under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , the cruiser - destroyer force is projected to reach 100 ships in fy2024 and remain at or close to that figure through fy2028 before dropping below 90 ships in fy2032 and to 80 ships by the end of the 30-year period .

given this projection , a force of about 100 cruisers and destroyers could be achieved and maintained over the entire 30-year period by inserting 16 cruisers and destroyers into the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , for a total procurement of 82 cruisers and destroyers rather than 66 .

a notional profile would insert 1 additional cruiser or destroyer per year over the 16-year period fy2020-fy2035 , increasing the procurement rate for this period from 2 ships per year to 3 ships per year .

this notional profile would achieve a 100-ship cruiser destroyer force in fy2024 ( as under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan ) and maintain a force of between 96 and 104 cruisers and destroyers for the remainder of the 30-year period .

frigates and lcss — notional objective of 56 although the 308-ship plan calls for 52 frigates and lcss , the lcs / frigate program has been reduced from 52 ships to 40 .

under the current 30-year shipbuilding program , the annual procurement rate for the lcs / frigate program has been limited to 1 or 2 ships per year , a successor small surface combatant design is scheduled to begin procurement in fy2029 , and the force of frigates and lcss is not projected to exceed 45 during the 30-year period .

given currently planned procurement and the resulting projected force level , one notional profile for achieving a force of 56 frigates and lcss and maintaining about this number through the end of the 30-year period would be to insert 17 additional frigates and lcss into the nine - year period fy2017-fy2025 , and then remove 5 frigates and lcss from the seven - year period fy2029-fy2035 .

this would result in a net increase of 12 frigates and lcss procured during the 30-year period — a total procurement of 70 rather than 58 .

 ( a total of 70 frigates and lcss are procured over the 30-year period to support a force level goal of 56 ships because the earliest of the first 56 lcss / frigates to enter service will reach the ends of their service lives and be retired during the 30-year period. ) .

under this notional profile , frigates and lcss would be procured in fy2019-fy2023 at a rate of four ships per year , a rate that is currently shown for procuring frigates and lcss for some of the later years of the current 30-year shipbuilding plan .

producing lcss / frigates at a rate of four ships per year might require producing them at more than one shipyard .

under the notional profile , a force of at least 56 frigates and lcss would be achieved in fy2029 ( there would be 57 that year ) , procurement of the successor design would begin in fy2033 rather than fy2029 , and the force would be maintained at a level of 55 to 57 ships through the remainder of the 30-year period .

table b - 1 shows , for the period fy2017-fy2035 , the notional procurement profile compared to the profile in the current 30-year shipbuilding plan .

 ( the procurement profile for the years after fy2035 would remain unchanged. ) .

amphibious ships — notional objective of 38 under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , the amphibious force is projected to grow to 38 ships in fy2033 , and then decline to 32 or 33 ships by the final years of the 30-year period .

given this projection , inserting additional amphibious ships into the future years defense plan ( fydp ) ( i.e. , fy2017-fy2021 — the first five years of the 30-year shipbuilding plan ) could accelerate the attainment of a 38-ship amphibious force by several years , and keep the amphibious force at or relatively close to the 38-ship level for most of the 30-year period .

for example , adding 3 amphibious ships to the fydp could accelerate the attainment of a 38-ship amphibious force to fy2025 and keep the amphibious force within 3 ships of the 38-ship figure for the remainder of the 30-year period .

the situation is summarized in table b - 2 .

clf ships — notional objective of 33 under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , the clf force is projected to remain at 29 or 30 ships throughout the 30-year period .

the 3 or 4 additional clf ships that would need to be added to the 30-year shipbuilding plan to achieve and maintain a force of 33 clf ships could be added so that the additional ships enter the force at about the time that they would be needed to support growing numbers of surface combatants and amphibious ships .

support ships ( including epfs ) — notional objective of 39 under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan , the number of support ships ( including expeditionary fast transports , or epfs — the ships previously known as joint high speed vessels , or jhsvs ) , is projected to increase to 35 in fy2020 , increase further to a maximum of 39 in fy2025 , remain at or above the current 34-ship goal until fy2038 , and then decline to 32 ships for the final seven years of the 30-year period .

given this projection , the situation for these ships can be viewed as somewhat similar to the one described above for amphibious ships: adding additional support ships during the fydp could accelerate the date for attaining a force of at least 39 ships from fy2025 to an earlier year , and keep the force closer to the 39-ship figure in the final years of the 30-year period .

if one or more of the additional ships are to be epfs , then from a production standpoint , it might be efficient for those additional ships to be added directly after the ones that have already been funded , so as to preserve production learning - curve benefits .
