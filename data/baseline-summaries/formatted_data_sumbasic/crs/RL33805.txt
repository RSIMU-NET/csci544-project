several federal programs support child care , education , or related services , primarily for low - income working families .

in addition , the tax code includes provisions specifically targeted to assist families with child care expenses .

descriptions of those programs and tax provisions follow , as does table 1 , which shows funding ( or obligations or tax expenditures , where applicable and available ) for the programs and tax provisions for the past five years .

in many cases , other congressional research service ( crs ) reports are referenced as sources for more detailed information about individual programs .

early childhood care and education programs still due to be reauthorized in the 110 th congress include the child care and development block grant and programs under the no child left behind act ( nclba ) .

legislation to reauthorize head start ( h.r .

1429 ) , a program whose authorization expired with fy2003 , was signed into law ( p.l .

110-134 ) by the president on december 12 , 2007 .

all of these programs have continued to receive funding .

the nclba programs include elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) title i , part a , early reading first , even start , and the early childhood educator professional development program .

programs for young children contained in the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) , such as the preschool grants program and the infants and toddlers program , are not up for reauthorization in the 110 th congress .

readers should be aware that this report does not attempt to cover all issues connected with each of those reauthorizations .

the fy2007 appropriations process consisted of four continuing resolutions , the last of which ( h.j.res .

20 ) , signed into law ( p.l .

110-5 ) on february 15 , 2007 , extended through the entirety of fy2007 .

the final cr language specified a dollar amount for head start — $6.889 billion — approximately $100 million more than the regular funding provided for fy2006 .

 ( regular funds totaled $6.786 billion in fy2006 and do not include the supplemental funding that was provided to target needs arising from the 2005 gulf hurricanes. ) .

fiscal year 2008 began without appropriations bills for the year having been completed .

the process extended almost a full quarter into fy2008 , with continuing resolutions providing temporary funding during the time it took for the house , senate , and president to come to agreement on a bill .

ultimately , the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 ( h.r .

2764 / p.l .

110-161 ) on december 26 , 2007 , but only after first vetoing a conference agreement submitted by congress ( h.rept .

110-424 ) .

the funding levels that appear in the act ( with few exceptions ) are subject to an across - the - board reduction of 1.747% .

all fy2008 appropriation amounts referenced in this report reflect the across - the - board cut .

the administration released its proposed budget for fy2009 on february 4 , 2009 .

as shown in table 3 , the president's funding request for most of the early childhood care and education programs discussed in this report mirror the funding levels provided for fy2008 .

exceptions include a proposed $149 million increase for the head start program , and a $500 million decrease for the social services block grant ( ssbg ) .

in addition to the proposed cut for the coming year , the budget also proposes a plan to eliminate the ssbg entirely in fy2010 .

for fy2009 , the administration again proposes to eliminate the even start program , as well as funding for early childhood educator professional development .
