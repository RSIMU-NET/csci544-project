the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act ( reauthorization act ) contains a number of death penalty related provisions .

some create new federal capital offenses ; some add the death penalty as a sentencing option in the case of pre - existing federal crimes ; some alter the procedural attributes of federal capital cases .

other proposals offered during the 109 th congress would have followed the same pattern: some new crimes ; some new penalties for old crimes ; and some procedural adjustments .

only one of the other proposals , the adam walsh child protection and safety act , passed , although at least one house approved several others .

three proposals do not fit the pattern ; they either would have abolished the death penalty as a federal sentencing alternative or would have imposed a moratorium upon executions .

the reauthorization act changes procedures associated with federal capital cases including those relating to air piracy cases arising before 1994 , capital offenses under federal drug laws , appointment of counsel in capital cases , and habeas procedures for state capital petitioners .

title iii of the reauthorization act , designated the reducing crime and terrorism at america's seaports act , creates three new federal capital offenses: 18 u.s.c .

2282a ( devices or dangerous substances in waters of the united states likely to destroy or damage ships or to interfere with maritime ; causing a death ) ; 18 u.s.c .

2283 ( transportation of explosive , biological , chemical , or radioactive or nuclear materials ; causing a death ) ; and 18 u.s.c .

2291 ( destruction of vessel or maritime facility ; intentionally causing aâ death ) .

the provisions supplement federal capital offenses created earlier , eg , 18 u.s.c .

2280 ( violence against maritime navigation where death results ) , 229 & 229a ( possession of chemical weapons where death results ) , 1111 ( murder within the maritime jurisdiction of the united states ) .

two other port security bills would have suggested similar new death penalty offenses , h.r .

2651 and s. 378 ( as reported ) ( proposed 18 u.s.c .

2282a , 2283 , and 2291 ) , and a third would have offered three slightly less comparable offenses , h.r .

173 ( proposed 18 u.s.c .

1372 ( destruction of vessel or maritime facility ; if death results ) , 2280a ( devices or substances in waters of the united states likely to destroy or damage ships ; if death results ) , and 2282 ( malicious dumping ; if death results ) ) .

the bills drafted to counter gang violenceâ h.r .

4472 and h.r .

1279 , h.r .

970 , and s. 155 âfrequently included two new federal death penalty offenses .

one of the proposed offenses would have proscribed the use of interstate facilities with the intent to commit multiple murders and would have been a capital offense where death resulted .

the other , modeled after the provision that condemned the use of a firearm during or in relation to a crime of violence or a drug offense , would have outlawed crimes of violence committed during or in relation to a drug trafficking offense and would have made the offense punishable by death if a death results .

a few bills would have made it a federal capital offense to kill a police officer under various circumstances .

for example , h.r .

2363 would have outlawed killing a peace officer and fleeing the country , proposed 18 u.s.c .

1121 ( c ) .

h.r .

1751 and h.r .

2194 would have prohibited murdering federally funded state or local law enforcement officers , proposed 18 u.s.c .

1123 .

other proposed new federal capital offenses would have included: agroterrorism when death results , proposed 18 u.s.c .

2339d ( s. 1532 ) ; interference with federal disaster relief efforts if death results , proposed 18 u.s.c .

1370 ( h.r .

3728 ) ; death resulting from a violation of 18 u.s.c .

1590 ( trafficking in persons ) thatâ involves raping or kidnaping more than one person , proposed 18 u.s.c .

1590 ( s. 2437 ) ; death resulting from a violation of proposed 18 u.s.c .

555 ( s. 2611 ) that proscribes evading immigration , customs or agricultural inspection at the border ; â and death resulting from the commission of federal crimes of terrorism , violations of 18 u.s.c .

175 ( biological weapons ) , 175b ( biological materials ) , 229 ( chemical weapons ) , 831 ( nuclear materials ) , or of 42 u.s.c .

2284 ( atomic weapons ) , or conspiracies or attempts to commit such crimes or violations , proposed 18 u.s.c .

2339e ( h.r .

3060 , h.r .

5939 , s. 3882 , and s. 3848 ) .

section 110 of the reauthorization act merges 18 u.s.c .

1992 ( 2000 ed. ) .

 ( wrecking trains ) and 18 u.s.c .

1993 ( 2000 ed. ) .

 ( attacks on mass transit ) into a new 18 u.s.c .

1992 .

the train wreck offense was a capital offense ; the mass transit offense was not ; under the new section both are now capital offenses , 18 u.s.c .

1992 .

the most common example of a proposed death penalty sentencing option for an existing crime came from some of the child safety bills , many of which would have made the death penalty available when a child died as a result the commission of a federal crime of violence or some other federal crime: s. 956 ( crime of violence , proposed 18 u.s.c .

3559 ( d ) ) ; h.r .

2388 ( same ) ; h.r .

3132 ( same ) ; h.r .

4472 ( same ) ; and h.r .

3860 ( violations of 18 u.s.c .

ch.110 ( sexual exploitation of children ) , ch .

117 transportation of illegal sexual activity ) , or 1591 ( sex trafficking in children ) , proposed 18 u.s.c .

2245 ( b ) ) .

congress adopted a variation of this theme in the adam walsh child protection and safety act when it amended 18 u.s.c .

2245 to read , "a person who , in the course of an offense under this chapter [chapter 109a] , or sections 1591[ ( sex trafficking in children] , 2251 , 2251a , 2260 , 2421[transportation for sexual purposes] , 2422[coercion or enticement to travel for sexual purposes] , 2423[transportation followed by sexual abuse of minors] , or 2425[interstate transmission of information about a minor] , murders an individual shall be punished by death or imprisoned for any term of years or for life. .

the section had previously covered only death resulting violations of chapter 109a , 18 u.s.c .

2245 ( 2000 ed. ) .

which then as now included sections 2251 , 2251a and 2260 .

the gang bills would have rewritten the federal criminal gang statute ( 18 u.s.c .

521 ) to permit imposition of capital punishment for a death - resulting violation of the newly crafted provisions or of the travel act ( 18 u.s.c .

1952 ) : h.r .

1279 , proposed 18 u.s.c .

521 , 1952 ; s. 155 , proposed 18 u.s.c .

523 , 1952 ; h.r .

4472 , proposed 18 u.s.c .

521 , 1952 ; see also , h.r .

970 , proposed 18 u.s.c .

523 .

h.r .

3060 , h.r .

5939 , s. 3882 , and s. 3848 would have made capital offenses of several death - resulting terrorism - related offenses that are now punishable by no more than life imprisonment , specifically , proposed 18 u.s.c .

832 ( participating in foreign nuclear or other weapon of mass destruction programs ) , proposed 18 u.s.c .

2332g ( anti - aircraft missiles ) , proposed 18 u.s.c .

2332h ( radiological dispersal devices ) , proposed 18 u.s.c .

175c ( smallpox virus ) , and proposed 18 u.s.c .

42 u.s.c .

2272 ( atomic weapons ) .

it is possible that the drafters of h.r .

3060 also intended to treat receipt of military training from a foreign terrorist organization , 18 u.s.c .

2339d , like treason and espionage ; that is , to make it a capital offense even if no death results from commission of the offense .

the statutes that outlaw treason and espionage make them punishable by death or a term of imprisonment , 18 u.s.c .

2381 , 794 .

section 3591 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the federal capital punishment procedures provides that treason or espionage are punishable by death if execution is found justified after considering the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in section 3592 .

section 3592 ( b ) lists three aggravating factors for treason and espionage cases , i.e. , ( 1 ) the offender has a prior espionage or treason conviction , ( 2 ) the offense involved a grave risk to national security , and ( 3 ) the offense involved a grave risk of death .

violation of section 2339d is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years , 18 u.s.c .

2339d ( a ) .

h.r .

3060 would have made no change in section 2339d , but it would have amended section 3591 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the capital procedures provisions to say that violations of sections 2381 ( treason ) , 794 ( espionage ) , or 2339d ( terrorist training ) might be punished by death if execution were found justified after considering the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in section 3592 , proposed 18 u.s.c .

3591 ( a ) ( 1 ) .

it also would have amended the list of 3592 ( c ) aggravating factors to add a fourth factor , i.e. , the defense involved substantial planning by the defendant , proposed 18 u.s.c .

3592 ( c ) ( 4 ) .

assuming the conforming amendment to section 2339dâmaking it a capital offenseâwas an oversight and in spite of the proposal's caption ( "addition of terrorism to death penalty offenses not resulting in death" ) , it is not clear that the courts would permit imposition of the death penalty for a violation of section 2339d unless the offense also involved a first degree murder .

the eighth amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause precludes imposing the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman by an individual already under a sentence of life imprisonment at the time of the rape ; it precludes imposition of the death penalty even in the case of murder unless the defendant at least acted intentionally or actedâ with reckless indifference to human life while participating in a felony involving a murder ; and since the court's decision in furman v. georgia , it has never been called upon to approve , and consequently has never approved , imposition of the death penalty for a crime that did not involve murder .

h.r .

4923 / s. 122 would have repealed federal death penalty provisions and would have barred imposition or execution of any capital sentence for violation of federal law .

it made no mention of capital punishment imposed for violation of state law .

h.r .

379 , on the other hand , would have set a ten year moratorium on imposition and execution of capital sentences in any state in which an individual originally sentenced to death had subsequently been judicially found innocent .

it said nothing of capital punishment imposed or executed under federal law .

 ( c ) if one of the conditions in subsection ( b ) has occurred , no federal court thereafter shall have the authority to enter a stay of execution in the case , unless the court of appeals approves the filing of a second or successive application under section 2244 ( b ) .
