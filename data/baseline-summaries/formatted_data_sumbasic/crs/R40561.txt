this section outlines how medicare part b premiums and social security cost - of - living adjustments ( colas ) are calculated and how the cola affects part b premiums .

the following section examines what happens when medicare part b premiums rise but social security benefits do not .

since 1975 , when the automatic social security cola was established , a cola has been paid every year through 2009 .

however , there was no social security cola in 2010 and ssa announced on october 15 , 2010 , that there will be no social security cola in 2011 .

the interaction between social security benefits and medicare premiums is a complex one that raises a number of issues .

these issues may include the impact of having no social security cola on seniors who are projected to face higher part d premiums and higher out - of - pocket medical costs , the impact of the hold harmless provision on the part b premiums paid by beneficiaries who are not held harmless , and other issues .

several bills before the 111 th congress would address one or more of these issues .

none of the bills propose any relief to states , which bear the additional burden of increased part b premiums for the medicaid eligibles .

several bills considered during the 111 th congress contained provisions to address medicare part b financing issues created as a result of having no cost - of - living increase to the social security benefits in 2010 .

however , only one bill related to this issue was ever voted on ( and passed ) by the house ; as of the date of this report , the senate has yet to pass any bills on this issue in the 111 th congress .

on march 31 , 2009 , representative wexler introduced h.r .

1832 , the medicare prescription drug affordability act of 2009 , which would amend the social security act to limit the increase in premium costs for beneficiaries under the medicare prescription drug program to no more than the social security cost - of - living adjustment , among other provisions .

the bill was referred to the ways and means and energy and commerce committees .

on july 14 , 2009 , representative dingell introduced h.r .

3200 , america's affordable health choices act of 2009 .

the discussion draft of h.r .

3200 contained a proposal to suspend , temporarily , the requirement that the part b premium revenues cover 25% of medicare part b , protecting all medicare beneficiaries from the effect of the projected part b premium increase and covering the resulting financing shortfall using general revenues .

cbo estimated that this proposal ( section 1233 of division b of the house tri - committee health reform discussion draft , as released on june 19 , 2009 ) would have required $1.8 billion in additional outlays in 2010 and $0.6 billion in 2011 .

however , this provision was not included in any of the versions of the health care bill reported out of the three committees of jurisdiction .

on september 23 , 2009 , representative titus introduced h.r .

3631 , the medicare premium fairness act , which would freeze the 2010 monthly medicare part b premium at the 2009 premium level .

this premium freeze would be offset by transferring $576 million from the medicare improvement fund , which was established in 2008 under p.l .

110-252 .

h.r .

3631 passed the house on september 24 , 2009 , by a vote of 406-18 .

several bills introduced in the 111 th congress would provide either a cola for social security benefits or a one - time payment to beneficiaries .

most of these bills do not directly address the issue of part b premiums but rather focus on payments to social security beneficiaries , veterans , and retired railroad workers .

several bills in the 111 th congress would provide a positive cola increase .

a positive cola increase in 2010 would result in fewer beneficiaries being held harmless from medicare part b premium increases .

representative kagen introduced h.r .

3211 , the cost of living equity act , which would amend the social security act to provide that the cola applied to social security benefits should in no case be less than the percentage increase in compensation provided to members of congress .

representative jones introduced h.r .

3557 , which would provide a cola increase in 2010 equal to the average increase in the 10 calendar years preceding 2009 ( about 2.6% ) .

representative alexander introduced h.r .

3572 , the cola assistance act of 2009 , which would deem the 2010 cola to be 2.9% ( half the 2009 cola ) .

representative defazio has introduced h.r .

2365 , the consumer price index for elderly consumers act of 2009 , to require bls to publish a monthly cpi - e representing consumption typical for individuals who are age 62 and over .

representative gonzalez has introduced h.r .

2429 , the consumer price index for elderly consumers act of 2009 , to call on bls to publish a revised , complete cpi - e. representative duncan introduced h.r .

5305 , the cpi for seniors act of 2010 , to establish a cpi - s specifically for senior citizens that would address concerns with the cpi - e methodology .

representative deutch introduced h.r .

5834 , "preserving our promise to seniors act," which among other provisions would direct bls to publish a cpi - e that accurately tracks changes in seniors' consumption over time and would base the social security cola on the cpi - e. h.r .

5834 contains several other provisions , including a one - time payment in each year that social security pays no cola .

the social security administration ( ssa ) scored h.r .

5834 using the assumption that the cpi - e would result in an average annual cola of 3.0% per year , which is 0.2 percentage points higher than the average annual increase assumed for the cpi - w under the trustees' intermediate assumptions .

ssa found that the provision to base the social security cola on the cpi - e instead of the cpi - w would decrease ( worsen ) the long - range balance by an estimated 0.34% of taxable payroll ; ssa's score for the entire package is discussed below .

senator lincoln introduced s. 2926 , the economic fairness for seniors act , which , among other provisions including a one - time payment of $250 to beneficiaries in 2010 ( discussed below ) , would also require the bls to study and report on the potential use of the cpi - e .

several other bills would provide one - time additional social security payments in 2010 .

representative mccarthy introduced h.r .

3536 , the social security cola fix for 2010 act , which would provide a one - time social security benefit increase of $150 in 2010 to all social security beneficiaries who were entitled for both the month of enactment and a month 180 days after enactment .

ssa found that h.r .

3536 would result in payments to about 50.2 million oasdi beneficiaries for a total expenditure of $7.5 billion , reducing the oasdi actuarial balance by less than 0.005% of taxable payroll .

representative mccarthy also introduced h.r .

3672 , the social security cola fix for 2010 act , which would provide a one - time benefit increase of $150 in 2010 and also eliminate the requirement that there be a social security cola for an adjustment to the social security contribution and benefit base to occur .

representative defazio introduced h.r .

3597 , the emergency senior citizens relief act of 2009 , and senator sanders has introduced a companion bill , s. 1685 , in the senate .

both h.r .

3597 and s. 1685 would provide a one - time additional payment of $250 in 2010 to all adult social security recipients ( including ssdi beneficiaries ) , adult railroad retirees , beneficiaries of supplemental security income , and adults receiving veterans' benefits .

ssa scored s. 1685 , as discussed below under the description of s. 1685 .

representative defazio has also introduced h.r .

3810 , which would provide a one - time $250 payment to be financed by a temporary application , in 2010 , of the fica tax to wages and self - employment income in excess of $1,290,000 .

representative granger introduced h.r .

3677 , the save our seniors' social security act of 2009 , which would provide a one - time payment of $280 to individuals who had received social security or railroad retirement benefit payments in any of the months of december 2009 , january 2010 , or february 2010 to be financed with unobligated monies from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 , known as arra ) .

representative brown - waite introduced h.r .

3691 , the seniors and veterans economic stimulus ( "saves" ) act of 2009 , to provide a $250 payment ( as provided by arra in 2009 ) to seniors and veterans in 2010 ; this additional amount would be paid for by redirecting unobligated arra funds .

representative adler introduced h.r .

4429 , the restoring the social security cola act , which would increase benefits for certain federal programs , including social security , by $250 for one month in 2010 , intended to be equivalent to the 2% cola received by federal employees in 2010 .

funding would be provided from unobligated arra monies .

representative deutch introduced h.r .

5834 to provide a payment of $250 ( indexed to the cpi - e ) to beneficiaries of social security , supplemental security income , railroad retirement pensions , and veterans disability compensation or pension benefits in each year , including 2011 , when there is no cola .

the bill would also require bls to base the social security cola on changes in the cpi - e , extend the social security payroll tax of 12.4% to all earnings starting in 2017 , pay benefits on additional earnings subject to tax using a modified benefit formula , and raise a point of order against privatization of social security benefits .

ssa scored h.r .

5834 and found that it would be expected to reduce the 75-year actuarial imbalance from - 1.92% of taxable payroll ( under intermediate assumptions ) to - 0.13% of payroll .

representative pomeroy introduced h.r .

5987 , the seniors protection act of 2010 , to provide a one - time $250 payment for all social security beneficiaries including children and disabled beneficiaries receiving ssdi , railroad retirees , ssi recipients , and veterans in the event that no cola is payable in 2011 .

the one - time payment would be disregarded for the purposes of all federal and federally assisted programs and would not be considered income for the purposes of taxation .

representative richardson introduced h.r .

6294 , the social security safety dividend act , to provide a payment of $250 to all social security beneficiaries including children and disabled beneficiaries receiving ssdi , ssi recipients , railroad retirees , and veterans in the event that no cola is payable in calendar year 2011 .

the one - time payment would be disregarded for the purposes of all federal and federally assisted programs and would not be considered income for the purposes of taxation .

representative rothman has circulated a letter to president obama calling on the president to include a one - time payment of $500 to social security beneficiaries in lieu of a cola in 2010 and 2011 .

senator lincoln has introduced s. 2926 , the economic fairness for seniors act , to provide a one - time $250 payment to persons who received a $250 payment under arra ( p.l .

111-5 ) , as well as a $250 tax credit for certain government retirees .

the bill would also require bls to study and report on whether the cpi - e reflects the elderly's cost of living more accurately than the cpi - w .

senator sanders introduced s. 1685 , the emergency senior citizens relief act of 2009 , to provide an emergency benefit payment of $250 to various persons who were entitled to benefits in august , september , or october of 2009 .

this is the companion bill to h.r .

3597 , discussed above .

the social security administration estimated that s. 1685 would result in 2010 payments to 55.6 million individuals ( 48.9 million adult oasdi beneficiaries , 5.1 million ssi recipients who are not also oasdi beneficiaries , 1.4 million veterans compensation and pension beneficiaries , and 0.2 million adult railroad retirement and disability beneficiaries ) and that payments would total about $13.9 billion , of which $12.2 billion would be to adult social security beneficiaries .

h.r .

3597 and s. 1685 would fully pay for the one - time $250 payment by applying the social security payroll ( fica ) tax to household earnings above $250,000 and below $359,000 in 2010 , with no credit of the additional tax contributions towards benefits .

ssa estimates that the bill would have essentially no effect on the federal unified budget balance , while oasdi would experience a negligible positive effect .

on march 3 , 2010 , the senate rejected a procedural motion concerning senator sanders' proposed amendment ( s.amdt .

3353 ) to h.r .

4213 to provide an emergency payment of $250 to seniors , veterans , and persons with disabilities in 2010 .

also on march 3 , a similar amendment offered by senator burr ( s.amdt .

3390 ) was rejected on procedural grounds .

in october 2010 , speaker of the house nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid announced their support for consideration of a one - time , $250 payment to social security and certain other beneficiaries when congress returns after the november elections .

on october 15 , 2010 , the white house press office announced that the president supports efforts to provide a $250 payment to seniors , veterans , and people with disabilities .
