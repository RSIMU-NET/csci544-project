marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the united states .

in 2013 , an estimated 19.8 million individuals in the united states aged 12 or older ( 7.5% of this population ) were current ( past month ) users of marijuana .

while reported marijuana use is similar to that in 2012 , it has generally increased since 2007 when 5.8% of individuals aged 12 or older were current users of marijuana .

the past decade has seen a decline in youth perceptions of risk tied to smoking marijuana ; however , the rate of past - month marijuana use among youth declined between 2011 and 2013 ( 7.1% ) .

youth also perceive that obtaining marijuana — if they desire it — is relatively easy .

indeed , marijuana availability in the united states has increased , according to the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) .

this increase has been linked to factors such as rising marijuana production in mexico and increasing marijuana cultivation in the united states led by criminal networks including mexican drug trafficking organizations .

the uptick in availability and use of marijuana in the united states is coupled with a general shift in public attitudes toward the substance .

in 1969 , 12% of the surveyed population supported legalizing marijuana ; today , more than half ( 52% ) of surveyed adults feel that marijuana should be legalized .

in addition , 60% indicate that the federal government should not enforce federal laws prohibiting marijuana use in those states that allow for its use .

marijuana is currently listed as a schedule i controlled substance under the controlled substances act ( csa ) .

this indicates that the federal government has determined that ( a ) the drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse .

 ( b ) the drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states .

 ( c ) there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision .

u.s. federal drug control policies — and specifically those positions relating to marijuana — continue to generate debates among policy makers , law enforcement officials , scholars , and the public .

even prior to the federal government's move in 1970 to criminalize the manufacture , distribution , dispensation , and possession of marijuana , there were significant discussions over marijuana's place in american society .

while the federal government maintains marijuana's current place as a schedule i controlled substance , states have established a range of views and policies regarding its medical and recreational use .

as of november 2014 , over half of all states and the district of columbia allowed for the medical use of marijuana in some capacity .

in the november 2012 elections , voters in washington state and colorado voted to legalize , regulate , and tax small amounts of marijuana for recreational use .

in the november 2014 elections , voters in the district of columbia , oregon , and alaska also passed recreational legalization initiatives .

these moves have spurred a number of questions regarding their potential implications for related federal law enforcement activities and for the nation's drug policies on the whole .

this report provides a background on federal marijuana policy as well as an overview of state trends with respect to marijuana decriminalization and legalization — for both medical and recreational uses .

it then analyzes relevant issues for u.s. federal law enforcement as well as for the criminal organizations involved in producing , distributing , and profiting from the black market sale of marijuana .

this report also outlines a number of related policy questions that congress may confront .

of note , it does not discuss the legal issues associated with state - level initiatives to legalize marijuana for recreational use .

until 1937 , the growth and use of marijuana was legal under federal law .

the federal government unofficially banned marijuana under the marihuana tax act of 1937 ( mta ; p.l .

75-238 ) .

the mta imposed a strict regulation requiring a high - cost transfer tax stamp for every sale of marijuana , and these stamps were rarely issued by the federal government .

shortly after passage of the mta , all states made the possession of marijuana illegal .

the controlled substances act ( csa ) , enacted as title ii of the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of 1970 ( p.l .

91-513 ) , placed the control of marijuana and other plant , drug , and chemical substances under federal jurisdiction regardless of state regulations and laws .

in designating marijuana as a schedule i controlled substance , this legislation officially prohibited the manufacture , distribution , dispensation , and possession of marijuana .

as part of the csa , the national commission on marihuana and drug abuse , also known as the shafer commission , was established to study marijuana in the united states .

specifically , this commission was charged with examining issues such as ( a ) the extent of use of marihuana in the united states to include its various sources of users , number of arrests , number of convictions , amount of marihuana seized , type of user , nature of use ; ( b ) an evaluation of the efficacy of existing marihuana laws ; ( c ) a study of the pharmacology of marihuana and its immediate and long - term effects , both physiological and psychological ; ( d ) the relationship of marihuana use to aggressive behavior and crime ; ( e ) the relationship between marihuana and the use of other drugs ; and ( f ) the international control of marihuana .

the shafer commission , in concluding its review , produced two reports: ( 1 ) marihuana: a signal of misunderstanding , and ( 2 ) drug use in america: problem in perspective .

in its first report , the shafer commission discussed the perception of marijuana as a major social problem and how it came to be viewed as such .

it made a number of recommendations , including the development of a "social control policy seeking to discourage marihuana use , while concentrating primarily on the prevention of heavy and very heavy use. .

in this first report , the shafer commission also called the application of the criminal law in cases of personal use of marijuana "constitutionally suspect" and declared that "total prohibition is functionally inappropriate. .

of note , federal criminalization and prohibition of marijuana was never altered , either administratively or legislatively , to comply with the recommendations of the shafer commission .

in its second report , the shafer commission reviewed the use of all drugs in the united states , not solely marijuana .

it examined the origins of the drug problem in the united states , including the social costs of drug use , and once again made specific recommendations regarding social policy .

among other conclusions regarding marijuana , the shafer commission indicated that aggressive behavior generally cannot be attributed to marijuana use .

the shafer commission also reaffirmed its previous findings and recommendations regarding marijuana and added the following statement: the risk potential of marihuana is quite low compared to the potent psychoactive substances , and even its widespread consumption does not involve social cost now associated with most of the stimulants and depressants ( jones , 1973 ; tinklenberg , 1971 ) .

nonetheless , the commission remains persuaded that availability of this drug should not be institutionalized at this time .

at the conclusion of the second report , the shafer commission recommended that congress launch a subsequent commission to reexamine the broad issues surrounding drug use and societal response .

while a number of congressionally directed commissions regarding drugs have since been established , no such commission has been directed to review the comprehensive issues of drug use , abuse , and response in the united states .

going forward , policy makers may debate the utility of a complete re - examination of federal drug policy or , more narrowly , federal marijuana policy .

over the past few decades , some states have deviated from an across - the - board prohibition of marijuana .

evolving state - level positions on marijuana include decriminalization initiatives , legal exceptions for medical use , and legalization of certain quantities for recreational use .

federal law enforcement has generally tailored its efforts to target criminal networks rather than individual criminals ; its stance regarding drug ( particularly marijuana ) offenders appears consistent with this position .

in the years since the enactment of the csa and the establishment of the u.s. drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , federal counter - drug efforts have largely been focused toward traffickers and distributors of illicit drugs , rather than the low - level users of illicit substances .

after some states began to legalize the medical use of marijuana , the department of justice ( doj ) reaffirmed that marijuana growth , possession , and trafficking remain crimes under federal law irrespective of how individual states may change their laws and positions on marijuana .

doj has continued to enforce the csa in those states , and federal agents and u.s .

attorneys have arrested and prosecuted medical marijuana producers ( growers ) and distributors for violations of federal drug laws regardless of their compliance with state laws .

doj has clarified federal marijuana policy through several memos providing direction for u.s .

attorneys in states that allow the medical use of marijuana .

in the so - called ogden memo of 2009 , deputy attorney general david ogden reiterated that combating major drug traffickers remains a central priority and stated: [t]he prosecution of significant traffickers of illegal drugs , including marijuana , and the disruption of illegal drug manufacturing and trafficking networks continues to be a core priority in the [justice] department's efforts against narcotics and dangerous drugs , and the department's investigative and prosecutorial resources should be directed towards these objectives .

as a general matter , pursuit of these priorities should not focus federal resources in your states on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana .

in a follow - up memorandum to u.s .

attorneys , deputy attorney general james cole restated that enforcing the csa remained a core priority of doj , even in states that had legalized medical marijuana .

he clarified that "the ogden memorandum was never intended to shield such activities from federal enforcement action and prosecution , even where those activities purport to comply with state law. .

in his memo , deputy attorney general cole warned those who might assist medical marijuana dispensaries in any way .

he stated that "persons who are in the business of cultivating , selling or distributing marijuana , and those who knowingly facilitate such activities [emphasis added] , are in violation of the controlled substances act , regardless of state law. .

this has been interpreted by some to mean , for example , that building owners and managers are in violation of the csa by allowing medical marijuana dispensaries to operate in their buildings .

deputy attorney general cole further warned that "those who engage in transactions involving the proceeds of such activity [cultivating , selling , or distributing of marijuana] may be in violation of federal money laundering statutes and other federal financial laws. .

this warning may be one reason why medical marijuana dispensaries have had difficulty accessing bank services .

in an august 2013 memorandum , deputy attorney general cole stated that while marijuana remains an illegal substance under the controlled substances act , the department of justice would focus its resources on the "most significant threats in the most effective , consistent , and rational way. .

the memo outlined eight enforcement priorities for the department of justice: preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors ; preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises , gangs , and cartels ; preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states ; preventing state - authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity ; preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana ; preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use ; preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands ; and preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property .

these priorities are to guide u.s .

attorneys and federal law enforcement to focus their resources and efforts on those who interfere with any of these priorities , regardless of state law .

in an interview with abc news , president obama noted that "[it] would not make sense from a prioritization point of view for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law that's legal. .

of note , under the supremacy clause of the u.s. constitution , state laws that conflict with federal law are generally preempted and therefore are void ; however , courts have generally not viewed the relationship between state and federal marijuana laws in such a manner .

further , congress did not intend that the csa should displace all state laws associated with controlled substances .

it is unclear whether or how the department of justice is tracking activity to ensure that standards are being met in states that have legalized marijuana .

at minimum , it appears that the dea discusses trafficking issues with state and local law enforcement .

according to dea administrator michele leonhart , there has been increased marijuana trafficking in states surrounding colorado since colorado legalized for recreational use .

a number of criminal networks rely on profits generated from the sale of illegal drugs — including marijuana — in the united states .

mexican drug trafficking organizations control more of the wholesale distribution of marijuana than other major drug trafficking organizations in the united states .

one estimate has placed the proportion of u.s. - consumed marijuana that was imported from mexico at somewhere between 40% and 67% .

while the mexican criminal networks control the wholesale marijuana distribution of illicit drugs in the united states , they "are not generally directly involved in retail distribution of illicit drugs. .

in order to facilitate the distribution and sale of drugs in the united states , mexican drug traffickers have formed relationships with u.s. street gangs , prison gangs , and outlaw motorcycle gangs .

although these gangs have historically been involved with retail - level drug distribution , their ties to the mexican criminal networks have allowed them to become increasingly involved at the wholesale level as well .

these gangs facilitate the movement of illicit drugs to urban , suburban , and rural areas of the united states .

not only do these domestic gangs distribute and sell the drugs , but they also "provide warehousing , security , and / or transportation services as well. .

barrio azteca is a prominent u.s. prison gang with ties to mexican drug trafficking organizations .

barrio azteca primarily generates money from smuggling marijuana , heroin , and cocaine across the southwest border for the drug trafficking organizations — namely , the juárez cartel — but they are also involved in other crimes , such as extortion , kidnapping , and alien smuggling .

a number of organizations have assessed the potential profits generated from illicit drug sales , both worldwide and in the united states , but "[e]stimates of marijuana ... revenues suffer particularly high rates of uncertainty. .

the former national drug intelligence center ( ndic ) , for instance , estimated that the sale of illicit drugs in the united states generates between $18 billion and $39 billion in u.s. wholesale drug proceeds for the colombian and mexican drug trafficking organizations annually .

the proportion that is attributable to marijuana sales , however , is unknown .

without a clear understanding of ( 1 ) actual proceeds generated by the sale of illicit drugs in the united states , ( 2 ) the proportion of total proceeds attributable to the sale of marijuana , and ( 3 ) the proportion of marijuana sales controlled by criminal organizations and affiliated gangs , any estimates of how marijuana legalization might impact the drug trafficking organizations are purely speculative .

marijuana proceeds are generated at many points along the supply chain , including production , transportation , and distribution .

experts have debated which aspects of this chain — and the related proceeds — would be most heavily impacted by marijuana legalization .

in addition , the potential impact of marijuana legalization in four of the 50 u.s. states and the district of colombia ( complicated by varying legal frameworks and regulatory regimes ) may be more difficult to model than the impact of federal marijuana legalization .

for instance , in evaluating the potential fiscal impact of the 2012 washington and colorado legalization initiatives on the profits of mexican drug trafficking organizations , the organization of american states ( oas ) hypothesized that "[a]t the extreme , mexican drug trafficking organizations could lose some 20 to 25 percent of their drug export income , and a smaller , though difficult to estimate , percentage of their total revenues. .

other scholars have , in estimating the potential financial impact of marijuana legalization , based their estimates on a hypothetical federal legalization of marijuana .

under this scenario , small scale growers at the start of the marijuana production - to - consumption chain might be put out of business by professional farmers , a few dozen of which "could produce enough marijuana to meet u.s. consumption at prices small - scale producers couldn't possibly match. .

large drug trafficking organizations generate a majority of their marijuana - related income ( which some estimates place at between $1.1 billion to $2.0 billion ) from exporting the drug to the united states and selling it to wholesalers on the u.s. side of the border .

this revenue could be jeopardized if the united states were to legalize the production and consumption of recreational marijuana .

aside from the fiscal impact of u.s. marijuana legalization on drug revenues generated by the criminal networks in mexico , some have also questioned whether there might be an impact on the levels of drug trafficking - related violence in mexico .

in short , there is no definitive answer to this question , and arguments have been presented to support both the stance that marijuana legalization in the united states could drive violence higher ( because of increased competition for the scarce revenues that would be generated from an expected dwindling market of mexican - produced marijuana ) and the position that such legalization could help in reducing drug trafficking - related violence ( because the profit motive for entering and dominating the drug trade might be reduced ) .

either way , "[a]ny changes in cannabis markets will take time to develop and may occur simultaneously with other changes that also affect violence rates in mexico. .

the diversification of drug trafficking organizations' illicit activities could also mitigate the impacts they might feel from various levels of marijuana legalization in the united states .

while these criminal networks might generate a substantial portion of their proceeds from the growth , production , transportation , and sale of marijuana , they have enhanced their dominance over the market of other illicit substances .

mexican drug trafficking organizations control more of the wholesale cocaine , heroin , and methamphetamine distribution than any other major drug trafficking organizations in the united states .

in addition to their drug - related illegal activities , mexican criminal networks have diversified their operations , adding to their portfolio crimes ranging from kidnapping and extortion to human trafficking and intellectual property rights violations .

profits from these enterprises may help supplement their drug trafficking - related income .

given the differences in marijuana policies of the federal government and those of alaska , colorado , oregon , washington , and the district of columbia , congress may choose to address state legalization initiatives in a number of ways , or not at all .

there are a host of options available to policy makers should they choose to address state - level legalization of marijuana , including affirming federal marijuana policy , exercising oversight over federal law enforcement activities , or incentivizing state policies through the provision or denial of certain funds .

alternatively , congress may opt not to address the policy conflict with state legalization of marijuana .

for over 40 years , the federal government's official position , as implied by sustaining marijuana's position as a schedule i controlled substance under the csa , has been that marijuana is a dangerous drug with no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse .

since passing the csa , congress has not altered marijuana's status as a schedule i drug .

in addressing states' most recent legalization efforts , congress could take one of two general routes .

on one hand , congress could elect to take no action , thereby upholding the federal government's current marijuana policy .

on the other hand , congress could choose to reevaluate marijuana's placement as a schedule i controlled substance .

on this path , congress could consider a variety of actions .

for one , it could once again exercise its authority to establish a policy commission to examine marijuana , its impacts , and the efficacy of current marijuana laws in the united states , just as it did in establishing the shafer commission .

additionally , congress could direct the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) and / or the attorney general to reevaluate marijuana and its position within the schedules of controlled substances .

of note , the attorney general — through the dea , and in consultation with the secretary of hhs — may reschedule a substance or remove a substance altogether from control .

in addition to establishing commissions and directing additional research , congressional options include legislatively amending the csa .

this could involve keeping — with caveats — marijuana as a schedule i substance , moving it to a different schedule , or removing it from the schedule altogether .

without altering marijuana's position as a schedule i controlled substance on the whole , one option might be to build additional flexibility into existing law .

for example , policy makers could amend the csa to make certain criminal liability exceptions for individuals operating in compliance with state marijuana laws .

upon reevaluation , should congress determine that marijuana no longer meets the criteria to be a schedule i substance , it could take legislative action to remove marijuana from schedule i of the csa .

in doing so , congress may ( 1 ) place marijuana on one of the other schedules ( ii , iii , iv , or v ) of controlled substances or ( 2 ) remove marijuana as a controlled substance altogether ; however , if marijuana remains a controlled substance under the csa under any schedule , then this would not eliminate the existing policy conflict with those states that have legalized to allow recreational use .

if congress chooses to remove marijuana as a controlled substance , it could alternatively seek to regulate and tax marijuana .

if congress were to take this route of legalizing and regulating marijuana , and given agencies' current authorities over controlled and legal substances , one path may then be to transfer jurisdiction over marijuana from the dea to the atf for regulation .

in exercising its oversight authorities , congress may choose to examine the extent to which the carrying out of federal law enforcement missions might be impacted by state initiatives to decriminalize or legalize — either for medical or recreational purposes — marijuana .

for instance , policy makers may elect to review the mission of each federal law enforcement agency involved in enforcing the csa and examine how its drug - related investigations may be influenced by the varying state - level policies regarding marijuana .

as noted , federal law enforcement has generally prioritized the investigation of drug traffickers and dealers over that of low - level drug users .

policy makers may question whether these priorities are consistent across states with different forms of drug policies regarding marijuana .

policy makers may question whether federal law enforcement priorities have shifted in states that have altered their marijuana laws and regulations .

with respect to the coordination of federal , state , and local efforts to combat drug trafficking networks and other drug offenders , one issue policy makers may debate is whether or how to incentivize task forces , fusion centers , and other coordinating bodies charged with combating drug - related crimes .

before determining whether to increase , decrease , or maintain funding for coordinated efforts such as task forces , policy makers may consider whether state and local counterparts are able to effectively achieve task force goals if the respective state marijuana policy is not in agreement with federal marijuana policy .

policy makers may choose to evaluate whether certain drug task forces are sustainable in states that have established policies that are either inconsistent — such as in states that have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana possession — or are in direct conflict — including states that have legalized either medical or recreational marijuana — with federal drug policy .

for instance , might there be any internal conflicts that prevent task force partners from collaborating effectively to carry out their investigations ? .

as noted , in responding to states with recreational legalization initiatives , the department of justice ( doj ) issued federal enforcement priorities for states with legal marijuana .

it is unclear whether or how doj is tracking activity in these states to ensure that these priorities are being emphasized .

the metrics to evaluate these priorities , whether in place or not , are also unknown .

for example , one of the eight enforcement priorities listed by deputy attorney general cole was to prevent the diversion of marijuana to other states .

while it seems the dea is aware of increased marijuana trafficking from colorado to kansas , it is unclear what level of increased trafficking might trigger action by the federal government against state marijuana laws .

congress may choose to exercise oversight over doj's enforcement priorities and metrics for tracking illicit activity in the states .

congress may also request research or investigation of this issue outside of actions by the obama administration .

congress has long used the provision of monies as a carrot to influence states' policies .

if policy makers are interested in affecting states' drug policies , one means may be through some form of policy - contingent funding .

for instance , congress could consider compliance with federal marijuana policy as an eligibility requirement to receive certain federal grant funds .

in the past , congress has exercised its authority to withhold federal grant funds to states in order to achieve agreement with federal policy .

for example , under the sex offender registration and notification act ( sorna ; p.l .

109-248 ) , congress established a set of minimum standards for sex offender registration and notification for all 50 states , the district of columbia , territories , and federally recognized american indian tribes .

to assure compliance with these standards , sorna mandated a 10% reduction in annual formula funding under the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant ( jag ) program for the states , territories , and district of columbia if these jurisdictions did not substantially implement sorna by july 27 , 2009 .

congress may choose to establish similar financial penalties to influence states' drug policies or ensure consistency between state - level laws and those outlined under the csa .

whether or not linking funding to state - level compliance with federal drug policy standards might produce the desired outcomes is unknown .

one question that remains is whether congress could withhold sufficient money from programs such as jag to provide a true incentive for states to acquiesce to federal drug policy requirements .

might states that legalize and tax marijuana generate enough revenue to offset any losses from grant program funding that congress might impose ? .

in addition , could states see some savings in criminal justice expenditures from not investigating , prosecuting , and incarcerating low - level marijuana offenders ? .

these savings could also compensate for any losses from congressionally imposed financial penalties .
