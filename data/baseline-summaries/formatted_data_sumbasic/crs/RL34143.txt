in response to concerns raised by the director of national intelligence , admiral mike mcconnell , that the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) , 50 u.s.c .

§§ 1801 et seq . , required modernization to meet the current intelligence needs of the nation , a number of bills were introduced in the senate and the house of representatives .

intense legislative activity with respect to proposed amendments to fisa in both bodies resulted in the enactment of the protect america act of 2007 , p.l .

110-55 on august 5 , 2007 .

the measure was introduced as s. 1927 by senator mcconnell , for himself and senator bond , on august 1 , 2007 .

the bill was considered in the senate on august 3 , in conjunction with s. 2011 , entitled the protect america act of 2007 , introduced by senator levin , for himself and senator rockefeller .

the senate agreed by unanimous consent to an amendment to s. 1927 offered by senator mcconnell , for himself and senator bond , providing that sections 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 of the bill would sunset 180 days after its enactment .

as amended , s. 1927 passed the senate the same day .

s. 2011 did not receive the requisite 60 votes , and was placed on the senate calendar under general orders .

that evening , the house considered h.r .

3356 , the improving foreign intelligence surveillance to defend the nation and the constitution act of 2007 , introduced by representative reyes for himself , representative conyers , representative schiff , and representative flake .

after a motion to suspend the rules and pass h.r .

at 10:19 p.m. saturday night , august 4 , the house passed s. 1927 .

it was signed by the president on august 5 , 2007 .

on january 29 , 2008 , both the house and the senate passed h.r .

5104 , a 15-day extension to the sunset for the protect america act , to allow further time to consider , pass , and go to conference on proposed legislation to amend fisa , while ensuring that the intelligence community would have the authority it needed in the intervening period .

the president signed the measure into law on january 31 , 2008 , as p.l .

110-182 .

on february 13 , 2008 , the house rejected h.r .

this report discusses the provisions of p.l .

110-55 and their impact on or relationship with the prior provisions of fisa .

sec .

1 of s. 1927 states that the short title of the law is the protect america act of 2007 .

section 2 of the law contains its first substantive provisions .

they are summarized in order below .

section 3 of the act creates a new section 105c of fisa , creating a review process for the procedures under which the government determines that acquisitions of foreign intelligence information from persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states do not constitute electronic surveillance .

section 4 of p.l .

110-55 requires the attorney general to inform the senate select committee on intelligence , the house permanent select committee on intelligence , the senate judiciary committee and the house judiciary committee semi - annually concerning acquisitions "under this section" during the previous six - month period .

each report is to include descriptions of any incidents of non - compliance with a directive issued by the dni and the attorney general under section 105b , including noncompliance by an element of the intelligence community with guidelines or procedures for determining that "the acquisition of foreign intelligence authorized by the attorney general and the [dni] concerns persons reasonably to be outside the united states," and incidents of noncompliance by a specified person to whom a directive is issued under section 105b .

the report is also required to include the number of certifications and directives issued during the reporting period .

section 5 ( a ) ( 1 ) and ( a ) ( 2 ) make technical amendments to section 103 ( e ) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of fisa , 50 u.s.c .

§ 1803 ( e ) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , to reflect the jurisdiction of the fisc petition review pool over petitions under section 105b ( h ) of fisa , dealing with challenges to the legality of directives issued under section 105b ( e ) of fisa to a person by the attorney general and the dni , and over petitions under section 501 ( f ) of fisa , 50 u.s.c .

§ 1861 , dealing with challenges to production orders or nondisclosure orders issued by the fisc under section 501 ( c ) of fisa , 50 u.s.c .

§ 1861 ( c ) .

section 5 ( b ) makes conforming amendments to the table of contents of the first "section" of fisa , 50 u.s.c .

§ 1801 et seq . , to reflect the additions of new sections 105a , 105b , and 105c of fisa .

under section 6 ( a ) of p.l .

110-55 , the amendments to fisa made in the act are to take effect immediately after its enactment except as otherwise provided .

section 6 ( b ) of p.l .

110-55 provides that any order issued under fisa in effect on the date of enactment of p.l .

110-55 ( august 5 , 2007 ) shall remain in effect until the date of expiration of the order , and , at the request of the applicant for the order , the fisc shall reauthorize the order as long as the facts and circumstances continue to justify its issuance under fisa as in effect the day before the applicable effective date of p.l .

110-55 .

this appears to refer to orders and applications for orders under fisa authorizing electronic surveillance , physical searches , pen registers or trap and trace devices , or production of tangible things and related nondisclosure orders .

section 6 ( b ) provides further that the government may also file new applications and the fisc shall enter orders granting such applications pursuant to fisa , as long as the application meets the requirements set forth in fisa as in effect on the day before the applicable effective date of p.l .

110-55 .

this seems to indicate that pre - existing authorities under fisa remain available in the wake of p.l .

110-55 's enactment .

at the applicant's request , the fisc shall extinguish any extant authorizations to conduct electronic surveillance or physical searches pursuant to fisa .

any surveillance conducted pursuant to an order entered under subsection 6 ( b ) of p.l .

110-55 is to be subject to the provisions of fisa as in effect before the effective date of p.l .

110-55 .

under section 6 ( c ) of p.l .

110-55 , sections 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 of that act were to sunset 180 days after the date of enactment of the act , except as provided in section 6 ( d ) .

under section 6 ( d ) , any authorizations for acquisition of foreign intelligence information or directives issued pursuant to those authorizations issued under section 105b shall remain in effect until their expiration .

section 6 ( d ) also provides that such acquisitions shall be governed by the applicable amendments made to fisa by p.l .

110-55 , and shall not be deemed to constitute electronic surveillance as that term is defined in section 101 ( f ) of fisa .

on january 29 , 2008 , both the house and the senate passed h.r .

5104 , a 15-day extension to the sunset for the protect america act , to allow further time to consider , pass , and go to conference on proposed legislation to amend fisa , while ensuring that the intelligence community would have the authority it needed in the intervening period .

it was signed into law on january 31 , 2008 , as p.l .

110-182 .

on february 13 , 2008 , the house rejected h.r .

5349 , which would have extended the sunset provision for an additional 21 days .

bills have been introduced in the senate to extend the sunset from 180 to 210 days ( s. 2541 , s. 2556 , and s. 2615 ) , or to extend it to july 1 , 2009 ( s. 2557 ) .

the president has indicated that he will not agree to a further extension of the sunset provision .
