the agriculture appropriations bill — formally known as the agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act — provides funding for the following agencies and departments: all of the u.s. department of agriculture ( except the forest service , which is funded by the interior appropriations bill ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services , and in the house , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) .

in the senate , cftc appropriations are handled by the financial services appropriations subcommittee .

jurisdiction for the appropriations bill rests with the house and senate committees on appropriations , particularly each committee's subcommittee on agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies .

these subcommittees are separate from the agriculture authorizing committees — the house committee on agriculture and the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry .

for the fy2011 agriculture appropriations bill , no separate floor action and limited formal committee action occurred in the 111 th congress .

the full senate appropriations committee reported an agriculture appropriations bill ( s. 3606 , s.rept .

111-221 ) on july 15 , 2010 .

the house agriculture appropriations subcommittee marked up its draft on june 30 , 2010 , but the bill did not see full committee action nor was it reported .

in the 112 th congress , a full - year continuing resolution ( p.l .

112-10 ) was enacted with many line - item changes on april 15 , 2011 .

table 1 summarizes the steps in the passage of the bill in each chamber .

the fy2011 agriculture appropriation is somewhat similar to the fy2009 bill in that neither chamber acted on the agriculture bill as a stand - alone measure ( table a - 1 in the appendix ) .

conversely , agriculture appropriations were enacted as stand - alone bills in fy2010 and fy2006 .

omnibus appropriations were used as recently as fy2008 and fy2009 .

fy2007 saw a year - long continuing resolution .

table a - 1 has links to each appropriation and annual crs report .

the following tables compare the effect of the fy2011 appropriation within three usda program areas at a more detailed level than in table 3 .

these include the agricultural research mission area ( table 8 ) , farm loan programs ( table 9 ) , and rural development mission area ( table 10 ) and its three agencies ( table 11 through table 13 ) .
