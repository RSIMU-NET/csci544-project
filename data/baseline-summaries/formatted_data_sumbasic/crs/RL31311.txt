on february 13 , congress approved h.j.res .

2 , a continuingappropriations measure to which foreign operations and 10 other fy2003appropriations bills had been added .

this omnibus spending measure was signed bythe president on february 20 ( p.l .

108-7 ) .

as enacted , foreign operations is fundedat $16.3 billion for fy2003 , about $150 million less than requested and $125 millionand $250 million less than bills recommended earlier by the senate and house,respectively ( h.j.res .

2 , as passed by the senate on january 23 and h.r .

5410 reported in the house in september 2002 ) .

the conferenceagreement further provides for an across - the - board rescission of 0.65% of alldiscretionary budget authority in the bill .

this reduces total foreign operationsfunding to roughly $16.18 billion .

as passed by congress , the $16.3 billion foreign operations modifies several of the administration's fy2003 funding requests .

p.l .

108-7 increases childsurvival programs to $1.8 billion , about $242 million higher than the request .

thelegislation includes $880 million for international hiv / aids programs , $140 millionmore than proposed , but $172 million less than recommended by the senate .

the measure further provides $446.5 million for bilateral family planning activities , compared with $425 million recommended by the house in h.r .

5410 and $435 million passed by the senate .

the conferees agreedto allocate $34 million to unfpa , the same as in fy2002 , but made the fundssubject to several conditions , including a requirement that the president certifies thatthe organization is no longer involved in the management of a coercive familyplanning program .

last year , the administration declared unfpa ineligible for u.s.support because of its program in china where the secretary of state determinedunfpa was involved in a coercive program .

the enacted foreign operations appropriation provides $700 million for the andean regional counternarcotics initiative .

the senate had approved $650 millionand the house ( h.r .

5410 ) had proposed $731 million , as requested .

p.l .

108-7 includes $295 million for afghanistan , compared with $296 million ( house ) and $220 million ( senate ) .

the administration estimated that it wouldallocate $98 million for afghan aid out of its foreign operations request .

theconference agreement includes full funding for regular aid to israel ( $2.7 billion ) , butdoes not include house language that would have earmarked an additional $200million requested by the president in a september 2002 budget amendment for israelianti - terrorism aid .

the omnibus appropriation further cuts all funding for northkorean heavy fuel oil ( $71.5 million ) but retains $5 million for administrative costsof kedo .

 ( note: this report does not discuss or include $7.48 billion in foreign operations funding approved in p.l .

108-11 , the iraq war supplemental .

for complete detailson that legislation , see crs report rl31829 , supplemental appropriations fy2003:iraq conflict , afghanistan , global war on terrorism , and homeland security . ) .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislativevehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the u.s. foreign assistancebudget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy makinggenerally .

 ( 1 ) it contains the largest share - - abouttwo - thirds - - of total internationalaffairs spending by the united states ( see figure 1 ) .

the legislation funds all u.s.bilateral development assistance programs , managed mostly by the u.s. agency forinternational development ( usaid ) , together with several smaller independentforeign aid agencies , such as the peace corps and the inter - american and africandevelopment foundations .

most humanitarian aid activities are funded withinforeign operations , including usaid's disaster program and the state department'srefugee relief support .

foreign operations includes separate accounts for aidprograms in the former soviet union ( also referred to as the independent statesaccount ) and central / eastern europe , activities that are jointly managed by usaidand the state department .

security assistance ( economic and military aid ) for israeland egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure , as are smallersecurity aid programs administered largely by the state department , in conjunctionwith usaid and the pentagon .

u.s. contributions to the world bank and otherregional multilateral development banks , managed by the treasury department , andvoluntary payments to international organizations , handled by the state department,are also funded in the foreign operations bill .

finally , the legislation includesappropriations for three export promotion agencies: the overseas private investmentcorporation ( opic ) , the export - import bank , and the trade and developmentagency .

for nearly two decades , the foreign operations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressionalinvolvement in foreign policy making .

congress has not enacted a comprehensiveforeign aid authorization bill since 1985 , leaving most foreign assistance programswithout regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees .

as a result , foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriationscommittees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues andplayed a major role in shaping , authorizing , and guiding both executive andcongressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives .

it has been largelythrough foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aidpolicy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war .

thelegislation has also been a key tool used by congress to apply restrictions andconditions on administration management of foreign assistance , actions that havefrequently resulted in executive - legislative clashes over presidential prerogatives inforeign policy making .

status of foreign operations appropriations , fy2003: action in the 108th congress ( h.j.res.2 ) president bush submitted his fy2003 federal budget request to congress on february 4 , including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriationsprograms .

subsequently , on march 21 , the white house requested fy2002emergency supplemental funds for homeland security and combating terrorismoverseas , a proposal that includes assistance to "front - line" states .

house and senateappropriations committees held a series of hearings on both the fy2003 andfy2002 supplemental requests , and approved the supplemental ( p.l .

107-206 ) onjuly 24 , 2002 .

the senate appropriations committee reported a bill for fy2003 onjuly 24 ( s. 2779 ) .

the house foreign operations subcommitteeapproved its bill on september 5 , a measure that was marked up by the fullcommittee on september 12 and reported on september 19 ( h.r .

5410 ) .

both fy2003 bills expired at the end of the 107th congress .

subsequently , the senate passed h.j.res .

2 on january 23 , 2003 .

the legislation contained 11 fy2003 appropriation bills , including foreignoperations .

on february 13 , congress approved the conference report for theomnibus appropriation , and the president signed the measure on february 20 ( p.l.108-7 ) .

as shown in figure 2 below , foreign operations funding levels , expressed inreal terms taking into account the effects of inflation , have fluctuated widely over thepast 25 years .

 ( 2 ) after peaking at over $33 billion in fy1985 ( constant fy2003dollars ) , foreign operations appropriations began a period of decline to $13.8 billionin fy1997 , with only a brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due tospecial supplementals for panama and nicaragua ( 1990 ) , countries affected by thegulf war ( 1991 ) , and the former soviet states ( 1993 ) .

table 3 .

foreign operations appropriations , fy1995 to fy2003 ( discretionary budget authority in billionsof current and constant dollars ) note .

fy1999 excludes $17.861 billion for the imf .

fy2003 does not include the 0.65% across - the - board rescission .

fy2003 also excludes the $7.48 billion forforeign operations included in p.l .

108-11 , the iraq war supplemental .

supplemental funds added following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , resulted in large increases for foreign operations programs .

as part of a $40 billionemergency supplemental to fight terrorism enacted in september 2001 ( p.l .

107-38 ) ,president bush and congress allocated $1.4 billion for foreign aid activities .

 ( 3 ) congress approved an additional $1.15 billion foreign operations supplemental ( p.l.107-206 ; h.r .

4775 ) , bringing amounts for fy2002 to $16.54 billion .

the amounts for each year since fy2000 - - ranging between $16.3 billion and$15.54 billion - - are the largest in nominal terms since fy1985 and in constantterms , are the highest in 10 years .

despite the recent trend of increased spending on foreign aid , however , by historical standards the amounts between fy2000 and fy2003 , in real terms , are relatively low .

except for the lowest point in foreign aid appropriations that occurredin the mid - 1990s , this most recent period is lower , in real terms , than for any yearprior to fy1994 .

as a share of the entire $2.15 trillion u.s. budget for fy2003 , foreign operations represents a 0.76% share .

as a portion of discretionary budget authority - - that part of the budget provided in annual appropriation acts ( other thanappropriated entitlements ) - - foreign operations consumes 2.13% .

by comparison,at the high point of foreign operations spending in fy1985 , foreign aid fundsrepresented 2% of the total u.s. budget and 4.6% of discretionary budget authority .

the administration sought $1.28 billion in additional fy2002 foreignoperations funding , primarily to increase economic , military , and counter - terrorismassistance to so - called "front - line" states in the war on terrorism .

the united stateshas placed a growing priority on increasing assistance to 26 nations representing notjust those bordering afghanistan or located in the region , but including countriesglobally that have committed to helping the united states in the war on terrorism .

as finalized by congress and signed by the president on august 2 ( p.l .

107-206 ) , the administration received $1.8 billion in foreign aid funding ( less $269million rescission ) , over $400 million above the request .

this came on top of about$1.5 billion for foreign operations programs that were drawn , beginning october 1,2001 , from the $40 billion emergency terrorism supplemental approved by congressshortly after september 11 ( p.l .

107-38 ) .

the supplemental , as submitted , alsoincluded several policy changes related to foreign aid activities that raisedcontroversy during congressional debate .

nevertheless , as a result of a decision made by president bush on august 13 not to spend any of the $5.1 billion supplemental designated as "contingent emergency,"about one - third of the foreign aid supplemental became unavailable .

according tothe 1985 balanced budget and emergency deficit control act as amended , both thepresident and congress must agree that spending is emergency for those funds to beexempt from budgetary controls over total spending .

after the white house stronglyobjected to house and senate proposals to exceed the president's $27.1 billionsupplemental request , lawmakers agreed to provide $5.1 billion of the $28.9 billionsupplemental total as contingent emergency funding for which the president alsowould have to designate as emergency resources in order for the money to becomeavailable .

the $5.1 billion in contingent emergency funding included new itemsadded by congress and increases above the administration's request .

the enactedsupplemental , however , included a so - called "all or nothing" provision , requiring thepresident to declare either the entire $5.1 billion as emergency funds or none of it .

on august 13 , president bush announced that he would not utilize the $5.1 billion of contingent emergency spending .

the decision had the effect , in terms usedby the white house , of a "pocket veto" by the president of the contingent emergencyfunds .

major foreign aid funds that were not available because of the president'saction included: israel aid - - $200 million palestinian aid - - $50 million afghanistan aid and refugee relief - - $134million philippine military aid - - $30 million international hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis - - $200million the white house said , however , that the president supported more aid to israel , the palestinians , and for hiv / aids , and would seek other means to gain congressionalapproval for these activities in the future .

subsequently , on september 3 , the administration submitted a $996 million budget amendment to the pending fy2003 request , including $350 million forforeign operations .

included were $200 million for israel , $50 million for thepalestinians , and $100 million for the international mother and child hiv preventionprogram .

an additional $100 million for hiv / aids was requested for the centersfor disease control fund in the labor / hhs appropriation .

other foreign operations contingent emergency funds , including those for afghanistan and the philippines , were not part of the president's amendment .

theeffect of not seeking to restore the contingent emergency funds for afghanistan andthe philippines not only meant less aid for those two countries than amounts assumedby congress when it passed the supplemental bill , but reductions for several othercountries .

congress had assumed that afghanistan would receive about $264 millionin p.l .

107-206 , $14 million more than the $250 million request .

ultimately , asshown in table 6 below , the state department allocated afghanistan $258 million .

working with $75 million less in total economic and military assistance thanrequested , a congressional directive to spend $7 million on a muslim educationexchange program , and the loss of the contingent emergency funds , administrationofficials had to reduce amounts for a number of priority aid recipients in order tomaintain a high level for afghanistan .

final supplemental allocations cut aid topakistan by $30 million , african nations by $16.5 million , a middle east economicinitiative by $30 million , and yemen , nepal , and colombia by smaller amounts .

thephilippines received $37 million , $3 million less than requested and $33 millionbelow what congress assumed when it passed the supplemental .

the fy2003 budget amendment request also proposed no offsets , but the white house said it expected congress to absorb the additional funds within the original$759 billion appropriation request for all 13 spending bills .

in the case of foreignoperations , the house committee raised the bill's total by $200 million , reduced theamount available for defense appropriations , and accommodated the balance of thepresident's amendment by reducing other programs in the foreign operations bill by$150 million .

107-38 ) .

b afghan aid figures for fy2001 and fy2002 represent estimates of u.s. assistanceprovided primarily through humanitarian aid accounts , such as food , refugeerelief , and disaster aid .

the fy2002 enacted level includes total amountsobligated for afghanistan , including funds enacted in the supplemental bill .

c as enacted , p.l .

107-206 appropriated $200 million for israel , $50 million for thepalestinians , $200 million for hiv / aids , $30 million in additional military aidto the philippines , $40 million refugee relief for afghanistan , plus additionalamounts in disaster assistance for afghanistan .

these funds represented newitems not requested by the president but added by congress .

as such , they weredesignated as "contingent emergency" funds that needed the president also todeclare them as emergency spending before they would become available .

because of the president's decision not to spend money designated as"contingent emergency," none of these funds became available .

d the administration did not allocate economic aid for african states on acountry - by - country basis , but as a "regional" program shown in the line below .

as it suggests , the $35 million economic aid request for africa was reduced to$20 million in the final allocation .

additional amounts shown here for djibouti,ethiopia , and kenya are allocations for military assistance .

e as enacted , p.l .

107-206 appropriated $1.549 billion , $622 million of which wasdesignated as "contingent emergency" funding .

the president decided he wouldnot spend any of the $5.1 billion contingent emergency funds provided in p.l.107-206 .

a .

in 2002 , house and senate appropriations committees reported bills appropriating fy2003 foreignoperations funds .

congress adjourned , however,before completing action on these measures .

the 108th congress enacted fy2003 foreign operationsappropriations as part of new legislation - - h.j.res .

2 .

for comparative purposes , amounts reported but not enacted in the 107th congressare shown in the final two columns ofthis table .

b. fy2002 supplemental includes funds appropriated in p.l .

107-117 ( legislation allocating $20 billionin emergency terrorism response funds ) and p.l.107-206 ( emergency fy2002 supplemental appropriations ) .

excluded from this total is $1.329 billionappropriated in september 2001 in p.l.107-38 and ( the emergency terrorism response fund ) and allocated to foreign operations programs during thefirst half of fy2002 .

c. for fy2003 , the administration proposed to consolidate child survival / health anddevelopment assistance accounts into a single account .

forcomparative purposes with fy2002 , the fy2003 request broke down as follows: $1.474 billion for childsurvival / health and $1.365 billion fordevelopment assistance .

the child survival / health figures also include the u.s. contribution for unicef , anamount requested in title iv , butincluded by congress in this account .

d. on september 3 , 2002 , the administration amended its original request , proposing additional fundsfor three accounts: development aid , from $2.86billion to $2.96 billion for hiv / aids programs ; international disaster assistance , from $235.5 million to $285.5million for humanitarian aid forthe palestinians ; and the economic support fund , from $2.29 billion to $2.49 billion for anti - terrorism aid to israel .

e. population and hiv / aids aid funding include small amounts from other foreign operations accounts .

the figures here represent totals "across allaccounts," not just those within the development aid subtotal .

f. the administration request included the ireland fund as part of the economic support fund .

g. excludes unicef contribution which is part of development assistance under title ii above .

h. h.j.res .

2 , as passed by the senate , included an across - the - board rescission of 1.6% ( ï¿½601,division n ) .

this rescission was augmentedby ï¿½ 309 of division g , which required an increase in the rescission to offset $5 billion inadditional education spending .

according to cbo , thisamount generated an additional 1.252% reduction .

thus , the total across - the - board reduction is currently estimatedat 2.852% , which has beencalculated by cbo as $11.392 billion .

as enacted , ï¿½ 601 of h.j.res .

2 requires a 0.65%across - the - board rescission figures listed hereare estimates reflecting the impact of these rescissions .
