rs21630 - - immigration of religious workers: background and legislation september 30 , 200 .

permanent legal immigration to the united states is regulated by a set of numerical limits and systems of preference categories delineated in the immigrationand nationality act ( ina ) , and employment - based immigration comprises one of the major groups of the preferencecategory systems .

 ( 1 ) aliens who come tothe united states through the permanent legal immigration categories are commonly known as legal permanentresidents ( lprs ) .

the fourth category of theemployment - based preference system is known as "special immigrants," and the largest number of specialimmigrants are ministers of religion and religiousworkers .

 ( 2 ) religious workers are treated separatelyfrom ministers of religion and are limited to 5,000 immigrants annually .

accompanying spouses and minorchildren of ministers of religion and religious workers are included as special immigrants .

prior to the immigration act of 1990 ( p.l .

101-649 ) , ministers of religion were admitted to the united states without numerical limits , and there was noseparate provision for religious workers .

religious workers immigrated through one of the more general categoriesof numerically - limited , employment - basedimmigration that were in effect at that time .

the immigration act of 1990 amended the ina to redefine the specialimmigrant category to include ministers ofreligion and religious workers , but contained a "sunset"of the provision for religious workers on september 30,1994 .

it was subsequently extended severaltimes , most recently through september 30 , 2003 .

 ( 3 ) the 1990 act also created a new nonimmigrant ( i.e. , temporary ) visa for religious workers , commonlyreferred to as the r visa .

 ( 4 ) .

defining what constitutes religious work is daunting given the theological diversity of religions , denominations , and faith traditions .

the education , training,and ordination requirements for ministers of religion and religious workers vary greatly by religious group .

underthe special immigrant provisions , the inadefines ministers of religion and religious workers as follows: ( c ) an immigrant , and the immigrant's spouse and children if accompanying or following to join the immigrant,who - - ( i ) for at least 2 years immediately preceding the time of application foradmission , has been a member of areligious denomination having a bona fide nonprofit , religious organization in the unitedstates ; ( ii ) seeks to enter the united states - - ( i ) solely for the purpose of carrying on the vocation of a minister of thatreligiousdenomination , ( ii ) before october 1 , 2003 , in order to work for the organization at the requestof the organization in aprofessional capacity in a religious vocation or occupation , or ( iii ) before october 1 , 2003 , in order to work for the organization ( or a bona fide organization which is affiliatedwith the religious denomination and is exempt from taxation as an organization described in section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) ofthe internal revenue code of 1986 ) at therequest of the organization in a religious vocation or occupation ; and ( iii ) has been carrying on such a vocation , professional work , or other workcontinuously for at least the 2-yearperiod described in clause ( i ) ; ( 5 ) the regulations further define religious occupation as "an activity which relates to a traditional religious function. .

 ( 6 ) the nonimmigrant r visa category ofreligious workers holds to the same definitions ; aliens on r visas are not , however , held to the 2-year experiencerequirement .

religious workers are notsubject to the labor certification requirements that many other employment - based immigrants must meet .

 ( 7 ) the ina is silent on what constitutes a religious denomination , but the regulations offer the following definition: religious denomination means a religious group or community of believers having some form of ecclesiasticalgovernment , a creed or statement of faith , some form of worship , a formal or informal code of doctrine anddiscipline , religious services and ceremonies,established places of religious worship , religious congregations , or comparable indica of a bona fide religious denomination .

for the purposes of this definition,an interdenominational religious organization which is exempt from taxation pursuant to �501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the internalrevenue code will be treated as a religiousdenomination .

 ( 8 ) the u.s .

citizenship and immigration services bureau in the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is the lead agency for immigrant admissions .

 ( 9 ) .

in the wider sweep of legal immigration to the united states , religious workers represent a tiny fraction of the annual flow - - 0.3% of the 1,063,732 immigrantsin fy2002 .

while the number of nonimmigrant r visas issued since fy1992 ( first year the category was available ) exceeds that of the permanent admissions,it likewise constitutes a small portion of all nonimmigrants admitted .

the issuances of r visas has moved steadilyupward , but the levels of admission forpermanent religious workers has varied since fy1992 ( figure 1 ) .

most religious workers who become lprs are not arriving from abroad ; rather they are adjusting status after they have lived in the united states .

in fy2002,only 389 of the 3,127 religious workers and their families arrived from abroad , while 87.6% adjusted to lpr statusas religious workers in the united states .

itis likely that most of those who adjusted status had entered on r visas as temporary religious workers .

although the extension of the religious worker provision has a broad base of support , efforts to make it a permanent immigration category have not succeeded .

some have criticized the religious worker provision as vulnerable to fraud .

a few have expressed fear that it maybe an avenue for religious extremists to enterthe united states .

others , however , point out that the ina has provisions to guard against visa fraud and to excludefrom admission aliens who may threatenpublic safety or national security , and who commit fraud to enter the united states .
