in december 2019 , a new disease , later called covid - 19 , emerged in china and quickly spread around the world .

the disease presents major consequences for global health , foreign relations , the global economy , and global security .

international institutions and country governments are taking a variety of responses to address these challenges .

in the 116 th congress , members have introduced legislation to respond to covid - 19 in particular and to address global pandemic preparedness in general that are now occurring on a global scale .

this report focuses on global implications of and responses to the covid - 19 pandemic , and is organized into four broad parts that answer common questions regarding: ( 1 ) the disease and its global prevalence , ( 2 ) country and regional responses , ( 3 ) global economic and trade implications , and ( 4 ) issues that congress might consider .

for information on domestic covid - 19 cases and related responses , see crs insight in11253 , domestic public health response to covid - 19: current status and resources guide , by kavya sekar and ada s. cornell .

individual countries carry out both domestic and international efforts to control the covid - 19 pandemic , with the who issuing guidance , coordinating some international research and related findings , and coordinating health aid in low - resource settings .

countries follow ( to varying degrees ) who policy guidance on covid - 19 response and leverage information shared by who to refine national covid - 19 plans .

the united nations ( u.n. ) office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( unocha ) is requesting $6.7 billion to support covid - 19 efforts by several u.n. entities ( see " multilateral technical assistance " section ) .

on january 29 , 2020 , president donald trump announced the formation of the president's coronavirus task force , led by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and coordinated by the white house national security council ( nsc ) .

on february 27 , the president appointed vice president michael pence as the administration's covid - 19 task force leader , and the vice president subsequently appointed the head of the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) , ambassador deborah birx , as the white house coronavirus response coordinator .

international covid - 19 response efforts carried out by u.s. federal government departments and agencies , including those in the task force , are described below .

the covid - 19 pandemic has raised questions about domestic and international preparedness and the appropriate responses to pandemic control .

although the united states has long - supported the delivery of ppe through its international pandemic preparedness programs , this practice has come into question while the numbers of covid - 19 cases and deaths climb in the united states .

as of april 15 , 2020 , the united states had the highest number of covid - 19 cases and deaths worldwide , accounting for roughly 30% of all covid - 19 cases globally .

in march , some members of congress began questioning the delivery of ppe by usaid to foreign countries while some governors and mayors reported shortages of the commodities .

the united states provides annual funding for foreign assistance , approximately $20 billion of which is administered by usaid each year .

usaid programs operate in more than 120 countries worldwide and are intended to meet specific development objectives .

in many of these countries , widespread poverty , weak public institutions , and diverse pre - existing governance challenges are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic .

to preserve these investments and past policy progress , protect u.s. foreign policy interests in the region , save lives , and help combat the negative socioeconomic effects of the pandemic in the region , congress may seek to address additional help aid recipients might request to control the pandemic and its effects .

congress might also consider how the pandemic may affect partner governments' absorption capacities , and the manner and degree to which u.s. assistance may complement or coincide with nationally - determined pandemic responses .

congress may also wish to consider how responding to the challenges created by the pandemic may reshape pre - existing u.s. aid prioritiesâand how it may affect the ability of u.s. personnel to implement and oversee programs in the field .

relatedly , congress may wish to ensure that u.s. responses are robustly coordinated with those of other donor governments and multilateral functional agenciesâand to ensure that such efforts are transparent and cost - effective , and that donor assistance is complementary and non - duplicative .

the pandemic is also having other effects on foreign affairs that congress might consider .

some have questioned , for example , how u.s. immigration policy might impact covid - pandemic control efforts .

some members of congress and officials representing latin american and caribbean governments have expressed concern that covid - 19-related screening procedures for deportations are not sufficient to prevent the importation of covid - 19 cases from the united states and have asked the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) to suspend deportations .

a number of people deported from the united states to latin america have reportedly tested positive with covid - 19 or have reportedly been exposed to someone with covid - 19 .

other members of congress continue to support the administration's border policies , which the administration maintains are conducted in a manner that accounts for the dangers of covid - 19 .

congress continues to debate the extent to which the united states should contribute to multilateral organizations for covid - 19 control .

some members , for example , are arguing for withholding contributions to the who , while others are urging the administration to pay outstanding assessments to the organization and support ongoing who covid - 19 efforts .
