renewable energy policy in the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-246 , 2008 farm bill ) builds on earlier programs , many of which were established in the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-171 , 2002 farm bill ) .

the 2002 farm bill was the first omnibus farm bill to explicitly include an energy title ( title ix ) .

the energy title authorized grants , loans , and loan guarantees to foster research on agriculture - based renewable energy , to share development risk , and to promote the adoption of renewable energy systems .

since enactment of the 2002 farm bill , interest in renewable energy has grown rapidly , due in large part to a strong rise in domestic and international petroleum prices and a dramatic acceleration in domestic biofuels production ( primarily corn - based ethanol ) .

many policymakers view agriculture - based biofuels as both a catalyst for rural economic development and a response to growing energy import dependence .

ethanol and biodiesel , the two most widely used biofuels , receive significant federal support in the form of tax incentives , loans and grants , and regulatory programs .

the 2008 farm bill became law six months after the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa , p.l .

110-140 ) .

provisions in the 2008 farm bill reflect the increased role for biofuels mandated by the expansion of the renewable fuels standard ( rfs ) in eisa and its likely impact on the u.s. agriculture sector , especially the emphasis on facilitating production of biofuels derived from cellulosic feedstocks .

eisa includes a significant expansion of the overall rfs to 36 billion gallons by 2022 , with carve - outs for biodiesel ( 1 billion gallons by 2012 ) and cellulosic ethanol ( 16 billion gallons by 2022 ) and an implicit cap on corn starch ethanol ( 15 billion gallons by 2015 ) .

the emphasis on cellulosic ethanol also reflects increasing concerns about the economic and environmental issues associated with corn starch - based ethanol .

escalating commodity prices since 2007 , combined with high energy costs , have resulted in sharp increases in livestock feed costs , export prices , and domestic food price inflation .

for the first time , an agricultural commodity is directly competing with petroleum in the marketplace .

in 2010 ethanol production used nearly 40% of u.s. corn production .

the increase in corn used for u.s. ethanol relative to corn produced has helped to draw down u.s. corn stocks and drive up prices .

ethanol's profitability depends on both petroleum and corn prices .

when petroleum prices rise , so does demand for ethanol as a substitute , which in turn increases both the demand for and price of corn .

the "food versus fuel" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate as food price inflation accelerated both in the u.s. and globally — highlighting some of the potential problems associated with replacing even a small share of the nation's gasoline consumption with corn - based ethanol .

several of the federal programs that currently support renewable energy production in general , and agriculture - based energy production in particular , are outside the purview of the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and have legislative origins outside of the farm bill .

for example , the rfs , which mandates the inclusion of an increasing volume of biofuels in the national fuel supply , originated with the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .

109-58 ) and was more recently expanded in eisa .

similarly , several of the federal tax credits available to biofuel blenders were initially contained in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-357 ) .

more recently , the tax credits were extended in the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) .

the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) significantly expands both the number and type of programs to support biofuels production and use .

like the 2002 farm bill ( p.l .

107-171 ) , it contains a distinct energy title ( title ix ) that covers a wide range of energy and agricultural topics with extensive attention to biofuels , including corn starch - based ethanol , cellulosic ethanol , and biodiesel .

research provisions relating to renewable energy are found in title vii and tax and trade provisions are found in title xv .

the enacted 2008 farm bill keeps the structure of title ix as it was in the senate - passed version of the farm bill .

title ix serves as a substitute amendment to the 2002 farm bill title ix and consists of 3 sections .

the first section , 9001 , contains 13 new provisions which effectively replace the provisions of the 2002 bill .

sections 9002 and 9003 direct studies and reports on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer , respectively .

see appendix for a side - by - side comparison of previous law with the energy provisions of the 2008 farm bill .

key biofuels - related provisions in the enacted 2008 farm bill include establishment of a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit ( sec .

15321 ) , and promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production ( sec .

9011 ) , marketing infrastructure ( sec .

9007 ) , and refinery development ( sec .

9003 ) ; grants and loan guarantees for biofuels ( especially cellulosic ) research ( sec .

9008 ) and production ( sec .

9005 ) ; a new program to incentivize production of cellulosic ethanol feedstock ( sec .

9011 ) ; studies of the market and environmental impacts of increased biofuels use ( sec .

15322 ) ; expansion of the existing bio - based marketing program to encourage federal procurement of bio - based products ( sec .

9002 ) ; expansion of the federal bio - products certification program ( sec .

9002 ) ; support for rural energy efficiency and self - sufficiency ( sec .

9007 ) ; reauthorization of biofuels research programs ( sec .

9008 ) within the usda and the department of energy ( doe ) ; an education program to promote the use and understanding of biodiesel ( sec .

9006 ) ; reduction of the blender tax credit for corn - based ethanol ( sec .

15331 ) ; and continuation of the import duty on ethanol ( sec .

15333 ) .

the 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for fy2008 through fy2012 ( table 1 ) , compared with $800 million in the 2002 farm bill ( fy2002-fy2007 ) .

mandatory authorization in the 2008 farm bill includes $320 million to the biorefinery assistance program , $300 million to the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels , $255 million to the rural energy for america program ( reap ) , $118 million to the biomass research and development act ( brda ) , and potentially unlimited funding ( such sums as necessary ) for the biomass crop assistance program ( bcap ) .

discretionary funding ( i.e. , authorizations for appropriations ) for energy - related provisions in the 2008 farm bill total over $1.7 billion , nearly seven times the $245 million in the 2002 farm bill .

most of the increase is for the biorefinery assistance program , which has an authorization $600 million higher than in the 2002 farm bill .

mandatory funding is through usda's commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) .

programs identified as receiving mandatory funds are funded at these levels unless congress limits funding to a lower amount through the appropriations or legislative process .

discretionary programs are funded each year through the annual appropriations process .

table 2 provides a list of provisions in the 2008 farm bill's energy title , and selected energy programs in the research title , for fy2010 through fy2012 , along with their mandatory and discretionary funding levels — as requested by the president , authorized levels in the 2008 farm bill , and eventual availability as measured by budget authority provided by congress — where available .
