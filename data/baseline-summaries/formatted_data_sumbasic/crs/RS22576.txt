in 1997 , a new avian ( bird ) flu virus ( h5n1 ) emerged in asia and killed six people .

it has since spread to europe and africa .

the virus has infected more than 330 people , killing more than half of them .

health officials are concerned that it could change sufficiently to cause a global human pandemic .

beginning in fy2004 , congress has provided funding specifically for pandemic flu preparedness , through both regular and emergency supplemental appropriations .

this report describes federal funding for pandemic flu , primarily to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .

federal funding to control the disease in birds is generally provided to the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) for activities involving commercial poultry , and to the department of the interior for activities involving wildlife .

the departments of homeland security , defense , state , and veterans affairs , and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , have also received funds for global avian flu control .

it is difficult to track federal funding for flu preparedness , for several reasons .

first , funds designated specifically for pandemic flu do not reflect the sum of all relevant activities .

for example , programs to improve health surveillance in general , or to streamline federal disaster response , are important for pandemic preparedness .

also , the president has called on all federal agencies to develop continuity plans for a flu pandemic , activities that are typically funded through general administrative accounts .

second , certain activities ( eg , the expansion of vaccine production capacity ) address preparedness for both seasonal and pandemic flu , and may not be designated as pandemic spending , despite their relevance .

finally , federal agencies may not prepare budget information , such as the presentation of base funding or annual increases , in a consistent fashion .

this report provides information on appropriations , primarily to hhs , that the congress has specifically designated for pandemic flu preparedness .

appropriated amounts are presented in tables 1 and 2 .

pandemic flu funding for hhs has generally been provided in the public health and social services emergency fund ( phssef ) , an account intended for one - time or short - term activities .

this report will be updated .

in february 2003 , the administration requested $100 million in fy2004 appropriations for activities to ensure an adequate supply of vaccine in the event of a pandemic .

in p.l .

108-199 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2004 , congress provided $50 million to hhs to enhance vaccine production capacity .

funding was used in part to award a $10 million contract to a domestic manufacturer of injectable flu vaccine to assure a year - round supply of eggs for vaccine production .

in february 2004 , the administration requested $100 million in fy2005 appropriations , again for hhs to expand vaccine production capacity .

in october 2004 , while congress was considering fy2005 appropriations , there was a production failure at a plant supplying half of the nation's supply of injectable seasonal flu vaccine .

this resulted in a nationwide shortage , and focused attention on the frailty of the vaccine production system .

at the same time , h5n1 avian flu was spreading through asia .

in december 2004 , congress passed p.l .

108-447 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 , providing hhs with the requested $100 million to bolster flu vaccine production capacity , including the purchase of flu vaccine .

in may 2005 , congress passed p.l .

109-13 , the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense , the global war on terror , and tsunami relief , 2005 , providing $25 million to usaid for programs to control the global spread of avian flu , and stipulating that $15 million of it be transferred to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .

the law also provided $58 million to cdc to purchase flu countermeasures ( vaccines and antiviral drugs ) for the strategic national stockpile , and $10 million to hhs for sewer improvements to support an expansion of the nation's only domestic production facility for injectable flu vaccine .

in february 2005 , the administration requested $120 million for hhs for pandemic preparedness for fy2006 , including ongoing work to expand vaccine production capacity .

in july 2005 , the administration sought an additional $150 million to purchase and stockpile flu antiviral drugs and prototype h5n1 vaccines .

in december 2005 , congress provided funding for pandemic flu in fy2006 emergency supplemental appropriations ( discussed below ) , using this vehicle , rather than regular appropriations , to provide the bulk of pandemic funding for fy2006 .

also in december 2005 , congress passed regular fy2006 appropriations for hhs in p.l .

109-149 , the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies appropriations act , 2006 , providing $63.6 million to hhs for general public health preparedness activities , including efforts to bolster domestic flu vaccine production capacity and to stockpile vaccine .

as congress weighed regular appropriations for fy2006 , h5n1 avian flu spread to europe , and hurricane katrina raised concerns about the nation's general level of disaster readiness .

in november 2005 , the administration requested $7.1 billion in emergency supplemental funds for avian and pandemic flu preparedness .

this included $6.7 billion for hhs in amounts to be obligated over three years — $3.2 billion for fy2006 , $2.3 billion for fy2007 , and $1.2 billion for fy2008 — and the remainder for fy2006 activities in several other departments and agencies .

 ( see table 2 . ) .

the bulk of the amount requested for hhs was to support the expansion of domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity .

in december 2005 , congress provided $3.8 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations , including $3.3 billion for hhs , in division b , title ii of p.l .

109-148 , the department of defense , emergency supplemental appropriations to address hurricanes in the gulf of mexico , and pandemic influenza act , 2006 .

the distribution of these funds to various federal departments and agencies is presented in table 2 .

most of the difference between the $7.1 billion request and the $3.8 billion appropriation resulted because congress did not fund the "out years" of the administration's hhs request , i.e. , the amounts for fy2007 and fy2008 .

in report language ( h.rept .

109-359 ) , conferees directed the secretary of hhs to report to the appropriations committees on a semi - annual basis regarding the use of the $3.3 billion provided .

hhs has submitted a report to congressional appropriators , and has published updates on these activities .

in february 2006 , in its fy2007 budget request , hhs repeated its november 2005 request for $2.3 billion in fy2007 emergency supplemental funds for pandemic flu , but sought the funds prior to the regular fy2007 appropriations cycle .

 ( hhs called the $2.3 billion amount an "allowance. .

 ) in june 2006 , congress provided $2.3 billion in supplemental funds to hhs in title iv of p.l .

109-234 , the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense , the global war on terror , and hurricane recovery , 2006 .

congress authorized the secretary of hhs to use most of the funds to further federal domestic preparedness activities , the vaccine initiative ( including the construction or renovation of privately owned buildings ) , and stockpiling of antiviral drugs and medical supplies .

congress directed that $30 million be transferred to usaid for global disease control activities .

no other departments or agencies received funds specifically for avian or pandemic flu in the act .

 ( see table 2 . ) .

in february 2006 , in addition to supplemental funds noted above , the administration requested $352 million for hhs pandemic flu activities in regular fy2007 appropriations .

coincident with passage of the second fy2006 supplemental , the house and senate committees on appropriations each recommended $78.9 million for the phssef .

the senate committee recommended an additional $92 million for domestic and global pandemic flu activities at cdc .

similarly , the house passed agriculture appropriations for fy2007 , including $28.1 million for pandemic flu activities at the food and drug administration ( fda ) , and the senate committee reported agriculture appropriations , including a $50.5 million increase for fda pandemic flu activities , to make the fy2007 recommended total in excess of $60 million .

the amounts recommended above were not subsequently enacted .

in february 2007 , congress passed fy2007 appropriations for hhs in h.j.res .

20 , the revised continuing appropriations resolution , 2007 ( p.l .

110-5 ) .

the law was not accompanied by a conference report .

except for amounts specified — including an amount for pandemic flu — the law provided that departments be funded through fy2007 at the fy2006 level , with certain rescissions and salary adjustments .

p.l .

110-5 explicitly provided $100 million to the phssef , to be transferred to cdc , for preparedness and response to pandemic flu and other emerging infectious diseases .

it also rescinded $29.7 million from cdc regular appropriations for fy2006 , intended for the purchase of annual bulk monovalent influenza vaccine ( to bolster supplies of seasonal flu vaccine ) .

it did not mention any additional hhs amounts for flu preparedness .

though it is possible that the department funded additional pandemic flu activities with a portion of its overall appropriation for fy2007 , specific amounts , if any , have not been published .

two fy2007 supplemental appropriations bills ( h.r .

1591 and p.l .

110-28 ) would have provided an appropriation to hhs for pandemic flu , but in neither case was the provision enacted .

the conference report for h.r .

1591 , the u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act , 2007 , which would have provided $625 million for pandemic flu to the phssef , was vetoed by president bush on may 1 , 2007 .

h.r .

2206 , a bill with the same name that passed in the house , would also have provided $625 million to the phssef , but the provision was removed before the bill's enactment as p.l .

110-28 .

the law as enacted provided funds to usaid and the department of the interior for avian flu control .

the administration had opposed , among other things , the inclusion of funding for "avian flu preparedness" as emergency spending in h.r .

2206 , saying that it was adequately addressed in the fy2008 budget request .

as discussed earlier , the administration requested , in november 2005 , $7.1 billion in supplemental funds for pandemic preparedness , of which $1.16 billion was to be available to hhs in fy2008 .

the supplemental amount requested for fy2008 has not been appropriated .

in its budget proposal for fy2008 , the administration requested $1.19 billion in regular appropriations for pandemic flu , including $870 million for the phssef to be available until expended , and $322 million for ongoing agency activities , principally at cdc , fda and the national institutes of health ( nih ) .

on november 13 , 2007 , president bush vetoed h.r .

3043 , the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies appropriations act , 2008 .

the house failed to override the veto on november 15 , 2007 .

the conference report would have provided $764 million to the phssef for pandemic flu activities , of which $686 million was to be used for the development and purchase of vaccine , antiviral drugs , and other supplies .

the conference report also included , for cdc , $37 million for immunization activities related to both seasonal and pandemic flu , and $69 million for global pandemic flu preparedness activities .

agriculture appropriations for fy2008 , which may include pandemic preparedness funding for fda , are also pending at this time .
