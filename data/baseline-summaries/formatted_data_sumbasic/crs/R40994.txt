in june 2009 , the house passed h.r .

2454 , the american clean energy and security act of 2009 .

in november 2009 , chairwoman boxer of the senate committee on environment and public works completed markup of s. 1733 , the clean energy jobs and american power act , by approving a "manager's amendment" as a substitute , and ordered s. 1733 reported .

both the house - passed ( h.r .

2454 ) and the senate - reported ( s. 1733 ) bills would establish a cap - and - trade system to regulate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions , as well as to address energy efficiency , renewable energy , and other energy topics .

among other provisions , both bills would require major reductions in ghg emissions from entities comprising roughly 85% of current u.s. ghg emissions .

covered sectors would include electricity production , natural gas distribution , petroleum refining , and industrial sectors .

these and related bills and issues are currently being debated in congress .

for more detailed information , see crs report r40896 , climate change: comparison of the cap - and - trade provisions in h.r .

2454 and s. 1733 .

the climate provisions in the house - passed and the senate - reported bills would not require ghg emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors .

however , if enacted , provisions in these bills could potentially raise farm input costs for fossil fuels , fertilizers , energy , and other production inputs .

these higher costs could potentially be alleviated by possible farm revenue increases should farmers participate in carbon offset and renewable energy provisions that are part of these bills .

this report provides a background on the energy and climate debate and pending legislation as it pertains to the u.s. agriculture and forestry sectors .

it provides a brief overview of how the agricultural and forestry sectors could be affected by the proposed cap - and - trade programs in climate titles of these bills .

also included in the proposed cap - and - trade programs are provisions that address which industries are to be considered sources of ghg emissions thus requiring emission reductions ; which industries are to be considered as eligible sources of carbon allowances ; and what types of domestic and international carbon storage and emission reduction activities might become eligible under a carbon offset credit program .

this report also describes some of the carbon energy and biomass provisions pertaining to the domestic agricultural and forestry sectors in the energy titles of these bills .

finally , the report describes other related initiatives involving the u.s. agricultural sectors , including updates on related activities being addressed by the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) .

various other potential regulatory and legislative initiatives related to the climate change debate could affect u.s. agriculture .

the most significant and immediate are two epa rulemakings: ( 1 ) a final rule mandating ghg emissions reporting from selected sectors and ( 2 ) a solicitation for comment on how epa should respond to ghgs under the clean air act .

in some cases , the house and senate energy and climate bills contain provisions that address some of these issues .

on september 22 , 2009 , epa announced its final rule to require mandatory reporting of ghg emissions from large sources in the united states to collect emissions data to inform future policy decisions .

both h.r .

2454 and s. 1733 contain provisions that would require climate registries to "collect high - quality greenhouse gas emission data from facilities , corporations , and other organizations to support various ghg emission reporting and reduction policies. .

these bills do not specifically identify the extent to which the u.s. agriculture sector would be affected .

epa's final reporting rule does not require control of ghgs ; rather it requires only that sources above certain threshold emission levels monitor and report emissions .

epa estimates that the rule will cover about 85% of the nation's ghg emissions and apply to roughly 10,000 facilities .

the only farm - level production category subject to epa's final rule are livestock facilities with a manure management system .

affected operations are those that meet or exceed the reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons of co 2 - equivalent , based on the following animal population thresholds: 29,300 head of beef cows , 3,200 dairy cows , 34,100 hogs , 723,600 layers , 38,160,000 broilers , and 7,710,000 turkeys .

epa estimated that there will be approximately 107 livestock facilities that will need to report under the rule .

these operations will be required to report aggregate methane ( ch 4 ) and nitrous oxide ( n 2 o ) emissions from certain manure management system components .

operations that use anaerobic digesters will be required to report ch 4 generated and destroyed , and any ch 4 leakage at the digester .

the final rule excludes other agricultural categories that are known to contribute to ghg emissions , including "enteric fermentation" ( livestock digestion ) , rice cultivation , field burning of agricultural residues , composting ( except when associated with manure management ) , agricultural soils , settlements , forestland or other land uses and land - use changes , or emissions associated with deforestation , and carbon storage in living biomass or harvested wood products .

at this time , epa's final rule does not address emissions from certain food processing sectors .

epa claims that "the sources of ghg emissions at food processing facilities that were to be reported under the proposed rule were stationary fuel combustion , onsite landfills , and onsite wastewater treatment ; " however , the agency has decided not to finalize the portion of the rule covering landfills and wastewater treatment .

facilities subject to reporting would report annually , starting in 2011 .

for more information , see epa's preamble , fact sheets , and cost analysis .

also see crs report rl32948 , air quality issues and animal agriculture: a primer and crs report r40585 , climate change: potential regulation of stationary greenhouse gas sources under the clean air act .

in december 2009 , epa published its final determination that the combined ghg emissions from new motor vehicles in the united states contribute to an "endangerment" from climate change .

more precisely , epa found that such emissions , in the words of clean air act section 202 ( a ) ( 42 u.s.c .

sec .

7521 ( a ) ) , "cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. .

many in the agricultural sectors are concerned that this action may set the stage for a series of rules to regulate ghg emissions in other sectors , including the u.s. agricultural sectors .

epa's endangerment finding follows action taken by epa in 2008 when it issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking ( anpr ) .

since that time , there has been confusion about the extent that u.s. agriculture would be affected by that proposed rule .

some farm groups believed that , as part of the notice , epa was proposing to impose a "cow tax" on livestock operations .

however , the anpr did not recommend the use of any particular caa authority to regulate any emissions , nor did it commit to specific next steps to deal with ghgs , and it did not include a formal proposal to regulate ghgs .

among the options discussed in the anpr was the potential to use the caa's permitting program ( in title v ) to regulate sources of ghg emissions .

agricultural sources were not singled out or highlighted in this discussion .

the anpr did mention the agricultural sectors , but only as background discussion as a source of ghgs , similar to that for other sectors , such as electric utilities .

the title v permit program does require regulated sources to pay permit fees to states , which could be the source of concern among some that , if epa were to use the permitting program in the caa to regulate ghgs , which some claim would automatically result in mandatory fees .

epa noted in its anpr that the caa allows considerable flexibility in setting fee schedules .

epa also stated that in the event of future regulation , it would be appropriate for permitting agencies to use that flexibility in setting any permit fees ( by lowering fees for ghgs , compared with other pollutants , or setting lower fees for smaller sources , or other means ) .

some of these same issues and concerns have persisted regarding epa's endangerment finding .

however , it remains unclear whether this action will trigger other obligations by epa that could affect the u.s. agricultural sectors .

in march 2009 , senator thune and representative lucas introduced bills ( s. 527 and h.r .

1426 , respectively ) that would prevent epa from imposing title v operating permits for controlling ghgs resulting from biological processes associated with livestock production .

the house interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill ( h.r .

2996 , sec .

420 ) includes a similar provision prohibiting the use of available funds to promulgate or implement any regulation requiring the issuance of permits under title v of the clean air act "for carbon dioxide , nitrous oxide , water vapor , or methane emissions resulting from biological processes associated with livestock production. .

in october 2009 , the fy2010 interim appropriations conference agreement included an amendment to block epa efforts to require permits for ghgs emitted by livestock .
