a valid conference report must carry the signatures of a majority of the conferees appointed by each chamber .

house precedents state that "to be valid in the house , a conference report must be signed by a majority of the managers of the house and by a majority of the managers of the senate. .

similarly , senate precedents provide that "[a] conference report to be valid must be signed by a majority of the conferees of each house...." in most cases , no problems arise in determining whether this requirement has been met .

under certain circumstances , however , questions may arise about whether a conference report carries sufficient signatures .

these questions may arise especially in the house , and when one or both chambers appoint some of their conferees only for limited purposes .

usually , each house authorizes at least some of its conferees to negotiate on all the matters in disagreement between the two houses .

conferees with this blanket authority may be called "general conferees. .

either house or both , however , also may authorize some of its conferees to negotiate only on certain of the matters committed to conference .

for example , one chamber might appoint certain of its conferees only to consider title ii of the senate substitute and the corresponding provisions of the house bill .

conferees with this form of authority may be called "limited purpose conferees. .

many limited purpose conferees are named as "additional" conferees , to negotiate along with the general conferees on the specified matters .

some , however , may be named as the "sole" conferees on the matters specified ( in which case the authority of all other conferees also must be limited , so that they are not to negotiate on these matters ) .

when limited purpose conferees are present , the matters before the conference may be thought of as divided into several portions , on each of which a different group of conferees is authorized to negotiate .

the memberships of these different panels of conferees , of course , may overlap .

when limited conferees are present , the house and senate determine whether a conference report carries a sufficient number of signatures in different ways .
