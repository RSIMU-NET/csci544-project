some u.s. policymakers share widespread concern that the united states cannot conduct "whole of government" missions and activities abroad efficiently and effectively .

for the 112 th congress , various proposals to reform interagency authorities , organizations , processes , and personnel dedicated to foreign missions may be of interest , especially as it considers ways to maintain u.s. power and influence as it reduces expenditures .

proponents argue that reforms to rationalize interagency collaboration on foreign missions will not only enhance performance , but also save money by streamlining processes , facilitating cooperation , and reducing duplication .

some reform proposals are relevant to legislation currently before congress , in particular the interagency personnel rotation act of 2011 , which provides for interagency rotations by u.s. government personnel in national security agencies , and the contingency operations oversight and interagency enhancement act of 2011 , as well as the recently approved global security contingency fund , providing an integrated state department - department of defense budget for certain types of security assistance .

the fy2012 ndaa ( p.l .

112-81 ) requires the president to submit to specified congressional committees within 270 days of enactment "an implementation plan for achieving the 'whole - of - government' integration vision prescribed in the president's national security strategy of may 2010. .

 ( see the section on " the obama administration and interagency reform ," below. ) .

for nearly two decades , policymakers have pondered many questions regarding "interagency" missions and activities abroad — including stabilization and reconstruction , security assistance , counterterrorism , humanitarian assistance , and counterinsurgency — in a search to improve them .

a primary question is the appropriate division of labor between the department of defense ( dod ) and civilian agencies , particularly the state department , in conducting these missions and activities .

other questions concern the recommended changes in authorities , processes , organization , structures , and personnel resources to optimize their use .

as policymakers and analysts contemplate the range of probable near - and medium - term future threats — particularly the potential spillover effects of state instability and intrastate conflict , and the growth of terrorist and organized criminal activity — a consensus has grown that major challenges to u.s. national security over the next decades will require interagency responses .

nonetheless , despite a growing sense of a need for interagency reform to address multiple systemic problems , there is little agreement on the solutions .

congress has played a leading role in some aspects of interagency reform .

for instance , the george w. bush administration's creation in 2004 of the state department office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization ( s / crs ) was promoted by senator richard g. lugar and then senator ( now vice president ) joe biden .

some members call for additional congressional initiatives .

to provide context for the 112 th congress's continuing consideration of interagency reform , this report provides perspectives on the questions and issues raised by a broad range of reform proposals offered by research organizations and selected experts .

the focus is on proposals for civilian institutions and personnel .

although dod is a key player in the missions and activities that are the object of proposed reform , its very dominance in many areas underlies calls for reform to build civilian capacity .

thus , this report discusses dod reforms only to the extent that they would foster improved interaction with civilians .

this report starts with a brief history of the impetus for interagency reform during the 1990s and 2000s , and a sketch of clinton , bush , and obama administration measures and initiatives , followed by a discussion of key problems in the context of the current interagency structure .

 ( appendix a provides a fuller discussion of interagency authorities and structures. ) .

the report then provides a short synopsis of the content of reform proposals recommended or published by some three dozen foreign policy and defense organizations and experts .

 ( appendix b , appendix c , appendix d , and appendix e provide a broader discussion of proposed reforms , with tables of the proposals. ) .

the report concludes with a discussion of four broad overarching questions: ( 1 ) is interagency reform necessary for missions abroad ; ( 2 ) which proposals are considered highest priority ; ( 3 ) can interagency reform produce cost savings ; and ( 4 ) must congressional reform accompany other national security measures ? .

for nearly two decades , foreign policy analysts have been troubled by the difficulties that u.s. agencies experience when working together to advance u.s. interests abroad .

after the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold war in 1989 , u.s. policymakers were confronted in the 1990s by new types of missions — the conflicts in haiti , somalia , bosnia , and elsewhere — where conflict could not be brought to an end by force of arms alone .

in these operations , u.s. military forces were tasked with a variety of state - building responsibilities , such as creating justice systems , assisting police , and promoting governance , which many believed were more appropriately performed by civilians .

dod soon realized that it needed assistance from civilian agencies , but those agencies often lacked the resources to help .

further , the united states' agency - centric national security system could not provide the strong leadership and appropriate mechanisms needed to meld military and civilian contributions into effective efforts .

in a first step to address the perceived need to develop coordinated u.s. responses to crises abroad rather than relying on case by case ad hoc responses , the clinton administration issued the may 1997 presidential decision directive ( pdd ) 56 .

this directive , entitled the clinton administration's policy on managing complex contingency operations , dealt with interagency planning , collaboration , and coordination problems by creating new planning and implementing mechanisms .

pdd 56's provisions were not systematically implemented , due to what some analysts have described as internal bureaucratic resistance , although some of its practices were incorporated into planning processes for some subsequent operations .

the first widely distributed call for broad reform of the u.s. national security system was issued in february 2001 by the u.s. commission on national security / 21 st century , the so - called "hart - rudman" commission .

this commission recommended a "significant organizational redesign" of the executive branch "to permit the u.s. government to integrate more effectively the many diverse strands of policy that underpin u.s. national security in a new era — not only the traditional agenda of defense , diplomacy and intelligence , but also economic , counter - terrorism , combating organized crime , protecting the environment , fighting pandemic diseases , and promoting human rights worldwide. .

soon after , the terrorist attacks on the united states of september 11 , 2001 ( 9 / 11 ) , put the problems of interagency cooperation at home and abroad in bold relief for many policymakers and analysts .

the u.s. military interventions in afghanistan ( october 2001 ) and , especially , in iraq ( march 2003 ) manifested — some would say magnified — the perceived deficiencies of previous interagency missions abroad .

these wars heavily stressed u.s. military forces .

they demonstrated that u.s. departments and agencies had difficulty working together productively ; indeed they sometimes worked at cross purposes .

gradually , consensus grew that the united states needed to foster civilian - led interagency collaboration and cooperation in missions abroad , and to develop adequate civilian organizational structures , procedures , and personnel to make that possible .

the united states' system for decision - making and implementing foreign affairs missions and activities is considered dysfunctional by many analysts .

one recent study characterizes the exercise of foreign relations as "a mob scene" of individual and independent agencies .

the problems are perceived across many national security areas , including counterterrorism , failed states / post - conflict stabilization and reconstruction , democracy promotion , and transnational issues ( crime , health , environment , migration , drugs ) .

the three most commonly cited factors responsible for perceived inefficiency and ineffectiveness of interagency efforts abroad are: inadequate civilian strategic planning and interagency operational planning capabilities and processes ; structural weaknesses in the u.s. government system for conducting missions abroad including ( 1 ) department - centric organizations resulting in the tendency for "stove - piping," with each agency reporting up and down through its own chain of command and responsibility for coordination placed on an overburdened white house ; ( 2 ) insufficient civilian resources , including personnel , discouraging domestically oriented agencies from directing funds and personnel away from core missions ; ( 3 ) inadequate mechanisms to foster information sharing within and among agencies ; and ( 4 ) insufficient leadership authority , either de jure or de facto , at the headquarters and field level ; and personnel who are not trained for interagency missions , possessing little , if any , familiarity with the missions , capabilities , and cultures of other departments and agencies .

some analysts also cite strong disagreements among key players over the general purposes of and means to conduct missions as factors impeding successful performance .

improved institutional arrangements and enhanced leadership may provide the means to reduce such disagreements , or their worst effect , in some , but not all , missions .

the perceived problems surface and have repercussions at all levels: in the field ( u.s. embassies or interagency operations on - the - ground ) , at an intermediate ( regional ) level , at department headquarters in washington , dc , and within the executive office of the president , that is , the white house .

how these problems manifest themselves in interagency missions is briefly outlined in the section immediately below .

the next section provides an overview of proposals to address these problems , with extended discussion in the appendices .

congress has considerable authority regarding interagency reform .

through its appropriations power , congress ultimately controls reforms that require additional resources , such as personnel , facilities , and additional education and training .

congress also sets through statute the organization of the top levels of executive branch departments and agencies , conditioning the executive's ability to put in place new high - level posts and organizational units .

these include positions at the nsc , and leadership positions ( i.e. , assistant secretary and above ) at the civilian departments , including state , defense , usaid , and others .

congress also has considerable influence over other personnel matters , through its power to promote civilian and military officers and fix other terms of employment .

even where the executive branch has the authority to make changes on its own , congress can stimulate reforms by enacting legislation that would break bureaucratic resistance ; for instance , congress can mandate new procedures and processes by requiring strategy and budget documents that deal with these matters .

congress may also encourage changes indirectly through hearings , briefings , and meetings with executive branch officials .

while contemplating the utility of specific reforms , members may also wish to consider a number of issues .

four addressed below are whether interagency reform is necessary ; to what extent the u.s. military should be relied upon ; how to prioritize proposed reforms ; and whether interagency reform will produce budget savings ? .

the united states' ability to protect its interests and play a global leadership role may be significantly affected by the way in which it brings resources to bear on new and continuing national security challenges .

most immediate are the new state - building needs of transforming arab states .

over the longer run , if advanced countries' economic troubles increase developing countries' economic distress , the united states may engage even more in counterterrorism and conflict prevention .

in an era of constrained budgets , congress may be increasingly interested in examining the possibilities that interagency reform may improve the use of resources .

for instance , improved strategic planning and "whole - of - government" budgeting may focus resource allocation more effectively .

organizations and officials may produce better results if given the authority to harness the necessary resources to accomplish their missions , irrespective of their agency identification .

better trained and experienced personnel may carry out their duties more effectively .

finally , as the u.s. military , especially the u.s. army , reviews its purposes while it shrinks its forces , the need for rebalancing military and civilian state - building capacity may be further emphasized .

 appendix a provides an overview of u.s. interagency institutions and arrangements .

the subsequent appendices discuss salient reform proposals from 38 sources , with each appendix addressing one ( or a subset of one ) of the three problem areas perceived as contributing to the inability of civilian agencies to effectively plan , organize , and implement missions abroad .

appendix b deals with proposals to improve strategy - making , planning , and budgeting .

appendix c surveys a broad sweep of proposals to enhance institutional arrangements , resources , and civilian authority at the headquarters level .

appendix d focuses on enhancing civilian authority at the field level , that is , proposals to enhance the authority and capacity of u.s .

ambassadors .

appendix e examines proposals to create or improve interagency personnel policies and mechanisms .

the appendices exclude discussion and proposals concerning specific field or program level interagency issues ( such as those involving the structure and operation of provincial reconstruction teams ) and proposals to strengthen the capacity of individual agencies and departments , other than the interagency role of the state department .

they also do not include proposals that already have been implemented .

for instance , the recent creation of the consortium for complex operations at the national defense university addresses past proposals for a better interagency "lessons learned" capability , although some may argue that this capability would be better placed in the state department or at usaid .

they do not include proposals on foreign assistance reform , which is covered in a previous crs report , crs report r40102 , foreign aid reform: studies and recommendations , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] .

they also do not address "whole - of - government" reforms that bear on the success of activities and missions abroad , for instance , the need to commit adequate resources for a substantial period of time to achieve stabilization and reconstruction goals in post - conflict settings .

as this report focuses on executive branch interagency reform , the tables do not include proposals for the reform of congressional oversight of interagency activities .

this topic is covered in a broad sense in the section " should congressional reform accompany other national security reform measures ? .

above .

in the tables , the language used for the proposal descriptions is generally an exact quote or a close paraphrasing of the proposal .

quotation marks are often omitted for clarity .

these tables do not include recommendations that have already been implemented .

this is far from an exhaustive list of all proposals by all individuals or organizations .

proposals were selected because they represent the types of proposals advanced , because they are issued by organizations and individuals with a recognized depth of expertise on the issues , or because they are significantly unique .

appendix a. interagency authorities and structures the national security council ( nsc ) and national security staff role in policy coordination established by the national security act of 1947 , the nsc is "the president's principal forum for considering national security and foreign policy matters with his senior national security advisors and cabinet officials," according to the white house website .

the nsc also advises and assists the president on these matters and "serves as the president's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies," according to the website .

the act specifically sets forth the nsc's "whole - of - government" coordination role , stating that the function of the council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic , foreign , and military policies relating to the national security so as to enable the military services and other departments and agencies of the government to cooperate more effectively in matters involving the national security .

the act also provides that the nsc , "for the purpose of more effectively coordinating the policies and functions of the departments and agencies of the government relating to the national security," shall "consider policies on matters of common interest to the departments and agencies of the government concerned with the national security , and to make recommendations to the president in connection therewith. .

the law does not specifically set "hands - on" coordination in the implementation phase as an nsc staff function .

the law leaves wide discretion to the president in many areas .

in particular , the nsc may perform "such other functions as the president may direct. .

nsc supporting units and staff are structured according to the president's design .

and the president may appoint nsc members in addition to the statutory members .

because the law leaves the president great leeway in determining nsc and nsc staff size ( subject to appropriations ) , functions , and organization , each administration has used the nsc differently .

over time , the nsc staff ( known as the "national security staff" or nss ) has taken on among its responsibilities "coordination of the interagency policy process and policy implementation follow - up," and "articulation of the president's policies to other departments. .

nevertheless , the staff structure and its role in developing and coordinating policy among executive branch agencies varies from administration to administration , often depending on a president's relationships with department heads and the national security advisor , as well as a president's preferences and the management style of the national security advisor .

the state department's responsibility for oversight and coordination the secretary of state "plays the lead role in developing and implementing the president's foreign policy," and is entrusted under current statutes with primacy for ensuring the coherence of foreign assistance in support of that policy .

the foreign assistance act of 1961 , as amended ( faa ) , provides that the secretary of state , under the direction of the president , "shall be responsible for the continuous supervision and general direction of economic assistance , military assistance , and military education and training programs ... to the end that such programs are effectively integrated both at home and abroad and the foreign policy of the united states is best served thereby. .

oversight and direction are not equivalent to coordination , however .

this statutory language does not explicitly charge the secretary of state or the state department with responsibility for coordinating the implementation of u.s. foreign policy and foreign assistance .

instead , coordination responsibility is vested in the secretary of state through other legislation or presidential orders , or a combination of those .

for instance , the state department , under the policy guidance of the secretary of state , has primary responsibility for administering all development ( broadly defined to include economic , political , and social aid ) assistance .

in 1992 , congress adopted legislation stating that "the secretary of state shall be responsible for coordinating all assistance provided by the united states government to support international efforts to combat illicit narcotics production or trafficking. .

through national security presidential directive ( nspd ) 44 , entitled management of interagency efforts concerning reconstruction and stabilization , president george w. bush vested the secretary of state with responsibility for coordinating and leading "integrated united states government efforts , involving all u.s .

departments and agencies with relevant capabilities , to prepare , plan for , and conduct stabilization and reconstruction activities. .

 ( the secretary of state's relationship to dod under this authority seems more limited .

somewhat ambiguously , the next sentence states that the "secretary of state shall coordinate such efforts with the secretary of defense to ensure harmonization with any planned or ongoing u.s. military operations across the spectrum of conflict." ) .

the state department organizational structure includes four coordinating offices of highly differing scope .

one office focuses on foreign assistance to europe and eurasia ; another on hiv / aids assistance ; a third on counterterrorism efforts around the world , usually on a regional basis ; and a fourth on stabilization and reconstruction ( s&r ) activities throughout the world .

the last of these was transformed into a bureau in late 2011 .

the coordinators , that is , the heads of the first three of these offices , are equivalent in rank to an assistant secretary rank , and are confirmed by the senate , but they report directly to the secretary of state rather than through a state department bureau .

the president will nominate an assistant secretary for the new s&r bureau .

this bureau was created in line with obama administration plans , outlined in the december 2010 quadrennial diplomacy and development review ( qddr ) , to upgrade the coordinator offices on counterterrorism and on s&r — in an effort to make them more effective .

 ( see below , the section on creating new agencies or arrangements. ) .

office of the coordinator of u.s. assistance to europe and eurasia well before the call for interagency reform in complex contingency operations became widespread , congress created two interagency coordinator posts in the state department , one responsible for assistance to eastern europe and the other for assistance to the former soviet union .

in 2001 , these posts were combined into the state department office of the coordinator of u.s. assistance to europe and eurasia .

this office oversees the bilateral economic , security , democracy , and humanitarian assistance provided by all u.s. government agencies to the 18 states of the former soviet union and eastern europe .

this office reports to the secretary of state through the director of the foreign assistance ( i.e. , "f" ) bureau .

office of the u.s .

global aids coordinator the office of the u.s .

global aids coordinator ( ogac ) was established in 2003 by the united states leadership against hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria act of 2003 ( p.l .

108-25 ) .

section 102 ( b ) ( i ) of that act charges the coordinator with "primary responsibility for oversight and coordination of all resources and international activities of the united state government to combat the hiv / aids pandemic. .

responsibilities include coordinating among all relevant executive branch agencies and non - governmental organizations , and dispersing funds provided under the u.s. president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) .

office of the coordinator for counterterrorism ( s / ct ) the office of the coordinator for counterterrorism ( s / ct ) "coordinates and supports the development and implementation of all u.s. government policies and programs aimed at countering terrorism overseas," according to its website .

a major s / ct function is to facilitate and encourage interagency collaboration at the regional level , in particular to stimulate ideas for multi - country activities and provide a mechanism for integrating interagency programs .

 ( despite the use of the term "coordination" on the office's website , the actual function of the office appears to be encouraging collaboration , or voluntary cooperation , among agencies. ) .

it also provides input to dod counterterrorism activities , such as those conducted under "section 1206" funding and the combating terrorism fellowship program ( ctfp ) .

however , the office does not have authority to compel other offices and agencies to develop , conduct , or participate in programs , nor a program budget to leverage or compel others to participate .

its origins date back to 1972 , when the office for combatting [sic]terrorism was established after the munich olympics terrorist attack .

 ( according to the s / ct website , president richard nixon appointed a special committee which proposed that the state department create an office to provide day - to - day coordination for counterterrorism activities and to develop u.s. government policy initiatives and responses. ) .

in 1994 , congress provided a mandate for the office of the coordinator for counterterrorism and defined the coordinator's role as being the principal adviser to the secretary of state on international counterterrorism matters , and providing "overall supervision ( including policy oversight of resources ) of international counterterrorism activities. .

bureau of conflict and stabilization operations ( formerly the office of the coordinator for stabilization and reconstruction ) in mid - 2004 , the bush administration established the state department office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization ( s / crs ) .

in december of that year , the office was provided with a congressional mandate ( section 408 of division d , p.l .

108-447 ) ; in october 2008 , its establishment was codified , along with that of the civilian response corps and reserve for which it is responsible ( title xvi , p.l .

110-417 ) .

 ( civilian response corps active and standby members deploy at the request of regional bureaus and ambassadors to assist with strategic planning in conflict , post - conflict settings and states at risk of instability .

the reserve component has never been formed. ) .

in december 2005 , through presidential decision directive 44 , the bush administration provided that the secretary of state could delegate responsibilities for stabilization and reconstruction activities to the s / crs coordinator .

in late november 2011 , the state department transferred s / crs functions to a new bureau for conflict and stabilization operations ( cso ) , as contemplated by the 2010 qddr .

the bureau is expected to play a greater role than s / crs in developing policy and planning for missions , becoming " the institutional locus for policy and operational solutions for crisis , conflict , and instability," according to the cso website .

the head of cso bureau , the assistant secretary for conflict and stabilization operations , will also hold the title of coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization .

other agencies' roles u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) usaid is the u.s. federal government agency primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and plays an important role in various interagency activities and missions .

an independent agency , usaid receives overall foreign policy guidance from the secretary of state .

it describes itself as "the principal u.s. agency to extend assistance to countries recovering from disaster , trying to escape poverty , and engaging in democratic reforms. .

usaid programs support economic growth , agriculture , trade , global health , democracy , and conflict prevention throughout the world .

usaid has a headquarters staff based in washington , dc , of 2,255 , and a staff overseas of 1,634 , supplemented by 4,469 foreign nationals abroad .

usaid often carries out its program through contracts or cooperative arrangements with private voluntary organizations , indigenous organizations , universities , american businesses , international agencies , other governments , and other u.s. government agencies .

usaid is the lead agency in u.s. disaster relief and other humanitarian assistance .

the usaid administrator ( the agency's head ) leads interagency disaster relief efforts , which often include dod and support from the department of agriculture .

the usaid office of foreign disaster assistance's disaster assistance and relief teams ( generally known as darts ) are quickly deployed to a disaster area ( after an initial assessment ) , providing trained specialists to assist u.s. embassies and usaid missions respond to disasters .

besides its state - building and economic development activities , usaid has long played a major role in u.s. state - building and other s&r efforts in conflict and in post - conflict settings from vietnam forward .

the usaid office of transition initiatives ( oti ) , established in 1994 , modeled itself as a rapid response unit after the dart teams .

it has had a key role in s&r efforts , in the case of iraq arriving in baghdad "about the same time as the first u.s .

troops. .

other executive departments and agencies several executive departments have offices or agencies that work abroad and some have foreign service officers posted abroad whose work contributes to interagency efforts , particularly in stabilization and reconstruction missions .

these include the departments of treasury , agriculture , commerce , energy , health and human services , homeland security , justice , and transportation .

all but treasury participate in the civilian response corps ( crc ) system under s / crs .

u.s. chiefs of mission ( ambassadors ) and embassy country teams in normal circumstances , u.s .

ambassadors overseas bear the greatest responsibility for ensuring the coordination of foreign assistance and foreign policy in the countries to which they are appointed .

under the u.s. constitution , the president appoints ambassadors with the advice and consent of the senate .

an ambassador serves as the president's personal representative abroad .

in addition , an ambassador , or other civilian serving as a chief of mission ( com ) , has the sole authority to oversee u.s. foreign policy in individual countries .

some experts judge that the authority exercised by chiefs of mission "provides the president with the clearest and most forceful cross - departmental executive authority mechanism in use today. .

section 622 ( b ) of the foreign assistance act of 1961 , as amended , charges the ambassador , or other responsible official , with the leadership role in ensuring coordination regarding foreign assistance programs , including u.s. military assistance , among government representatives in each country , under procedures prescribed by the president .

section 622 ( b ) states: "the chief of the diplomatic mission shall make sure that recommendations of such representatives pertaining to military assistance are coordinated with political and economic considerations , and that his [sic] comments shall accompany such recommendations if he so desires. .

the embassy "country teams," that is , the group in every embassy comprised of representatives of all u.s. departments and agencies present in a country , bear much responsibility for turning the president's broad foreign policy into concrete diplomatic measures and foreign assistance programs .

the team operates under the direction and authority of the u.s .

ambassador or other com .

country teams vary according to embassy size and u.s. interests in a country ; some may include representatives from some 40 u.s. departments and agencies .

in addition to state department personnel , many embassies have personnel from at least the departments of agriculture , defense , commerce , homeland security , and justice , as well as usaid .

other departments represented may be health and human services , interior , labor , transportation , and treasury .

individual agencies from these departments may also be represented on country teams .

as codified by the foreign service act of 1980 ( p.l .

96-465 , §207 ) an ambassador ( or other chief of mission ) is charged , under the direction of the president , with "full responsibility for the direction , coordination , and supervision of all government executive branch employees" within the country .

this statute also requires that the ambassador ( or other com ) "shall keep fully and currently informed with respect to all activities and operations of the government within that country," and "shall insure that all government executive branch employees within that country ( except for voice of america correspondents on official assignment and employees under the command of a united states area military commander ) comply with all applicable directives of the chief of mission. .

national security decision directive ( nsdd ) 38 gives chiefs of mission the authority to determine the size , composition , and mandate of personnel operating under her / his authority .

 ( each ambassador , upon assuming his / her post , receives a personal letter from the president spelling out similar responsibilities. ) .

nevertheless , the nature of ambassadorial leadership and the use of country teams as integrative mechanisms varies greatly from country to country , according to observers .

much depends on the interest , knowledge , and management ability of the individual ambassador , as well as his relationship with officials in washington .

mechanisms to integrate civilian perspectives into dod missions and activities for nearly a decade , the u.s. military has attempted to incorporate an increasing number of civilians from other departments and agencies into its structures , by creating either new interagency groups or new posts for civilian agency representatives .

 ( note , the state department has long assigned senior officials as political advisors or polads to the geographic combatant command , or gcc , commanders. ) .

beginning in 2002 , as discussed below , dod began to reach out for further civilian input by requiring each gcc to set up a joint interagency coordination group that would function as an advisory body to the combatant commander , initially on counterterrorism issues .

in 2004 , a usaid office of military affairs was established at usaid washington , dc , headquarters , with liaison personnel sent to each gcc to advise on military activities with development implications .

a more recent step was the creation of multiple civilian positions within some gccs .

in 2007 , the u.s. africa command was set up as the model "interagency" command , with designated civilian billets .

the u.s. southern command ( latin america and the caribbean ) and others subsequently increased civilian participation .

joint interagency coordination groups ( jiacg ) for several years , gccs have each hosted a jiacg , an advisory body composed of military personnel from all services and civilian personnel from a variety of agencies , usually numbering about one dozen .

jiacgs were established through a memorandum from the nsc deputies committee in early 2002 instructing combatant commanders to implement the jiacgs concept .

 ( at the u.s. european command , the jiacg was named the interagency engagement group. ) .

headed in most cases by a member of the federal senior executive service ( ses ) , the jiacg was designed to facilitate interagency information sharing for the operations and activities of the combatant commands and to enhance the understanding of civilian agency perceptions and activities within the commands .

the initial focus of the jiacgs was counterterrorism .

jiacg structures and tasks , as well as the use that the combatant commanders make of them , have evolved over time .

some observers express concern that jiacgs have not always fulfilled the civilian advisory function originally intended .

nevertheless , it seems difficult to generalize about jiacgs .

some are little used , some are used extensively , and some have been virtually subsumed under or replaced by other interagency arrangements ( see below ) .

usaid office of civilian - military cooperation in response to increasing concerns about possible conflicts between increasing u.s. military activities and sound development objectives , usaid established in 2005 an office of military affairs ( oma ) to provide input and oversight to u.s. military activities abroad .

in november 2011 , oma was renamed the office of civilian - military cooperation .

under this office , senior usaid development officials are assigned to gccs ( see above ) and to pentagon offices .

in addition , military liaison officers from the gccs and from the special operations command are assigned to usaid headquarters .

civilian posts at the geographic combatant commands while the jiacgs have operated outside the formal organizational structure of combatant commands , some gccs have created new posts within the command's organizational structure for civilian personnel from other departments and agencies .

this personnel augmentation includes senior usaid representatives that have been brought in through the usaid office of military affairs , established in 2005 , as well as civilians from other agencies .

two commands have become the most integrated: the u.s. africa command ( africom ) covering all of sub - saharan africa , and the u.s. southern command ( southcom ) , covering central and south america , as well as the caribbean .

according to dod's june 2011 report to congress on the organization of the gccs , africom had 39 civilian "interagency" personnel assigned fulltime to its headquarters staff , with at least one from each of the civilian agencies relevant to its mission , while southcom had 29 from 13 agencies .

both commands have also integrated senior civilian personnel into command leadership by establishing civilian "deputy to the commander" posts occupied by senior state department foreign service officials , as has the u.s. european command ( eucom ) .

eucom , which covers 51 countries including russia and the countries of greater europe , has incorporated its interagency engagement group ( i.e. , its jiacg ) into its command structure as an interagency partnering directorate ( currently lead by an army civilian ) .

as of the end of fy2011 , eucom expected to have 13 interagency personnel at the command .

the u.s. central command ( centcom ) , covering 20 states ( egypt , states on the arabian peninsula , and in central and south asia ) , has "20 liaison members from other u.s. government departments and agencies" working with centcom staff .

the report contained no information on interagency personnel within the staff structure of the u.s. pacific command ( pacom ) and northcom .

other interagency mechanisms interagency task forces interagency cooperation for missions abroad has largely been accomplished through multi - agency task forces .

most often these task forces are pulled together in times of crisis or periods of transition when agency roles are not clear , and constitute the very ad hoc structures that are criticized as inadequate and dysfunctional .

at the field level , these are sometimes referred to as "hastily formed networks. .

established task forces there are long - standing task forces in two mission areas involving the protection of u.s. borders .

three task forces are organized under three gccs to coordinate military and civilian counternarcotics , and in some cases counter - terrorism , efforts .

following congress's 1988 designation of dod as the lead agency for the detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime drug trafficking into the united states , dod set up three task forces to combat drug trafficking .

the purpose of the task forces was to coordinate the support and assistance that dod provides to civilian law enforcement agencies under other authorities .

in 1994 , two of the dod task forces served as the base for the establishment of two interagency task forces: the joint interagency task force - south ( jiatfs ) under southcom in florida ( often pointed to as a model task force ) , and joint interagency task force west ( jiatfwest ) under the u.s. pacific command in hawaii .

jiatfs stated function is "to facilitate the interdiction of illicit trafficking and other narco - terrorist threats in support of national and partners' national security. .

jiaftwest describes its mission as providing support "to law enforcement for counterdrug and drug - related activities. .

the third dod task force , joint task force north ( jtfn ) under the u.s. northern command , is not formally an interagency task force , but it is located at fort bliss , near el paso , tx , near the civilian interagency operation alliance , a civilian task force of federal , state , and local civilian law enforcement agencies .

jtfn ( known as joint task force north until 2004 ) coordinates activities along the southwest border and the gulf of mexico .

it provides support to federal law enforcement agencies for counternarcotics and homeland security missions .

task forces by another name the provincial reconstruction teams ( prts ) that have operated in iraq and afghanistan may be considered a type of task force .

these teams — which have consisted of 20 to 100 members — were first formed in afghanistan in 2002 , and then were established in iraq in 2005 .

members were drawn largely from dod , the state department , and usaid .

the original concept was for the prts to be mixed civilian - military teams that would operate in afghanistan's provinces , coordinating u.s. government support from civilian agencies to local authorities and providing a secure environment for aid agencies involved in reconstruction work in areas outside kabul .

prts were stood up first in afghanistan and then in iraq .

their purpose was to build basic infrastructure and to provide assistance , advice , and mentoring to provincial and local government and officials in a wide range of areas , including governance , political and economic development , rule of law , education and culture , and public health .

despite numerous problems — among them what many considered an initial disproportionate representation by dod , given that civilian agencies at first could not provide the requisite personnel — the prts have persisted in afghanistan .

in iraq , with the transition to a u.s. state department lead for the u.s. presence there , the 15 prts were dissolved in fy2011 .

their engagement , stabilization , and liaison functions are conducted through state department civilian diplomatic posts , and other functions were turned over to iraqi provincial and local governments .

in addition , the interagency civilian response corps ( crc ) teams , mentioned above , may be viewed as a form of interagency task force .

although their assignments are still limited , crc deployed personnel , often from two or more civilian agencies , work together as teams , developing data , conducting interviews , and stimulating the thinking of u.s. government employees in the field about approaches to conflict mitigation and resolution in their countries .

interagency informal arrangements interagency collaboration may occur through informal arrangements developed by those responsible for program planning and implementation .

for example , although legislation establishing the dod regional counterterrorism fellowship program ( ctfp ) has no provision for state department coordination or collaboration , dod regularly consults with the state department on ctfp programming .

in afghanistan , dod and civilian personnel at the field level often have devised informal arrangements to better integrate their work .

appendix b .

proposals to improve strategy - making , planning , and budgeting many foreign policy and interagency reform analyses express concern that successive administrations have done at best a fair job in integrating the various elements of foreign policy making and have not engaged at all in making strategy , that is , matching resources to policy decisions and priorities .

in 2001 , the united states commission on national security / 21 st century ( hart - rudman commission ) flatly stated that "strategic planning is largely absent within the u.s. government .

the planning that does occur is ad hoc and specific to executive departments and agencies .

no overarching strategic framework guides u.s. national security policymaking or resource allocation. .

the project on national security reform ( pnsr ) in 2008 described the united states' "inability to formulate and implement a coherent strategy" as corroding all governmental processes by "hindering planning , creating gaps , duplicating efforts , frustrating leaders , and encouraging ad hoc short cuts. .

further , the pnsr historical case studies identified a link between poor strategy and policy formulation and deficient implementation , with the lack of clarity and unity at top levels fomenting rivalries and "stove - piping" at lower levels .

the reasons pnsr cited for these problems at the leadership level ranged from the behavior of top leaders to insufficient information flows at the executive level .

many other analysts have also cited a need for systems and procedures to ensure the development of coherent strategy , guide planning , and bring to bear sufficient leadership and direction .

in discussing civil - military operations to quell conflict , from initial intervention to the state - building phase , two experts pointed to three reasons for improving strategy , planning , and leadership that would hold true for many u.s. government missions and activities abroad .

these are ( 1 ) the mutual dependence among agencies to carry out complex missions , ( 2 ) the contentious policy issues that can lead to problems in the field if not addressed at the outset , and ( 3 ) the shortages of personnel and other resources that demand their optimal use .

from the hart - rudman commission forward , many organizations and experts have advanced proposals to enhance or improve strategy - making and planning processes , including reforms at the nsc ( table b - 1 , table b - 2 , table b - 3 ) , creating specific new strategy development processes and documents ( table b - 4 ) , or making other changes to rationalize or enhance strategy development and planning ( table b - 5 ) .

many have also recommended integrating national security budgets ( table b - 6 ) and / or improving budget processes ( table b - 7 ) .

the obama administration has two initiatives in the budgeting area .

one is a request that congress establish a global security contingency fund , providing a pool of integrated dod and state department funding for security assistance .

another is a plan for ambassadors to participate in budget - making at the country team level .

 ( see the section on integrated budgets , below. ) .

in addition , state department , united states agency for international development ( usaid ) , and department of defense ( dod ) planners have recently formed a "3d planning group" to improve their collaboration in planning .

modify national security council and staff roles , responsibilities , processes , or structures proposals for improving strategy - making and planning have centered on the national security council ( nsc ) processes and nsc staff .

policy and strategy - making for foreign policy and affairs is the prerogative of the president , normally conducted through the nsc and its staff , with the participation of dod , the state department , and other agencies .

nonetheless , the president and the nsc staff have been widely viewed for many years as so overwhelmed with the tasks of conducting day - to - day governance that the nsc cannot direct the processes of making coherent policy and strategy .

analysts offer differing solutions .

some would create new nsc staff positions ( table b - 1 ) , new nsc staff structures ( table b - 2 ) , or assign new responsibilities to the nsc staff ( table b - 3 ) .

this might require expanding the size of the nsc staff ; alternatively , the president might delegate these functions to others .

the composition of the nsc itself is largely set by statute , but it is the president's prerogative to determine nsc staff structure and size , subject of course to appropriations .

any substantial changes in staff size , or the creation of new nsc staff units or additional posts elsewhere to handle delegated functions would , through their budgetary implications , be a matter for congressional action .

nevertheless , any codification of size or structure , as mentioned above , may be considered impinging on a president's flexibility to structure the white house in accordance with circumstances and the capacity of available personnel .

create new procedures to facilitate strategy - making and planning many proposals to make interagency missions more effective start with or include recommendations for new or improved government - wide , comprehensive strategy and planning reviews or documents .

 ( table b - 4 ) such annual or periodic reviews and documents would serve to clarify agency roles and facilitate agency planning and mission integration .

the proposals usually call for modeling the documents after improved versions of the president's national security strategy report and the dod quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) .

some proposals explicitly tie the creation of new strategy documents to the development of national security budgets .

there also are a variety of other proposals to rationalize strategy development and planning capabilities and processes by creating new posts , mechanisms , procedures , or practices to facilitate coordination and oversight ( table b - 5 ) .

in an obama administration effort to integrate plans and budgets , secretary of state clinton said that chiefs of mission will play a role in integrating country - level strategic plans and budgets .

at a february 2 , 2011 , meeting of ambassadors ( billed as the first annual chief of mission conference ) the secretary stated , "each chief of mission will be responsible for overseeing an integrated country strategy that will bring together all country - level planning processes and efforts into one single multiyear overarching strategy that encapsulates u.s. policy priorities , objectives , and the means by which diplomatic engagement , foreign assistance , and other tools will be used to achieve them. .

integrate national security budgets or improve budgeting procedures another significant perceived system deficiency is the current practice of budgeting by agency rather than by mission or goal .

many proposals would integrate agency budgets relevant to national security , either as a whole or for a specific sector ( table b - 6 ) .

others seek to improve the budgeting process ( table b - 7 ) .

the concept of an integrated national security budget dates back at least to the 2001 u.s. commission on national security .

the commission faulted the budgeting process for its failure to make clear how the allocation of resources in agency budgets addressed national security goals , and to systematically consider tradeoffs in the allocation of those resources .

it also noted the problem for congressional oversight from the absence of a unified budget .

"at present , therefore , neither the congress nor the american people can assess the relative value of various national security programs over the full range of executive branch activities in this area. .

budgeting by agency can lead to duplication of efforts in some areas and gaps in others , as well as incoherent budget information on activities and missions undertaken by multiple agencies .

preparation of a full scale integrated budget would be a complex undertaking .

it would involve the pragmatic exercise of bringing intellectual rigor to the concepts and programs involved .

potentially , it could also involve bureaucratic challenges over the appropriate allocation of missions , programs , and funds .

perhaps because of the complexity of preparing a fully integrated national security budget , the commission on national security proposed that the first of them "focus on a few of the nation's most critical strategic goals , involving only some programs in the departmental budgets. .

 ( the first strategic areas the commission proposed for the initial document were homeland security , counterterrorism , nonproliferation , nuclear threat reduction , and science and technology. ) .

eventually , the commission stated , the national security budget "could evolve into a more comprehensive document. .

that complexity may also explain why subsequent recommendations called for sector - specific integrated budgets or budget presentations ( with proposals limited to security assistance , or counterterrorism ) , or greater transparency and combined decision - making on state , usaid , and dod budgets in areas of overlap .

whether an integrated national security budget or integrated sector specific budgets will increase government efficiency and effectiveness may depend on what is meant by the term "integrated. .

the budget exercise of providing information on all u.s. national security accounts in one document may well bring more transparency .

funding could be totaled by mission areas , providing a comprehensive view of u.s. government spending in vital areas , such as counterterrorism , that is not now available .

this could facilitate oversight .

however , to achieve efficiencies and increase effectiveness by coordinating programs through shared cross - agency accounts may involve other changes .

reform of strategy and planning structures may be required to manage "blended" funds .

another drawback mentioned by some analysts are possible complications for congress in handling integrated budgets under its current department and agency - centric committee system .

the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 ) provides congress , through the joint select committee on intelligence , with an opportunity to view the defense and international affairs budgets as a whole .

this legislation consolidates the dod , state department , and usaid budgets , as well as others , under a comprehensive "security" category .

this type of exercise in considering overlapping defense and international affairs spending may produce useful insights for future budget integration .

the obama administration has endorsed the idea of establishing a full integrated national security budget and is taking preliminary steps to achieve that goal .

in a may 2010 speech , secretary of state clinton noted that the administration wanted "to begin to talk about a national security budget ... [where] you can see the tradeoffs and the savings. .

the december 2010 qddr , as mentioned above , signals the administration's intent to advance the discussion .

a first step proposed in the qddr was the pooled dod - state global security contingency fund ( gscf ) .

in december 2011 , congress provided authority for the gscf in the fy2012 national defense authorization act ( section 1207 , h.r .

1540 , p.l .

112-81 , signed into law december 31 , 2011 ) .

proposed by the state department as a three - year pilot project , the fund may make clear the degree to which associated changes are needed .

appendix c. proposals to enhance civilian authority , institutional arrangements , and resources for interagency missions abroad the predominant role of the department of defense ( dod ) in missions and activities that some policymakers and experts ( including some dod and military leaders ) argue would be better placed in civilian hands is often attributed to the weaknesses of civilian institutions and leadership .

the weaknesses cited include inadequate authority , inappropriate structures , and insufficient civilian resources , especially personnel .

most of the studies surveyed for this report judged that leaving many of the "nation - building" or "state - building" tasks that dod has assumed in military hands is problematic .

 ( see the section , above , entitled " to what extent should the u.s. military provide needed state - building capabilities ? " ) .

as a result , improvements to the existing civilian institutions and institutional authorities of the national security system , particularly the department of state and its secretary , have been the mainstay of many recommendations for interagency reform .

most often , the secretary of state leads civilian efforts in missions and activities abroad , but , on occasion , the president looks elsewhere for a leader .

the civilian alternatives to leadership by the secretary of state and the state department for interagency missions have also been viewed by some as unsatisfactory .

over the years , presidents have routinely turned to the appointment of "czars" to head interagency efforts in a large number of areas of interagency cooperation .

although their offices offer a venue for interagency operations , the czars themselves often have not possessed the authority or ability to coordinate interagency operations .

further , some members view "czars" as lacking accountability to congress ; the 112 th congress expressly denied the administration authority to fund such offices .

 ( president obama rejected the prohibition as an unconstitutional intrusion on executive branch prerogatives. ) .

for certain activities and missions , presidents may appoint "lead agencies" to coordinate interagency efforts .

but lead agencies , including the department of state when it plays this role , are often viewed as ineffective because their mandates to coordinate activities are not accompanied by the requisite authority and resources .

also , in some cases the lead agency's agenda and underlying assumptions may not square with those of other agencies .

thus , civilian agencies often have no incentive to divert personnel and funding for programs that do not further their core functions or otherwise serve their interests .

proposals to enhance civilian authority and institutions are numerous .

many proposals focus on increasing state department capacity and authority ( table c - 1 , table c - 2 ) ; others would transfer some state department stabilization and reconstruction ( s&r ) functions elsewhere ( table c - 3 ) .

others would create new institutions or structures for s&r and other missions abroad ( table c - 4 ) , create interagency task forces ( table c - 5 ) , enhance civilian regional presence ( table c - 6 , table c - 7 ) , and increase civilian interagency personnel capacity ( table c - 8 , table c - 9 , table c - 10 ) .

obama administration interagency reform plans and actions include ( 1 ) creating two new bureaus , one for conflict and stabilization operations and the other for counterterrorism ; ( 2 ) establishing regional hubs ; ( 3 ) better supporting the military geographic combatant commands ; and ( 4 ) increasing civilian personnel .

these are discussed below .

 ( plans to enhance chief of mission authority are discussed in appendix d . ) .

enhance state department authority and capacity the secretary of state is formally the lead civilian official for developing and implementing foreign policy and , through a patchwork of statutes and executive orders , has authority for a variety of ancillary roles .

 ( see appendix a . ) .

the secretary's ability to carry out all her responsibilities is severely constrained by a lack of appropriate authorities and organizational structures , adequate numbers of personnel with the appropriate skills , and a sufficient budget , according to many analysts .

there is particular concern that the department of state does not possess the capacity to take the lead in three key areas: counterterrorism , security assistance , and stabilization and reconstruction .

in all three areas , congress has been willing to provide dod with authority and resources to carry out missions .

several of the studies surveyed recommend a wide variety of ways to enhance the state department's ability to lead , coordinate , and conduct interagency missions and activities .

these include a new authorities , new procedures , restructuring , and the cultivation of an "operational" ethos for interagency missions ( table c - 1 ) .

the state department's ability to lead , coordinate , and conduct s&r missions is of particular concern , and several recommendations were specifically targeted at improving s&r capacity ( table c - 2 ) .

in 2011 , the obama administration elevated the status and expanded the functions of two state department offices coordinating interagency efforts: the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization ( s / crs ) , and the office of the coordinator for counterterrorism ( s / ct ) .

as proposed by the 2010 quadrennial defense and diplomacy review ( qddr ) and implemented after consultation with congress , the obama administration created a new conflict and stabilization operations ( cso ) bureau ( incorporating s / crs ) and a new counterterrorism bureau .

on the other hand , some analysts would neither expand nor enhance the state department's stabilization and reconstruction ( s&r ) role .

they view the state department's culture , rooted in its core mission of diplomacy , as an insurmountable barrier that no restructuring , increases in personnel , or additional budgetary resources could overcome .

because an agency's core mission shapes recruitment and promotion selection criteria , some analysts argue that the state department will never make effective use of personnel skilled at planning and conducting operational missions .

some of these analysts also doubt the state department's ability to effectively oversee missions to prevent and manage conflict .

instead , they would build up the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) or create a new agency to manage operational and preventive missions ( table c - 3 ) .

create new agencies , arrangements , authorities recently , concerns about the gaps in civilian structures to coordinate interagency missions — both steady state and extraordinary — have led some to argue for new arrangements at the national , regional , and field levels .

at the national level , some argue for new s&r institutions or arrangements , independent of existing departments and agencies .

some have advocated the use of various interagency task forces , informed by the lessons learned from the various permanent and temporary u.s. government tasks forces , as the means to provide both much needed capacity , flexibility , and adaptability to respond to emerging situations .

some argue for improved regional arrangements .

create new structures or arrangements for s&r and other overseas missions in addition to reforms proposed for the nsc ( discussed above ) , several organizations and experts have recommended a reorganization of current responsibilities for dealing with fragile states , for preventing , managing , resolving conflict , or for operational missions abroad in general ( table c - 4 ) .

some proposals would redistribute s&r responsibilities , enhancing the role of usaid or incorporating its offices into new combined state - usaid units .

those who propose enhancing usaid's position in s&r structures generally judge its agency focus and culture to be better suited to the operational nature of s&r missions than those of the state department .

two would create an independent s&r agency ; one would make it responsible to the secretary of state ( csis 2005 ) , the other to the nsc ( special inspector general for iraq , or sigir , 2010 ) .

sigir argues that a new agency "would streamline decision - making and eliminate the 'lead agency' dilemma" that hinders interagency cooperation .

the contingency operations oversight and interagency enhancement act of 2011 ( h.r .

3660 , introduced december 14 , 2011 ) would create a new independent entity , the united states office for contingency operations , reporting to the department of state and dod .

h.r .

3660 proposes that the functions , personnel , and assets of s / crs , and the usaid office of transition initiatives , as well certain other s&r functions , personnel , and assets of state , usaid , dod , and other agencies , be transferred to this new office .

establish new interagency teams or task forces ? .

proposals to create new agencies or other arrangements that entail new structures may well be costly , the source of a wide variety of unintended consequences , and subject to bureaucratic infighting .

for those reasons , many may prefer the proposals to improve civilian coordination efforts through the tool of improved interagency teams ( table c - 5 ) .

there are a variety of interagency teams for missions abroad and domestic matters , as noted above ( appendix a ) , but information about how they function are notably lacking .

some may consider teams yet another "ad hoc" mechanism , providing a seeming flexibility at the cost of making the structural and capacity changes needed to create an enduring system for interagency cooperation .

some may view their prospects for success as subject to the same bureaucratic obstacles — resistance to sharing responsibilities , personnel , and resources — as the development of other new interagency structures .

improve regional structures and capacity ? .

a variety of proposals have called for improving regional structures and capacity , either by enhancing the current military geographic combatant commands or by creating new civilian regional arrangements .

especially since 9 / 11 , many analysts perceive that the threats to the united states emanating from non - state actors and the spill - over effects of conflict in one country to its neighbors often demand a regional policy response .

because of its robust military regional commands but relatively weak civilian regional structures , some analysts question whether the united states brings the appropriate leaders to the table for decision - making on regional issues and integrates civilian and military resources to respond effectively .

enhance the military geographic combatant commands ( gccs ) most reform at the regional level to date has focused on enhancing the gccs .

the u.s. africa command ( africom ) , created in 2008 as a model for interagency organization as mentioned above , set the standard for civilian integration into military geographic commands .

however , there has been continued work to improve the model , and about the time that command was created , rand and the american academy of diplomacy offered further suggestions for enhancing civilian input into gccs , as well as other dod units ( table c - 6 ) .

nonetheless , some analysts are skeptical that combatant commands will be able to attract sufficient personnel from civilian agencies to operate with the degree of interagency integration originally envisioned for africom .

the obama administration pledged in the qddr to support gccs in a number of ways: making available senior ambassador - ranked personnel as civilian deputies in addition to existing foreign policy advisors , providing usaid high - level development advisors where appropriate , and , "consistent with personnel availability," detailing mid to senior - level state and usaid personnel to gccs .

create new civilian regional structures a few analysts advocate creating new civilian regional structures ( table c - 7 ) .

some would make the military commands subordinate to them .

while none of the think tank studies surveyed for this report advanced proposals for civilian regional "command," one study by an air force officer argues for new state department - led regional - level interagency organizations .

two experts on interagency organization propose that chief of mission authority be expanded to provide appropriate leadership for civilian - led interagency teams that could be used at the regional level , as well as elsewhere .

the obama administration , in the 2010 qddr , states its intention to establish "regional hubs" in some embassies , creating a home base for personnel dedicated to regional programs in cross - cutting issue areas who will travel to posts throughout the region ( table c - 7 ) .

this is a key reform in its plan to improve the state department and usaid ability "to think and act regionally. .

the qddr states that regional hubs will offer "cost savings over deploying such experts to every bilateral mission. .

in a related action , the administration stated it would improve regional communication among bilateral posts .

it would also create a new state department "regional forum" under the state department under secretary for political affairs , where representatives from relevant agencies would "meet regularly to coordinate regional initiatives and proposals. .

review and augment civilian personnel authority and capacity only a few studies surveyed here have explicitly recommended reviewing or increasing civilian personnel authorities and capacity .

some recommendations concerned state department and usaid personnel ( table c - 8 ) , some concerned interagency personnel in general ( table c - 9 ) , and some concerned the interagency civilian response corps ( table c - 10 ) .

nevertheless , the need for an expansion of civilian personnel involved in national security missions — especially state department and usaid personnel — has been an implicit part of the entire interagency reform discussion .

for many analysts , a primary goal is for the civilian agencies to emulate the dod practice of hiring enough personnel to provide a "float," that is , sufficient excess capacity to allow personnel to engage periodically in interagency education and training without creating vacancies at posts .

the obama administration's "diplomacy 3.0" hiring plan to increase the number of state department foreign service and civil service and usaid personnel is intended to provide such a float .

according to a recent report , for the foreign service officer corps , the state department's goal is a 15% float , equivalent to that of the u.s. military .

appendix d. proposals to enhance authority and / or capacity of u.s .

ambassadors as the key locus of interagency coordination for steady state operations , the embassy country teams under the leadership of an ambassador ( or other official delegated chief of mission authority ) are uniquely responsible for the conduct of foreign policy .

given the great disparities that observers note in ambassadors' skills and knowledge to manage country teams and oversee the foreign assistance operations of an embassy , improving chief of mission ( com ) capacity is crucial , according to many analysts .

for those who view the "country teams" as the key element in diplomacy and foreign assistance in most circumstances , enhancing an ambassador's authority , capacity , and control over funding is crucial .

some perceive this step as not only vital , but as an alternative to creating new structures .

over the years , there have been far fewer proposals to augment the authority and capacity of u.s .

ambassadors than for other aspects of interagency reform , and all are relatively recent .

new or improved authority is viewed by some as but one possible step in increasing the capacity of u.s .

ambassadors to carry out their responsibility for coordinating foreign policy and foreign assistance ( table d - 1 ) .

other possible steps are selecting potential ambassadors and others in line for chief of mission posts for interagency experience , expertise , and inclination , and providing such personnel with adequate training in interagency matters ( table d - 2 ) .

some may wish for progress at standardizing the education and training of potential ambassadors , and vetting candidates for skills at interagency collaboration and coordination , before enhancing ambassadors' authority over interagency resources .

proposals to increase com authority over budgets related to embassy operations and over interagency personnel may be resisted by executive branch agencies .

some may question whether attention to interagency reform at the com level is sufficient , particularly because many current problems are not bilateral , but require regional or global level attention .

table d - 3 presents a unique option to expand com authority in order to provide coms with the power to lead , as "mission managers," interagency functional or regional teams or task forces .

some analysts are skeptical that new or improved authorities , structures , systems , training , or selection criteria per se will help an ambassador overcome the pulls of agency interests and pressures on a country team if that ambassador does not have support at appropriate times of officials in washington .

a key failing of the system , in the opinion of some analysts , can be the disregard of ambassadors' authority and expertise within the state department itself , and a lack of direct support for an ambassador's position when necessary .

the obama administration has announced its plans to strengthen the ability of ambassadors and other coms to perform their role .

the state department / usaid 2010 quadrennial diplomacy and development review ( qddr ) casts ambassadors as chief executive officers or "ceos" of multi - agency missions , not only conducting traditional diplomacy , but also leading and overseeing civilians from multiple federal agencies in other work .

the qddr highlights the key role of country teams and ambassadors in the conduct of foreign policy and assistance , and sets forth ways in which the obama administration will try to improve the knowledge and skills of coms and their ability to lead country teams .

civilian agencies "possess some of the world's leading expertise on issues increasingly central to our diplomacy and development work," the qddr states .

"the united states benefits when government agencies can combine their expertise overseas as part of an integrated country strategy," when "implemented under chief of mission authority , and when those agencies build lasting working relationships with their foreign counterparts. .

as discussed in appendix b , secretary of state clinton has announced that chiefs of mission are to play a role in integrating country - level strategic plans and budgets .

the authors of the proposal in table d - 3 predict that implementing it would be bureaucratically contentious , but would "facilitate clear roles and missions," empower good leaders "to be more consistently effective," and provide those charged with "weighty responsibilities" with "commensurate authority. .

such an expanded com authority could provide the president with an additional tool to use for interagency national security missions abroad .

it could be used to address the gap , noted in appendix c , in civilian regional authority .

it could also provide an alternative to appointing "czars" or lead agencies .

some might argue that it could replace the need for revising structures and augmenting capabilities at the nsc , as it might alleviate burdens there , or at state department or other civilian agencies .

nevertheless , as the authors note , it might be subject to bureaucratic pressures .

other analysts might argue that the proposal only adds a new layer of "adhockery" to the national security system .

appendix e. proposals to create interagency personnel policies and mechanisms the current interagency personnel system has few incentives , but many disincentives for u.s. civilian personnel to behave in ways that are conducive to interagency collaboration and coordination .

some civilian personnel may seek interagency missions as important and interesting work , attracted by the challenges of working under difficult conditions where innovation is required .

nevertheless , agencies do not encourage personnel to engage in interagency missions , according to many sources .

agencies generally feel that they are short on personnel for their core missions and generally do not wish to spare many people for interagency activities .

some analysts point to the difficulties that state department office of the coordinator for stabilization and reconstruction ( s / crs ) and the geographic combatant commands have had in attracting civilian personnel from other agencies as a result of that disinclination .

in addition , according to some analysts , agencies do not structure their personnel evaluation and promotion systems to provide credit for interagency work .

systems may penalize those who seek interagency operations because they have not advanced steadily up the agency's career ladder .

compounding the problem of agency disincentives are the cultural problems that can unnecessarily complicate interagency work .

the great differences between the military and civilian cultures are often noted , but there are also significant differences among civilian agencies' cultures , for example , the perception of a fast - response operational culture within usaid compared to a slower , reflective state department culture based upon its reporting and diplomacy functions — thus making certain agencies more suitable than others for some tasks .

others believe that the cultures can change over time , given the appropriate training and incentives for interagency missions .

meantime , some consider efforts to assist with helping personnel engaged in interagency missions to understand the cultures of other agencies an important interim step .

proposals for personnel reform are intended not only to provide incentives for interagency work , but establish the shared knowledge , skills , vision , and trust that some analysts argue is necessary for effective interagency performance .

many analysts consider the 1986 "goldwater - nichols" act a model for the type of fundamental reforms needed to create a productive interagency environment .

in october 1986 , recognizing that the inability of the four u.s. armed forces to work together effectively was jeopardizing military operations , congress passed the bipartisan goldwater - nichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 ( p.l .

99-433 ) .

among other reforms , this act created more powerful incentives for officers to broaden their experience by seeking formal education and assignments in an inter - service environment with the objective of creating a "joint" culture .

key among the goldwater - nichols changes were a requirement for joint education and training , safeguards to protect officers with "joint" experience to ensure they would be treated on a par with those without such experience , and a joint service requirement for promotion to general or flag officer rank .

these reforms set the basis for inter - service cooperation and the evolution of "joint" military rather than service - specific loyalties and a "joint" culture .

some argue that congress should provide similar legislation for civilian personnel , linking interagency education , training , and experience to job qualifications and rewards ( table e - 5 , table e - 6 ) , as well as mandating and providing funds for additional education and training ( table e - 7 ) and interagency rotations ( table e - 8 ) .

congress might also provide for increases in personnel to allow civilian agencies to create such opportunities while , like the military , maintaining full strength for core missions ( table e - 4 ) .

 ( a key difference between military and civilian personnel systems is the dod excess capacity of about 10% more personnel than needed for day - to - day operations , known as the "float," to accommodate regular periods of education and training , among other service - related needs. ) .

congress could similarly mandate changes in training and education systems by establishing new schools or providing funds for increased interagency coursework at others ( table e - 10 , table e - 11 ) .

others propose that congress establish a national interagency professional corps , cadres , career track ( table e - 1 ) or senior executive service corps or cadre ( table e - 4 ) , and protect interagency personnel during political transitions ( table e - 9 ) .

in the area of interagency personnel reform , the obama administration is slowly advancing the bush administration's national security professional development program , which seeks to expand interagency education , training , and rotations .

 ( discussed below in the section on establishing a national security interagency corps , cadre , career track , or executive service , and referred to in table e - 2 . ) .

legislation currently before congress , the interagency personnel rotation act of 2011 ( s. 1268 and h.r .

2314 ) , would expand opportunities for interagency experience .

establish a national interagency professional corps , cadre , career track , or executive service the most far - reaching recommended changes to the current personnel system involve proposals to establish a national security corps or cadre ( table e - 1 ) .

a special corps or cadre , proponents argue , would foster the development of a group of federal employees whose loyalties are not principally to an agency or department , as has been the case until now , but to the other people and entities devoted to interagency missions .

although proponents believe that these proposals hold great promise for transforming the united states' ability to perform interagency missions , they may also be the most costly , involving the creation of new units and management structures .

depending on how the corps or cadre was structured and manned , these proposals may meet bureaucratic impediments .

some proposals would continue efforts to build an interagency cadre based on the existing national security professional development program ( table e - 2 ) .

this program was established in 2007 by the bush administration under executive order 13434 .

it called for each agency with a national security function to create a program of interagency education , training , and rotations for its personnel .

the program soon stagnated .

in its 2010 report , the project on national security reform ( pnsr ) cited several reasons for that stagnation: ( 1 ) sporadic leadership to improve human capital systems , ( 2 ) a lack of authority to direct an overall program , ( 3 ) unclear roles and responsibilities , ( 4 ) no common lexicon and poor communication among programs , ( 5 ) no direct funding source , ( 6 ) no defined metrics for system evaluation , and ( 7 ) a lack of coordinated congressional oversight .

some skeptics judge such agency - centric efforts unlikely to surmount numerous resource allocation and cultural issues .

early in his term , president obama directed the nsc's national security staff to "reinvigorate" the national security professional development program .

since then , 19 executive departments have participated in nsc - led efforts to define and draft a guiding strategy .

the long - run goal , according to the 2010 quadrennial diplomacy and development review ( qddr ) , is to form a cadre of interagency professionals .

as of 2011 , the obama administration has launched a second iteration of this professional development program .

this iteration is focusing on a single pilot program to enhance interagency cooperation in emergency management , leaving aside for the moment efforts to further develop interagency professionals for other national security matters .

 ( further information on obama administration activities can be found in crs report rl34565 , national security professionals and interagency reform: proposals , recent experience , and issues for congress , by [author name scrubbed] , pp .

17-21. ) .

related proposals call for the development of a special interagency career track within individual agencies and departments ( table e - 3 ) .

although participating personnel would remain with their agency or department , they would be considered "interagency" personnel available to be tasked for interagency missions .

advocates argue that as specially trained and experienced personnel , attuned to the capabilities and cultures of other agencies and the requirements of interagency missions , individuals in this career track would be effective in such missions at carrying out their roles , coordinating their activities with others , and representing their agencies .

on the other hand , without the provision of an excess capacity "float," such a career track may well encounter bureaucratic resistance , as funding personnel in that track might divert agency funding from core missions .

in addition , such "interagency" personnel may be perceived as secondary citizens within their home agencies , which still are dominated by people devoted to the core functions .

a third set of proposals regards the creation of a senior executive interagency leadership cadre of personnel versed in the requirements of interagency missions ( table e - 4 ) .

again , the effectiveness of members of this cadre may depend not only on their interagency experience and expertise , but also their ability to maintain close relationships with their home bureaus and departments when deployed .

these proposals may all require new institutional arrangements .

if personnel were to be grouped in new units formed outside existing agencies , they would require new budgets .

even if incorporated into existing agencies , the ability of such personnel to perform their tasks may well benefit from the establishment of separate budget lines , so that funds do not have to be squeezed from core functions to accomplish interagency missions .

link interagency education , training , and experience to job qualifications , opportunities , and promotion .

proposals to link interagency education , training , and experience to job qualifications , opportunities , and promotions ( table e - 5 , and for senior leaders specifically table e - 6 ) would be the most akin to the changes in the military personnel system mandated by the goldwater - nichols act .

as a result of changes initiated in 1986 under this act , soldiers , sailors , and airman remain in and retain their loyalties to their service , but enjoy opportunities for inter - service education and experience .

further , inter - service education and experience is required for their promotion to senior levels .

these "joint" inter - service opportunities are widely viewed as contributing to continuing improvements in military missions .

nevertheless , for civilian personnel , the proposals are not always accompanied by the types of structural changes that also were legislated by goldwater - nichols , that is , the development of the inter - service combatant commands that plan , organize , and conduct all military activities and operations aside from service - specific personnel training and education .

also , given that analysts view the development of a joint service culture as still a work in progress , some may question whether such education , training , and experience opportunities are sufficient to create cohesive interagency units .

still , these practices may break down misconceptions and prejudices and help individuals understand the capabilities and operating cultures of other agencies , facilitating interagency relations at the field level , where analysts say many problems are worked out , even if they are not likely to create new loyalties and overcome "stove - piping. .

expand opportunities , requirements , and incentives for interagency education , training and professional experience over the years , many analysts have viewed enhancing interagency education and training ( table e - 7 ) and rotations ( table e - 8 ) , as basic steps to more effective interagency missions .

some also find a need to protect interagency personnel during political transitions ( table e - 9 ) .

enhance existing or create new education and training institutions a few organizations have championed the idea of creating entirely new education and training institutions ( table e - 10 ) .

others have argued for incorporating new courses and curricula into existing institutions ( table e - 11 ) .

several u.s. government or government - funded institutions have inaugurated or increased interagency coursework ; these include the foreign service institute ( fsi ) and the national defense university ( ndu ) , as well as the naval post graduate school , and the united states institute of peace ( usip ) .

some analysts judge these offerings still insufficient and urge continued work on expanding the curriculum at all institutions .

some would also try to tap into coursework at state and private educational institutions and consider whether such institutions might be encouraged to offer comprehensive coursework to meet the full range of interagency practitioner needs .
