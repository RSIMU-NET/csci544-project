the payments in lieu of taxes ( pilt ) program provides compensation for certain entitlement lands that are exempt from state and local taxes .

these lands include selected federal lands administered by the bureau of land management , the national park service , and the u.s .

fish and wildlife service , all in the department of the interior ( doi ) ; lands administered by the u.s. forest service in the department of agriculture ; federal water projects ; dredge disposal areas ; and some military installations .

enacted in 1976 , pilt is the broadestâin terms of federal land types coveredâof several federal programs enacted to provide compensation to state or local governments for the presence of tax - exempt federal lands within their jurisdictions .

pilt was enacted in response to a shift in federal policy from one that prioritized disposal of federal landsâone in which federal ownership was considered to be temporaryâto one that prioritized retention of federal lands , in perpetuity , for public benefit .

this shift began in the late 19 th century and continued into the 20 th century .

along with this shift came the understanding that , because these lands were exempt from state and local taxation and were no longer likely to return to the tax base in the foreseeable future , some compensation should be provided to the impacted local governments .

following several decades of commissions , studies , and proposed legislation , congress passed pilt to at least partially ameliorate this hardship .

pilt payments generally can be used for "any governmental purpose," which could include assisting local governments with paying for local services , such as "firefighting and police protection , construction of public schools and roads , and search - and - rescue operations. .

the office of the secretary in doi is responsible for the calculation and disbursement of payments under pilt .

payments under pilt are made annually to units of general local governmentâtypically counties , though other types of governmental units also may be used ( hereinafter , counties refers to units of general local government ) âcontaining entitlement lands .

pilt comprises three separate payment mechanisms: section 6902 , section 6904 , and section 6905 payments , all named for the sections of law in which they are authorized .

section 6902 payments account for nearly all payments made through pilt .

the section 6902 authorized payment amount for each county is calculated according to a statutory formula that is subject to a maximum payment based on the county's population ( see " pilt payments under section 6902 " ) .

the remaining payments are provided through section 6904 and section 6905 under selected circumstances and typically are limited in duration .

through fy2019 , pilt payments have totaled approximately $9.2 billion ( in current dollars ) .

members of congress routinely consider amending pilt within both appropriations and authorizing legislation .

for example , legislation in the 116 th congress would amend how pilt appropriations are provided and would change how payments are calculated under section 6902 .

in addition , members of congress may address issues related to which federal lands should be eligible for payments under pilt .

this report provides an overview of the pilt payment program and includes sections on pilt's authorization and appropriations , which discusses the history of how congress has provided funding for pilt ; section 6902 payments , which includes a breakdown of how section 6902 payments are calculated ; section 6904 and section 6905 payments , which outlines what situations result in payments under these mechanisms ; and issues for congress , which discusses several topics that have been or may be of interest to members of congress when considering the future of pilt .

congress has funded pilt through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations at various times since the program was first authorized .

some stakeholders and policymakers have routinely expressed concern about changes in the appropriations source , both the process of switching between mandatory and discretionary appropriations and the uncertainty that may accompany such changes .

from 1982 to 2008 , section 6906 provided an "authorization of appropriations" for pilt , which stated , "necessary amounts may be appropriated to the secretary of the interior to carry out [pilt]. .

further , it clarified that "amounts are available only as provided in appropriation laws. .

congress amended this language in 2008 and changed the section title from "authorization of appropriations" to "funding. .

further , congress changed the text to read for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012- ( 1 ) each county or other eligible unit of local government shall be entitled to payment under this chapter ; and ( 2 ) sums shall be made available to the secretary of the interior for obligation or expenditure in accordance with this chapter .

this amendment effectively changed pilt funding from being discretionary to being mandatory for the years specified ( see table 1 for pilt funding since fy2005 ) .

since 2008 , congress has amended section 6906 several times by changing the fiscal year in the first line through both annual discretionary appropriations laws and other legislative vehicles ( table 1 ) .

pilt was funded through discretionary appropriations from its enactment through fy2007 .

since fy2008 , congress has provided funding for pilt through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations ( table 1 ) .

from fy2008 through fy2014 , congress authorized mandatory funding for pilt through several laws .

since fy2015 , funding has been provided , at least partially , through the annual appropriations process .

in fy2015 , pilt received both discretionary and mandatory appropriations .

for fy2016 through fy2020 , congress funded pilt through the annual appropriations process .

in fy2016 and fy2017 , the appropriations laws provided specific funding levels for pilt , which was treated as discretionary spending .

in fy2018 , fy2019 , and fy2020 , the appropriations laws provided funding for pilt by amending the authority provided in 31 u.s.c .

â§6906 , which was treated as mandatory spending .

in each of these three years , funding was provided for pilt at the full statutory calculation levels .

since fy2008 , congress has provided funding for pilt through both one - year and multiyear appropriations .

congress's actions have resulted in full funding and partial funding in different years ( table 1 and figure 1 ) .

these types of changes from year to year may have implications for counties that rely on pilt funding as part of their annual budgets .

in addition to appropriating funding for the program , congress routinely provides other guidance on pilt within the annual appropriations process , such as minimum payment thresholds , set - asides for program administration , and provisions for prorating payments .

when appropriated funding is insufficient to cover the full amount for authorized payments under sections 6902 , 6904 , and 6905 , counties typically receive a proportional payment known as a prorated payment ( figure 1 shows the disparity between the authorized amount and the appropriated amount in recent years ) .

even in years in which appropriations are set equal to 100% of the full statutory calculation , payments to counties may be prorated if funding is set aside for purposes other than payments , such as administration .

section 6902 payments are provided to units of local government jurisdictions ( referred to as counties in this report ) across the united states to compensate for the presence of entitlement lands within their boundaries .

section 6902 payments also are provided to the district of columbia , guam , puerto rico , and the virgin islands .

section 6902 payments account for nearly all of the payments made under pilt .

in fy2019 , 99.85% of all pilt payments were made through section 6902 .

further , more counties are eligible for section 6902 payments than either section 6904 or section 6905 payments .

in fy2019 , of the 1,931 counties that received pilt payments , 1,927 received payments under section 6902 , and 134 received payments under section 6904 and / or section 6905 ( 130 counties received payments under both section 6902 and section 6904 and / or section 6905 ) .

section 6904 and section 6905 payments account for a small fraction of total pilt payments .

in fy2019 , these payments were made to 134 counties and accounted for 0.15% of pilt payments ( $750,605 of $514.7 million in total payments made ) .

once a county receives section 6904 and section 6905 payments , it is to disburse payments to governmental units and school districts within the county in proportion to the amount of property taxes lost because of the federal ownership of the entitled lands , as enumerated under these sections .

county units and school districts may use these payments for any governmental purpose .

pilt is of perennial interest to many in congress and to stakeholders throughout the country .

county governments are particularly interested in the certainty of pilt payments , as well as in how payments are calculated , because many consider pilt payments to be an integral part of their annual budgets .

congressional and stakeholder interests include questions of how pilt should be funded , what lands should be included as entitlement lands , and how authorized payment levels are calculated under pilt , among others .

congress annually addresses questions of how funding should be provided to pilt .

congress has funded pilt through both mandatory and discretionary appropriations ( see " pilt authorizations and appropriations " ) .

more often than not , pilt funding has been provided through the discretionary appropriations process for one fiscal year at a time .

although pilt has consistently received funding since its enactment , the appropriations process has created uncertainty among some stakeholders about the level of annual funding .

stakeholders also have asserted that greater certainty , in terms of both the guarantee of funding and the amount of funding ( i.e. , full statutory calculation ) would be better .

members of congress typically contemplate the implications and tradeoffs of discretionary versus mandatory spending and may have different views than the counties that receive pilt payments .

congress , for example , may weigh its discretion to review and fund pilt on an annual basis through the appropriations process against the certainty of funding for specific activities that accompany mandatory appropriations .

several bills have been introduced to amend how pilt is funded .

for example , legislation has been introduced in the 116 th congress that would require mandatory funding for pilt for either a set period of time ( eg , 10 additional years ) or indefinitely .

the question of which lands should be eligible for pilt payments is also of interest to many members and stakeholders .

in law , entitlement lands are restricted to the listed federal land types ( see " entitlement lands " ) .

however , this definition does not fully encompass the types of lands that are held by the federal government , nor does it account for the full suite of lands that are exempt from state and local taxes .

although some of these other lands may receive compensation through other federal programs , not all do , which may cause financial hardships for counties that otherwise might receive revenue through taxation .

to address this concern , some members of congress have contemplated amending the definition of entitlement lands under pilt .

for example , past congresses have introduced legislation that would have amended pilt by expanding the definition of entitlement land to include land "that is held in trust by the united states for the benefit of a federally recognized indian tribe or an individual indian" ; lands under the jurisdiction of the department of the defense , other than those already included in pilt ; lands acquired by the federal government for addition to the national wildlife refuge system ; and lands administered by the department of homeland security , among others .

amending the definition of entitlement lands could have several implications .

adding additional acres of entitlement lands could increase the authorized amount of payments under pilt , which likely would benefit those states with the added lands but not states that lack additional lands .

this , in turn , could influence how congress elects to fund pilt .

additional entitled lands may be eligible for other compensation programs , which could further affect pilt payments .

the authorized payment level under section 6902 , which accounts for nearly all payments under pilt , is calculated pursuant to the statutory requirements .

this section has remained largely unchanged since it was amended in 1994 to add the requirement to adjust for inflation , among other changes .

the inflation adjustment clause has resulted in increasing payment and ceiling rates since that time .

congress routinely considers whether the current formula is the best means of calculating payments under pilt or whether the formula should be amended .

for example , in the 116 th congress , bills have been introduced that would adjust the payment structure for counties with a population of less than 5,000 .

this adjustment would have implications for how population or area would be incorporated into calculating pilt payments and whether pilt payments were provided in an equitable manner .

pilt is of interest to a large number of counties and other state and local entities across the country , and it may remain of interest to many members of congress .

in addition to the above issues , congress may consider other issues related to pilt and how the program fits into the landscape of federal programs that compensate for the presence of tax - exempt federal lands .
