under sections 108-109 of the clean air act ( caa ) , congress mandated that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) set national ambient ( outdoor ) air quality standards ( or naaqs ) for pollutants whose emissions ( 1 ) "may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare" and ( 2 ) "results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources. .

the statute further requires that epa review the latest scientific studies and either reaffirm or modify previously established naaqs every five years .

epa has identified and promulgated naaqs for six principal pollutants commonly referred to as "criteria pollutants": 1 .

particulate matter ( pm ) , 2 .

ozone ( o 3 — a key measure of smog ) , 3 .

nitrogen dioxide ( no 2 , or nox — inclusively , nitrogen oxides ) , 4 .

sulfur oxides ( sox or specifically so 2 ) , 5 .

carbon monoxide ( co ) , and 6 .

lead ( pb ) .

for particulate matter ( pm ) , epa established short - term ( 24-hour ) and long - term ( annual ) standards .

additionally , epa established separate standards for two categories of pm based on size: "fine" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ( referred to as pm 2.5 ) and slightly larger , but still inhalable , particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers ( referred to as pm 10 ) .

epa last reviewed and revised the pm naaqs in 2006 .

 ( see pm naaqs chronology presented in table a - 1 . ) .

on january 15 , 2013 , epa published its revisions to the naaqs for pm to provide protection against potential health effects associated with short - and long - term exposure to particulates ( including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality ) .

because the agency finalized its decision on december 14 , 2012 , epa frequently refers to these changes as the "2012 pm naaqs. .

in this report , crs will refer to the changes as the 2013 pm naaqs based on the january 15 , 2013 , publication date of the final rule .

epa's 2013 pm naaqs revisions primarily tightened the pre - existing ( 2006 and 1997 ) standards for "fine" particulate matter pm 2.5 and affected only the stringency of the annual pm 2.5 standard .

the 24-hour pm 2.5 standard as revised in 2006 was not similarly strengthened in the 2013 naaqs revisions .

the standards for slightly larger , but still inhalable , particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers ( pm 10 ) established in 1987 were also not changed to a more stringent level in the 2013 pm naaqs revisions .

establishing naaqs does not directly limit emissions or directly compel specific emissions controls ; rather , it represents the epa administrator's formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution that will protect public health with an adequate margin of safety .

promulgation of naaqs sets in motion a process under which the states and epa first identify geographic nonattainment areas ( i.e. , those areas failing to meet the naaqs ) based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data .

states then submit state implementation plans ( sips ) , which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that are to bring areas into compliance as well as actions for maintaining compliance .

on april 7 , 2015 , epa published amendments to the final designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs that were published on january 15 , 2015 .

the changes to area designations were the result of air quality data for 2014 recently submitted by affected states .

the effective date of april 15 , 2015 ( 90 days from the date of publication ) for the final designation rule remained unchanged .

the final area designations as amended and published in the april 7 , 2015 , federal register encompass 20 counties or portions of counties ( nine areas ) in four states as nonattainment only for the 2013 revised annual pm 2.5 standard .

epa also designated five areas in georgia ( including two adjacent counties in alabama and south carolina ) as unclassifiable .

in the final designation rule as published on january 15 , 2015 , epa had designated 38 counties or portions of counties ( 14 areas ) in six states .

at that time epa announced that it was also deferring initial designation for 10 areas in three states by up to one year as a result of insufficient data .

included were all of florida , all of tennessee except for three counties , and eight areas in georgia ( including two adjacent counties in alabama and south carolina ) .

the epa also designated three areas ( including all of illinois ) as "unclassifiable" due to insufficiencies in the available ambient air quality monitoring data for these areas for the three - year period ( 2011-2013 ) .

the april 2015 modifications did not impact epa's designation determinations for areas in indian country as published in january 2015 .

twelve areas in indian country adjacent to counties designated nonattainment in two areas in california were designated nonattainment for the 2013 annual pm 2.5 standard .

epa designated all remaining state areas and areas in indian country as "unclassifiable / attainment" for the 2013 annual pm 2.5 standard , indicating that "the areas either have attaining [sic] air quality monitoring data or that air quality information is not available because the areas are not monitored , and the epa has not determined that the areas contribute to a violation in a nearby area. .

as epa had specified in its april 2013 area designation guidance to states and tribes , the initial area designations for all 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs nonattainment areas are classified as "moderate" as provided under section 188 ( a ) of subpart 4 of part d of title i of the caa .

epa had previously implemented the pm 2.5 naaqs — including nonattainment determinations for the 1997 and 2006 revisions — only under the general implementation provisions in subpart 1 ( §171-§176 ) of part d in title i of the caa ( "subpart 1" ) .

however , in a january 4 , 2013 , decision , the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit determined that epa had erred in implementing the pm 2.5 naaqs under subpart 1 and required the agency to implement the pm 2.5 naaqs under subpart 4 of part d in title i of the caa ( "subpart 4" ) .

this crs report focuses primarily on the naaqs implementation process for designating geographical nonattainment areas with respect to the tightening of the pm 2.5 annual standard under the 2013 particulates naaqs , including comparisons with the final designations under the 2006 and 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs revisions .

epa is not requiring new nonattainment designations for the pm 2.5 24-hour standard or the pm 10 standard , as the levels for these standards were unchanged in the 2013 revisions .

also included in this crs report is a brief overview of states' subsequent obligations for developing and submitting sips for attaining or maintaining compliance with the naaqs .

appendix a presents a chronology of pm naaqs regulations , and appendix b includes a comparative table of the implementation timeline for the 1997 , 2006 , and 2013 pm naaqs .

the table in appendix c provides a state and county breakdown of epa's final designated nonattainment areas published in january and april 2015 , areas proposed by epa in august 2014 , and recommendations by the states for the 2013 annual pm 2.5 naaqs compared to the final epa designations for the 2006 ( 24-hour ) and 1997 ( annual ) pm 2.5 naaqs for those states and counties .

table d - 1 in appendix d identifies areas in indian country designated nonattainment for the 2013 pm naaqs .

the caa provides for two types of naaqs: ( 1 ) primary standards , "the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the [epa] administrator ... are requisite to protect the public health" with "an adequate margin of safety" ; and ( 2 ) secondary standards , which are necessary to protect public welfare — a broad term that includes visibility impairment as well as damage to crops , vegetation , and effects on soil and nutrient cycling , water , wildlife , property , building materials , etc .

epa's 1997 revisions to the pm naaqs revised the standards that focused on particles smaller than 10 microns ( pm 10 or coarse particles ) established in 1987 and introduced standards for "fine" particles smaller than 2.5 microns ( pm 2.5 ) for the first time .

the primary naaqs as revised included a daily ( 24-hour ) limit for both pm 2.5 and pm 10 and an annual limit for pm 2.5 .

 ( epa revoked the previous annual limit for pm 10 in 2006. ) .

achieving attainment of the annual standard requires that the three - year average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean pm concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency .

the 24-hour standards are a concentration - based percentile form , indicating the percentage of the time that a monitoring station can exceed the standard .

for example , a 98 th percentile 24-hour standard indicates that a monitoring station can exceed the standard 2% of the days during the year .

for pm 2.5 and pm 10 , epa set the secondary ( welfare ) naaqs the same as the primary standards .

as modified and published in the january 15 , 2013 , federal register , the pm 2.5 and pm 10 primary ( public health ) standards as set in the final rule are as follows: pm 2.5 : epa revised the annual standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter ( µg / m 3 ) by setting a new limit to 12 µg / m 3 .

 ( epa's proposed rule included an optional limit of 13 µg / m 3 and solicited comment for 11 µg / m 3 . ) .

compliance with the "annual" standard is determined by whether the three - year average of its annual average pm 2.5 concentration ( at each monitoring site in the area ) is less than or equal to 12 µg / m 3 ; as proposed , epa retained the daily ( 24-hour ) standard at 35 µg / m 3 based on the current three - year average of the 98 th percentile of 24-hour pm 2.5 concentrations as established in 2006 .

pm 10 : epa retained the current daily pm 10 standard of no more than one exceedance of concentrations of 150 µg / m 3 per year on average over three years ; there is no current annual standard for pm 10 .

 ( epa eliminated the previous annual maximum concentration standard of 50 µg / m 3 in 2006. ) .

epa retained the secondary annual pm 2.5 standard at 15 µg / m 3 .

designating geographical areas as not achieving the established naaqs based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data is a critical step in naaqs implementation .

section 107 ( d ) of the caa ( 42 u.s.c .

7407 ) establishes the process for designating "attainment" ( or alternatively "unclassifiable" ) and "nonattainment" areas and setting their boundaries , but it allows the epa administrator some discretion in determining what the final boundaries of the areas will be .

areas are identified as nonattainment when they violate or contribute to the violation of naaqs .

under section 107 ( d ) ( 1 ) of the caa , the governor of each state must submit a list identifying designations for a naaqs "by such a date as the [epa] administrator may reasonably require , but not later than 1 year after promulgation" of the new or revised naaqs .

epa must promulgate final designations "as expeditiously as possible" but no later than two years from the date of promulgation of the new or revised naaqs .

section 107 ( d ) of the caa provides for an extension of up to one year if the epa administrator "has insufficient information to promulgate designations. .

the process leading up to final designation determinations has in the past extended beyond the established deadlines as states have continuously reviewed and analyzed data and modelling results with epa .

for the 2013 naaqs , state submissions were to be submitted by december 13 , 2013 , and epa was to promulgate final designations by december 12 , 2014 .

section 107 ( d ) ( 1 ) of the caa requires states to submit area designation recommendations no later than one year following the promulgation of a naaqs standard .

during november 2013 , four states — california , idaho , ohio , and pennsylvania — provided epa with recommended nonattainment boundaries for the 2013 revised primary annual pm 2.5 standard .

remaining states , the district of columbia , puerto rico , and guam recommended all areas as attainment or unclassifiable / attainment .

epa also received six tribal recommendations of attainment or unclassifiable / attainment .

epa has indicated that seven tribes are eligible to submit recommendations under section 107 ( d ) , but all tribes were invited to submit recommendations or to comment on state and epa recommendations .

epa responded to these recommendations in august 2014 , and promulgated the final area designations as published january 15 , 2015 .

these final designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs reflected some modifications to epa's august 2014 proposed designations .

epa subsequently amended the final designations based on complete , quality assured , and certified air quality data for 2014 recently submitted by several states .

these modifications , and a technical correction , were published april 7 , 2015 .

under the caa , epa sets the nationwide standard for criteria pollutants , and epa and states are responsible for placing limits on emissions that contribute to criteria pollution and for regulating entities that emit criteria pollutants .

areas designated as attainment / unclassifiable will not have to take steps to improve air quality , but under the statute they must take steps to prevent air quality from deteriorating to unhealthy levels .

for those areas designated as nonattainment , state , local , and tribal governments must outline detailed control requirements in plans demonstrating how they will meet and / or maintain compliance with the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard .

these plans are defined as state implementation plans and referred to as sips ( tips for tribal implementation plans ) .

as discussed previously in this report , in response to a january 2013 d.c .

circuit court decision epa has classified all initial nonattainment area designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard as moderate .

epa had previously implemented the pm 2.5 naaqs , only under the general implementation provisions in subpart 1 of the act .

subpart 4 requires epa to classify areas based on the severity of their fine particle pollution problem .

subpart 1 does not include classification requirements for nonattainment areas but does authorize epa to establish classifications if the agency deems it appropriate .

the subpart 4 requirements for areas classified as moderate are generally comparable to those of subpart 1 .

however , under subpart 4 , states have 18 months from the date of epa's final designations to submit sips , which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that will bring an area into compliance .

implementing the pm 2.5 naaqs under subpart 1 required submission of sips three years from the date of epa's final designations .

under subpart 4 , epa may reclassify as "serious" any nonattainment area that the agency determines cannot practicably attain the pm 2.5 naaqs by the applicable attainment date or those areas classified as moderate that do not attain the pm 2.5 naaqs after their applicable attainment date has passed .

subpart 4 introduces additional statutory sip planning requirements for areas classified as serious .

these additional requirements must be reflected in the states' initial sip submissions .

states must achieve attainment for moderate areas as expeditiously as practicable but no later than six years after designation and serious areas must achieve attainment no later than 10 years from designation as nonattainment under subpart 4 .

under the general provisions in subpart 1 , which has no classifications , attainment must be achieved no later than five years from the effective designation date .

both subpart 4 and subpart 1 include provisions for extensions .

even though epa has concluded that although in many cases attainment will be reached as the result of several promulgated federal regulations , states will very likely require some local controls because of the requirements of the caa .

all areas no matter their classification of attainment or nonattainment will be required under the caa to conduct emission inventories which will provide states the basis for states to analyze and estimate the extent to which various sources are contributing to nonattainment .

to achieve the most expeditious attainment date for an area , epa has recommended that states first identify emission reduction programs that have already been adopted and are being implemented at the federal , state , and local levels .

the agency also recommends that states evaluate additional control measures and control technologies — reasonably available control measures ( racm ) and reasonably available control technology ( ract ) — for an area .

states are required under the caa to impose racm and ract that can be implemented on sources located in nonattainment areas and to adopt enforceable regulations to ensure these areas will attain as expeditiously as practicable .

some have expressed concern that a nonattainment designation may negatively impact an area's economic development , as potential additional requirements associated with achieving compliance may deter investment .

epa and others contend that the benefits associated with the caa exceed the costs and that , while short - term impacts may vary , historical evidence suggests that impacts on overall economic growth concurrent with environmental ( including caa ) regulations are generally less significant than often anticipated .

as indicated earlier in this report , based on epa's january 2015 final designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard , three counties ( or portions ) of the 38 counties identified in the rule would be designated nonattainment for pm 2.5 for the first time .

nevertheless , exceeding the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard may have implications with respect to existing sips , the extent of which could vary significantly from area to area based on many factors .

in some cases sips may require substantial modifications , while in other cases the current sip may be sufficient to achieve compliance with both standards .

states will have 18 months from april 15 , 2015 , the effective date of epa's final designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs , to submit sips , which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that are to bring an area into compliance .

following epa approval of sips , implementation through imposition of control measures , where necessary , is to occur for several years .

under caa , section 188 of subpart 4 , states must achieve attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the end of the sixth calendar year after designation as nonattainment: december 2021 for the 2013 pm 2.5 standard .

 ( see timeline presented in appendix b ) .

because of health and cost implications , naaqs decisions have historically been the source of significant concern to some members of congress .

the evolution and development of the pm naaqs , in particular , has been the subject of extensive oversight .

 ( appendix a presents a chronology of pm naaqs regulations. ) .

epa's failure to complete timely review and revision of the naaqs as required under the caa has also been an area of concern to some in congress and others .

some members expressed concerns in hearings , letters to the epa administrator , and proposed legislation in anticipation of potential changes to the pm naaqs leading up to the january 2013 final published revisions .

some members and industry stakeholders had urged epa to delay the final rule , while others , including some states and various environmental and public health advocacy groups , urged timely completion of a tighter standard .

changes to the naaqs have historically triggered litigation alleging that the standards are too stringent or not stringent enough and often result in delays in implementation .

the agency's final designations of nonattainment areas and the implementation of the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs are expected to generate further interest and oversight .

chronology of epa's national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) regulations for total suspended particulates ( tsp ) and particulate matter ( pm ) 1971-2013 epa first promulgated annual and 24-hour naaqs for pm 2.5 in july 1997 .

epa had previously addressed particulate matter by regulating "total suspended particles" ( tsp ) in 1971 , followed by the agency's regulation of pm 10 in 1987 .

comparative timeline for implementing the 1997 , 2006 , and 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs the timeline presented in table b - 1 reflects the most recent key milestone dates for implementing the 1997 and 2006 naaqs and estimates for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs , including actual completions .

these milestones are driven primarily by statutory requirements .

the table mimics an epa milestone schedule outlined in an april 1 , 2003 , memorandum to epa regional administrators that also provided the nonbinding guidance for implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 area designations and the agency's projected timeline for the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs .

comparison of epa nonattainment areas for the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard and previous pm 2.5 standards epa nonattainment areas for the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard in indian country as noted earlier in this report , the area designation requirements under the caa ( section 107 ( d ) ) are specific with respect to states but do not explicitly reference indian tribes or indian country .

epa follows the same designation process for tribes per sections 110 ( o ) and 301 ( d ) of the caa and pursuant to the 1988 tribal authority rule , which specifies that tribes shall be treated as states in selected cases .

epa encouraged tribes to submit naaqs designation recommendations or to comment on state and epa recommendations .

epa indicated that 32 tribes participated in the area designation process for the 2013 annual pm 2.5 standard .

six of the 32 tribes submitted letters with designation recommendations .

with the exception of areas in the indian country of the pechanga band of luiseno indians , all of tribal lands were designated as part of adjacent state areas .

of the 32 participating tribes , epa designated 12 tribal land areas adjacent to two areas in california as nonattainment .

the remaining 20 participating tribes , including the lands of the pechanga band of the luiseno mission indians , and all other areas of the country were designated unclassified / nonattainment .

table d - 1 below identifies those areas in indiana country designated by epa to be nonattainment based on their proximity to state counties in areas designated as nonattainment .

for those tribal lands areas designated by epa other than nonattainment , including those tribes submitting recommendations , see epa's website "area designations for the 2012 annual final particle ( pm 2.5 ) standard: tribal recommendations and epa responses for area designations ( http: / / www.epa.gov / pmdesignations / 2012standards / tribalrec.htm ) .

counties in nonattainment for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs annual ( 12 μg / m 3 ) : u.s. epa january 15 , 2015 , final designations and comparison with the 2006 and 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs final designations the following maps present epa's final nonattainment area designations as published in the federal register on january 15 , 2015 , which epa subsequently amended april 7 , 2015 , based on more current air quality data ( 2012-2014 ) .

the maps include comparisons to 2006 and 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs final designations .

based on epa's april 2015 amended final designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard , three counties ( or portions ) of the 38 counties are designated nonattainment for pm 2.5 for the first time , but the majority of the counties overlap with epa's final nonattainment designations for the 2006 and 1997 pm 2.5 annual and / or 24-hour standards .

of the remaining 35 counties designated as nonattainment for the 2013 revised annual pm 2.5 standard , five have not been previously designated for the annual standard but were designated as nonattainment for the 24-hour standard , and the remaining 30 counties have been previously designated as nonattainment only for the annual standard or for the annual and the 24-hour pm 2.5 standards .

 ( see table in appendix c . ) .

counties included in epa's january 2015 final nonattainment area designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs are indicated in the map in figure e - 1 .

although epa's final designations for the 2013 pm naaqs do not identify areas violating the 24-hour pm 2.5 standard , as the level is unchanged from the 2006 pm naaqs , the map distinguishes those proposed counties not previously designated as nonattainment for the annual or the 24-hour pm 2.5 standards .

the map in figure e - 2 presents the overlap of the january 2015 nonattainment designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 annual standard with those areas designated nonattainment for the 2006 and 1997 pm 2.5 standards .

counties in nonattainment for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs annual ( 15 μg / m 3 ) and / or 24-hour ( 65 μg / m 3 ) standards: u.s. epa final designations the figure below provides a historical presentation of counties designated as nonattainment for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs .

all counties were designated nonattainment for the pm 2.5 annual standard or both the annual and 24-hour pm 2.5 standards .

no counties were designated nonattainment only for the 24-hour pm 2.5 standard .
