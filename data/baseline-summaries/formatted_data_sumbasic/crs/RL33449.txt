as the 110 th congress begins its second session , ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan , combined with recruiting challenges and a great deal of interest among military retirees and those working on their behalf will probably continue to highlight military retirement and concurrent receipt issues .

however , with the recruiting and retention challenges being faced by the military , it is anticipated that military personnel benefits , to include retirement , will continue to be advanced and advocated by the department of defense ( dod ) and veteran's organizations .

it is further anticipated that concurrent receipt eligibility will remain an issue for the second session of the 110 th congress .

military retired pay is protected against inflation by statute ( 10 u.s.c .

1401a ) .

the military retirement reform act of 1986 , in conjunction with recent changes in the fy2000 national defense authorization act , provides for colas as indicated below .

congress has not modified the cola formula since fy1996 ( 1995 ) , although virtually every year since 1982 some cola modifications , always with the aim of reducing costs and hence the payments to retirees , have been at least discussed .

therefore , it is probably inadvisable to assume at any time that colas will be totally off the table in future congresses .

for further information on colas , see crs report 98-223 , colas for military retirees: summary of congressional and executive branch action , 1982-2004 ( fy1983-fy2005 ) , by [author name scrubbed] .

most people familiar with military retirement would probably agree that the most controversial military retirement issue that is currently the object of intense congressional interest is that involving concurrent receipt of military retired pay and department of veterans affairs ( va ) disability compensation .

until 2004 , the law required that military retired pay be reduced by the amount of any va disability compensation received .

for many years some military retirees had sought a change in law to permit receipt of all or some of both , and legislation to allow this has been introduced during the past several congresses , frequently having co - sponsors well above half of both the house and the senate .

this issue is referred to as "concurrent receipt," because it would involve the simultaneous receipt of two types of benefits .

the fy2003 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) , enacted in 2002 , created a benefit known as "combat - related special compensation," or crsc .

crsc provides , for certain seriously disabled retirees , a cash benefit financially identical to what concurrent receipt would provide them .

the fy2004 ndaa authorized , for the first time , actual concurrent receipt ( now referred to as concurrent receipt disability payments or crdp ) , as well as a greatly expanded crsc program .

the fy2005 ndaa further liberalized the concurrent receipt rules contained in the fy2004 ndaa ; this is discussed in greater detail below .

for a detailed description of the existing crdp and crsc programs , including a sample application form , see a web page of the military officers association of america ( moaa ) at http: / / www.moaa.org / lac / lac_issues_list / lac_issues_fullyretired / lac.issues_news_crsc.htm .

to qualify for va disability compensation , a determination must be made by the va that the veteran sustained a particular injury or disease , or had a preexisting condition aggravated , while serving in the armed forces .

some exceptions exist for certain conditions that may not have been apparent during military service but which are presumed to have been service - connected .

the va has a scale of 10 ratings , from 10% to 100% , although there is no special arithmetic relationship between the amount of money paid for each step .

each percentage rating entitles the veteran to a specific level of disability compensation .

in a major difference from the dod disability retirement system , a veteran receiving va disability compensation can ask for a medical reexamination at any time ( or a veteran who does not receive disability compensation upon separation from service can be reexamined later ) .

all va disability compensation is tax - free , which makes receipt of va compensation desirable , even with the operation of the offset .

military retirees can also apply to the va for disability compensation .

this can be advantageous to retirees who have a dod disability rating because , although offset , the va compensation is totally tax - free .

also , a retiree may ( 1 ) apply for va compensation any time after leaving the service and ( 2 ) have his or her degree of disability changed by the va as the result of a later medical reevaluation , as noted above .

many retirees seek benefits from the va years after retirement for a condition that may have been incurred during military service but that does not manifest itself until many years later .

the dod and va disability rating systems have much in common as well as significant differences .

dod makes a determination of eligibility for disability retirement only once , at the time the individual is separating from the service .

although dod uses the va schedule of types of disabilities to determine the percentage of disability , dod measures disability , or lack thereof , against the extent to which the individual can or cannot perform military duties , rather than his or her ability to perform post - service civilian work .

a military retiree , regardless of his or her dod disability status immediately upon retirement , can apply for va disability compensation at any time after leaving active military duty .

military disability retired pay is usually taxable , unless related to a combat disability .

the fy2003 ndaa ( section 636 , p.l .

107-314 ; 116 stat .

2458 ) , as amended by the fy2004 ndaa section 642 , p.l .

108-136 , 117 stat .

1392 , authorized "combat related special compensation" ( crsc ) .

military retirees with at least 20 years of service and who meet either of the following two criteria are eligible for crsc: a disability that is "attributable to an injury for which the member was awarded the purple heart," and is not rated as less than a 10% disability by dod or the va ; or a disability rating from either dod or the va , incurred due to involvement in "armed conflict," "hazardous service," "duty simulating war," and "through an instrumentality of war. .

this appears , in lay terms , to encompass combat with any kind of hostile force ; hazardous duty such as diving , parachuting , using dangerous materials such as explosives , and the like ; individual training and unit training and exercises and maneuvers in the field ; and "instrumentalities of war," such as accidents in combat vehicles or , if due to training - related activities , aboard naval vessels or military aircraft , and accidental injuries due to occurrences , such as munitions explosions , injuries from gases or vapors related to training for combat , and the like .

 ( the 2003 legislation limited the latter criterion to retirees with at least a 60% disability ; the 2004 legislation repealed the 60% limit. ) .

crsc payments will be equal to the amount of va disability compensation to which the retiree is entitled , but the new legislation does not end the requirement that the retiree's military retired pay be reduced by whatever va compensation to which the retiree is entitled .

therefore , crsc beneficiaries will receive the financial equivalence of concurrent receipt , but in legal and statutory terms it will not constitute concurrent receipt , and the statute also states that it explicitly is not retired pay per se .

retirees may also phone the retirement services offices of their service for the necessary information .

servicemembers with a permanent disability rating of 30% or greater may be retired and receive retired pay prior to completing 20 years of service .

these retirees are generally referred to as "chapter 61" retirees , a reference to chapter 61 , title 10 which governs their retirement .

the original concurrent receipt legislation excluded those who retired with less than 20 years of service .

however , the fy2008 ndaa ( p.l .

110-181 ) expanded combat related special compensation ( crsc ) to include chapter 61 retirees effective january 1 , 2008 .

eligibility is not based on a minimum number of years of service or a minimum disability rating other than the 30% noted above for disability retirement .

excluded from eligibility are those former servicemembers who were medically retired due to service - connected disabilities .

the fy2008 ndaa also includes almost all reserve disability retirees except those retired under 10 u.s.c .

12731b , a special provision which allows reservists with a physical disability not incurred in the line of duty to retire with between 15 and 19 creditable years of service .

the crsc statute in the fy2004 ndaa clearly states that personnel who qualify for reserve retirement by having at least 20 years of duty creditable for reserve retirement purposes are eligible for crsc .

when crsc was enacted in 2002 , dod interpreted the law as requiring reserve retirees to have at least 7,200 reserve retirement "points" to be eligible for crsc .

a reservist receives a certain number of retirement points for varying levels of participation in the reserves , or active duty military service .

the 7,200 point figure was extraordinarily high â€” in fact , it could only have been attained by a reservist who had at least 20 years of active duty military service .

hence , the dod interpretation of the law effectively denied crsc to reservists .

the fy2004 ndaa ( section 641 ) authorized , for the first time , actual concurrent receipt for retirees with at least a 50% disability , regardless of the cause of disability .

however , the amount of concurrent receipt will be phased in over a 10-year period , from 2004-2013 , except for 100% disabled retirees , who will be entitled to immediate concurrent receipt effective january 1 , 2005 ( this provision was added in the fy2005 ndaa ; see below ) .

depending on the degree of disability , the initial amount of retired pay that the retiree could receive would vary from $100 to $750 per month , or the actual amount , whichever is less .

by 2014 , the decrease in retired pay will be totally eliminated .

as with the revised crsc , this concurrent receipt benefit is also available to those reservists with at least 20 years of service creditable for reserve retirement purposes and who are receiving retired pay ( eligibility begins at age 60 ) .

the actual operation of the new concurrent receipt benefit is complicated , due to its progressive implementation over several years as required by law [10 u.s.c .

1414 ( c ) , as enacted by subsection 641 ( a ) , p.l .

108-136 , november 24 , 2003 ; 117 stat .

1511] .

it uses both dollar amounts and percentage amounts and varies in accordance with the degree of disability and by calendar year ( not fiscal year ) as follows .

in calendar year 2004 , military retirees entitled to va disability compensation were entitled to receive , in addition to that part of their military retired pay which is greater than the total va compensation to which they are entitled , the following additional amounts of retired pay .

in calendar year 2005 , with the exception of 100% disabled retirees , military retirees entitled to va disability compensation were entitled to any such amounts received in 2004 , as noted above , and an additional 10% of the offset that remained in 2004 .

however , beginning on january 1 , 2005 , and thereafter , 100% disabled retirees are entitled to all of their military retired pay in addition to all of their va disability compensation .

in calendar year 2006 , the same procedure as in 2005 applied , but the retirees affected got an additional 20% of their remaining offset from 2004 .

full concurrent receipt for 100% disabled retirees continued .

in 2007 , the same procedure applies but with affected retirees receiving an additional 30% of their remaining offset from 2004 .

full concurrent receipt for 100% disabled retirees will continue .

in 2008 , the same procedure applies but with affected retirees receiving an additional 40% of their remaining offset from 2004 .

full concurrent receipt for 100% disabled retirees will continue .

on january 1 , 2008 , those former servicemembers who were medically retired due to combat - related disabilities become eligible for combat - related special compensation ( crsc ) .

in addition , those retirees rated as 100% unemployable by the va become eligible for concurrent receipt , retroactive to december 31 , 2004 .

full concurrent receipt for 100% disabled retirees will continue .

for those retirees who retire after 2004 , their initial amounts will be the dollar amount prescribed for each percentage of disability ( the range listed above , in the section on calendar year 2004 , between $100 and $750 , depending on degree of disability ) , plus the additional percentage of that dollar amount for that year .

thus , a retiree who first retires in , say , 2006 , with an 80% disability will begin receiving an additional $420 monthly of his or her retired pay ( the $350 that an 80% disabled retiree is entitled to , as noted above , plus the additional 20% of $350 , or $70 , specified for 2006 ) .

because of the high initial amounts provided to severely disabled retirees , this new concurrent receipt benefit is "front - loaded" ; that is , most retirees will be able to concurrently receive most of their military retired pay within a few years of enactment of the law .

a retiree cannot receive both crsc and crdp benefits .

the retiree may choose whichever is most financially advantageous to him or her and may move back and forth between either benefit to maximize the payments received as often as desired .

after the enactment of the fy2005 ndaa in late 2004 , an issue arose about whether the authorization of full concurrent receipt , effective january 1 , 2005 , for 100% disabled retirees applied to retirees with a disability rating of less than 100% , but with what the va terms an " individual unemployability " ( iu ) rating of 100% .

the language in subsection 642 ( a ) of the fy2005 ndaa states that the immediate payment of full concurrent receipt will apply to retirees "receiving veterans' disability compensation for a disability rated at 100 percent...." that is , the law does not mention the iu concept .

according to individuals familiar with the issue , during the conference on the fy2005 ndaa , in 2004 , language explicitly including the 100% unemployables with less than a 100% disability rating was kept out of the final legislation on cost grounds .

the fy2006 ndaa ( p.l .

109-163 ) contained a partial step toward inclusion of the 100% unemployables by authorizing full concurrent receipt beginning on october 1 , 2009 , over four years earlier than the date of january 1 , 2014 that is in current law ( the date of full concurrent receipt for all retirees , regardless of their disability rating ) .

the issue of concurrent receipt for 100% unemployables was addressed in the fy2008 ndaa ( p.l .

110-181 ) .

this provision extended eligibility to all who have been rated as 100% unemployable ( regardless of their disability rating ) by the va and made their eligibility for concurrent receipt retroactive to december 31 , 2004 .

however , this new benefit will not begin until october 1 , 2008 .

at that time , monthly payments will begin and will include a lump sum payment for the retroactive benefit .
