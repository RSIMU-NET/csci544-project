on may 25 , 2006 , the house passed h.r .

5429 to open anwr to development ( yeas 225 , nays 201 , roll call #209 ) .

on march 16 , 2006 , the senate passed the fy2007 budgetresolution ( s.con.res .

83 ; yeas 51 , nays 49 , roll call #74 ; no written report ) .

its solereconciliation instruction ( â§201 ) directed the committee on energy and natural resources to reducebudget authority by an amount equal to predicted revenues from anwr development .

the housebudget resolution , as passed ( h.con.res .

376 , h.rept .

109-402 ) , did not have anyanwr language , nor direction for the house resources committee .

if the senate version isretained in the conference report , the language would facilitate inclusion of anwr development ina reconciliation bill ; reconciliation bills are not subject to senate filibusters .

however , it is unclearwhether agreement will be reached , and the house is proceeding on appropriations bills in theabsence of a final agreement .

the arctic national wildlife refuge ( anwr ) consists of 19 million acres in northeastalaska .

it is administered by the fish and wildlife service ( fws ) in the department of the interior ( doi ) .

its 1.5-million - acre coastal plain is viewed as one of the most promising u.s. onshore oil andgas prospects .

according to the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , the mean estimate of technically recoverable oil on the federally - owned land in the refuge is 7.7 billion barrels ( billion bbl ) , and thereis a small chance that over 11.8 billion bbl could be recovered on the federal lands .

the meanestimate of economically recoverable oil ( at $55 / bbl in 2003 dollars ) on the federal lands id 7.14billion bbl and there is a small chance that the federal lands could have over 10.7 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil .

that amount would be nearly as much as the single giant field atprudhoe bay , found in 1967 on the state - owned portion of the coastal plain west of anwr , nowestimated to have held almost 14 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil .

moreover , if congress opens federal lands in anwr to development , current law would alsoopen native lands .

in addition , nearby onshore development would also make state lands ( alreadylegally open to development ) along the coast more economically attractive , and as a result , thesestate lands might also become more attractive to industry .

while only the federal lands wouldproduce income from bonus bids , rents , and royalties , usgs figures show that when state and nativelands are considered , the mean estimates of economically recoverable oil rises to 9.7 billion bbl , andthere is a small chance that economically recoverable oil in the three ownerships might total over14.6 billion bbl .

 ( see "oil," below , for further discussion. ) .

the refuge , especially the nearly undisturbed coastal plain , also is home to a wide varietyof plants and animals .

the presence of caribou , polar bears , grizzly bears , wolves , migratory birds,and other species in this wild area has led some to call the area "america's serengeti. .

someadvocates have proposed that the refuge and two neighboring parks in canada become aninternational park , and several species found in the area ( including polar bears , caribou , migratorybirds , and whales ) are protected by international treaties or agreements .

the analysis below covers,first , the economic and geological factors that have triggered interest in development , then thephilosophical , biological , and environmental quality factors that have generated opposition to it .

the conflict between high oil potential and nearly pristine nature in the refuge creates adilemma: should congress open the area for energy development or should the area's ecosystemcontinue to be protected from development , perhaps permanently ? .

what factors should determinewhether , or when , to open the area ? .

if the area is opened , to what extent can damages be avoided,minimized , or mitigated ? .

to what extent should congress legislate special management to guidethe manner of development , and to what extent should federal agencies be allowed to manage thearea under existing law ? .
