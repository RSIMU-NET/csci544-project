a pension is a voluntary benefit offered by employers to assist employees in preparing for retirement .

pension plans may be classified according to whether they are ( 1 ) defined benefit ( db ) or defined contribution ( dc ) plans and ( 2 ) sponsored by one or more than one employer .

in db plans , participants typically receive regular monthly benefit payments in retirement ( which some refer to as a "traditional" pension ) .

in dc plans , of which the 401 ( k ) plan is the most common , participants have individual accounts that can provide a source of income in retirement .

this report focuses on db plans .

pension plans are also classified by whether they are sponsored by one employer ( single - employer plans ) or by more than one employer ( multiemployer and multiple - employer plans ) .

multiemployer pension plans are sponsored by more than one employer ( often , though not required to be , in the same industry ) and maintained as part of a collective bargaining agreement .

multiple - employer plans are sponsored by more than one employer but are not maintained as part of collective bargaining agreements .

multiple - employer plans follow the same funding rules as single - employer plans and are generally not reported separately .

this report focuses on single - employer plans .

except where noted , references to single - employer plans in this report include multiple - employer plans .

to protect the interests of pension plan participants and beneficiaries , congress enacted the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ; p.l .

93-406 ) .

the law is codified in the internal revenue code ( 26 u.s.c. ) .

and labor code ( 29 u.s.c. ) .

erisa sets standards that private - sector pension plans must follow with regard to plan participation ( who must be covered ) ; minimum vesting requirements ( how long a person must work for an employer to be covered ) ; fiduciary duties ( how individuals who oversee the plan must behave ) ; and plan funding ( how much employers must set aside to pay for future benefits ) .

in addition , erisa established the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) , which is a government corporation that insures db pension plans covered by erisa in the case of plan termination .

erisa covers only private - sector pension plans and plans established by nonprofit organizations .

it exempts pension plans established by the federal , state , and local governments and by churches .

the funding relief provisions discussed in this report generally apply only to plans covered by erisa .

pension funding consists of several elements .

these include the value of plan benefits that participants will receive in the current and in future years ; the amount a plan has set aside to pay for these benefits ; and the employer contributions required each year to ensure the plan has sufficient funds to pay benefits when participants retire .

the amount of a participant's benefit in a single - employer db plan is based on a formula that typically uses a combination of length of service , accrual rate , and average of final years' salary .

for example , a plan might specify that retirees receive an amount equal to 1.5% of their pay for each year of service , where the pay is the average of a worker's salary during his or her highest - paid five years .

in general , erisa requires db plans to have enough assets set aside to pay the benefits owed to participants .

for various reasons , plans may have less or more than this amount .

employers that sponsor db plans are required to make annual contributions to their plans to ensure they ultimately reach that 100% funding goal .

the pension protection act of 2006 ( ppa ; p.l .

109-280 ) was the most recent major legislation to affect pension plan funding .

among other provisions , ppa established new funding rules for single - and multiple - employer plans and required that plans become 100% funded over a certain time period .

ppa specified interest rates and other actuarial assumptions that plans must use to calculate their funding targets and target normal costs .

ppa gave plans three years to transition to the new funding requirements .

ppa also created special rules for certain types of plans , including those sponsored by certain government contractors , commercial airlines , and rural cooperatives .

since ppa's enactment in 2006 , congress has modified funding rules for pension plans several times .

funding relief provisions have delayed the implementation dates of some ppa provisions , extended amortization periods , or changed interest rates .

some funding relief has been directed toward all single - employer db plans ; other modifications of funding rules have been targeted to specific types of pension plans , such as plans for certain cooperative and charitable organizations and for community newspapers .

an extension of amortization periods allows plans a greater amount of time to pay off unfunded liabilities , meaning that plans can contribute less money per year over a greater number of years .

changes in interest rates modify the timing of required employer contributions .

as previously mentioned , a higher interest rate decreases the present value of plan liabilities , which means employers can contribute less today to fund a future benefit .

the dollar amount of the benefit that a participant will receive in the future remains unchanged .

relative to a lower interest rate , a higher interest rate allows plans to contribute relatively smaller amounts in the near term but will have to be made up with higher contributions in the longer term .

a lower interest rate does the oppositeâit increases the present value of plan liabilities , requiring more employer contributions in the near term ( and fewer in the long term ) .

the following sections describe funding relief provisions and other funding rule modifications in chronological order , where feasible , since ppa .

the u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act , 2007 ( p.l .

110-28 ) provided funding relief for plans operated by certain commercial airlines and airline catering companies .

as described above , ppa had extended the amortization period to either 10 or 17 years for these plans .

p.l .

110-28 specified that eligible plans that had chosen the 10-year amortization period could use an interest rate of 8.25% for purposes of calculating the funding target for each of those 10 years .

the worker , retiree , and employer recovery act of 2008 ( wrera ; p.l .

110-458 ) delayed the implementation of the ppa transition rules , giving plans additional time to become fully funded ( given the decline in asset values due to the 2007-2009 economic downturn ) .

the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-192 ) allowed plans to amortize underfunding resulting from the 2007-2009 market downturn using one of two alternative amortization schedules .

pension plan sponsors could amortize their funding shortfalls over either ( 1 ) 9 years , with the first 2 years of payments consisting of interest only on the amortization charge and the next 7 years consisting of interest and principal , or ( 2 ) 15 years .

plan sponsors that chose one of these amortization schedules were required to make additional contributions to the plan if the plan sponsors paid excess compensation or declared extraordinary dividends , as defined in p.l .

111-192 .

the moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act ( map - 21 ; p.l .

112-141 ) established a funding corridor to provide minimum and maximum interest rates used in calculating plan liabilities .

the minimum and maximum rates were initially calculated as 90% and 110% , respectively , of the average of corporate bond yields for the segment over the prior 25-year period .

if the 24-month segment interest rate as calculated under ppa is below the minimum percentage of the funding corridor , the interest rate is adjusted upward to the minimum .

if the 24-month segment interest rate is higher than the maximum , it is adjusted downward to the maximum .

map - 21 adjusted the minimum and maximum percentages surrounding the baseline rate over time to become 70% and 130% , respectively , by 2016 ( essentially widening the corridor ) .

when interest rates increase ( which occurs when the 24-month rate is adjusted upward to the minimum rate ) , the present value of future benefit obligations decreases , and required plan contributions decrease .

when companies contribute less to their pension plan , lower plan contributions increase companies' taxable income , which results in increased treasury revenue .

since map - 21 , provisions in enacted legislation twice delayed the beginning of the widening of the funding corridor .

first , the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 ( htf ; p.l .

113-159 ) delayed the beginning of widening of the funding corridor until 2018 .

later , the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( bba ; p.l .

114-74 ) delayed it until 2021 .

table 2 shows the applicable minimum and maximum percentages under map - 21 , htf , and bba .

figure 5 shows a hypothetical example of how segment rates are determined using the funding corridors .

the red line shows the average of a segment's interest rates for the prior 25 years .

the yellow and gold lines indicate the minimum and maximum rates around the 25-year average under the map - 21 provisions .

the light green and dark green lines indicate the widening of the corridors around the 25-year average under the htf provisions ( starting in 2018 ) .

the light blue and dark blue lines are the minimum and maximum rates around the 25-year averages in current law , as passed in the bba ( starting in 2021 ) .

because of the htf and bba extensions , the minimum and maximum corridors have remained at 90% and 110% , respectively , since 2012 .

the following example demonstrates how segment rates are adjusted .

if treasury determines that the segment rate is above the maximum segment rateâpoint ( 1 ) in figure 5 âthen treasury adjusts the segment rate downward until it equals the proposed maximum segment rate .

if treasury determines that the segment rate is at or below the maximum segment rate and at or above the minimum segment rateâpoint ( 2 ) in figure 5 âtreasury does not adjust the segment rates .

if treasury determines that the segment rate is below the minimum segment rateâpoint ( 3 ) in figure 5 âthen treasury adjusts the interest rate upward until it equals the proposed minimum segment rate .

for example , in april 2020 , the first segment rate before adjustment was 2.68% .

adjusted for the 25-year average bond yields , the first segment rate was 3.64% .

congress has authorized special funding rules for plans sponsored by specific types of employers , such as rural cooperatives and certain charities .

ppa delayed the implementation of funding rules for certain cooperatives .

subsequent legislation expanded this delayed effective date to certain charities .

later legislation modified funding rules for these plans , referred to as cooperative and small employer charity ( csec ) pension plans .

with two exceptions , csec plans are multiple - employer pension plans established by eligible cooperatives and certain charitable organizations to provide retirement benefits for their employees .

ppa provided a delayed effective date of january 1 , 2017 , for certain multiple - employer cooperative plansâsuch as pension plans for agriculture , electric , and telephone cooperativesâto adopt the new funding rules .

the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-192 ) extended ppa's delayed effective date to apply to certain charitable organizations' pension plansâmultiple - employer plans whose employers are charitable organizations described in 26 usc â§501 ( c ) ( 3 ) .

the cooperative and small employer charity pension flexibility act of 2013 ( p.l .

113-97 ) established funding rules for and provided a definition of csec pension plans .

among other provisions , this act permanently exempted these plans from ppa's funding rules and outlined minimum funding standards for csec plans .

plans must indicate if they use the csec - specific funding rules in their required annual reporting to the department of labor ( dol ) .

table a - 1 provides a list of csec plans and funded status in the 2017 plan year .

section 3 of division p of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 ) expanded the definition of csec plans to include plans maintained by an employer that meet several criteria .

it appears that the boy scouts of america master pension trust is the only plan that meets these expanded criteria .

section 3609 of the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act ; p.l .

116-136 ) applies csec funding rules to plans sponsored by certain charitable employers "whose primary exempt purpose is providing services with respect to mothers and children," among other criteria .

it appears that the pension plan sponsored by march of dimes is the only plan that meets these expanded criteria .

section 115 of the setting every community up for retirement enhancement act of 2019 ( secure act , enacted as division o of the further consolidated appropriations act of 2020 ; p.l .

116-94 ) provided special funding rules for pension plans operated by certain community newspapers that had no benefit increases for participants after december 31 , 2017 .

community newspaper plans are those maintained by certain private community newspaper organizations that are family - controlled and have been in existence for 30 or more years .

for these plans , the secure act increased the interest rate to 8% , and extended the amortization period from 7 to 30 years .

section 3608 of the cares act ( p.l .

116-136 ) allows contributions that are due in calendar year 2020 to be made , with interest , on january 1 , 2021 .

section 3608 also allows plans to use the funding percentage for the 2019 plan year , rather than the 2020 plan year ( which would likely be lower ) , in determining whether plans must impose benefit restrictions .

policymakers and stakeholders might consider some of the policy implications of single - employer db pension plan funding relief .

the considerations include the rationale for providing relief , the effects of lower levels of plan assets on participant benefits and pbgc , and the effect on the federal budget .

funding relief results in lower employer contributions to db plans in the near term .

among the rationales for funding relief is that it allows employers the flexibility to use funds for other priorities ( such as retaining or hiring employees ) .

for example , 74 trade associations said in a 2009 letter to policymakers that , "[p]roviding defined benefit funding relief is directly related to improving the economy and employment. .

on the other hand , some policymakers oppose funding relief to specific industries or companies because they provide "a special - interest bailout" and set both "bad policy and bad precedent. .

some stakeholders have expressed concern that employers adopting funding relief measures might use the funds saved via reduced contributions for non - core business activities .

for example , the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-192 ) limited the ability of employers that adopted funding relief measures to provide excess employee compensation or extraordinary dividends .

although employer contributions and plan assets are lower following funding relief , participants' benefits are not necessarily at riskâalthough they may be under certain circumstances .

participants in db plans that receive funding relief remain entitled to their benefits ; funding relief does not reduce these benefits .

for employers that do not become bankrupt , modifying the timing of contributions generally would not be problematicâover time , the employer would need to make all required contributions for participants to receive their full benefits .

however , in the case of employer bankruptcy , the timing of contributions may negatively affect both participants' benefits and pbgc .

participants with benefits greater than the pbgc maximum guarantee or with non - guaranteed benefits might see reduced benefits when pbgc becomes trustee of their plan .

following funding relief , there are fewer plan assets available from which to pay non - guaranteed benefits because funding relief lowers employer contributions to db plans in the short term .

in addition , pbgc receives fewer assets from the plans that it trustees , which harms its financial position .

erisa requires pbgc to be self - supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue .

erisa states that the "united states is not liable for any obligation or liability incurred by the corporation. .

increasingly large amounts of unfunded liabilities in terminated plans may burden pbgc's single - employer insurance program .

although pbgc ended fy2019 with a surplus of $8.6 billion , the effects of ( 1 ) the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic on the financial health of employers and ( 2 ) the market downturn in early 2020 on the value of db plan assets will likely worsen the funding position of single - employer pension plans and pbgc's financial position .

funding relief can result in short - term revenue for treasury and pbgc .

because employer contributions to pension plans are generally tax deductible , decreasing a plan's required contributions for a year ( either through increasing the interest rate or extending the amortization period ) increases the plan's taxable income .

some stakeholders point out that because funding relief provides revenue to treasury , it has been used for budgetary offsets without regard to the policy justifications .

funding relief can positively affect pbgc finances because greater db plan underfunding results in higher variable - rate premiums ( premiums based on the amount of plan underfunding ) paid by employers to pbgc .

 table a - 1 provides data on cooperative and small employer charity ( csec ) plans in the 2017 plan year ( the most recent year for which complete data are available ) .

in total , csec plans had about 239,000 participants , $19.6 billion in assets , and a total funding target of $20.7 billion in 2017 .

the largest plan by number of participants in 2017 was the retirement security plan , which had assets of $8.6 billion and a total funding target of $9.2 billion in that year .

to determine which plans use csec funding rules , the congressional research service ( crs ) analyzed public - use form 5500 data from the department of labor ( dol ) for the 2014 to 2017 plan years .

2014 is the first year that form 5500 includes an option to indicate the use of csec funding rules ( following p.l .

113-97 ) , and 2017 is the most recent year for which complete data are available .

most private - sector pension plans are required to submit annual forms to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , dol , and the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) .

these forms generally include information about the plan , such as the number of participants , financial information , and the companies that provide services to the plan .

in addition to form 5500 , pension plans are generally required to file information in specific schedules .

for example , most single - employer and multiple - employer plans are required to file schedule sb , which contains information specific to these plans .

each pension plan's form 5500 and required schedules are available by search on dol's website .

because data are self - reported , table a - 1 may not capture all plans that used csec funding rules or may include non - csec plans that erroneously identified as csec plans .

table a - 1 provides data on private - sector defined benefit ( db ) pension plans that indicated using csec funding rules on their 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , or 2017 schedule sb filings .

twenty - eight plans indicated using csec funding rules in multiple years .

one plan , the johns hopkins health system corporation plan , appeared to start using csec funding rules in 2017 .

table a - 1 provides the total number of participants , actuarial value of assets , total funding target , and funding target attainment percentage for the 29 plans ( including the johns hopkins plan ) .

in addition to the johns hopkins plan , 10 plans indicated using csec funding rules in a single year but not in other years .

an examination of individual plan filings from the employee benefits security administration ( ebsa ) showed that these plans did not use csec funding rules in the year they indicated having done so and are not included in this analysis .

the employee benefit plan of jewish community of louisville , inc. , indicated using csec funding rules in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , but a form 5500 for the 2017 plan year is not available and is not included in table a - 1 .

in 2016 , this plan had 110 participants .
