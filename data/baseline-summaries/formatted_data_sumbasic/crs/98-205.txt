the president signed both bills into law on october 17 ( the authorization is p.l.105-261 and the appropriations is p.l .

105-262 ) .

on october 20 , the house , and , onoctober 21 , the senate , approved an omnibus appropriations bill for fy1999 ( h.r .

4328 ) that provides additional defense - related funding of $8.3 billion,including $1.9 billion for bosnia operations , $1.3 billion for military readiness , $1.5 billionfor intelligence , $1 billion for missile defense , $1.1 billion for year 2000 fixes in the defensedepartment , $469 million for storm damage repairs , $525 million to purchase fissilematerials from russia ( a defense - related program of the department of energy ) , $529million for antiterrorism activities , and $42 million for defense counter - drug activities .

thepresident signed the bill into law ( p.l .

105-277 ) on october 21 .

the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of thedepartment of defense ( dod ) - - including pay and benefits of military personnel , operationand maintenance of weapons and facilities , weapons procurement , and research anddevelopment - - and for other purposes .

most of the funding in the bill is for programsadministered by the department of defense , though the bill also provides ( 1 ) relatively small,unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligencecommunity management , ( 2 ) classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activitiesadministered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod , and ( 3 ) very smallamounts for some other agencies .

five other appropriations bills also provide funds fornational defense activities of dod and other agencies - - see appendix b for an overview .

the administration's fy1999 budget included $270.6 billion for the national defense budgetfunction , of which $250.8 billion was requested in the defense appropriations bill .

along with annual defense - related appropriations , congress also acts every year on a national defense authorization bill .

the authorization bill addresses defense programs inalmost precisely the same level of line item detail as the defense - related appropriations bills .

differences between the authorization and appropriations measures within each housegenerally concern only a few programs .

congressional debate over major defense policy andfunding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization bill .

because thedefense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related , this report trackscongressional action on both measures .

congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations billson october 1 .

the final status of action on these bills and on related legislation is as follows: house and senate 302 ( b ) allocations: on may 14 , the senate appropriations committee approved its initial allocation of funds to each of its 13subcommittees , and on may 22 , house appropriations committee chairman bob livingstonannounced his proposed initial 302 ( b ) allocations - - the full committee approved the initialallocations on june 16 .

these allocations , which are revised over the course of the year,ultimately determine how much money will be available for defense and other programsunder the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees .

the final senate allocations to thedefense subcommittee are $250.290 billion in budget authority and $244.942 billion inoutlays .

these amounts are slightly below what the administration had requested , whileallocations to the military construction subcommittee are somewhat above the request .

thefinal house allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billionin outlays for the national security subcommittee .

see table b - 1 in appendix b , below , forallocations of all defense discretionary funds .

see crs report 96-912 , brief introductionto the federal budget process , by [author name scrubbed] , for a discussion of the role of 302 ( b ) allocations in the budget process .

the bill offsets the supplementalfunding for domestic programs with rescissions , but it does not offset the defense amounts .

the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities ofthe department of defense ( dod ) and for other purposes .

five other appropriationsbills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies,including: the military construction appropriations bill , which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military familyhousing , all administered by dod ; the energy and water development appropriations bill , which funds atomic energy defense activities administered by the department ofenergy ; the va - hud - independent agencies appropriations bill , which finances civil defense activities administered by the federal emergency managementagency and activities of the selective service system ; the commerce - justice - state appropriations bill , which funds national security - related activities of the fbi ; and the transportation appropriations bill , which funds some defense - related activities of the coast guard .

the defense appropriations bill is by far the largest of the defense - related appropriations measures .

table b - 1 provides a breakdown fy1999 funding byappropriations subcommittee .

the national defense budget function also includesmandatory funding .

net mandatory funding for defense is a relatively small negativeamount , which mainly reflects receipts from sales of items to the public .

note:the most recent house figures were not reported to show national defense funding .

the administration's defense budget request for fy1999 and projected defensebudgets through fy2002 reflect the white house - congressional budget agreementthat was finalized in june 1997 .

under the administration plan , extended throughfy2003 , budget authority for national defense will grow slowly in nominal terms , butit will be essentially flat when adjusted for inflation .

this marks the end of a longperiod in which defense spending has steadily declined from its peak in themid - 1980s .

by fy2003 , budget authority for national defense will be almost 38%below the level in fy1985 .

table c1 shows the trend in current year dollars and inconstant fy1999 prices .

c1 .

administration national defense budget projections ( current and constant fy1999 dollars in billions ) sources: current year figures from office of management and budget ; deflators from dod comptroller .

the cuts in the defense budget over the past several years have been achieved mainly by reducing the size of the military force and by slowing the pace of weaponsmodernization .

under plans established by the quadrennial defense review,released on may 19 , 1997 , active duty end - strength will decline from 2.2 million infy1987 to 1.36 million by fy2003 , a reduction of 36% .

funding for weaponsacquisition has declined even more steeply .

the fy1999 budget requests $48.7billion for weapons procurement and $36.1 billion for research , development , testand evaluation ( rdt&e ) .

adjusted for inflation , proposed procurement funding is65% below the level in fy1985 and the total for procurement plus r&d is down by54% .

the level of procurement funding is a matter of ongoing debate .

a key goal of the quadrennial defense review is to increase procurement funding over the nextseveral years , mainly by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and transferringthe savings to weapons acquisition .

by fy2001 , the administration projects $61.3billion for procurement ( see table a2 in appendix a ) .

to reach this level , however,depends on ( 1 ) achieving projected savings through reforms in defense businesspractices and ( 2 ) controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses ( seebelow for a further discussion ) .

 ( for detailed figures on trends in defense spending,see [author name scrubbed] and mary tyszkiewicz , defense budget for fy1999: datasummary , crs report 98-155 , feb. 23 , 1998. ) .

for the past three years , congress has added substantial amounts to the annual defense budget request .

because of last year's budget agreement , however , congresshas no room to add to the fy1999 request .

table c2 shows congressional additionsin to the request in recent years .

c2: congressional additions to administration national defense budget requests , fy1996-98 ( current yeardollars in millions ) sources: fy1996 and fy1997 request , congressional change , and appropriations from department of defense , "national defense budget estimates for fy1998,"march 1997 ; fy1998 request , congressional change , and appropriations fromcongressional budget office - - note that the request reflects cbo scoring of theadministration submission ; current estimate for all years from office of managementand budget , "historical tables: budget of the united states government , fiscalyear 1999 , feb. 1998 .

note: later adjustments are due to supplemental appropriations , rescissions , and technical adjustments .

the largest technical adjustments are in contract authority fordefense working capital funds .
