the 108th congress has considered and is considering legislation on a wide range ofimmigration issues .

two of these issues - - the transfer of immigration authorities and expeditednaturalization through military service - - relate directly to post - september 11 , 2001 u.s. efforts toimprove national security .

in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks , the 107th congress establisheda new department of homeland security ( dhs ) as part of the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l.107-296 ) .

dhs was tasked with preventing terrorist attacks in the united states and reducing thenation's vulnerability to terrorism , among other responsibilities .

effective march 1 , 2003 , p.l.107-296 abolished the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) of the department of justice ( doj ) , the agency which had administered and enforced the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , ( 1 ) and transferred most immigration - related functions to the newly created dhs .

lingering questionsremain , however , about the division of authorities between doj and dhs in some areas .

pendinglegislation would amend the ina to explicitly transfer certain authorities to dhs .

like theestablishment of dhs , operation iraqi freedom had a goal of protecting u.s. national security .

thisoperation prompted congressional interest in legislation to expand the citizenship benefits of aliensserving in the military .

the 108th congress has enacted a measure ( p.l .

108-136 ) that amendsmilitary naturalization and posthumous citizenship statutes and provides immigration benefits forimmediate relatives of u.s. citizen servicemembers who die as a result of actual combat service .

the 108th congress is currently debating legislation that would implement recommendations of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( also known as the 9 / 11commission ) .

the 9 / 11 commission's immigration - related recommendations focused primarily ontargeting terrorist travel through an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identificationsystems and effective , integrated information - sharing .

as congress has considered theserecommendations , however , possible legislative responses have broadened to include significant andpossibly far - reaching changes in the substantive law governing immigration and how that law isenforced , both at the border and in the interior of the united states .

other measures before the 108th congress - - such as those on temporary workers and business personnel , adjustment of status for unauthorized aliens , and noncitizen eligibility for public benefits - - concern more perennial immigration - related questions .

these include how to use the immigrationsystem to meet u.s. labor needs , how to address unauthorized immigration to the united states , andwhat types of benefits to provide to noncitizens .

of course , today's heightened security concernshave likewise added new dimensions to these old questions .

in the current debate over consularidentification cards , for example , issues of unauthorized immigration and security have been raised .

this report discusses these and other immigration - related issues that have seen legislative action orare of significant congressional interest .

 ( 2 ) the finalsection of the report lists enacted legislation andselected bills receiving action .

for decades , the administrative authority to interpret , implement , enforce , and adjudicateimmigration law within the united states lay almost exclusively with one officer: the attorneygeneral .

the most general statement of this power was found in ï¿½103 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the ina , thefundamental statute regulating the entry and stay of aliens .

with some exceptions , immigrationfunctions were delegated to ins , which was headed by a commissioner who reported to the attorneygeneral .

on march 1 , 2003 , primary responsibility for securing our borders and managing the immigration process shifted to dhs .

this transfer was effectuated through general language in thehomeland security act ( hsa ; p.l .

107-296 ) : congress did not amend every affected section of theina to change all references to the attorney general that were effectively superceded by the generaltransfer of authority .

however , congress did amend the language of ï¿½103 ( a ) of the ina , first inï¿½1102 of the hsa and later in division l , ï¿½105 , of the consolidated appropriations resolution of2003 ( p.l .

108-7 ) .

this section now states: the secretary of homeland security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of [the ina] and all other laws relating to the immigrationand naturalization of aliens , except insofar as this chapter or such laws relate to the powers,functions , and duties conferred upon the president , attorney general , the secretary of state ... .

provided , however , that determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to allquestions of law shall be controlling .

the revised language reflects the transfer of general authority , but may leave certain issues unresolved .

first , exactly what immigration powers and functions are to be retained by the attorneygeneral ? .

laws to date make clear that the attorney general is to remain responsible foradministrative adjudications by immigration judges and the board of immigration appeals , and thatdeterminations and rulings by the attorney general on questions of law are to be controlling .

however , the intended extent of these and possible other retained powers may not be altogether clearat the operational level .

second , to the degree that authority over immigration is now fragmentedor overlapping , how are the respective authorities of dhs and the attorney general to becoordinated and reconciled ? .

it has been argued that only a section - by - section revision of the ina , replacing references to the attorney general with references to the secretary of homeland security where appropriate , willtruly clarify the allocation of authorities between the two departments .

 ( 3 ) a bill to replace certain inareferences to the attorney general with references to the secretary of homeland security ( h.r .

1416 ) was adopted by the house on june 24 , 2003 , and reported by the senategovernmental affairs committee on november 25 , 2003 .

as passed by the house and reported bythe senate committee , this bill , the "homeland security technical corrections act of 2003," wouldremove specified references to the attorney general , ins , and the ins commissioner in ina ï¿½103 ( leaving intact the controlling nature of the attorney general's determinations of law ) and in inaï¿½287 ( g ) , which concerns acceptance of state services to carry out immigration enforcement .

according to the house select committee on homeland security report on h.r .

1416 ( h.rept .

108-104 ) , the bill "improves the homeland security act of 2002 and honors the originalintentions of the drafters by making grammatical and technical corrections. .

nonetheless , questionsmay remain as to how far this provision would fully clarify and resolve outstanding issues ofauthority .

 ( 4 ) .

since the beginning of operation iraqi freedom in march 2003 there has been considerableinterest in legislation to expand the citizenship benefits of aliens serving in the military .

thereported deaths in action of noncitizen soldiers have drawn attention to provisions of the ina thatgrant posthumous citizenship to those who die as a result of active - duty service during a period ofhostilities .

the ina also provides for expedited naturalization for noncitizens serving in the unitedstates military .

during peacetime , noncitizens in the military may petition to naturalize after threeyears aggregate military service rather than the requisite five years of legal permanent residence .

during periods of military hostilities , noncitizens serving in the armed forces can naturalizeimmediately .

in the wake of september 11 , 2001 , and the war against terrorism , president george w. bush officially designated the period beginning on september 11 , 2001 , as a "period of hostilities," whichtriggered immediate naturalization eligibility for active - duty u.s. military servicemembers .

at thetime of the designation ( july 3 , 2002 ) , the department of defense and the former ins announcedthat they would work together to ensure that military naturalization applications were processedexpeditiously .

as of february 2003 , there were 37,000 noncitizens serving in active duty in the u.s.armed forces , almost 12,000 noncitizens serving in the selected reserves , and another 8,000 servingin the inactive national guard and ready reserves .

of the many pending bills containing provisions concerning expedited or posthumous citizenship as the result of military service , h.r .

1588 , the "national defenseauthorization act for fiscal year 2004," became p.l .

108-136 on november 24 , 2003 .

title xviiof h.r .

1588 , entitled "naturalization and other immigration benefits for militarypersonnel and families," amends existing military naturalization statutes by: reducing the periodof service required for naturalization based on peacetime service from three years to one year ; waiving fees for naturalization based on military service during peacetime or wartime ; permittingdiscretionary revocation of naturalization granted on or after the date of enactment throughpeacetime or wartime service if the citizen were discharged from military service under other thanhonorable conditions before serving honorably for an aggregate period of five years ; permittingnaturalization processing overseas in u.s. embassies , consulates , and military bases ; providing forpriority consideration for military leave and transport to finalize naturalization ; and extendingnaturalization based on wartime service to members of the selected reserve of the ready reserve .

additionally , the secretary of defense or the secretary's designee within the dhs bureau ofcitizenship and immigration services is authorized to request posthumous citizenship immediatelyupon obtaining permission from the next - of - kin .

p.l .

108-136 expands immigration benefits available to the immediate relatives ( spouses , children , and parents ) of citizens , including posthumous citizens , who die from injuries or illnessesresulting from or aggravated by serving in combat .

such relatives would remain classified asimmediate relatives of a u.s. citizen for immigration purposes , notwithstanding the death of theservicemember , and could self - petition for immigrant status .

certain adjustment requirements andthe public charge ground of inadmissibility would be waived .

in addition , children and parents , aswell as spouses , of u.s. citizens who die during honorable active - duty service would be eligible tonaturalize without prior residence or a specified period of physical presence in the united states .

this includes survivors of posthumous citizens who died on or after september 11 , 2001 .

p.l .

108-136 also amends the relevant sections of the ina to change references to the attorney general to references to the secretary of homeland security .

the effective date of the provisionsin p.l .

108-136 would be retroactive to september 11 , 2001 , except for the fee waivers andprovision for naturalization proceedings abroad , which shall take effect on october 1 , 2004 .

 ( 5 ) .

the report of 9 / 11 commission concluded that the key officials responsible for determiningalien admissions ( consular officers abroad and immigration inspectors in the united states ) were notconsidered full partners in counterterrorism efforts prior to september 11 , 2001 , and as a result,opportunities to intercept the september 11 terrorists were missed .

the 9 / 11 commission contendedthat " ( t ) here were opportunities for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al qaeda's travelvulnerabilities. .

 ( 6 ) the 9 / 11 commission's immigration - related recommendations focused primarily on targeting terrorist travel through an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identification systemsand effective , integrated information - sharing .

as congress has considered these recommendations,however , possible legislative responses have broadened to include significant and possiblyfar - reaching changes in the substantive law governing immigration and how that law is enforced,both at the border and in the interior of the united states .

 ( 7 ) there are several major bills that seek to implement recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission , and some propose significant revisions to u.s. immigration law and policy .

the bills that wouldrevise immigration law include h.r .

10 , to provide for reform of the intelligencecommunity , terrorism prevention and prosecution , border security , and international cooperation andcoordination , and for other purposes ; s. 2845 , the national intelligence reform act of2004 ; s. 2774 / h.r .

5040 , the 9 / 11 commission report implementationact of 2004 ; and h.r .

5024 , the 9 / 11 commission recommendations implementationact of 2004 .

of these bills , h.r .

10 as reported by the house committee on the judiciaryon october 5 , 2004 , proposes the most extensive revisions of the ina .

during the senate floordebate on s. 2845 , s.amdt .

3807 , which added a title on "terrorist travel andeffective screening," was accepted on october 1 , 2004 .

the major immigration areas underconsideration in these comprehensive 9 / 11 commission bills include: asylum , biometric trackingsystems , border security , document security , exclusion , immigration enforcement , and visaissuances .

 ( 8 ) .

the ina provides for the temporary admission of various categories of foreign workers andbusiness personnel .

foreign nationals admitted to the united states on a temporary basis are knownas nonimmigrants .

the major nonimmigrant category for temporary workers is the h visa .

the hvisa category includes the h - 1b visa for professional specialty workers , the h - 2a visa foragricultural workers , and the h - 2b visa for nonagricultural workers , among other visa classifications .

foreign nationals also may be temporarily admitted to the united states for work - orbusiness - related purposes under other nonimmigrant categories , including the b - 1 visa for businessvisitors , the e visa for treaty traders and investors , and the l - 1 visa for intracompany transfers .

 ( 9 ) .

estimates derived from the march supplement of the u.s. bureau of census's currentpopulation survey indicate that the unauthorized resident alien population ( commonly referred toas illegal aliens ) was 9.3 million in 2002 .

almost two - thirds ( 57% ) of these illegal residents werebelieved to be mexican nationals .

 ( 13 ) several billsbefore the 108th congress , some of which arediscussed below , would enable certain unauthorized aliens to adjust to legal permanent resident ( lpr ) status .

adjustment refers to the process under immigration law by which an individualpresent in the united states is granted legal permanent residence .

prior to 1996 , lprs were eligible for federal public benefits , such as medicaid , under termscomparable to citizens , and states were not permitted to restrict access to federal programs on thebasis of immigration status .

the 1996 welfare reform law ( p.l .

104-193 ) made most newly enteringlprs ineligible for federal public benefits for five years ; after five years , it allowed states to continuebarring lprs from federal public benefits , including medicaid and the state children's healthinsurance program ( schip ) .

 ( 16 ) nonetheless , allnoncitizens , regardless of status , who otherwise meetthe eligibility requirements for medicaid , are eligible for emergency medicaid .

 ( 17 ) on december 8 , 2003 , president bush signed the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( p.l .

108-173 ) .

it includes a provision to reimburse healthcareproviders for uncompensated treatment given to unauthorized aliens , aliens paroled ( 18 ) into the unitedstates for the purpose of receiving eligible services , and mexican citizens permitted to enter theunited states with border crossing cards ( also referred to as "laser visas" ) .

specifically , p.l.108-173 instructs the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) to pay local governments,hospitals , or other providers such amounts as they can demonstrate were used to provideuncompensated emergency health services to unauthorized aliens , aliens paroled into the unitedstates , and mexican citizens entering with border crossing cards .

funding is allocated to statesbased on a formula , and the state allotment is available to reimburse health care providers in thatstate .

for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2008 , the provision appropriates $250 million , of which: $167 million is designated to states based on the percentage of unauthorized aliens residing in the state compared to the total number of unauthorized aliens in the united states ; and $83 million is designated to the 6 states with the highest percentage ofunauthorized alien apprehensions for the fiscal year .

p.l .

108-173 also requires the secretary of hhs to establish a process , including measures to protect against fraud and abuse , for hospitals and other health care providers to apply for reimbursement .

the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 ( ebsver ; p.l .

107-173 ) required that by october 26 , 2004 all visas issued have biometric identifiers .

although thedepartment of state ( dos ) has said that it will meet the deadline , it is not clear that dhs will havethe readers for the new biometric visas in place at all points of entry by the specified date .

 ( 20 ) ebsver also established biometric requirements for visa waiver program ( vwp ) countries , whosenationals are allowed to enter the united states as temporary visitors for business or pleasure withoutfirst obtaining a visa from a u.s. consulate abroad .

 ( 21 ) the act mandated that by october 26 , 2004,the government of each vwp country must certify that it has established a program to issuemachine - readable passports that are tamper - resistant and incorporate a biometric identifier .

ebsver also specified that any person applying for admission to the united states under the vwpmust have a tamper - resistant , machine - readable passport with a biometric identifier , unless thepassport was issued prior to october 26 , 2004 .

the standard agreed upon by the internationalcommunity for the biometric identifier is facial recognition .

p.l .

108-299 ( h.r .

4417 ) extended for one - year both the deadline for vwp countries to certify that they have a program to issue machine - readable passports with biometricidentifiers , and the requirement that all visas issued have biometric identifiers .

the new biometricdeadline is october 26 , 2005 .

under p.l .

108-299 , any person applying for admission to the unitedstates under the vwp as of that date would have to have a tamper - resistant , machine - readablepassport with a biometric identifier , unless the passport was issued prior to october 26 , 2005 .

s.amdt .

3933 was introduced on october 5 , 2004 , during the floor debate of s. 2845 , the "national intelligence reform act of 2004. .

s.amdt .

3933 would require that each vwp country , as a condition of being in the vwp , have a program to issuetamper - resident , machine readable visa documents that incorporate biometric identifiers which arecompatible with the biometric identifiers used in the us - visit program .

the current debate about consular identification cards in the united states has centered aroundthe matrã­cula consular , the consular card issued by the mexican government to its citizens in theunited states when they register with a consulate .

in recent years , and especially since theseptember 11 , 2001 attacks , mexican consulates in the united states and other interested partieshave worked to gain acceptance of the matrã­cula consular as identification for a variety of purposes,with considerable success .

the matrã­cula consular raises a number of questions for domestic and foreign policy .

with respect to domestic policy , there is much debate about the costs and benefits of the cards in the areasof immigration , public safety and law enforcement , and homeland security .

relevant foreign policyissues include the u.s. - mexico bilateral relationship , reciprocity of treatment of citizens abroad , andconsular notification in law enforcement situations .

legislation related to consular identification cards is before the 108th congress .

the house - passed foreign relations authorization act for fy2004-fy2005 ( h.r .

1950 ) contains provisions to restrict the issuance of such cards by foreign missions .

other pendingmeasures concern acceptance of consular identification cards by u.s. federal entities ( h.r .

502 , h.r .

687 , and h.r .

3534 ) , and acceptance of thecards for banking purposes ( h.r .

773 and h.j.res .

58 ) .

h.r .

4440 would establish consequences under immigration law for the possession or use of consularidentification cards .

h.r .

10 as reported by the house judiciary committee wouldrequire that , for purposes of establishing his or her identity to a federal employee , an alien presentin the united states may present a valid foreign passport or an immigration document issued by dhsor the department of justice under the authority of immigration laws , and no other document canbe used for such purposes .

iirira ( in title iv , subtitle a ) directed the attorney general to conduct three pilot programsfor employment eligibility confirmation ( i.e. , to confirm that new hires are legally eligible to work ) .

it further directed the attorney general to establish an employment eligibility confirmation systemto be used by employers participating in the pilot programs .

each program was authorized initiallyfor four years .

p.l .

107-128 extended the life of each program from four years to six years .

the first program to be implemented , known as the "basic pilot program," began in november 1997 .

under iirira , the basic pilot is to operate in at least five of the seven states with the largestestimated unauthorized alien populations .

currently , it is operating in six states ( california , florida,illinois , nebraska , new york , and texas ) .

although some employers are required to participate ina pilot program , participation in the programs is , for the most part , voluntary .

s. 1685 , as reported by the senate judiciary committee , would amend iirira's pilot program provisions .

it would extend each program for an additional five years , therebyauthorizing the basic pilot program until 2008 .

s. 1685 also would provide for theoperation of the basic pilot program in all states by december 1 , 2004 .

it would not change theiirira provisions concerning voluntary or mandatory participation .

during senate floor consideration , s. 1685 was amended to add unrelated provisions concerning the immigrant investor regional center pilot program .

these provisions,which were previously passed by the senate in another bill ( s. 1642 ) , are discussedbelow in the "other legislation receiving action" section .

s. 1685 , as amended , waspassed by the senate and house .

on december 3 , 2003 , the president signed the bill into law ( p.l.108-156 ) .

earlier in the session , a related bill ( h.r .

2359 ) had been considered in the house .

as reported by the house judiciary committee , h.r .

2359 , like s. 1685 ,would have extended each pilot program for an additional five years and would have provided forthe operation of the basic pilot program in all states .

additionally , h.r .

2359 wouldhave allowed the pilot program confirmation system to be used for government inquiries about anindividual's immigration status .

a separate provision of iirira ( ï¿½642 ( c ) ) directed the former insto respond to inquiries by federal , state , or local government agencies seeking to verify or ascertainthe citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agencies for anypurpose authorized by law .

h.r .

2359 would have provided that such inquiries maybe submitted and responded to using the employment eligibility confirmation system .

a modified version of h.r .

2359 , which contained all the above provisions , wasconsidered on the house floor on october 28 , 2003 .

a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill,as amended , failed .

the 231 to 170 vote on the motion fell short of the required two - thirds vote .
