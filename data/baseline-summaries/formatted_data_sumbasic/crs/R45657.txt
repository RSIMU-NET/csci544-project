political and economic developments in cuba and u.s. policy toward the island nation , located 90 miles from the united states , have been significant congressional concerns for many years .

especially since the end of the cold war , congress has played an active role in shaping u.s. policy toward cuba , first with the enactment of the cuban democracy act of 1992 ( cda ; p.l .

102-484 , title xvii ) and then with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity ( libertad ) act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) .

both measures tightened u.s. economic sanctions on cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s ; however , both measures also provided road maps for normalization of relations , dependent on significant political and economic changes in cuba .

congress partially modified its sanctions - based policy toward cuba when it enacted the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 ( tsra ; p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) allowing for u.s. agricultural exports to cuba .

over the past decade , much of the debate in congress over u.s. policy has focused on u.s. sanctions .

in 2009 , congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure ( p.l .

111-8 ) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports , marking the first congressional action easing cuba sanctions in almost a decade .

the obama administration took further action in 2009 by lifting restrictions on family travel and family remittances and in 2011 by further easing restrictions on educational and religious travel and remittances to other than family members .

president obama announced a major shift in u.s. policy toward cuba in december 2014 that moved away from a sanctions - based policy aimed at isolating cuba toward a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations .

the policy shift led to the restoration of diplomatic relations , the rescission of cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism , and the easing of some restrictions on travel and commerce with cuba .

there was mixed reaction in congress , with some members of congress supporting the change and others opposing it .

legislative initiatives in the 114 th congress in 2015-2016 reflected this policy divide , with some bills introduced that would have further eased u.s. economic sanctions and others that would have blocked the policy shift and introduced new sanctions ; ultimately no action was taken on either policy approach .

president trump announced a new policy approach toward cuba in june 2017 that partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions on cuba , including restrictions on the permissible category of people - to - people educational travel to cuba and on transactions with companies controlled by the cuban military .

again , reaction in the 115 th congress in 2017-2018 was mixed , with legislative initiatives reflecting the policy divide between those wanting to tighten sanctions and those wanting to ease them .

ultimately the only legislative action taken with regard to sanctions was a provision in the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) that permits funding for two u.s. agricultural exports promotion programs in cuba .

this marked the first time congress had eased cuba sanctions , albeit slightly , in almost a decade .

this report examines u.s. policy toward cuba in the 116 th congress .

it is divided into three major sections analyzing: ( 1 ) cuba's political and economic environment ; ( 2 ) u.s. policy toward cuba ; and ( 3 ) selected issues in u.s. - cuban relations , including restrictions on travel and trade , democracy and human rights funding for cuba , u.s. government - sponsored radio and television broadcasting to cuba ( radio and t martí ) , migration issues , antidrug cooperation , property claims , and u.s. fugitives from justice in cuba .

relevant legislative initiatives in the 116 th congress are noted throughout the report , and appendix a lists enacted measures and other bills and resolutions .

appendix b provides links to u.s. government information and reports on cuba .

when miguel díaz - canel succeeded raúl castro as president in april 2018 , a leader from a new generation came to power — díaz - canel is 58 years old .

nevertheless , raúl castro , currently 87 years old , is continuing as first secretary of cuba's communist party until 2021 , and he headed the commission that drafted cuba's new constitution approved by a public referendum in february 2019 .

although the new constitution locks in some market - oriented economic reforms that have been introduced in recent years ( private property , private sector , and foreign investment ) , it also ensures the state sector's dominance over the economy and the predominate role of the communist party in cuba's political system .

in late 2018 , díaz - canel took actions that appeared to demonstrate his independence from the previous castro government and his responsiveness to public concerns , but his government faces a difficult economic outlook , one that could become bleaker if oil supplies from venezuela are cut .

looking ahead , president díaz - canel faces two major challenges — moving forward with economic reforms that produce results and responding to desires for greater freedom .

president trump's partial rollback of the obama engagement policy and the introduction of new economic sanctions has limited opportunities for u.s. business engagement in cuba and increased tensions in bilateral relations .

the u.s. decision to downsize the diplomatic staff of the u.s. embassy in havana in response to unexplained injuries to u.s. diplomatic personnel in cuba resulted in the suspension of most visa processing at the embassy and reduced other embassy operations , which has made bilateral engagement and existing areas of government - to - government cooperation more difficult .

the administration's decision in march 2019 to partially implement title iii of the libertad act along with its use of strong cold war - era political rhetoric toward cuba has provoked a change in cuba's own political rhetoric toward the united states .

the current outlook for positive government - to - government engagement appears dim .

just as there were diverse opinions in the 115 th congress over u.s. policy toward cuba , debate over cuba policy is likely to continue in the 116 th congress , especially with regard to u.s. economic sanctions .

the human rights situation likely will remain a key concern in the future , although there are diverse views regarding the best approach to influence the cuban government .
