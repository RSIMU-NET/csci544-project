presidential establishment of national monuments under the antiquities act of 1906 ( 16 u.s.c .

â§â§431-433 ) has protected valuable sites , but also has been contentious .

president clinton used his authority 22 times to proclaim 19 new monuments and to enlarge 3 others ( see appendix ) .

with one exception , the monuments were designated during president clinton's last year in office , on the assertion that congress had not acted quickly enough to protect federal land .

the establishment of national monuments by president clinton raised concerns , including the authority of the president to create large monuments ; impact on development within monuments ; access to monuments for recreation ; and lack of a requirement for environmental studies and public input in the monument designation process .

lawsuits challenged several of the monuments on various grounds , described below .

the bush administration examined monument actions of president clinton and the interior department is developing management plans for doi - managed monuments .

recent congresses have considered , but not enacted , bills to restrict the president's authority to create monuments and to establish a process for input into monument decisions .

monument supporters assert that changes to the antiquities act are neither warranted nor desirable , courts have supported presidential actions , and segments of the public support such protections .

the antiquities act of 1906 authorizes the president to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain "historic landmarks , historic and prehistoric structures , and other objects of historic or scientific interest. .

the act does not specify particular procedures for creating monuments .

it was a response to concerns over theft and destruction of archaeological sites , and was designed to provide an expeditious means to protect federal lands and resources .

congress later limited the president's authority in wyoming ( 16 u.s.c .

â§431a ) and alaska ( 16 u.s.c .

â§3213 ) .

presidents have designated about 120 national monuments , totaling more than 70 million acres , although most of this acreage is no longer in monument status .

congress has abolished some monuments outright , and converted many more into other designations .

for instance , grand canyon initially was proclaimed a national monument , but was converted into a national park .

congress itself has created monuments on federal lands , and has modified others .

president clinton's 19 new and 3 enlarged monuments comprise about 5.9 million federal acres .

only president franklin delano roosevelt used his authority more oftenâ28 timesâand only president jimmy carter created more monument acreageâ56 million acres in alaska .

various issues regarding presidentially - created monuments have generated both controversy and lawsuits .

issues have included the size of the areas and types of resources protected , the inclusion of non - federal lands within monument boundaries , restrictions on land uses that may result , the manner in which the monuments were created , the selection of the managing agency , and other legal issues .

courts have upheld both particular monuments and the president's authority to create them .

for instance , a court dismissed challenges to clinton monuments which were based on improper delegation of authority by congress ; size ; lack of specificity ; non - qualifying objects ; increased likelihood of harm to resources ; and alleged violations of the national forest management act of 1976 ( nfma , 16 u.s.c .

â§1601 et seq .

 ) , administrative procedure act ( apa , 5 u.s.c .

â§551 et seq .

 ) , and national environmental policy act ( nepa , 42 u.s.c .

â§4321 et seq . ) .

in another case , a court found that plaintiffs did not allege facts sufficient to support the court's inquiry into whether the president might have acted beyond the authority given him in the antiquities act .

the bush administration examined the monument actions of president clinton , including whether to exclude private , state , or other non - federal lands from the boundaries of newly - created monuments .

there has been no comprehensive administration effort to redesignate the monuments with altered boundaries .

while the monument designation does not apply to these non - federal lands , most of president clinton's monument proclamations stated that they will become part of the monument if the federal government acquires title to the lands from the current owners .

also , the interior department continues to develop management plans for new monuments within its jurisdiction .

further , president bush reestablished one monumentâthe governors island national monument in new yorkâon february 7 , 2003 .

legislation to amend the antiquities act of 1906 has not been introduced thus far in the 109 th congress , but was considered in recent congresses .

for instance , h.r .

2386 of the 108 th congress sought to amend the antiquities act to make presidential designations of monuments exceeding 50,000 acres ineffective unless approved by congress within two years .

the measure also would have established a process for public input into presidential monument designations and required monument management plans to be developed in accordance with the national environmental policy act of 1969 .

other legislation in recent congresses has sought to alter particular monuments , for instance , to exclude private land from within their boundaries .
