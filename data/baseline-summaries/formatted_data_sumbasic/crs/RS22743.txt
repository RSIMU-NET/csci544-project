t he issue of health care fraud and abuse has attracted a lot of attention in recent years , primarily because the financial losses attributed to it are estimated to be billions of dollars annually .

considering that the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) is the largest purchaser of health care in the united states , and that medicare and medicaid combined pay about one - third of the nation's health expenditures , it is not surprising that these federal health programs have been considered prime targets for fraudulent activity .

accordingly , efforts to address this fraud and abuse continue to be a priority for congress .

the federal government has an array of statutes that it uses to fight health care fraud .

this report provides a brief overview of some of the key federal statutes , including program - related civil and criminal penalties , the anti - kickback statute , the stark law , and the false claims act , that are used to combat fraud and abuse in federal health care programs .

title xi of the social security act contains medicare and medicaid program - related anti - fraud provisions , which impose penalties and exclusions from federal health care programs on persons who engage in certain types of misconduct .

under section 1128a of the social security act , the office of the inspector general at the department of health and human services ( oig ) is authorized to impose civil penalties and assessments on a person , including an organization , agency , or other entity , who engages in various types of improper conduct with respect to federal health care programs , including the imposition of penalties against a person who knowingly presents or causes to be presented to a federal or state employee or agent certain false or fraudulent claims .

for example , penalties apply to services that were not provided as claimed , or claims that were part of a pattern of providing items or services that a person knows or should know are not medically necessary .

in addition , certain payments made to physicians to reduce or limit services are also prohibited .

this section provides for monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each item or service claimed , up to $50,000 under certain additional circumstances , as well as treble damages .

section 1128b of the social security act provides for criminal penalties involving federal health care programs .

under this section , certain false statements and representations , made knowingly and willfully , are criminal offenses .

for example , it is unlawful to make or cause to be made false statements or representations in either applying for benefits or payments , or determining rights to benefits or payments under a federal health care program .

in addition , persons who conceal any event affecting an individual's right to receive a benefit or payment with the intent to either fraudulently receive the benefit or payment ( in an amount or quantity greater than that which is due ) , or convert a benefit or payment to use other than for the benefit of the person for which it was intended may be criminally liable .

persons who have violated the statute and have furnished an item or service under which payment could be made under a federal health program may be guilty of a felony , punishable by a fine of up to $25,000 , up to five years imprisonment , or both .

other persons involved in connection with the provision of false information to a federal health program may be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to one year .

one of the most severe sanctions available under the social security act is the ability to exclude individuals and entities from participation in federal health care programs .

under section 1128 of the social security act , exclusions from federal health programs are mandatory under certain circumstances , and permissive in others ( i.e. , oig has discretion in whether to exclude an entity or individual ) .

exclusion is mandatory for those convicted of certain offenses , including ( 1 ) a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under medicare , medicaid , or a state health care program ; ( 2 ) a criminal offense relating to neglect or abuse of patients in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service ; or ( 3 ) a felony relating to the unlawful manufacture , distribution , prescription , or dispensing of a controlled substance .

oig has permissive authority to exclude an entity or an individual from a federal health program under numerous circumstances , including conviction of certain misdemeanors relating to fraud , theft , embezzlement , breach of fiduciary duty , or other financial misconduct ; a conviction based on an interference with or obstruction of an investigation into a criminal offense ; and revocation or suspension of a health care practitioner's license for reasons bearing on the individual's or entity's professional competence , professional performance , or financial integrity .

in light of the concern that decisions of health care providers can be improperly influenced by a profit motive , and in order to protect federal health care programs from additional costs and overutilization , congress enacted the anti - kickback statute .

under this criminal statute , it is a felony for a person to knowingly and willfully offer , pay , solicit , or receive anything of value ( i.e. , "remuneration" ) in return for a referral or to induce generation of business reimbursable under a federal health care program .

the statute prohibits both the offer or payment of remuneration for patient referrals , as well as the offer or payment of anything of value in return for purchasing , leasing , ordering , or arranging for , or recommending the purchase , lease , or ordering of any item or service that is reimbursable by a federal health care program .

persons found guilty of violating the anti - kickback statute may be subject to a fine of up to $25,000 , imprisonment of up to five years , and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs for up to one year .

there are certain statutory exceptions to the anti - kickback statute .

under one exception , "remuneration" does not include a discount or other reduction in price obtained by a provider of services or other entity if the reduction in price is properly disclosed and reflected in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider or entity under a federal health care program .

another exception includes , under certain circumstances , amounts paid by a vendor of goods or services to a person authorized to act as a purchasing agent for a group of individuals that furnish services reimbursable by a federal health program .

in addition to these exceptions , the department of health and human services' office of inspector general ( oig ) has promulgated regulations that contain several "safe harbors" to prevent common business arrangements from being considered kickbacks .

safe harbors listed by regulation include certain types of investment interests , personal services and management contracts , referral services , and space rental or equipment rental arrangements .

oig has indicated that the safe harbor provisions are not indicative of the only acceptable business arrangements , and that business arrangements that do not comply with a safe harbor are not necessarily considered "suspect. .

limitations on physician self - referrals were enacted into law in 1989 under the ethics in patient referrals act , commonly referred to as the "stark law. .

the stark law , as amended , and its implementing regulations prohibit certain physician self - referrals for designated health services ( dhs ) that may be paid for by medicare or medicaid .

in its basic application , the stark law provides that if ( 1 ) a physician ( or an immediate family member of a physician ) has a "financial relationship" with an entity , the physician may not make a referral to the entity for the furnishing of designated health services ( dhs ) for which payment may be made under medicare or medicaid , and ( 2 ) the entity may not present ( or cause to be presented ) a claim to the federal health care program or bill to any individual or entity for dhs furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral .

it has been noted that the general idea behind the prohibitions in the stark law is to prevent physicians from making referrals based on financial gain , thus preventing overutilization and increases in health care costs .

a "financial relationship" under the stark law consists of either ( 1 ) an "ownership or investment interest" in the entity or ( 2 ) a "compensation arrangement" between the physician ( or immediate family member ) and the entity .

an "ownership or investment interest" includes "equity , debt , or other means," as well as "an interest in an entity that holds an ownership or investment interest in any entity providing the designated health service. .

a "compensation arrangement" is generally defined as an arrangement involving any remuneration between a physician ( or an immediate family member of such physician ) and an entity , other than certain arrangements that are specifically mentioned as being excluded from the reach of the statute .

the stark law includes a large number of exceptions , which have been added and expanded upon by a series of regulations .

these exceptions may apply to ownership interests , compensation arrangements , or both .

violators of the stark law may be subject to various sanctions , including a denial of payment for relevant services and a required refund of any amount billed in violation of the statute that had been collected .

in addition , civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in medicaid and medicare programs may apply .

a civil penalty not to exceed $15,000 , and in certain cases not to exceed $100,000 , per violation may be imposed if the person who bills or presents the claim "knows or should know" that the bill or claim violates the statute .

the federal false claims act ( fca ) , codified at 31 u.s.c .

sections 3729-3733 , is considered by many to be an important tool for combating fraud against the u.s. government .

the fca is a law of general applicability that is invoked frequently in the health care context .

it has been reported that from january 2009 through the end of the 2015 fiscal year , the justice department used the false claims act to recover more than $16.5 billion in health care fraud cases .

in general , the fca imposes civil liability on persons who knowingly submit a false or fraudulent claim or engage in various types of misconduct involving federal government money or property .

health care program false claims often arise in terms of billing , including billing for services not rendered , billing for unnecessary medical services , double billing for the same service or equipment , or billing for services at a higher rate than provided ( "upcoding" ) .

penalties under the fca include a penalty of $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim filed , plus additional damages .

civil actions may be brought in federal district court under the fca by the attorney general or by a person known as a relator ( i.e. , a "whistleblower" ) , for the person and for the u.s. government , in what is termed a qui tam action .

the ability to initiate a qui tam action has been viewed as a powerful weapon against health care fraud , in that it may be initiated by a private party who may have independent knowledge of any wrongdoing .

popularity of qui tam actions brought under the fca may be attributed partially to the fact that successful whistleblowers can receive between 15% and 30% of the monetary proceeds of the action or settlement that are recovered by the government .
