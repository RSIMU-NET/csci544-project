between 1948 and 1951 , the united states undertook what many consider to be one of its more successful foreign policy initiatives and most effective foreign aid programs .

the marshall plan ( the plan ) and the european recovery program ( erp ) that it generated involved an ambitious effort to stimulate economic growth in a despondent and nearly bankrupt post - world war ii europe , to prevent the spread of communism beyond the "iron curtain," and to encourage development of a healthy and stable world economy .

it was designed to accomplish these goals by achieving three objectives: the expansion of european agricultural and industrial production ; the restoration of sound currencies , budgets , and finances in individual european countries ; and the stimulation of international trade among european countries and between europe and the rest of the world .

it is a measure of the positive impression enduring from the economic recovery program that , ever since , in response to a critical situation faced by some regions of the world or some problem to be solved , there are periodic calls for a new marshall plan .

in the 1990s , some members of congress recommended "marshall plans" for eastern europe , the former soviet union , and the environment .

meanwhile , international statesmen suggested marshall plans for the middle east and south africa .

in the 21 st century , there continue to be recommendations for marshall plan - like assistance programs — for refugees , urban infrastructure , iraq , countries affected by the ebola epidemic , the u.s. - mexican border , greece , and so on .

generally , these references to the memory of the marshall plan are summonses to replicate its success or its scale , rather than every , or any , detail of the original plan .

the replicability of the marshall plan in these diverse situations or in the future is subject to question .

to understand the potential relevance to the present of an event that took place decades ago , it is necessary to understand what the plan sought to achieve , how it was implemented , and its resulting success or failure .

this report looks at each of these factors .

the marshall plan was proposed in a speech by secretary of state george marshall at harvard university on june 5 , 1947 , in response to the critical political , social , and economic conditions in which europe found itself at that time .

recognizing the necessity of congressional participation in development of a significant assistance package , marshall's speech did not present a detailed and concrete program .

he merely suggested that the united states would be willing to help draft a program and would provide assistance "so far as it may be practical for us to do so. .

in addition , marshall called for this assistance to be a joint effort , "initiated" and agreed by european nations .

the formulation of the marshall plan , therefore , was , from the beginning , a work of collaboration between the truman administration and congress , and between the u.s. government and european governments .

the crisis that generated the plan and the legislative and diplomatic outcome of marshall's proposal are discussed below .

assistance to europe was not new with the marshall plan .

in fact , during the 2½ - year period from july 1945 to december 1947 , roughly $11 billion had been provided to europe , compared with the estimated $13 billion in 3½ years of the marshall plan .

two factors that distinguish the marshall plan from its predecessors are that the marshall plan was the result of a thorough planning process and was sharply focused on economic development .

because the earlier , more ad hoc and humanitarian relief - oriented assistance had made little dent on european recovery , a different , coherent approach was put forward .

the new approach called for a concerted program with a definite purpose .

the purpose was european recovery , defined as increased agricultural and industrial production ; restoration of sound currencies , budgets , and finances ; and stimulation of international trade among participating countries and between them and the rest of the world .

the marshall plan , as illustrated in the preceding section , ensured that each technical and financial assistance component contributed as directly as possible to these long - range objectives .

other aspects of its deliberate character were distinctive .

it had definite time and monetary limits .

it was made clear at the start that the u.s. contribution would diminish each year .

in addition to broad objectives , it also supported , by reference to the ceec program in the legislation and , more specifically , in congressional report language , the ambitious quantitative targets assumed by the participating countries .

the marshall plan was also a "joint" effort .

by bringing in european nations as active participants in the program , the united states ensured that their mutual commitment to alter economic policies , a necessity if growth was to be stimulated , would be translated into action and that the objective of integration would be further encouraged .

the marshall plan promoted recognition of the economic interdependence of europe .

by making congress a firm partner in the formulation of the program , the administration ensured continued congressional support for the commitment of large sums over a period of years .

further , the marshall plan was a first recognition by u.s. leaders of the link between economic growth and political stability .

unlike previous postwar aid , which was two - thirds repayable loans and one - third relief supplies , marshall plan aid was almost entirely in the form of grants aimed at productive , developmental purposes .

the reason for this large infusion of grants in peacetime was that u.s. national security had been redefined as containment of communism .

governments whose citizens were unemployed and unfed were unstable and open to communist advancement .

only long - term economic growth could provide stability and , as an added benefit , save the united states from having to continue an endless process of stop - gap relief - based assistance .

the unique nature of the marshall plan is perhaps best emphasized by what replaced it .

the cold war , reinforced by the korean war , signaled the end of the marshall plan by altering the priority of u.s. aid from that of economic stability to military security .

in september 1950 , the eca informed the european participants that henceforth a growing proportion of aid would be allocated for european rearmament purposes .

although originally scheduled to end on june 30 , 1952 , the plan began to wind down in december 1950 when aid to britain was suspended .

in the following months , ireland , sweden , and portugal graduated from the program .

the use of counterpart funds for production purposes was phased out .

to attack inflation , which resulted from the shortage of materials due to the korean war , the eca had begun to release counterpart funds .

in the fourth quarter of 1950 , $1.3 billion was released , two - thirds of which were used in retiring public debt .

under the mutual security act of 1951 and subsequent legislation , although in lesser quantities and in increasing proportions devoted to defense , aid continued to be provided to many european countries .

in the 1952-1953 appropriations , for example , france received $525 million in grants , half of which was for defense support and the other as budget support .

the joint nature of the marshall plan disappeared as national sovereignty came to the fore again .

france insisted on using post - marshall plan counterpart funds as it wished , commingling them with other funds and only later attributing appropriate amounts to certain projects to satisfy american concerns .

to many analysts and policymakers , the effect of the marshall plan policies and programs on the economic and political situation in europe appeared broad and pervasive .

while , in some cases , a direct connection can be drawn between american assistance and a positive outcome , for the most part , the marshall plan may be viewed best as a stimulus which set off a chain of events leading to the accomplishments noted below .

the marshall plan agencies , the eca and oeec , established a number of quantitative standards as their objectives , reflecting some of the broader purposes noted earlier .

the overall production objective of the european recovery program was an increase in aggregate production above prewar ( 1938 ) levels of 30% in industry and 15% in agriculture .

by the end of 1951 , industrial production for all countries was 35% above the 1938 level , exceeding the goal of the program .

however , aggregate agriculture production for human consumption was only 11% above prewar levels and , given a 25 million rise in population during these years , europe was not able to feed itself by 1951 .

viewed in terms of the increase from 1947 , the achievement is more impressive .

industrial production by the end of 1951 was 55% higher than only four years earlier .

participating countries increased aggregate agricultural production by nearly 37% in the three crop - years after 1947-1948 .

total average gnp rose by roughly 33% during the four years of the marshall plan .

the 1948 senate report on the erp authorization had noted a set of production goals that the europeans had set for themselves , goals that they noted "seem optimistic to many american experts. .

the participating countries , for example , had wanted to increase steel production to 55 million tons yearly , 20% above prewar production .

by 1951 , they had achieved 60 million .

it was proposed that oil refining capacity be increased by 2½ times that in 1938 .

in the end , they managed a four - fold increase .

the goal for coal production was 584 million tons , an increase of 30 million over prewar production .

by 1951 , production was still slightly below that of 1938 , but 27% higher than in 1947 .

in 1948 , participating countries could pay for only half of their imports by exporting .

an objective of the erp was to get european countries to the point where they could pay for 83% of their imports in this manner .

although they paid for 70% by exporting in 1938 , the larger ratio was sought under erp because earnings from overseas investment had declined .

even though trade rose substantially , especially among participants , the volume of imports from the rest of the world rose substantially as well , and prices for these imports rose faster than did prices of exports .

as a result , europe continued to be strained .

one obstacle to expansion of exports was breaking into the u.s. and south american markets , where u.s. producers were entrenched .

oeec exports to north america rose from 14% of imports in 1947 to nearly 50% in 1952 .

related to the overall balance of trade was the deficit vi s - a - vis the dollar area , especially the united states .

in 1947 , the total gold and dollar deficit was over $8 billion .

by 1949 , it had dropped to $4.5 billion , by 1952 to half that figure , and by the first half of 1953 had reached an approximate current balance with the dollar area .

in 1949 , the oeec council asked members to take steps to eliminate quantitative import restrictions .

by the end of 1949 , and by february 1951 , 50% and 75% of quota restrictions on imports were eliminated , respectively .

by 1955 , 90% of restrictions were gone .

in 1951 , the oeec set up rules of conduct in trade under the code of liberalization of trade and invisible transactions .

at the end of 1951 , trade volume within europe was almost double that of 1947 .

some benefits of the marshall plan are not easily quantifiable , and some were not direct aims of the program .

many believe that the role of the marshall plan in raising morale in europe was as great a contribution to the prevention of communism and stimulation of growth as any financial assistance .

as the then - director of policy planning at the state department george kennan noted , "the psychological success at the outset was so amazing that we felt that the psychological effect was four - fifths accomplished before the first supplies arrived. .

the united states had a view of itself as a model for the development of europe , with individual countries equated with american states .

as such , u.s. leaders saw a healthy europe as one in which trade restraints and other barriers to interaction , such as the inconvertibility of currencies , would be eliminated .

the european recovery program required coordinated planning for recovery and the establishment of the oeec for this purpose .

in 1949 , the erp authorization act was amended to make it the explicit policy of the united states to encourage the unification of europe .

efforts in support of european integration , integral to the original marshall plan , were strengthened at this time .

to encourage intra - european trade , the eca in its first year went so far as to provide dollars to participating countries to finance their purchase of vitally needed goods available in other participating countries ( even if these were available in the united states ) .

in a step toward encouraging european independence from the dollar standard , it also established an intra - european payments plan whereby dollar grants were made to countries that exported more to europe as a group than they imported , on condition that these creditor countries finance their export balance in their own currencies .

the european payments union ( epu ) , an outgrowth of the payments plan , was established in 1950 by member countries to act as a central clearance and credit system for settlement of all payments transactions among members and associated monetary areas ( such as the sterling area ) .

at eca request , the 1951 congressional authorization withheld funds specifically to encourage the pursuit of this program since successful conclusion of the epu depended on an american financial contribution .

in the end , the united states provided $350 million to help set up the epu and another $100 million to assist it through initial difficulties .

many believe that these and other steps initiated under the erp led to the launching of the european coal and steel community in 1952 and eventually to the european union of today .

perhaps the greatest inducement to the united states in setting up the marshall plan had been the belief that economic hardship in europe would lead to political instability and inevitably to communist governments throughout the continent .

in essence , the erp allowed economic growth and prosperity to occur in europe with fewer political and social costs .

plan assistance allowed recipients to carry a larger import surplus with less strain on the financial system than would be the case otherwise .

it made possible larger investments without corresponding reductions in living standards and could be anti - inflationary by mopping up purchasing power through the sale of imported assistance goods without increasing the supply of money .

the production aspects of the plan also helped relieve hunger among the general population .

human food consumption per capita reached the prewar level by 1951 .

in west germany , economically devastated and besieged by millions of refugees from the east , one house of every five built since 1948 had received marshall plan aid .

perhaps as a result of these benefits , communism in europe was prevented from coming to power via the ballot box .

it is estimated that communist strength in western europe declined by almost one - third between 1946 and 1951 .

in the 1951 elections , the combined pro - western vote was 84% of the electorate .

champions of the marshall plan hold that its authorizing legislation was free of most of the potential restrictions sought by private interests of the sort to later appear in foreign aid programs .

nevertheless , restrictions were enacted that did benefit the united states and u.s. business in particular .

procurement of surplus goods was encouraged under the economic recovery program legislation , while procurement of goods in short supply in the united states was discouraged .

it was required that surplus agriculture commodities be supplied by the united states ; procurement of these was to be encouraged by the eca administrator .

the erp required that 25% of total wheat had to be in the form of flour , and half of all goods had to be carried on american ships .

in the end , an estimated 70% of european purchases using eca dollars were spent in the united states .

types of commodities purchased from the united states included foodstuffs ( grain , dairy products ) , cotton , fuel , industrial and raw materials ( iron and steel , aluminum , copper , lumber ) , and industrial and agricultural machinery .

sugar and nonferrous metals made up the bulk of purchases from outside the united states .

u.s. prestige and power in europe were already strong following world war ii .

in several respects , however , the u.s. role in europe was greatly enhanced by virtue of the marshall plan program .

u.s. private sector economic relations grew substantially during this period as a consequence of the program's encouragement of increased exports from europe and erp grants and loans for the purchase of u.s. goods .

the book value of u.s. investment in europe also rose significantly .

furthermore , while the marshall plan grew out of a recognition of the economic interdependence of the two continents , its implementation greatly increased awareness of that fact .

the oeec , which , in 1961 , became the oecd ( organization for economic co - operation and development ) with the united states as a full member , endured and provided a forum for discussion of economic problems of mutual concern .

finally , the act of u.s. support for europe and the creation of a diplomatic relationship which centered on economic issues in the oeec facilitated the evolution of a relationship centered on military and security issues .

in the view of eca administrator hoffman , the marshall plan made the atlantic alliance ( nato ) possible .

many of the operational methods and programs devised and tested under the marshall plan became regular practices of later development efforts .

for example , the eca was established as an independent agency with a mission in each participating country to ensure close interaction with governments and the private sector , a model later adopted by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .

unlike previous aid efforts , the plan promoted policy reform and used commodity import programs and counterpart funds to ease adoption of those reforms and undertake development programs , a practice of usaid programs in later decades .

the marshall plan also launched the first participant training programs bringing europeans to the united states for training and leveraged private sector investment in recipient countries through the use of u.s. government guaranties .

hundreds of american economists and other specialists who implemented the marshall plan gained invaluable experience that many later applied to their work in developing countries for the eca's successor foreign aid agencies .

not everyone agrees that the marshall plan was a success .

one such appraisal was that marshall plan assistance was unnecessary .

it is , for example , difficult to demonstrate that erp aid was directly responsible for the increase in production and other quantitative achievements noted above .

critics have argued that assistance was never more than 5% of the gnp of recipient nations and therefore could have little effect .

european economies , in this view , were already on the way to recovery before the marshall plan was implemented .

some analysts , pointing out the experimental nature of the plan , agree that the method of aid allocation and the program of economic reforms promoted under it were not derived with scientific precision .

some claim that the dollar gap was not a problem and that lack of economic growth was the result of bad economic policy , resolved when economic controls established during the nazi era were eventually lifted .

even at the time of the marshall plan , there were those who found the program lacking .

if marshall plan aid was going to combat communism , they felt , it would have to provide benefits to the working class in europe .

many believed that the increased production sought by the plan would have little effect on those most inclined to support communism .

in congressional hearings , some members repeatedly sought assurances that the aid was benefiting the working class .

would loans to french factory owners , they asked , lead to higher salaries for employees ? .

journalist theodore h. white was another who questioned this "trickle" ( now called the "trickle down" ) approach to recovery .

"the trickle theory had , thus far," white wrote in 1953 , "resulted in a brilliant recovery of european production .

but it had yielded no love for america and little diminution of communist loyalty where it was entrenched in the misery of the continental workers. .

in addition , many did not want the united states to appear to be assisting colonial rule .

considerable concern was expressed that the aid provided to europe would allow these countries to maintain their colonies in africa and asia .

the switch in emphasis from economic development to military development that began in the third year of the plan was also the subject of criticism , especially in view of the limited time frame originally allowed for the aid program .

a staff member of the senate appropriations committee's special subcommittee on foreign economic cooperation believed that the original intent of the marshall plan could not be accomplished under these conditions .

the tactics employed to achieve marshall plan objectives were often questioned as well .

"much of our effort in france has been contradictory," reported the committee staffer .

"on the one hand we have been working toward the abolition of trade barriers between european countries and on the other we have been fostering , or rebuilding , uneconomic industries which cannot survive unhampered international competition. .

another concern was the proportion of funding that went to the public rather than private sector .

one contemporary writer noted that public investments from the italian counterpart fund obtained twice the amount of assistance as did the private sector in that country .

another analyst has argued that the eca promoted government intervention in the economy .

in the 1950 authorization hearings , u.s. businessmen urged that assistance be provided directly to foreign business rather than through european governments .

only in this way , they said , could free enterprise be promoted in europe .

from its inception , some members of congress voiced fears that the erp would have a negative effect on u.s. business .

some noted that the effort to close the trade gap by encouraging europeans to export and limit their imports would diminish u.s. exports to the region .

amendments , most defeated , were offered to erp legislation to ensure that certain segments of the private sector would benefit from marshall plan aid .

that strengthening europe economically meant increased competition for u.s. business also was not lost on legislators .

the eca , for example , helped europeans rebuild their merchant marine fleets and , by the end of 1949 , had authorized over $167 million in european steel mill projects , most using the more advanced continuous rolling mill process that had previously been little used in europe .

as the congressional "watchdog" committee staff noted , "the eca program involves economic sacrifice either in direct expenditure of federal funds or in readjustments of agriculture and industry to allow for foreign competition. .

in the end , the united states seemed to be willing to make both sacrifices .

the marshall plan was viewed by congress , as well as others , as a "new and far - reaching experiment in foreign relations. .

although in many ways unique to the requirements of its time , analysts have attempted over the years to draw from it various lessons that might possibly be applied to present or future foreign aid initiatives .

these lessons represent what observers believe were some of the primary strengths of the plan: strong leadership and well - developed argument overc a me opposition .

despite growing national isolationism , polls showing little support for the marshall plan , a congress dominated by budget cutters , and an election looming whose outlook was unfavorable to the president , the administration decided it was the right thing to do and led a campaign — with national commissions set up and cabinet members travelling the country — to sell the plan to the american people .

congress was included at the beginning to formulate the program .

because he faced a congress controlled by the opposition party , truman made the european recovery program a cooperative bipartisan creation , which helped garner support and prevented it from becoming bogged down with private - interest earmarks .

congress maintained its active role by conducting detailed hearings and studies on erp implementation .

country ownership ma de reforms sustainable .

the beneficiaries were required to put together the proposal .

because the plan targeted changes in the nature of the european economic system , the united states was sensitive to european national sovereignty .

european cooperation was critical to establishing an active commitment from participants on a wide range of delicate issues .

the collective approach facilitated success .

recovery efforts were framed as a joint endeavor , with the europeans joining together in the ceec to propose the program and the oeec to implement key features , including collaborating to make grant allocation decisions and cooperating to lower trade barriers .

the marshall plan had specific goals .

resources were dedicated to meeting the goals of increased production , trade , and stability .

the marshall plan fit the objective .

in the main , the plan was not a short - term humanitarian relief program .

it was a multiyear plan designed specifically to bring about the economic recovery of europe and avoid the repeated need for relief programs that had characterized u.s. assistance to europe since the war .

the countries to be assisted , for the most part , had the capacity to recover .

they , in fact , were recovering , not developing from scratch .

the human and natural resources necessary for economic growth were largely available ; the chief thing missing was capital .

trade supplemented aid .

aid alone was insufficient to assist europe economically .

a report in october 1949 by the eca and department of commerce found that the united states should purchase as much as $2 billion annually in additional goods if europe was to balance its trade by the close of the recovery program .

efforts to increase intra - european trade , such as funding the european payments union , were meant to bolster bilateral efforts .

parochial congressional tendencies to put restrictions on the program on behalf of u.s. business were kept under control for the good of the program .

american businessmen , for example , were not happy that the eca insisted europeans purchase what was available first in europe using soft currency before turning to the united states .

technical assistance , including exchanges , while inexpensive relative to capital block grants , may have a significant impact on economic growth .

under the marshall plan , technical assistance helped draw attention to the management and labor factors hindering productivity .

it demonstrated american know - how and helped develop in europe a positive feeling regarding america .

the long - term foreign policy value of foreign assistance cannot be adequately measured in terms of short - term consequences .

the marshall plan continues to have an impact: in nato , the oecd , the european community , the german marshall fund , in european bilateral aid donor programs , and in the stability and prosperity of modern europe .

although many disparate elements of marshall plan assistance speak to the present , the circumstances faced now by most other parts of the world are so different and more complex than those encountered by western europe in the period 1948-1952 that the solution posed for one is not entirely applicable to the other .

as noted earlier , calls for new marshall plans have continued ever since the first , but the first was unique , and today's proposals share little detail with their predecessor apart from the suggestion that a problem should be solved with the same concentrated energies , if not funds , applied decades ago .

even if there exist countries whose needs are similar in nature to what the marshall plan provided , the position of the united states has changed since the late 1940s as well .

the roughly $13.3 billion provided by the united states to 16 nations over a period of less than four years equals an estimated $143 billion in 2017 currency .

that sum surpasses the amount of development and humanitarian assistance the united states provided from all sources to 212 countries and numerous international development organizations and banks in the four - year period 2013-2016 ( $138 billion in 2017 dollars ) .

in 1948 , when the united states appropriated $4 billion for the first year of the marshall plan , outlays for the entire federal budget equaled slightly less than $30 billion .

for the united states to be willing to expend 13% of its budget on any one program ( versus 0.8% in fy2016 for foreign assistance ) , congress and the president would have to agree that the activity was a major national priority .

nevertheless , in pondering the difficulties of new marshall plans , it is perhaps worth considering the views of the eca administrator , paul hoffman , who noted 20 years after secretary marshall's historic speech that even though the plan was "one of the most truly generous impulses that has ever motivated any nation anywhere at any time," the united states "derived enormous benefits from the bread it figuratively cast upon the international waters. .

in hoffman's view: today , the united states , its former partners in the marshall plan and — in fact — all other advanced industrialized countries ... are being offered an even bigger bargain: the chance to form an effective partnership for world - wide economic and social progress with the earth's hundred and more low - income nations .

the potential profits in terms of expanded prosperity and a more secure peace could dwarf those won through the european recovery program .

yet the danger that this bargain will be rejected out of apathy , indifference , and discouragement over the relatively slow progress toward self - sufficiency made by the developing countries thus far is perhaps even greater than was the case with the marshall plan .

for the whole broadscale effort of development assistance to the world's poorer nations — an effort that is generally , but i think quite misleadingly , called "foreign aid" — has never received the full support it merits and is now showing signs of further slippage in both popular and governmental backing .

under these circumstances , the study of the marshall plan's brief but brilliantly successful history is much more than an academic exercise .
