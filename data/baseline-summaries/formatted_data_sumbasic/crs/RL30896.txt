ever since communist north vietnamese forces defeated u.s. - backed south vietnam in 1975 , reunified vietnam has been struggling with how to maintain a balance between two often contradictory goals — maintaining ideological purity and promoting economic development .

for the first decade after reunification , the emphasis was on the former .

by the mid - 1980s , disastrous economic conditions led the country to adopt a more pragmatic line , enshrined in the doi moi ( renovation ) economic reforms of 1986 .

under doi moi , the government gave farmers greater control over what they produce , abandoned central state planning , cut subsidies to state enterprises , reformed the price system , and opened the country to foreign direct investment .

the state of vietnam's worker rights conditions has become part of the debate over whether congress should approve the vietnam - u.s. bta , which does not contain provisions that explicitly deal with labor rights .

the linkage between labor rights and the bta would have become even more contentious if the bush administration had followed up on its proposal to bundle the bta into a broad - based trade bill that would also include a u.s. - jordan free trade agreement and new negotiating authority ( also known as "fast track" or "trade promotion authority" ) for the president to negotiate new multilateral trade agreements .

workers' rights — along with environmental conditions — will likely be prominent in the debates over both the jordan agreement and trade promotion authority .

they are also likely to loom large in the debate over the merits of a bilateral textile agreement , which the u.s. and vietnam are likely to negotiate in the next year .

many proponents of linking labor rights and trade agreements have argued that congress should not pass the bta until vietnam's labor conditions improve further .

some labor rights advocates contend that globalization occasionally has weakened vietnam's labor rights regime in the textile and apparel industries ; at times , textile multinationals and industrialized governments have pushed the vietnamese government — against the wishes of the vgcl — to relax its enforcement of certain provisions of the labor code .

other labor rights advocates argue that while congress should pass the vietnam - u.s. bta , it should do so only after the signing of a textile and apparel agreement that includes conditions on labor rights along the lines of the provisions of the cambodia - u.s. textile agreement .

that agreement , which was signed in january 1999 , is designed to reward improvements in labor rights with increased access to the u.s. textile and apparel market .

the agreement establishes annual quota levels , which can be increased by up to 14% each year if the u.s. determines that worker rights in the cambodian textile sector "substantially comply" with "international recognized core labor standards" and cambodian labor laws .

opponents of linking the vietnam - u.s. bta to improvements in labor conditions contend that obtaining mfn status will indirectly help improve vietnamese labor conditions .

by promoting economic development , they argue , the bta will provide vietnamese workers with more opportunities , increased knowledge , and improved means to promote their rights .

foreign investment , which is likely to increase if the bta is passed , is also thought by some to raise working conditions generally by bringing in multinational corporations that pay higher wages and have better health and safety conditions than do local enterprises .

finally , supporters of unconditional passage of the bta argue that the agreement will improve labor rights by promoting the rule of law in vietnam .

for instance , they point out that the bta requires vietnam to publicize in advance most business - related laws and regulations , a move that should enhance the transparency of the country's legal regime .
