congress periodically establishes agricultural and food policy in an omnibus farm bill .

following nearly three years of debate , congress completed action in february 2014 on the most recent farm bill ( the agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-78 ) , which succeeded the expired food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( 2008 farm bill , p.l .

110-246 ) .

the 2014 farm bill establishes policy for the next five years in its 12 titles , covering farm commodity price and income support , crop insurance , conservation , domestic food assistance , agricultural trade and international food aid , credit , rural development , research , horticulture , forestry , and bioenergy , among others .

periodic farm bills provide congress , the administration , and interest groups with an opportunity to reexamine agriculture and food issues more carefully , and address them more comprehensively .

within the various titles of the enacted 2014 farm bill are provisions that reshape the structure of farm commodity support , expand crop insurance coverage , consolidate conservation programs , reauthorize and revise nutrition assistance , and extend authority to appropriate funds for many u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) discretionary programs through fy2018 .

many provisions of the previous farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) expired in 2012 , but were extended for an additional year in the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 , the fiscal cliff bill ) .

the 112 th congress began work on a new farm bill but did not complete action before the conclusion of the congress , requiring new bills to be introduced in the 113 th congress .

the house and senate agriculture committees marked up their respective bills in may 2013 and floor action was completed in the summer months .

a conference agreement was reached in late january 2014 ; it was approved by both chambers within eight days and was signed into law as the agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-79 ) on february 7 , 2014 .

the senate agriculture committee reported its version of the 2013 omnibus farm bill on may 14 , 2013 ( s. 954 , the agriculture reform , food and jobs act of 2013 ) , by a vote of 15-5 .

floor action began during the week of may 20 , 2013 , and concluded on june 10 , 2013 , when the full senate approved the measure by a vote of 66-27 .

while the bill was being debated in the senate , approximately nine amendments were adopted and six were rejected .

attempts to modify the sugar program , further limit snap spending , eliminate crop insurance subsidies for tobacco , and require the labeling of genetically engineered foods were all defeated .

more than 200 other amendments were offered to the senate bill , but were not considered , when an agreement could not be reached on consolidating the amendments and limiting floor debate .

on may 15 , 2013 , the house agriculture committee completed markup of its version of the bill ( h.r .

1947 , the federal agriculture reform and risk management act of 2013 ) and approved the revised measure by a 36-10 vote .

the bill was subsequently referred to the house judiciary committee , which revised the bill to ensure that certain dairy programs were subject to standard rulemaking procedures .

floor action on the house bill was conducted during the week of june 17 , 2013 , when numerous amendments were adopted to the committee bill .

however , the amended bill was defeated by a vote of 195-234 on june 20 .

three weeks later , the full house debated a variation of the defeated bill that dropped all of the nutrition title but included all of the earlier adopted floor amendments to the other titles .

this revised bill ( h.r .

2642 ) was approved by the house by a 216-208 vote on july 11 .

in order to initiate conference committee negotiations with the house , the senate on july 18 substituted the text of h.r .

2642 with the text of s. 954 .

on september 19 , the house passed a stand - alone nutrition bill ( h.r .

3102 ) by a vote of 217-210 .

the house adopted a resolution ( h.res .

361 ) on september 28 that combined the texts of h.r .

2642 and h.r .

3102 into one bill ( h.r .

2642 ) for purposes of resolving differences with the senate .

a conference agreement reconciling the differences between the two measures was reported as the agricultural act of 2014 ( h.rept .

113-333 ) on january 27 , 2014 .

within eight days , both chambers approved the conference agreement , the house on january 29 by a vote of 251-166 and the senate on february 4 by a vote of 68-32 .

the president signed it into law ( p.l .

113-79 ) on february 7 , 2014 .

this report begins with a brief overview of the estimated budgetary impact of the 2014 farm bill , followed by a summary comparison of the major provisions of each title .

a side - by - side section comprehensively compares all of the provisions in p.l .

113-79 to senate and house versions of the farm bill — including s. 954 as passed by the senate ( also referred to as the senate amendment to h.r .

2642 ) and the house - passed version of h.r .

2642 ( which includes the provisions of h.r .

3102 as a new title iv to h.r .

2642 ) — as well as to relevant provisions in then - current law .

the "prior law / policy" column of the side - by - side tables reflects the provisions of the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 ) , which extended most of the 2008 farm bill provisions for an additional year , as well as other relevant statutes that are revised by the 2014 farm bill .

the budgetary impact of the 2014 farm bill is measured relative to what the prior farm bill would have spent had it been continued .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projected that the mandatory programs of the 2008 farm bill would have cost $973 billion if continued for the next 10 years ( fy2014-fy2023 ) .

this "baseline" already had been reduced by $6.4 billion to reflect the effects of sequestration over the 10-year baseline .

compared to this post - sequestration baseline , the 2014 farm bill ( p.l .

113-79 ) reduces projected spending and the deficit by $16.6 billion ( - 1.7% ) over 10 years .

 ( the five - year reduction through fy2018 is $5.4 billion from a five - year baseline of $494 billion. ) .

p.l .

113-79 saves less than either the house - passed or senate - passed proposals .

the house - passed combination of h.r .

2642 and h.r .

3102 together would have reduced spending by $51.9 billion ( - 5.3% ) over 10 years .

the senate - passed farm bill proposal ( s. 954 ) would have reduced spending by $17.9 billion ( - 1.8% ) over 10 years .

if the baseline had not already been reduced by sequestration , the enacted 2014 farm bill could have been credited for reducing spending by $23 billion over 10 years .

similarly , the savings from each of the house and senate proposals could have been $6.4 billion greater .

but sequestration had already been factored into the baseline , so the official score of p.l .

113-79 remains as savings of $16.6 billion over 10 years .

the net reduction is composed of some titles receiving more funding than in the past , while other titles provide offsets , some of which contributes to deficit reduction .

the titles for farm commodity subsidies , nutrition , and conservation provide budgetary savings .

the titles for crop insurance , research , bioenergy , horticulture , rural development , trade , forestry , and miscellaneous items receive additional funding .

the final 2014 farm bill is projected to spend $956 billion over the next 10 years , of which $756 billion is for nutrition assistance and $200 billion is for the agriculture portion .

 ( the five - year total is $489 billion , with $391 billion for nutrition and $98 billion for the agriculture portion ) .

within the agriculture portion , crop insurance outlays are projected to be $90 billion over the next 10 years , $58 billion for conservation , and $44 billion for farm commodity programs ( title i ) .

the trade title is projected to spend $3.6 billion over the next 10 years , horticulture $1.7 billion , research $1.3 billion , and bioenergy $1.1 billion .

figure 1 illustrates the budgetary impacts of changes to each title in each bill .

the table contains the data in tabular form and includes an estimate of the projected outlays .
