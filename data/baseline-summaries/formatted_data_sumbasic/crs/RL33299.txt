child nutrition programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women,infants , and children ( the wic program ) are governed by three basic federal laws: ( 1 ) the richard b. russell national school lunch act .

this law was originallyenacted in 1946 as the national school lunch act ; it was renamed in 1999 .

it provides authorityfor the school lunch program , the child and adult care food program , the summer food serviceprogram , after - school programs ( those run under both the aegis of the school lunch program andthe child and adult care food program ) , food commodity support for child nutrition programs,training and technical assistance ( including the food service management institute ) , compliance,program integrity , and accountability activities , and an information clearinghouse .

it also includesa number of general - purpose provisions governing the operation of multiple child nutrition programs ( eg , income eligibility and inflation indexing rules , nutrition requirements for meals , general rulesparticipating schools must follow ) .

the child nutrition act .

it alsoincludes additional authority ( to that in the richard b. russell national school lunch act ) andfunding for the acquisition of food commodities for distribution to child nutrition programs ( section32 money is used to buy and distribute surplus commodities ) .

 ( 2 ) prior to the 108th congress , the most recent comprehensive amendments to child nutritionand wic law were made by the 1998 william f. goodling child nutrition reauthorization act ( p.l.105-336 ) .

 ( 3 ) and , underthe reauthorization schedule , the next wide - ranging review of child nutrition and wic programs wasset for 2003 .

however , a number of significant laws affecting the child nutrition and wic programswere enacted in the 106th and 107th congresses ( 1999 through 2002 ) .

these are covered in theimmediate predecessor to this report - - crs report rl31578 ( pdf ) , child nutrition and wic legislationin the 106th and 107th congresses , by [author name scrubbed] .

only one significant law governing child nutrition programs ( eg , school mealprograms ) and the wic program has been ( or is likely to be ) enacted in the 108th and 109thcongresses - - the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-265 ; signed on june 30 , 2004 ) .
