between 1969 and 1999 , almost 3,500 people died as a result of political violence in northern ireland , which is a part of the united kingdom ( uk ) .

the conflict , often referred to as "the troubles," has its origins in the 1921 division of ireland ( see map in figure 1 ) .

at its core , the conflict reflects a struggle between different national , cultural , and religious identities .

protestants in northern ireland ( 48% of the population ) largely define themselves as british and support northern ireland's continued incorporation in the uk ( unionists ) .

catholics in northern ireland ( 45% of the population ) consider themselves irish , and many catholics desire a united ireland ( nationalists ) .

in the past , more militant unionists ( loyalists ) and more militant nationalists ( republicans ) were willing to use force and resort to violence to achieve their goals .

the troubles were sparked in late 1968 , when a civil rights movement was launched in northern ireland mostly by catholics , who had long faced discrimination in areas such as electoral rights , housing , and employment .

this civil rights movement was met with violence by some unionists , loyalists , and the police , which in turn prompted armed action by nationalists and republicans .

increasing chaos and escalating violence led the uk government to deploy the british army on the streets of northern ireland in 1969 and to impose direct rule from london in 1972 ( between 1920 and 1972 , northern ireland had its own regional government at stormont , outside belfast ) .

for years , the uk and irish governments sought to facilitate a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in northern ireland .

multiparty talks began in june 1996 , led by former senate majority leader george mitchell , who was serving as u.s. president bill clinton's special adviser on ireland .

after many ups and downs , the uk and irish governments and the northern ireland political parties participating in the peace talks announced an agreement on april 10 , 1998 .

this accord became known as the good friday agreement ( for the day on which it was concluded ) ; it is also known as the belfast agreement .

despite the significant decrease in the levels of violence since the good friday agreement , implementation of the peace accord has been challenging .

tensions persist among northern ireland's political parties and between the unionist and nationalist communities more broadly .

northern ireland remains a largely divided society and continues to grapple with a number of issues in its search for peace and reconciliation .

sectarian differences flare periodically , and addressing northern ireland's legacy of violence ( often termed dealing with the past ) is particularly controversial .

many analysts assess that peace and security in northern ireland is fragile .

the uk's withdrawal from the european union ( eu ) in january 2020âor brexit âhas added to divisions within northern ireland .

brexit poses new challenges for northern ireland's peace process and economy and has renewed questions about northern ireland's constitutional status as part of the uk .

successive u.s .

administrations and many members of congress have actively supported the northern ireland peace process and encouraged the full implementation of the good friday agreement , as well as subsequent accords and initiatives to further the peace process and promote long - term reconciliation .

some members have been particularly interested in police reforms and human rights in northern ireland .

since 1986 , the united states has provided development aid through the international fund for ireland ( ifi ) as a means to encourage economic development and foster reconciliation .

some members of congress also have demonstrated an interest in how brexit might affect northern ireland in the years ahead .

many analysts view implementation of the most important aspects of the good friday agreement as complete .

since 2013 , however , the northern ireland political parties and the uk and irish governments have made several attempts to reduce sectarian tensions and promote reconciliation .

major endeavors include the following: the 2013 haass initiative .

in 2013 , the northern ireland executive appointed former u.s. diplomat and special envoy for northern ireland richard haass as the independent chair of interparty talks aimed at tackling some of the most divisive issues in northern ireland society .

in particular , haass was tasked with making recommendations on dealing with the past and the sectarian issues of parading , protests , and the use of flags and emblems .

in december 2013 , haass released a draft proposal outlining the way forward in these areas , but he was unable to broker a final agreement among the northern ireland political parties .

the 2014 stormont house agreement .

in 2014 , financial pressures and budgetary disputes related to uk - wide welfare reforms and austerity measures tested northern ireland's devolved government .

the uk and irish governments convened interparty talks to address government finances and governing structures , as well as the issues previously tackled by the haass initiative .

in the resulting december 2014 stormont house agreement , the northern ireland political parties agreed to support welfare reform ( with certain mitigating measures ) , balance the budget , address northern ireland's heavy reliance on the public sector , and reduce the size of the assembly and the number of executive departments to improve efficiency and cut costs .

the agreement also included measures on parading , flags , and dealing with the past .

continued disagreements over welfare reform between the dup and sinn fein , however , stalled implementation of all aspects of the stormont house agreement .

the 2015 fresh start agreement .

in november 2015 , the uk and irish governments , the dup , and sinn fein reached a new fresh start agreement .

like the stormont house agreement , the accord focused on implementing welfare reform and improving the stability and sustainability of northern ireland's budget and governing institutions .

it confirmed a reduction in the size of the assembly from 108 to 90 members ( effective from the first assembly election after the may 2016 election ) , decreased the number of executive departments , and made provision for an official opposition in the assembly .

the fresh start agreement also included provisions on parading and the use of flags , but the parties were unable to reach final agreement on establishing new institutions to deal with the past .

in addition , the fresh start agreement addressed ongoing concerns about paramilitary activity , sparked by the arrest of a senior sinn fein official in connection to the august 2015 murder of an ex - ira member .

despite a much - improved security situation since the 1998 good friday agreement , concerns linger about the stability of the devolved government and the fragility of community relations .

as noted previously , the devolved government led by the dup and sinn fein collapsed in january 2017 amid heightened tensions related to brexit and other issues .

it took nearly three years following the march 2017 snap assembly elections to reestablish the devolved government .

the search for peace and reconciliation remains challenging .

difficult issues include bridging sectarian divisions and managing key sticking points ( especially parading , protests , and the use of flags and emblems ) ; dealing with the past ; addressing remaining paramilitary concerns and curbing dissident activity ; and furthering economic development .

the 2013 haass initiative , the 2014 stormont house agreement , and the 2015 fresh start agreement attempted to tackle some aspects of these long - standing challenges .

some measures agreed in these successive accords were delayed amid the absence of a devolved government between 2017 and 2020 .

the uk exited the eu on january 31 , 2020 .

in the uk's june 2016 public referendum on eu membership , voters in northern ireland favored remaining in the eu , 56% to 44% ( the uk overall voted in favor of leaving , 52% to 48% ) .

brexit has added to divisions within northern ireland and poses considerable challenges , with potential implications for northern ireland's peace process , economy , and , in the longer term , constitutional status .

successive u.s .

administrations have viewed the good friday agreement as the best framework for a lasting peace in northern ireland .

the clinton administration was instrumental in helping the parties forge the agreement , and the george w. bush administration strongly backed its full implementation .

u.s. officials welcomed the end to the ira's armed campaign in 2005 and the restoration of the devolved government in 2007 .

the obama administration remained engaged in the peace process .

in october 2009 , then - u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton visited northern ireland , addressed the assembly , and urged northern ireland's leaders to reach an agreement on devolving policing and justice powers .

in february 2010 , president obama welcomed the resulting hillsborough agreement .

in june 2013 , president obama visited northern ireland and noted that the united states would always "stand by" northern ireland .

the obama administration welcomed the conclusion of both the december 2014 stormont house agreement and the november 2015 fresh start agreement .

like its predecessors , the trump administration has offered support and encouragement to northern ireland .

in march 2017 , vice president mike pence noted that , "the advance of peace and prosperity in northern ireland is one of the great success stories of the past 20 years. .

in november 2017 , a u.s. state department spokesperson expressed regret at the impasse in discussions to restore northern ireland's power - sharing institutions and asserted that the united states remained "ready to support efforts that ensure full implementation of the good friday agreement and subsequent follow - on cross - party agreements. .

on march 6 , 2020 , president trump appointed his former acting chief of staff mick mulvaney as u.s. special envoy to northern ireland ; leaders in northern ireland and ireland welcomed mulvaney's appointment .

many members of congress have actively supported the northern ireland peace process for decades .

over the last several years , congressional hearings have focused on the implementation of the good friday agreement , policing reforms , and human rights in northern ireland .

some members have been interested in the status of public inquiries into several past murders in northern ireland in which collusion between the security forces and paramilitary groups is suspectedâincluding the 1989 slaying of belfast attorney patrick finucane and the 1997 killing of raymond mccord , jr .

some members also urged the trump administration to name a special envoy for northern ireland to signal continued u.s. commitment to the region .

on the economic front , the united states is a key trading partner and an important source of investment for northern ireland .

according to statistics from the northern ireland executive , in 2017 , exports to the united states accounted for 17% of total northern ireland exports , and imports from the united states accounted for 10% of total northern ireland imports .

foreign direct investment by u.s. - based companies totaled â£1.8 billion ( about $2.5 billion ) between 2008 and 2018 .

between 2009 and 2011 , a special u.s. economic envoy to northern ireland worked to further economic ties between the united states and northern ireland and to underpin the peace process by promoting economic prosperity .

since 2016 , president trump has repeatedly expressed his support for brexit .

the trump administration also backs a future u.s. - uk free trade agreement post - brexit .

in a september 2019 visit to ireland , vice president pence reiterated the administration's support for brexit but asserted that the united states recognizes the "unique challenges" posed by the irish border and "will continue to encourage the united kingdom and ireland to ensure that any brexit respects the good friday agreement. .

at the same time , vice president pence urged ireland and the eu to reach a brexit withdrawal agreement that "respects the united kingdom's sovereignty," which many irish commentators viewed as indicating a limited understanding of brexit's potential implications for both northern ireland and ireland .

some members of congress have demonstrated an interest in how brexit might affect northern ireland and expressed continued support for the good friday agreement .

although many members back a future u.s. - uk free trade agreement post - brexit , some members also have tied their support to protecting the northern ireland peace process .

in april 2019 , house speaker nancy pelosi said there would be "no chance whatsoever" for a u.s. - uk trade agreement if brexit were to weaken the northern ireland peace process .

on october 22 , 2019 , the house foreign affairs committee's subcommittee on europe , eurasia , energy , and the environment held a hearing titled "protecting the good friday agreement from brexit. .

on december 3 , 2020 , the house passed h.res .

585 , reaffirming support for the good friday agreement in light of brexit and asserting that any future u.s. - uk trade agreement and other u.s. - uk bilateral agreements must include conditions to uphold the peace accord .

other members of congress have not directly tied their support for a bilateral u.s. - uk free trade agreement to protecting northern ireland post - brexit .

the united states has provided development aid to northern ireland primarily through the international fund for ireland ( ifi ) , which was created in 1986 .

the uk and irish governments established the ifi based on objectives in the anglo - irish agreement of 1985 , but the ifi is an independent entity .

it supports economic regeneration and social development projects in areas most affected by the conflict in northern ireland and in the border areas of the republic of ireland ; in doing so , the ifi has sought to foster dialogue and reconciliation .

the united states has contributed more than $540 million since the ifi's establishment , roughly half of total ifi funding .

the eu , canada , australia , and new zealand have provided funding for the ifi as well .

in the 1980s and 1990s , u.s. appropriations for the ifi averaged around $23 million annually ; in the 2000s , u.s. appropriations averaged $18 million each year .

according to the ifi , the vast majority of projects it has supported with seed funding have been located in disadvantaged areas that have suffered from high unemployment , a lack of facilities , and little private sector investment .

in its first two decades , ifi projects in northern ireland and the southern border counties focused on economic and business development and sectors such as tourism , agriculture , and technology .

in 2006 , the ifi announced it would begin shifting its focus toward projects aimed at promoting community reconciliation and overcoming past divisions .

successive u.s .

administrations and many members of congress have backed the ifi as a means to promote economic development and encourage divided communities to work together .

support for paramilitary and dissident groups in northern ireland traditionally has been strongest in communities with high levels of unemployment and economic deprivation .

thus , many observers have long viewed the creation of jobs and economic opportunity as a key part of resolving the conflict in northern ireland and have supported the ifi as part of the peace process .

many u.s. officials and members of congress also encouraged the ifi to place greater focus on reconciliation activities and were pleased with the ifi's decision to do so in 2006 .

at the same time , some critics have questioned the ifi's effectiveness , viewing certain ifi projects as largely wasteful and unlikely to bridge community divides in any significant way .

in fy2011 , amid the u.s. economic and budget crisis , some members of congress began to call for an end to u.s. funding for the ifi as part of a raft of budget - cutting measures .

some members asserted that u.s. contributions to the ifi were no longer necessary given ireland and northern ireland's improved political and economic situation ( relative to what it was in the 1980s ) .

in the final fy2011 continuing budget resolution ( p.l .

112-10 ) , congress did not specify an allocation for the ifi ( and has not done so in successive fiscal years ) .

since fy2011 , however , the obama and trump administrations have continued to allocate funds from economic support fund ( esf ) resources to the ifi in the form of a grant for specific ifi activities to support peace and reconciliation programs .

the obama administration provided $2.5 million per year between fy2011 and fy2014 and $750,000 per year in fy2015 and fy2016 from esf funding .

the trump administration provided $750,000 per year from esf funding to the ifi in fy2017 and fy2018 .
