funding for the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) , including the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) , is provided in the annual energy and water development ( e&w ) appropriations bill .

eere supports renewable energy and end - use energy efficiency technology research , development , and implementation .

the funding level congress decides to provide for fy2018 could impact goals set by eere and priorities identified in the administration's fy2018 budget request .

president trump submitted his fy2018 budget request to congress on may 23 , 2017 .

the budget requests $28.2 billion for doe , a decrease of nearly $3 billion , or 9.5% , from the fy2017 enacted level .

nearly half of the reduction ( $1.5 billion ) in the doe budget request would come from eere programs .

the request specifies two eere program eliminations: the weatherization assistance program and the state energy program .

the funding level congress provides could affect continued support for these programs and other efforts within eere including sustainable transportation , renewable energy , and energy efficiency .

this report discusses the fy2018 eere budget request and the proposed eere funding levels and priorities in the related e&w appropriations bills .

it does not discuss the opportunities , challenges , economic value , or commercial status of the various renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives selected by eere , nor does it delve into the goals of the individual eere programs or congressional oversight of certain eere issues .

eere leads the doe's effort to support research , accelerate development , and facilitate deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies .

eere is led by the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy , and it is organized into four offices: office of transportation , office of renewable power , office of energy efficiency , and office of operations .

eere contends that it invests in what it considers to be the highest - impact activities .

the office collaborates with industry , academia , national laboratories , and others to develop technology - specific road maps and then focuses funding on early stage research and development ( r&d ) , technology validation and risk - reduction activities , and the reduction of barriers to the adoption of market - ready new technologies .

eere also manages a portfolio of research and development programs that support state and local governments , tribes , and schools .

in addition , eere oversees the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) — the only national laboratory solely dedicated to researching and developing renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies .

eere funding is provided from the annual e&w appropriations bill .

during the last several years of the obama administration , the budget request sought to increase funding to support eere programs and objectives .

congress provided funding at levels lower than the request .

appropriations for eere have averaged $2.0 billion annually for the last three years in current dollars ( see table 1 ) .

doe categorizes eere funding into four major categories: sustainable transportation , energy efficiency , renewable energy , and corporate support ( eg , program administration ) .

from fy2015 to fy2017 , approximately 30% of eere appropriations supported sustainable transportation , 35% went to energy efficiency , 23% went to renewable energy , and 12% went to corporate support .

president trump submitted his fy2018 budget request to congress on may 23 , 2017 .

the budget requests $28.2 billion for doe , a decrease of nearly $3 billion , or 9.5% , from the fy2017 enacted level .

nearly half of the reduction ( $1.45 billion ) in the doe budget request comes from eere programs .

the eere request of $636 million is a nearly 70% decrease from fy2017 .

according to the budget request , funding for eere would focus on "early - stage r&d , where the federal role is critically important , and reflects an increased reliance on the private sector to fund later - stage research , development , and commercialization of energy technologies. .

for fy2018 , the bulk of the eere request would be split among three areas: about 29% for sustainable transportation programs , 25% for energy efficiency programs , and 21% for renewable energy programs .

under the request , funding for both the office of sustainable transportation and office of renewable power would decrease by 70% from fy2017 enacted levels .

the office of energy efficiency would see funding decrease by 79% from fy2017 enacted levels , and funding for corporate support would decrease by 18% .

the budget request specifies two eere program eliminations: the weatherization assistance program and the state energy program , which received fy2017 appropriations of $225 million and $50.0 million , respectively .

the request would reduce eere funded full - time equivalents ( fte ) by approximately 30% .

some of the goals , highlights , and major changes presented in the eere fy2018 request , as reported by doe , are discussed below .

the house appropriations committee reported its version of the fy2018 energy and water development appropriations bill with a manager's amendment by voice vote on july 12 , 2017 .

the bill would provide funding for eere of $1.1 billion — $1.0 billion below fy2017 and $449 million above the administration request ( h.r .

3266 ) .

h.r .

3266 was incorporated as division d of h.r .

3219 , the defense , military construction , veterans affairs , legislative branch , and energy and water development national security appropriations act , 2018 ( also referred to as the make america secure appropriations act , 2018 ) .

the house passed h.r .

3219 on july 27 , 2017 .

h.r .

3219 was received in the senate on july 31 , 2017 .

the senate committee on appropriations reported its version of the fy2018 energy and water appropriations bill , s. 1609 , on july 20 , 2017 .

s. 1609 would provide $1.9 billion for eere — $153 million below the fy2017 level and $1.3 billion above the administration request ( s.rept .

115-132 ) .

the president signed p.l .

115-56 , continuing appropriations act , 2018 and supplemental appropriations for disaster relief requirements act , 2017 on september 8 , 2017 , providing appropriations at the fy2017 level through december 8 , 2017 .

there are several eere issues before the 115 th congress .

concerns may include not only the level of eere appropriations for fy2018 , but also which activities eere should support .

congress might consider whether the goals of eere can be met with the proposed funding cuts in the administration's request , or whether to limit the scope of federal r&d activities .

the issues described in this section — listed approximately in the order they appear in the energy and water development appropriations bills — were selected based on the total funding involved , the percentage increases or decreases proposed by the administration , and their possible impact on broader public policy considerations .

for h.r .

3219 , the funding levels for specific offices and programs are those specified in h.rept .

115-230 , the report accompanying h.r .

3266 , which reported $1.104 billion in total funding for eere .

the house - passed version of h.r .

3219 would provide $1.086 billion for eere , $18.4 million less than the committee - reported bill .

it is unclear how this reduction would be implemented .

for s. 1609 , the funding levels for specific offices and programs are those that are in s.rept .

115-132 , the report accompanying the committee - passed version of the bill .

the reported funding levels are consistent with the total funding for eere that would be provided in the senate committee bill .

according to the budget request , funding for eere would focus on "early - stage r&d," and would result in a decrease of nearly 70% for eere programs .

the two appropriation bills before congress — h.r .

3219 and s. 1609 — address the administration's request for eere to focus on "early - stage r&d" in different ways .

according to h.rept .

115-230 , the report accompanying h.r .

3266 , the house appropriations bill reflects "a gradual shift towards early stage research and development activities," and includes "a limited scope of deployment activities. .

the appropriation recommendation in s. 1609 affirms "the importance of the development and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies , which are critical to expanding u.s. energy security and global leadership. .

both statements are supported with proposed appropriations that would fund most eere programs at levels above the administration's request .

both h.r .

3219 and s. 1609 would provide appropriations for fy2018 above the administration's request of $184 million for sustainable transportation .

h.r .

3219 would appropriate $268 million for sustainable transportation in fy2018 , while s. 1609 would appropriate $553 million .

both appropriations reports also express continued support for the following programs within vehicle technologies that the administration's request would terminate: supertruck ii , the clean cities program , and efforts to reduce energy consumption of the commercial off - road vehicle sector .

h.r .

3219 would support these and other projects within vehicle technologies at $125 million , while s. 1609 would provide approximately $278 million .

h.r .

3219 and s. 1609 both recommend appropriations for fy2018 above the administration's request of $134 million for renewable energy .

h.r .

3219 would appropriate nearly $190 million , while s. 1609 would appropriate nearly $390 million .

both bills would provide support for later - stage r&d and deployment projects in contrast to the administration's request .

for solar energy , both the house bill and senate committee bill support research in thin - film photovoltaics .

h.r .

3219 would also encourage access to solar energy for low - income communities .

s. 1609 would support solar workforce development training for veterans and continued research for systems integration , balance of system cost reduction , and innovations in manufacturing competitiveness .

for wind energy , the house bill supports efforts to lower market barriers for distributed wind including small wind for rural homes , farms , and schools .

the senate committee bill would support demonstration projects for distributed wind and offshore wind and would support testing facilities such as the national wind technology center .

for the water program , h.r .

3219 would continue to support the hydronext initiative and research , development , and deployment of marine energy components and systems for marine hydrokinetic technology .

s. 1609 would support funding for commercial viability of pumped storage hydropower and research into mitigation of marine ecosystem impacts and continued construction of an open - water wave energy test facility .

for geothermal , there were no specific comments in h.rept .

115-230 ; s. 1609 would continue to support low - temperature co - produced resources and forge in fy2018 .

both bills would provide appropriations for fy2018 above the administration's request of $160 million for energy efficiency .

h.r .

3219 would appropriate nearly $481 million , while s. 1609 would appropriate nearly $737 million .

for advanced manufacturing , h.r .

3219 would provide funds for improvements in steel industry and transient kinetic analysis , and would also support advanced textile research .

the house bill would follow the administration's request to eliminate funding for the critical materials energy innovation hub , the energy water desalination hub , and the clean energy manufacturing innovation institutes ; however , the bill would support phasing out operations that ensure that the most promising early stage r&d efforts of the hubs and institutes are continued through competitive awards in similar areas .

in contrast , s. 1609 would provide funding for the manufacturing demonstration facility , the critical materials energy innovation hub , the energy water desalination hub , and clean energy manufacturing innovation institutes .

it would also support the combined heat and power technical assistance partnerships ( chp taps ) and related activities , and industrial assessment centers , among other efforts .

for building technologies , h.r .

3219 would continue to support the goals of the transformation in cities initiative and the research , development , and market transformation of direct use of natural gas in residential applications .

s. 1609 would support ongoing efforts to work with state and local agencies to incorporate the latest technical knowledge and best practices into construction requirements and to engage with industry teams to facilitate widespread deployment .

for commercial buildings , the report on s. 1609 encourages support for more cost - effective integration techniques and technologies to facilitate deep retrofits .

s. 1609 also would support emerging technologies efforts , including transactive controls r&d , regional demonstration of utility - led efforts advancing smart grid systems in communities , advanced solid - state lighting technology , and r&d for energy efficiency efforts for natural gas applications .

s. 1609 would also provide funding for equipment and building standards .

the administration's budget for fy2018 would terminate the weatherization and intergovernmental programs .

the weatherization assistance program ( wap ) provides funding through formula grants to states , tribes , the district of columbia , and u.s. territories to provide weatherization services that reduce energy costs for low - income households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes .

the state energy program ( sep ) provides funding and technical assistance to states , the district of columbia , and u.s. territories to promote the efficient use of energy and reduce the rate of growth of energy demand through the development and implementation of specific state energy programs .

both h.r .

3219 and s. 1609 do not follow the administration's request to terminate these programs and would continue to support wap and sep .

the house bill would continue those programs at fy2017 funding levels — $225 million for wap and $50 million for sep .

the senate committee bill would fund those programs at $212 million for wap and $50 million for sep .
