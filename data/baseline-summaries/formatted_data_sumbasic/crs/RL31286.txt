debt - for - nature initiatives were conceived to address the rapid loss of resources and biodiversity in developing countries that were heavily indebted to foreign creditors .

conservationists had noted that the pressure to pay off foreign debts in hard currency was leading to increased levels of natural resource exports ( i.e. , timber , cattle , minerals , and agricultural products ) at the expense of the environment .

in many cases , indebted developing countries had difficulty meeting their hard currency debt obligations and defaulted .

reducing foreign debt and allowing for portions of it to be paid with local currency while increasing funds for the environment was thought to improve environmental conditions in developing countries and had the advantage of relieving the debtor country's difficulties in procuring sufficient hard currency to pay off its debts .

money generated from debt - for - nature transactions has been used to fund a variety of projects , ranging from national park protection in costa rica to supporting ecotourism in ghana and conserving tropical forests in bangladesh .

since 1993 , there has been a declining trend in the number of debt - for - nature transactions involving official ( public ) and private funds .

accounting changes requiring new appropriations to support official ( public ) debt transactions in creditor countries such as the united states , and a higher price of commercial debt on secondary markets , are two reasons suggested for the decline of debt - for - nature transactions .

while congress has periodically authorized u.s. participation in three - party debt - for - nature transactions and has supported two bilateral debt - for - nature initiatives , appropriations to support these types of efforts have generally diminished over the years .

bilateral debt - for - nature initiatives implemented by the u.s. government were supported through appropriations under programs such as the eai and tfca .

recently , appropriations for conducting debt - for - nature transactions under these programs have stopped .

additionally , there generally has been less interest in conducting debt - for - nature transactions .

some possible reasons for the decreased interests could include the following: eligible debt to conduct these transactions has decreased , making these transactions either insignificant or not allowed for some debtor countries .

the amount involved in the transactions is too small for some eligible countries to show interest in participating .

there is a lack of appropriations to support debt - for - nature transactions .

the focus on tropical forests ( i.e. , through tfca ) might be too narrow for many eligible countries .

some members of congress contend that transactions under tfca should continue because the program is included in strategies to address global climate change .

tropical forests make up the largest proportion of carbon stored in terrestrial land masses and are thought to be a carbon sink .

despite uncertainties on the part of some , it is generally thought that maintaining existing tropical forests will store carbon and that preventing deforestation will reduce the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere .

the most recent debt - for - nature swap with indonesia under the tfca in 2014 , for example , has been billed as a cooperative effort to deal with climate change .

however , no quantitative analyses have examined the amount of stored - carbon emissions reduced by tfca efforts .

others have supported expanding tfca to include coral reefs .

the addition of coral reefs to the program could expand the number of eligible countries for debt - for - nature transactions , pending economic and political criteria .
