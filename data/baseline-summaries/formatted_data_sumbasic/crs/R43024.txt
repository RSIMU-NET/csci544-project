on december 17 , 2014 , after the end of the 113 th congress , president obama announced major developments in u.s. - cuban relations .

first , the cuban government released alan gross , the u.s. agency for international development subcontractor imprisoned in cuba for five years , on humanitarian grounds .

second , in a separate action , the cuban government released an important u.s. intelligence asset imprisoned for almost two decades in exchange for three cuban intelligence agents who had been imprisoned in the united states since 1998 .

finally , with the release of gross and the u.s. intelligence asset , president obama announced a major shift in u.s. policy toward cuba , moving away from a sanctions - based policy aimed at isolating cuba to a policy of engagement .

the president outlined three major steps to move toward normalization: ( 1 ) reestablishment of diplomatic relations with cuba ( relations were severed in 1961 ) ; ( 2 ) a review of cuba's designation by the department of state as a state sponsor of international terrorism ( cuba has been on the list since 1982 ) ; and ( 3 ) an increase in travel , commerce , and the flow of information to and from cuba .

the president maintained that the united states would continue to speak out on human rights and democracy issues , but stressed that more could be done to support the cuban people through engagement .

 ( see " president obama unveils a new policy approach toward cuba " below. ) .

on december 16 , 2014 , president obama signed into law the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 ) , which provided fy2015 funding for cuba democracy projects and cuba broadcasting .

with regard to democracy funding , the law measure stated that economic support funds should be made available for programs in cuba , but did not specify an amount ( the administration had requested $20 million ) .

the explanatory statement to the measure provides for $27.130 million to be provided for cuba broadcasting ( the administration had requested $23.130 million ) , but also indicated that funds may be transferred to the office of cuba broadcasting ( ocb ) of the broadcasting board of governors from appropriated economic support funds to restore ocb program reductions .

 ( see " u.s. funding to support democracy and human rights " and " radio and tv marti " below ) .

on december 9 , 2014 , cuba released from prison ladies in white member sonia garro alfonso , her husband ramón alejandro muñoz gonzález , and a neighbor , eugenio hernández , who had been held since march 2012 .

upon release , the three reportedly were placed under house arrest while awaiting trial .

amnesty international expressed concern that the three will not receive a fair trial in accordance with international standards .

 ( see " human rights conditions " below. ) .

on december 3 , 2014 , the independent havana - based cuban commission on human rights and national reconciliation reported that there were 8,410 short - term detentions for political reasons in the first 11 months of 2014 , far higher than the same period over the past several years .

in june 2014 , the group also reported that there were 102 political prisoners in the country , not including 12 released on parole who are not allowed to leave the country .

 ( see " human rights conditions " below. ) .

for developments earlier in 2014 and 2013 , see appendix b .

political and economic developments in cuba and u.s. policy toward the island nation , located just 90 miles from the united states , have been significant congressional concerns for many years .

since the end of the cold war , congress has played an active role in shaping u.s. policy toward cuba , first with the enactment of the cuban democracy act of 1992 ( p.l .

102-484 , title xvii ) and then with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) .

both of these measures strengthened u.s. economic sanctions on cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s , but the measures also provided roadmaps for a normalization of relations dependent upon significant political and economic changes in cuba .

a decade ago , congress partially modified its sanctions - based policy toward cuba when it enacted the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 ( p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) allowing for u.s. agricultural exports to cuba that led to the united states becoming a major source for cuba's food imports .

over the past decade , much of the debate over u.s. policy in congress has focused on u.s. sanctions , especially over u.s. restrictions on travel to cuba .

the george w. bush administration initially liberalized u.s. family travel to cuba in 2003 , but subsequently tightened restrictions on family and other categories of travel in 2004 because of cuba's crackdown on political dissidents .

in 2009 , congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure ( p.l .

111-8 ) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports , marking the first congressional action easing cuba sanctions in almost a decade .

the obama administration took further action in april 2009 by lifting all restrictions on family travel and on cash remittances by family members to their relatives in cuba and restarting semi - annual migration talks that had been curtailed in 2004 .

in january 2011 , the administration announced the further easing of restrictions on educational and religious travel to cuba and on non - family remittances , and it also expanded eligible airports in the united states authorized to serve licensed charter flights to and from cuba .

in december 2014 , just after the adjournment of the 113 th congress , president obama announced a major shift in u.s. policy toward cuba , moving away from a sanctions - based policy aimed at isolating cuba to a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations .

as announced , part of the president's initiative is to increase travel , commerce , and the flow of information to cuba .

this report is divided into three major sections analyzing cuba's political and economic situation , u.s. policy toward cuba , and selected issues in u.s. - cuban relations .

the first section includes a brief historical political background on cuba ; a discussion on the current political situation under raúl castro , including human rights conditions ; an examination of economic conditions and policy changes that have occurred to date under raúl castro ; and cuba's foreign relations .

the second section on u.s. policy provides a broad overview of u.s. policy historically through the george w. bush administration and then a discussion of current policy under the obama administration .

it then provides a brief discussion on the general policy debate regarding the direction of u.s. policy toward cuba .

the third section analyzes many of the key issues in u.s. - cuban relations that have been at the forefront of the u.s. policy debate on cuba and have often been the subject of legislative initiatives .

while legislative initiatives are noted throughout the report where appropriate , a final section of the report provides a listing of enacted measures and bills and resolutions introduced in the 113 th congress .

an appendix also provides links to selected executive branch reports and web pages on cuba .

for many years , congress has played an active role in u.s. policy toward cuba through the enactment of legislative initiatives and oversight on the many issues that comprise policy toward cuba .

these include u.s. restrictions on travel and remittances to cuba ; u.s. agricultural exports to cuba with conditions ; funding and oversight of u.s. - government sponsored democracy and human rights projects ; the imprisonment of usaid subcontractor alan gross in cuba since december 2009 ; funding and oversight for u.s. - government sponsored broadcasting to cuba ( radio and tv martí ) ; terrorism issues ; migration issues ; bilateral anti - drug cooperation ; and the status of cuba's offshore oil development , including efforts to ensure adequate oil spill prevention , preparedness , and response efforts .
