the superfund program had its 25 th anniversary in 2005 .

although superfund debate has lessened , as compared with past years , particular aspects of the program continue to generate debate .

policymakers are faced with broad programmatic concerns , as well as more specific issues concerning program implementation .

this report discusses some of these questions: who should pay to clean up the nation's most contaminated sites if responsible parties cannot be found ? .

is the program receiving enough funding to meet its current and future obligations ? .

how does the statute interact with abandoned hardrock mining sites and animal feeding operations ? .

to supply the context for these issues , this report first provides a background and overview of the superfund program .

on december 11 , 1980 , congress enacted the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla , p.l .

96-510 ) to create the hazardous substance cleanup program .

the program became known as "superfund" in reference to the trust fund established by the law .

the fund was originally supported by taxes levied on specific petroleum products and chemicals , and a corporate environmental income tax .

until recent years , the superfund taxes provided the majority of the funding for the needs of the program .

at the time of cercla's enactment , other federal environmental statutes provided federal agencies with only limited authority to address contamination at abandoned sites .

cercla gave the federal government the authority to take direct action to respond to instances involving uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances ( or pollutants and contaminants ) that may endanger public health or the environment .

cercla also enables the environmental protection agency ( epa ) to compel the persons responsible to clean up their contaminated sites .

if the potentially responsible parties ( prps ) cannot be located , or they are unable ( generally for financial reasons ) to perform cleanup , epa is authorized to use monies from the superfund trust fund to clean up the site .

cercla was expanded and reauthorized by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 ( sara , p.l .

99-499 ) .

amendments after sara have been narrowly focused .

in 1992 and 1996 , congress enacted legislation allowing for easier transfer of military bases with contaminated areas to local entities .

in 1996 and 1999 , congress provided conditional liability exemptions for financial institutions and recycling facilities .

in 2002 , congress enacted the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act ( p.l .

108-118 ) , which added further liability relief and authorized the brownfields program .

table 1 lists the various cercla amendments .

the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ( ncp ) contains the procedures and regulations for implementing the superfund program .

generally , epa leads the response to releases on land and in inland waters , whereas the coast guard leads the response in coastal waters of the united states .

this section of the report discusses four superfund issues that have received interest in recent years .

the first two issues concern program funding , including who should fund the program ( industry or general taxpayers ) and how much funding is needed to meet the program's obligations .

the second two issues concern cercla interaction at specific site types: abandoned hardrock mines and animal feeding operations .

superfund issues , such as the four described above , continue to generate debate and interest .

the selected topics discussed in this report are not mutually exclusive ; activity in one of the issues may influence policy in another .

for example , if more abandoned hardrock mining sites are added to the npl , congress may consider increasing annual appropriations to the superfund program .

this action could affect the argument concerning who should pay for the program .

similarly , cercla's level of application to animal feeding operations could affect the use of agency resources in the future .

if more sites fall under the cercla umbrella , finite agency resources may be strained , thus further fueling a debate over superfund taxes and funding levels .
