on february 14 , 2007 , congress completed work on the foreign operations appropriations bill and the science , state , justice , and commerce appropriations bill as part of the fy2007 continuing resolution ( h.j.res .

20 ) .

the bill was signed into law on february 15 ( p.l .

109-289 as amended by p.l .

110-5 ) .

the bill provided $32.6 billion in international affairs spending , of which $9.6 billion was for state department operations , diplomacy , and broadcasting , and $23.0 billion for foreign assistance programs .

except for a pending fy2007 supplemental request for global war on terror costs , the continuing resolution finished the appropriations process for fy2007 .

on september 29 , 2006 , congress included a continuing resolution ( cr ) in the defense department appropriation ( h.r .

5631 / p.l .

109-289 ) , signed into law the same day .

the continuing resolution , division b of the act , provided funding for the department of state , related agencies , and foreign operations accounts through november 17 , 2006 .

the funding level was to be apportioned based on the lesser of the fy2006 amount or the house - passed or senate - passed fy2007 levels .

since the senate had yet to pass its state department / foreign operations appropriation , the cr spending level was calculated on the fy2006 levels , including the fy2006 supplementals for recurring need , or the fy2007 house - passed level , whichever was lower .

two additional crs were passed that extended funding until february 15 , 2007 ( h.j.res .

100 and h.j.res .

102 ) .

on june 29 , 2006 , the senate appropriations committee approved the fy2007 state , foreign operations bill ( s.rept .

109-277 ) , providing $31.5 billion for both foreign assistance programs and state department operations , a decrease of $2.4 billion from the president's request .

the committee consolidated some accounts , putting all health - related programs including hiv / aids funding in the child survival and health account , and democracy promotion programs in the democracy fund account .

the bill provided $1.9 billion for the millennium challenge corporation , a $1.1 billion reduction from the request .

it provided $600 million for the global fund to fight aids , tb , and malaria , an increase of $400 million over the request .

also on june 29 , 2006 , the house passed h.r .

5672 , the science , state , justice and commerce appropriations bill providing $9.7 billion for the state department and related programs , an amount $218.5 million below the request .

on june 9 , 2006 , the house passed h.r .

5522 ( h.rept .

109-486 ) , the fy2007 foreign operations appropriations act providing $21.3 billion , a level that is $597 million , or 2.8% , above the fy2006 spending measure , but $2.387 billion , or 11.2% , below the president's $23.69 billion request .

the house largely accepted the recommendations of the house appropriations committee in its markup of the bill on may 25 with regard to overall funding levels .

several floor amendments were adopted that marked modest changes from what the committee had recommended for some programs .

h.r .

5522 included near full funding ( $3.43 billion ) for hiv / aids , more than double the amount requested for the multilateral global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis , and malaria , but reduced proposed spending for the presidents malaria initiative by $47 million .

overall , h.r .

5522 provided $3.61 billion for the foreign operations portion of bilateral and multilateral hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis programs , about $55 million less than requested , but roughly $820 million more than for fy2006 .

the legislation created a new account the trade capacity enhancement fund consolidating resources from multiple accounts that support trade capacity building efforts .

h.r .

5522 also proposed full or near - full funding for several fragile and post - conflict states of afghanistan , haiti , liberia , and sudan , and provided $522 million for iraq , about $150 million less than requested .

the measure included $2 billion for the millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) , $1 billion less than requested .

h.r .

5522 rescinded $200 million in cash assistance to egypt previously appropriated in fy2003 through fy2006 .

meanwhile , congress approved the fy2006 emergency supplemental measure ( h.r .

4939 / p.l .

109-234 ) that includes $2.4 billion in additional foreign operations and $1.4 billion for state department operations for this year .

amounts appropriated for foreign operations programs and for the department of state and related agencies comprise about 96% of the total international affairs budget and represent roughly 3.6% of discretionary budget authority under the jurisdiction of house and senate appropriations committees .

at the beginning of the 109 th congress , house and senate committees on appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures .

the house panel reduced the number of subcommittees to ten and reconfigured several of their jurisdictions .

these changes , however , do not affect the previous organizations for foreign operations and state department / broadcasting programs .

the jurisdiction of the house foreign operations committee remains the same , while state department , broadcasting , and related activities continue to be funded within the re - titled subcommittee on science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies ( ssjc ) .

the senate appropriations committee chose to restructure its subcommittees differently from the house by maintaining twelve sub - panels .

the senate configuration combined foreign operations with the state department , broadcasting , and related agencies , creating a re - titled subcommittee on state , foreign operations and related programs .

after passing separate and structurally different bills in 2005 , house and senate leaders agreed that for fy2006 funding measures , conference consideration would follow the house organization .

consequently , state department funds were removed from the senate - passed legislation ( h.r .

3057 ) and incorporated into h.r .

2862 , the ssjc measure .

for the 2 nd session of the 109 th congress , the house and senate appropriations committees are maintaining the same jurisdiction structure as last year — house foreign operations and senate state / foreign operations .

this report covers funding and policy issues related to foreign operations , as addressed in the house and senate , and state department programs as debated in the senate .

the discussion and accompanying tables are designed to track the house foreign operations appropriation measure , as well as the broader senate state , foreign operations spending bill .

to read about state department / broadcasting issues within the context of the house ssjc appropriation measure , see crs report rl33470 , science , state , justice , commerce and related agencies ( house ) / commerce , justice , science and related agencies ( senate ) : fy2007 appropriations , by [author name scrubbed] et al .

while appropriation bills funding foreign aid , state department operations , embassy construction , public diplomacy , and contributions to international organizations can address the entire range of u.s. foreign policy issues , the fy2007 budget request posed several key matters that the congress considered .

for foreign operations programs , major issues included: the overall size of the request — a 14.3% increase over regular fy2006 foreign operations funds — and whether competing budget proposals for domestic programs and efforts to reduce the deficit will permit full funding of the $ 23.69 billion recommendation .

foreign aid in support of the global war on terror and whether the fy2007 proposal fully addresses this high national security priority .

congress was expected to focus on reconstruction and other aid in iraq for which the administration sought $771 million .

this was in addition to a $2.4 billion fy2006 emergency supplemental proposal for iraq and other purposes .

the millennium challenge account and whether progress on this new , innovative foreign aid program justified a 71% funding increase to $3 billion in fy2007 .

global health funding , especially amounts for hiv / aids , a new presidential malaria initiative , and avian flu , and whether reductions for other health activities were warranted .

"core" bilateral development aid programs and whether proposed funding reductions for some activities were justified , especially given the large increases for mca and hiv / aids programs .

the creation of the new director of foreign assistance within the state department , announced in early 2006 , and whether the change will result in better coordination and policy coherence of various u.s. foreign aid programs .

on state department operations , key policy and funding issues included: transformational diplomacy: the fy2007 request included $102.8 million to begin implementing secretary rice's vision of u.s. diplomacy in the 21 st century , providing funds for repositioning american diplomats , creating regional public diplomacy centers , localizing small posts outside foreign capitals , training in new skills and languages , and fostering working relationships with the defense department and other federal agencies .

public diplomacy: educational and cultural exchange funds increased in the fy2007 request by 11% and broadcasting operations by 4% .

arguably , from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s , the underlying rationale for foreign aid and diplomatic efforts was the defeat of communism .

u.s. aid programs were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms , in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances .

other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies and friendly states , some of which faced soviet or soviet - proxy threats .

aid programs also were used to help the united states gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american armed forces .

diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the soviet threat .

foreign aid and diplomatic programs also supported a number of secondary u.s. policy goals in the developing world , such as reducing high rates of population growth , promoting wider access to health care , expanding the availability of basic education , advancing u.s. trade interests , and protecting the environment .

if these secondary goals were also achieved , u.s. aid programs could be promoted as delivering "more bang for the buck. .

with the end of the cold war , the focus of american foreign policy shifted to support more extensively other u.s. national interests , including stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs , expanding peace efforts in the middle east , seeking solutions to conflicts around the globe , protecting human rights and religious freedom , and countering trafficking in persons .

usually , appropriations committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted a budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302 ( a ) allocation process .

section 302 ( a ) is the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act .

following this , house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their subcommittees , staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution .

this second step is referred to as the section 302 ( b ) allocation .

foreign operations and state department funds fall within the international affairs budget function ( function 150 ) , representing in most years about 67% and 30% , respectively , of the function total .

the other major component of function 150 — international food assistance — is funded in the agriculture spending measure .

how much international affairs money to allocate among each of the subcommittees , and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs , are decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees .

nevertheless , overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for budget limitations within which the house and senate subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriations bills .

on march 16 , 2006 , the senate approved a budget resolution for fy2007 ( s.con.res .

83 ) that reduced to $33.5 billion the amount of discretionary budget authority for international affairs funding .

this fell $1.6 billion , or 4.6% , less than the presidents's request .

the house measure ( h.con.res .

376 ) , which passed on may 17 , cut function 150 deeper than the senate .

the $33 billion included in the house measure was $2.1 billion , or nearly 6% , below the administration's proposal .

house and senate appropriations committees , however , can choose to allocate the final amount set out in the budget resolution among the various subcommittees with jurisdiction over the international affairs budget proportionally different than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities .

depending on other competing priorities , the final allocations can diverge significantly from those assumed in the budget resolution .

nevertheless , the size of the reduction compared with the executive request approved in house and senate budget resolutions creates a challenging budget picture for appropriation subcommittees with jurisdiction over foreign operations and state department / broadcasting programs .

this was evident by the house appropriations committee approval on may 10 of a $21.3 billion allocation for foreign operations .

although 2.8% above regular foreign operations appropriations for fy2006 , the allocation was 11% below the fy2007 request , by far the largest percentage cut made by the house panel for any of its 11 section 302 ( b ) allocations .

the committee decided to reallocate $2.39 billion from foreign operations and $4.8 billion from defense and military quality of life subcommittees in order to increase spending levels in several domestic appropriations bills , most prominently for agriculture , homeland security , and labor , hhs , education .

on february 6 , 2006 , the president submitted his fy2007 budget request , including $23.69 billion for foreign operations and $10.09 billion for state department and related agencies appropriations ( amounts are adjusted to reflect cbo re - estimates of the request ) .

these amounts were 14.3% and 6% , respectively , higher than fy2006 amounts enacted in regular , non - supplemental appropriations .

the combined fy2007 foreign operations / state department request of $33.8 billion was 11.7% larger than regular fy2006 funding .

however , the fy2006 emergency supplemental ( p.l .

109-234 ) provided an additional $4.3 billion for state department and foreign operations , resulting in an fy2006 total of more than $34 billion .

this brought the fy2006 enacted level into near parity with the fy2007 request .

with the pending fy2007 supplemental ( h.r .

1591 / s. 965 ) , the fy2007 level could top that of last year .

the 14.3% increase over regular fy2006 appropriations proposed for foreign operations was one of the largest additions in the president's request for discretionary spending in fy2007 .

by comparison , the administration sought increases for two other high - priority budget areas — defense and homeland security — of about 6% and 3% , respectively .

despite the large overall increase for foreign operations , much of the added funding was concentrated in a few areas .

the fy2007 budget continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism and iraq reconstruction as the highest priorities , with nearly $7 billion proposed .

as shown in table 4 , increases for iraq and afghanistan were especially sharp .

resources continued to grow for the president's two cornerstone foreign aid initiatives — the millennium challenge account ( mca ) and the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) .

the $3 billion mca request was 71% higher than in fy2006 , while foreign operations funds for pepfar rose from $2.79 billion in fy2006 to $3.67 billion in the fy2007 request .

 ( additional pepfar funds were proposed in the labor / hhs appropriation measure , bringing the total fy2007 pepfar request to $4.26 billion. ) .

after failing to win congressional approval the past four years for a contingency fund that could be used to respond to unanticipated foreign policy emergencies , the white house again proposed $75 million for a conflict response fund .

funding for debt reduction programs would nearly triple — to $183 million — largely to cancel debt owed by the democratic republic of congo .

peacekeeping funds for non - u.n. sponsored operations would grow by 16% , mainly due to additional resources for african union peacekeeping activities in the darfur region of sudan .

combined , funding for these major elements of the foreign operations request totaled $9.2 billion , or 55% higher than for fy2006 .

by contrast , the $14.8 billion proposed for all other foreign operations activities was 2.1% less than fy2006 regular appropriations amounts .

each of the high - priority items in the fy2007 foreign operations budget request discussed above , and other issues of concern , are discussed below , including congressional action .

on february 16 , 2006 , the administration submitted an emergency fy2006 supplemental appropriations request totaling $92.2 billion for additional funding for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan ( $67.9 billion ) , state department operations in iraq and various foreign aid programs , including assistance for iraq ( $4.2 billion ) , and for recovery and reconstruction efforts in the hurricane - affected gulf coast areas ( $19.8 billion ) .

the supplemental proposal for international matters covered a range of activities that were not addressed in the regular fy2006 appropriations , addressed circumstances that had changed since passage of the regular spending measures , or , like military operations in iraq and afghanistan , had been funded largely through supplementals rather than incorporated into the base of annual , on - going diplomatic and aid operations .

the request of $1.6 billion in iraq stabilization assistance was the first sizable aid package for baghdad since congress approved $18.45 billion in the fy2004 emergency supplemental measure .

other foreign policy elements included funding for u.s. diplomatic costs in iraq and afghanistan , reconstruction aid for afghanistan , democracy promotion programs for iran , darfur humanitarian relief and peace implementation aid in sudan , pakistan earthquake reconstruction , liberia refugee repatriation , and food aid for africa ( see table 11 for detailed funding levels ) .
