as part of its proposed fy2010 defense budget , the administration proposed deferring the start of a program to develop a next - generation bomber ( ngb ) for the air force , pending the completion of the 2010 quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) and associated nuclear posture review ( npr ) , and in light of strategic arms control negotiations with russia .

the administration's proposed fy2010 budget requested no funding specifically identified in public budget documents as being for an ngb program .

prior to the submission of the fy2010 budget , the air force was conducting research and development work aimed at fielding a next - generation bomber by 2018 .

although the proposed fy2010 defense budget proposes to defer the start of an ngb program , the secretary of defense and air force officials in 2009 have expressed support for the need to eventually start such a program .

the air force's fy2010 unfunded requirements list ( url ) — a list of programs desired by the air force but not funded in the air force's proposed fy2010 budget — includes a classified $140-million item that some press accounts have identified as being for continued work on a next - generation bomber .

a key issue for congress in fy2010 is whether to provide funding in fy2010 for an ngb program .

a second issue is whether to enact legislation that would amend or add to prior - year legislation on bomber force structure .

congress's decisions on these issues could affect air force capabilities and funding requirements , and the u.s. aircraft manufacturing industrial base .

a key issue for congress in fy2010 is whether to provide funding in fy2010 for a next - generation bomber program .

a second issue is whether to enact legislation that would amend or add to prior - year legislation on bomber force structure .

in considering these issues , congress may take various factors into account , including the following: the future roles and missions of bombers for strategic nuclear deterrence , conventional conflicts , and irregular warfare ; the ability of the current bomber force to perform those roles and missions cost effectively , and for how long ; the potential effect of the timing of a next - generation bomber program on the design and capabilities of the new bomber ; and the potential effect of decisions on a next - generation bomber program on the bomber design and construction industrial base .

each of these factors is discussed briefly below .

the air force's research and development account includes a line item — program element ( pe ) 0604015f , next generation long range strike ( nglrs ) — that since the fy2005 budget submission has included funded explicitly identified as being for development of a next - generation bomber .

the administration's proposed fy2010 defense budget requested no funding for this line item for fy2010-fy2015 .

the house armed services committee , in its report ( h.rept .

111-166 of june 18 , 2009 ) on h.r .

2647 , recommends authorizing no fy2010 funding in pe0604015f for development of a next - generation bomber .

 ( page 188 , line 50 ) the report recommends $215 million in additional funding in the air force research and development account for a line item identified as "other programs" ( page 198 , line 999 ) , but it is not clear whether any of this funding is related to a next - generation bomber .

the fy2010 funding request for this line item was $11.96 billion , suggesting that this line item might fund a variety of classified research and development projects .

a june 26 , 2009 , press report stated: the decision by u.s. house defense overseers to authorize continued funding for next generation bomber studies has buoyed the hopes of senate bomber advocates , even though defense secretary robert gates wants to wait before spending more... .

the house armed services committee ( hasc ) included $215 million for additional , classified air force r&d in the fiscal 2010 defense authorization bill .

that air force r&d is believed to contain the bomber project .

"the question in the house revolves more around the advanced technology associated with the bomber," said rep. neil abercrombie ( d - hawaii ) , chair of the house airland subcommittee .

because of the classified nature of the information , abercrombie said he couldn't go into detail , but he noted there is general agreement in the house — particularly the hasc — about pursuing r&d associated with the new bomber .

he said there was interest in "increased stealth capabilities" but would go no further than that .

section 1032 of h.r .

2647 would require the secretary of defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the force structure findings of 2009 quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) .

regarding this section , the house armed services committee's report states: the committee expects that the analyses submitted will include details on all elements of the force structure discussed in the qdr report , and particularly the following:... ( 4 ) a description of the factors that informed decisions regarding bomber force structure , including: the modeling , simulations , and analyses used to determine the number and type of bomber aircraft necessary to meet the national defense strategy ; the force sizing constructs used including peak demand ; the number and type of bomber aircraft necessary to meet the national defense strategy ; and the operational risks associated with the planned bomber aircraft fleet , based on requirements of combatant commanders , and measures planned to address those risks ; ...

division d of the senate - reported ( s.rept .

111-35 of july 2 , 2009 ) version of the fy2010 defense authorization bill ( s. 1390 ) presents the detailed line - item funding tables that in previous years have been included in the senate armed services committee's report on the defense authorization bill .

division d recommends authorizing no fy2010 funding in pe0604015f for development of a next - generation bomber .

 ( page 685 of the printed bill , line 50 ) division d recommends $140 million in additional funding in the air force research and development account for a line item identified as "other programs" ( page 692 of the printed bill , line 999 ) , but it is not clear whether any of this funding is related to a next - generation bomber .

the fy2010 funding request for this line item was $11.96 billion , suggesting that this line item might fund a variety of classified research and development projects .

section 124 of s. 1390 makes a series of findings regarding long - range strike capability and bombers , and would make it u.s. policy to support a development program for next - generation bomber aircraft technologies .

the text of the provision is as follows: sec .

124 .

next generation bomber aircraft .

 ( a ) findings - congress makes the following findings: ( 1 ) long - range strike is a critical mission in which the united states needs to retain a credible and dominant capability .

 ( 2 ) long range , penetrating strike systems provide — ( a ) a hedge against being unable to obtain access to forward bases for political reasons ; ( b ) a capacity to respond quickly to contingencies ; ( c ) the ability to base outside the reach of emerging adversary anti - access and area - denial capabilities ; and ( d ) the ability to impose disproportionate defensive costs on prospective adversaries of the united states .

 ( 3 ) the 2006 quadrennial defense review found that there was a requirement for a next generation bomber aircraft and directed the united states air force to `develop a new land - based , penetrating long range strike capability to be fielded by 2018' .

 ( 4 ) on april 6 , 2009 , secretary gates announced that the united states `will not pursue a development program for a follow - on air force bomber until we have a better understanding of the need , the requirement and the technology' .

 ( 5 ) on may 7 , 2009 , president barack obama announced the termination of the next generation bomber aircraft program in the document of the office of management and budget entitled `terminations , reductions , and savings' , stating that `there is no urgent need to begin an expensive development program for a new bomber' and that `the future bomber fleet may not be affordable over the next six years' .

 ( 6 ) the united states will need a new long - range strike capability because the conflicts of the future will likely feature heavily defended airspace , due in large part to the proliferation of relatively inexpensive , but sophisticated and deadly , air defense systems .

 ( 7 ) general michael maples , the director of the defense intelligence agency , noted during a march 10 , 2009 , hearing of the committee on armed services of the senate on worldwide threats that `russia , quite frankly , is the developer of most of those [advanced air defense] systems and is exporting those systems both to china and to other countries in the world' .

 ( 8 ) the final report of the congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states , submitted to congress on may 6 , 2009 , states that `[t]he bomber force is valuable particularly for extending deterrence in time of crisis , as their deployment is visible and signals u.s. commitment .

bombers also impose a significant cost burden on potential adversaries in terms of the need to invest in advanced air defenses' .

 ( 9 ) the commanders of the united states pacific command , the united states strategic command , and the united states joint forces command have each testified before the committee on armed services of the senate in support of the capability that the next generation bomber aircraft would provide .

 ( 10 ) on june 17 , 2009 , general james cartwright , vice - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and chair of the joint requirements oversight council , stated during a hearing before the committee on armed services of the senate that `the nation needs a new bomber' .

 ( 11 ) nearly half of the united states bomber aircraft inventory ( 47 percent ) pre - dates the cuban missile crisis .

 ( 12 ) the only air - breathing strike platforms the united states possesses today with reach and survivability to have a chance of successfully executing missions more than 1,000 nautical miles into enemy territory from the last air - to - air refueling are 16 combat ready b - 2 bomber aircraft .

 ( 13 ) the b - 2 bomber aircraft was designed in the 1980s and achieved initial operational capability over a decade ago .

 ( 14 ) the crash of an operational b - 2 bomber aircraft during takeoff at guam in early 2008 indicates that attrition can and does occur even in peacetime .

 ( 15 ) the primary mission requirement of the next generation bomber aircraft is the ability to strike targets anywhere on the globe with whatever weapons the contingency requires .

 ( 16 ) the requisite aerodynamic , structural , and low - observable technologies to develop the next generation bomber aircraft already exist in fifth - generation fighter aircraft .

 ( b ) policy on continued development of next generation bomber aircraft in fiscal year 2010- it is the policy of the united states to support a development program for next generation bomber aircraft technologies .

regarding section 124 , the committee's report states: on april 6 , 2009 , secretary gates announced that the united states ''will not pursue a development program for a follow - on air force bomber until we have a better understanding of the need , the requirement , and technology.' .

subsequent to this announcement , commanders of the united states strategic command , the united states pacific command , and the united states joint forces command all testified before the committee that the capability that a next - generation bomber would provide will be needed in the future .

the committee understands that discussion on a next - generation bomber will occur in the context of the quadrennial defense review and the nuclear posture review , which will inform the fiscal year 2011 budget deliberations .

 ( pages 15-16 ) the committee's report presents the additional views of senator john thune regarding section 124 on pages 326-329 .

senator thune states in these views that section 124 is based on s. 1044 ( see below ) .

a provision similar to s. 1044 was included as section 255 of the fy2010 defense authorization act ( h.r .

2647 / p.l .

111-84 ) .

appendix a .

existing bomber fleet this appendix presents additional information on the air force's existing fleet of b - 2 , b - 1b , and b - 52h bombers .

b - 2 bomber may 2009 air force testimony the air force testified in may 2009 that: the b - 2 spirit advanced technology bomber provides a lethal combination of stealth , range , payload , and precision engagement .

the b - 2 remains the world's sole long - range , low observable bomber , and the only platform capable of delivering 80 independently targeted gbu - 38s .

b - 2 availability has steadily increased over the past five years , due in large part to focused efforts to enhance low observable maintenance such as the highly successful alternate high frequency material program .

however , it still faces increasing pressures to upgrade avionics originally designed over twenty years ago .

the three - increment extremely high frequency satellite communications and computer upgrade program ( ehf satcom and computer upgrade ) seeks first , in increment 1 , to upgrade the spirit's flight management computers as an enabler for future avionics efforts .

increment 2 integrates the family of beyond - line - of - sight terminals ( fab - t ) along with a low observable antenna to provide secure , survivable strategic two - way communications , while increment 3 will connect the b - 2 into the global information grid .

increment 1 of ehf satcom and computer upgrade is currently in engineering and manufacturing development ( emd ) and on track to begin procurement in fy11 for fleet installation beginning at the end of fy13 .

the b - 2 is also replacing the original radar antenna and upgrading selected radar avionics as part of the radar modernization program ( rmp ) to change the radar operating frequency .

rmp recently recovered from development challenges and has been approved to enter production .

the lrip contract for the first six production radar kits was signed on 29 december 2008 , with the second and final buy for the remaining seven shipsets slated for later this year .

seven radar shipsets were also bought during development and are currently being installed in fleet aircraft to round out the 20 aircraft b - 2 fleet ; the developmental units will be retrofitted to the final production configuration .

thanks in large part to congressional support , the rmp acquisition strategy was modified to include both life - of - type component buys to avoid diminishing manufacturing issues during the production run , and advance procurement to recover five months of the schedule lost while resolving the rmp integration issues during development .

march 2009 gao report a march 2009 gao report provides summary assessments of the b - 2 radar modernization program ( rmp ) and the b - 2 advanced extremely high frequency ( ehf ) satcom modernization program .

air force fact sheet an online air force fact sheet on the b - 2 bomber dated april 2008 stated the following: mission the b - 2 spirit is a multi - role bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions .

a dramatic leap forward in technology , the bomber represents a major milestone in the u.s. bomber modernization program .

the b - 2 brings massive firepower to bear , in a short time , anywhere on the globe through previously impenetrable defenses .

features along with the b - 52 and b - 1b , the b - 2 provides the penetrating flexibility and effectiveness inherent in manned bombers .

its low - observable , or "stealth," characteristics give it the unique ability to penetrate an enemy's most sophisticated defenses and threaten its most valued , and heavily defended , targets .

its capability to penetrate air defenses and threaten effective retaliation provides a strong , effective deterrent and combat force well into the 21 st century .

the revolutionary blending of low - observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the b - 2 important advantages over existing bombers .

its low - observability provides it greater freedom of action at high altitudes , thus increasing its range and a better field of view for the aircraft's sensors .

its unrefueled range is approximately 6,000 nautical miles ( 9,600 kilometers ) .

the b - 2's low observability is derived from a combination of reduced infrared , acoustic , electromagnetic , visual and radar signatures .

these signatures make it difficult for the sophisticated defensive systems to detect , track and engage the b - 2 .

many aspects of the low - observability process remain classified ; however , the b - 2's composite materials , special coatings and flying - wing design all contribute to its "stealthiness. .

the b - 2 has a crew of two pilots , a pilot in the left seat and mission commander in the right , compared to the b - 1b's crew of four and the b - 52's crew of five .

background the first b - 2 was publicly displayed on nov. 22 , 1988 , when it was rolled out of its hangar at air force plant 42 , palmdale , calif. its first flight was july 17 , 1989 .

the b - 2 combined test force , air force flight test center , edwards air force base , calif. , is responsible for flight testing the engineering , manufacturing and development aircraft on the b - 2 .

whiteman afb , mo. , is the only operational base for the b - 2 .

the first aircraft , spirit of missouri , was delivered dec. 17 , 1993 .

depot maintenance responsibility for the b - 2 is performed by air force contractor support and is managed at the oklahoma city air logistics center at tinker afb , okla .

the combat effectiveness of the b - 2 was proved in operation allied force , where it was responsible for destroying 33 percent of all serbian targets in the first eight weeks , by flying nonstop to kosovo from its home base in missouri and back .

in support of operation enduring freedom , the b - 2 flew one of its longest missions to date from whiteman to afghanistan and back .

the b - 2 completed its first - ever combat deployment in support of operation iraqi freedom , flying 22 sorties from a forward operating location as well as 27 sorties from whiteman afb and releasing more than 1.5 million pounds of munitions .

the b - 2's proven combat performance led to declaration of full operational capability in december 2003 .

the prime contractor , responsible for overall system design and integration , is northrop grumman integrated systems sector .

boeing military airplanes co. , hughes radar systems group , general electric aircraft engine group and vought aircraft industries , inc. , are key members of the aircraft contractor team .

general characteristics primary function: multi - role heavy bomber contractor: northrop grumman corp. and contractor team: boeing military airplanes co. , hughes radar systems group , general electric aircraft engine group and vought aircraft industries , inc. power plant: four general electric f118-ge - 100 engines thrust: 17,300 pounds each engine wingspan: 172 feet ( 52.12 meters ) length: 69 feet ( 20.9 meters ) height: 17 feet ( 5.1 meters weight: 160,000 pounds ( 72,575 kilograms ) maximum takeoff weight: 336,500 pounds ( 152,634 kilograms ) fuel capacity: 167,000 pounds ( 75750 kilograms ) payload: 40,000 pounds ( 18,144 kilograms ) speed: high subsonic range: intercontinental ceiling: 50,000 feet ( 15,240 meters ) armament: conventional or nuclear weapons crew: two pilots unit cost: approximately $1.157 billion ( fiscal 98 constant dollars ) initial operating capability: april 1997 inventory: active force: 20 ( 1 test ) ; ang: 0 ; reserve: 0 b - 1b bomber may 2009 air force testimony the air force testified in may 2009 that: the b - 1 provides the joint force commander massive firepower potential coupled with a significant loiter capability perfectly suited for the inconsistent tempo of today's ongoing operations .

added to this is the b - 1's unique supersonic dash potential which allows a single aircraft to perform as a roving linebacker over large portions of the overall aor .

once solely a nuclear deterrent , the air force has re - focused the b - 1's capabilities through modernizing its current conventional lethality .

a perfect example of the b - 1's potential was realized by adding an advanced targeting pod to the platform's sensor suite .

in an exceptional display of acquisition effectiveness , in 2007 the air force and our corporate partners responded to afcent's highest urgent operational need requirement by energizing a fast - track development and procurement timeline .

with the help of supplemental funding , by june 2008 the 34 th bomb squadron from ellsworth afb , south dakota was able to deploy a full complement of sniper - equipped b - 1 bombers to support both oef and oif operations without a single break in daily combat operations .

the program continues in 2009 to outfit the remaining fleet and incorporate laser - guided weapons as well as integrating pod data directly into the avionics system , allowing for direct machine - to - machine transfer of targeting data .

as stated by the combined force air component commander , "the sniper pod on the b - 1 bomber is amazing. .

this new capability means the b - 1 is even more in demand for current operational taskings .

the non - stop overseas contingency operations are taking a toll on the overall fleet .

currently in fy09 , the air force is addressing five different issues which would have meant potentially grounding aircraft if they were not addressed .

as a baseline to many of these sustainment modifications , the air force also embarked on its largest cockpit and communications modernization for the b - 1 since its inception .

begun in 2005 , the b - 1 fully integrated data link ( fidl ) program infuses a tactical link - 16 data link and a joint range extension ( jre ) beyond line of sight ( blos ) data link into an entirely overhauled modern cockpit .

this system of modifications removes legacy monochrome displays and incorporates a series of color multifunction displays capable of displaying a wide array of fused data at all crew stations .

although the b - 1 fidl program has suffered several setbacks , through the continued persistence of air force and congressional support the program is now turning the corner and progressing toward completion .

this upgrade will not only help protect the b - 1 parts from obsolescence , it will evolve an already capable conventional platform into a networked provider of precision firepower .

air force fact sheet an online air force fact sheet on the b - 1b bomber dated may 2009 stated the following: mission carrying the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the air force inventory , the multi - mission b - 1 is the backbone of america's long - range bomber force .

it can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non - precision weapons against any adversary , anywhere in the world , at any time .

features the b - 1b's blended wing / body configuration , variable - geometry wings and turbofan afterburning engines , combine to provide long range , maneuverability and high speed while enhancing survivability .

forward wing settings are used for takeoff , landings , air refueling and in some high - altitude weapons employment scenarios .

aft wing sweep settings - the main combat configuration — are typically used during high subsonic and supersonic flight , enhancing the b - 1b's maneuverability in the low - and high - altitude regimes .

the b - 1b's speed and superior handling characteristics allow it to seamlessly integrate in mixed force packages .

these capabilities , when combined with its substantial payload , excellent radar targeting system , long loiter time and survivability , make the b - 1b a key element of any joint / composite strike force .

the b - 1 weapon system is capable of creating a multitude of far - reaching effects across the battlefield .

the b - 1 is a highly versatile , multi - mission weapon system .

the b - 1b's offensive avionics system includes high - resolution synthetic aperture radar , capable of tracking , targeting and engaging moving vehicles as well as self - targeting and terrain - following modes .

in addition , an extremely accurate global positioning system - aided inertial navigation system enable aircrews to autonomously navigate globally , without the aid of ground - based navigation aids as well as engage targets with a high level of precision .

the recent addition of combat track ii radios permit an interim secure beyond line of sight reach back connectivity until link - 16 is integrated on the aircraft .

in a time sensitive targeting environment , the aircrew can receive targeting data from the combined air operations center over ct ii , then update mission data in the offensive avionics system to strike emerging targets rapidly and efficiently .

this capability was effectively demonstrated during operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom .

the b - 1b's self - protection electronic jamming equipment , radar warning receiver ( alq - 161 ) and expendable countermeasures ( chaff and flare ) system complements its low - radar cross - section to form an integrated , robust onboard defense system that supports penetration of hostile airspace .

the alq - 161 electronic countermeasures system detects and identifies the full spectrum of adversary threat emitters then applies the appropriate jamming technique either automatically or through operator manual inputs .

chaff and flares are employed against radar and infrared threat systems .

b - 1 capabilities are being enhanced through the completion of the conventional mission upgrade program .

this program has already improved lethality by adding the ability to carry up to 30 cluster munitions ( cbu - 87 , - 89 , - 97 ) , a global positioning system receiver , an improved weapons interface that allows the carriage of joint direct attack munitions guided weapons and advanced secure radios ( arc - 210 ) .

survivability is enhanced through the addition of the ale - 50 towed decoy system which decoys advanced radar guided surface - to - air and air - to - air missile systems .

the cmup adds improved avionics computers which allow the employment of additional advanced guided precision and non - precision weapons: 30 wind - corrected munitions dispensers ( cbu - 103 , - 104 , - 105 wcmd ) , 12 agm - 154 joint standoff weapons or 24 agm - 158 joint air - to - surface standoff missile .

the b - 1 will be able to carry and employ any mix of these weapons ( a different type of weapon in each of the three weapons bays ) .

the b - 1 will also be the first platform to carry the extended range version of the jassm .

these modifications significantly increase b - 1 combat capability .

future planned modifications build on this foundation provided by the new avionics computers .

radar sustainability and capability upgrades will provide a more reliable system in addition to an ultra high - resolution capability that may include automatic target recognition features .

the addition of link - 16 will allow the b - 1 to operate in the integrated battlefield of the future .

cockpit modifications will relieve reliability problems and increase aircrew situational awareness and provide an integrated flow of information .

background the b - 1a was initially developed in the 1970s as a replacement for the b - 52 .

four prototypes of this long - range , high speed ( mach 2.2 ) strategic bomber were developed and tested in the mid - 1970s , but the program was canceled in 1977 before going into production .

flight testing continued through 1981 .

the b - 1b is an improved variant initiated by the reagan administration in 1981 .

major changes included the addition of additional structure to increase payload by 74,000 pounds , an improved radar and reduction of the radar cross section by an order of magnitude .

the inlet was extensively modified as part of this rcs reduction , necessitating a reduction in maximum speed to mach 1.2 .

the first production b - 1 flew in october 1984 , and the first b - 1b was delivered to dyess air force base , texas , in june 1985 .

initial operational capability was achieved on oct. 1 , 1986 .

the final b - 1b was delivered may 2 , 1988 .

the b - 1b holds almost 50 world records for speed , payload , range , and time of climb in its class .

the national aeronautic association recognized the b - 1b for completing one of the 10 most memorable record flights for 1994 .

the most recent records were made official in 2004 .

the b - 1b was first used in combat in support of operations against iraq during operation desert fox in december 1998 .

in 1999 , six b - 1s were used in operation allied force , delivering more than 20 percent of the total ordnance while flying less than 2 percent of the combat sorties .

eight b - 1s were deployed in support of operation enduring freedom .

b - 1s dropped nearly 40 percent of the total tonnage during the first six months of oef .

this included nearly 3,900 jdams , or 67 percent of the total .

all of this was accomplished while maintaining an impressive 79 percent mission capable rate .

given the expected service life of the aircraft , the b - 52 airframes will be the longest operationally employed powered war machine in history , far surpassing the lifespan of any other single model land , sea or air weapon system .

for more than 40 years b - 52s have been the backbone of the strategic bomber force for the u.s .

the b - 52 is capable of dropping or launching the widest array of weapons in the u.s. inventory , including gravity bombs , cluster bombs , precision guided missiles and jdams .

updated with modern technology , the b - 52 will be capable of delivering the full complement of joint developed weapons and will continue into the 21 st century as an important element of our nation's defenses .

the air force has invested in b - 52 modernization programs to keep the platform operationally relevant by adding satellite and nuclear survivable and secure wideband high data rate communications ; sniper and litening advanced targeting pods ; aircraft computer and data transfer unit upgrades ; and integration of smart weapons to improve conventional warfare capability .

together with the b - 1 and the b - 2 , the b - 52 serves as a key component of the united states' long - range bomber force .

it has earned respect as a highly capable conventional and nuclear combat platform during the cold war , the vietnam war , desert storm , oaf , oif , oef , and frequently deploys to guam to provide a continuous bomber presence mission in the pacific .

the b - 52 continues to serve the nation well as it has during its long and distinguished history , and we have provided significant support across the future years defense program in recognition of its value .

air force fact sheet an online air force fact sheet on the b - 52h bomber dated october 2007 stated the following: mission air combat command's b - 52 is a long - range , heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions .

the bomber is capable of flying at high subsonic speeds at altitudes up to 50,000 feet ( 15,166.6 meters ) .

it can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability .

features in a conventional conflict , the b - 52 can perform strategic attack , air interdiction , offensive counter - air and maritime operations .

during desert storm , b - 52s delivered 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces .

it is highly effective when used for ocean surveillance , and can assist the u.s. navy in anti - ship and mine - laying operations .

two b - 52s , in two hours , can monitor 140,000 square miles ( 364,000 square kilometers ) of ocean surface .

all b - 52s are equipped with an electro - optical viewing system that uses platinum silicide forward - looking infrared and high resolution low - light - level television sensors to augment targeting , battle assessment , and flight safety , thus further improving its combat ability and low - level flight capability .

pilots wear night vision goggles ( nvg ) to enhance their vision during night operations .

night vision goggles provide greater safety during night operations by increasing the pilot's ability to visually clear terrain , avoid enemy radar and see other aircraft in a covert / lights - out environment .

starting in 1989 , on - going modifications incorporates the global positioning system , heavy stores adapter beams for carrying 2,000 pound munitions , and a full array of advance weapons currently under development .

the use of aerial refueling gives the b - 52 a range limited only by crew endurance .

it has an unrefueled combat range in excess of 8,800 miles ( 14,080 kilometers ) .

the aircraft's flexibility was evident in operation desert storm and again during operations allied force .

b - 52s struck wide - area troop concentrations , fixed installations and bunkers , and decimated the morale of iraq's republican guard .

the gulf war involved the longest strike mission in the history of aerial warfare when b - 52s took off from barksdale air force base , la. , launched conventional air launched cruise missiles and returned to barksdale — a 35-hour , non - stop combat mission .

during operation allied force , b - 52s opened the conflict with conventional cruise missile attacks and then transitioned to delivering general purpose bombs and cluster bomb units on serbian army positions and staging areas .

background for more than 40 years b - 52 stratofortresses have been the backbone of the manned strategic bomber force for the united states .

the b - 52 is capable of dropping or launching the widest array of weapons in the u.s. inventory .

this includes gravity bombs , cluster bombs , precision guided missiles and joint direct attack munitions .

updated with modern technology the b - 52 will be capable of delivering the full complement of joint developed weapons and will continue into the 21 st century as an important element of our nation's defenses .

current engineering analyses show the b - 52's life span to extend beyond the year 2040 .

the b - 52a first flew in 1954 , and the b model entered service in 1955 .

a total of 744 b - 52s were built with the last , a b - 52h , delivered in october 1962 .

only the h model is still in the air force inventory and is assigned to air combat command and the air force reserves .

the first of 102 b - 52h's was delivered to strategic air command in may 1961 .

the h model can carry up to 20 air launched cruise missiles .

in addition , it can carry the conventional cruise missile that was launched in several contingencies during the 1990s , starting with operation desert storm and culminating with operation allied force .

1992-2002 plans for bomber modernization this appendix presents plans for modernizing the bomber force from 1992 until the 2006 qdr .

1992 u.s. air force bomber roadmap in 1992 , the air force published a bomber roadmap to guide the development of the bomber force in the post - cold war security environment .

a key goal of the roadmap was to set forth a plan for converting the bomber fleet from a nuclear - centric force to a force with more of a conventional mission focus .

the newly formed air combat command ( acc ) implemented the roadmap by funding upgrades needed to enhance the bomber force's conventional weapons delivery capability , by developing a bomber concept of operations to more effectively incorporate the bomber into conventional operations , and by shifting training away from the nuclear mission and towards missions conducted in a conventional theater air campaign .

the 1992 roadmap concluded that a bomber force of 95 b - 52hs , 96 b - 1bs , and 20 b - 2s ( 211 heavy bombers in all ) would meet current and future requirements .

the roadmap also declared the b - 1 as the "backbone of the conventional bomber force" and that future bomber investments would focus on b - 1 conventional enhancements .

1993 bottom - up review ( bur ) dod's 1993 bottom - up review ( bur ) of u.s. defense plans and programs called for a u.s. military force structure that would permit the united states to conduct two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts .

the 1993 bur called for a force of 100 heavy bomber aircraft to conduct the first regional conflict and for an overall bomber force of 184 aircraft .

the 1993 bur echoed the 1992 roadmap's recommendations to upgrade the bomber fleet to enable bombers to carry the latest advanced conventional munitions .

some observers voiced concerns over the reduction in bomber numbers called for in the 1993 bur .

the acc commander at the time stated that the nation needed about 180 operational bombers to handle two major regional conflicts , plus additional non - operational aircraft for backup inventory , attrition reserves , and flight testing .

1994 nuclear posture review ( npr ) the 1994 nuclear posture review ( npr ) endorsed decision in the 1992 roadmap to reorient the b - 1b to a conventional - only role .

it called for a force of 66 b - 52s and no more than 20 b - 2s to support the nuclear mission .

if requirements for bombers were set by nuclear missions alone , such a force would permit the b - 52 force called for in the 1993 bur to be reduced by another 28 aircraft .

the 1994 npr acknowledged the b - 52's limited survivability in high - threat environments and relegated the aircraft in nuclear operations to a role of delivering standoff - ranged air - launched cruise missiles ( alcms ) .

1995 dod heavy bomber force study the 1995 dod heavy bomber force study was a classified study initiated by congressional direction .

under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology , paul kaminski , presented an unclassified summary of the study to the national security subcommittee of the house appropriations committee in may 1995 .

the study concluded the following: the currently planned bomber force of 181 aircraft was sufficient to handle two nearly simultaneous major regional contingencies ; procuring additional advanced guided munitions was more cost effective than procuring 20 additional b - 2s ; the planned bomber force with accurate guided munitions would provide a prudent hedge against threat uncertainties ; and planned b - 1 conventional upgrades were more cost effective than procuring 20 additional b - 2s .

the study stressed the value of shorter - range tactical aircraft , noting that "once all the tactical air forces are in place and fully employed — the bomber contribution shrinks to a small portion of the overall aggregate force. .

a 1996 gao report on bombers took exception to the heavy bomber force study , along with the 1992 roadmap , the 1993 bur , and the 1994 npr , stating that dod's requirement for 181 bombers was overstated given dod's other ground - attack capabilities and the unified commanders in chief plans for using bombers .

gao agreed with dod's desire not to procure additional b - 2s , but judged that a reduction or elimination of the b - 1 fleet was warranted with minimal risk .

1997 quadrennial defense review dod's 1997 quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) produced no major changes to the recommended bomber fleet .

the qdr recommended sustaining the bomber fleet at 187 aircraft , including 71 b - 52hs , 21 b - 2s , and 95 b - 1bs .

while the qdr acknowledged that additional b - 2s would help the united states in the initial phase of a major regional conflict , the qdr judged that it would not be cost - effective to procure additional b - 2s in light of other pressing needs .

a congressionally mandated independent bomber review , chaired by brent scowcroft , was highly critical of the 1997 qdr's decision not to procure additional b - 2s .

unlike the 1996 gao report on bombers , which called for reducing bomber numbers in light of , among other things , the capabilities of tactical aircraft , scowcroft's review stated that the "pentagon's preference for short - range instead of long - range air power raises a puzzling contradiction. .

the scowcroft study stated that the long - range bomber fleet is well suited to the demands of the new security environment and that long - range air power will be increasing important in coming decades .

the scowcroft study concluded that "current plans for the long - range air power force were woefully deficient," and called for congress to , at a minimum , fund at least one additional b - 2 squadron of nine aircraft .

1999 usaf white paper on long - range bombers the 1999 usaf white paper on long - range bombers modified aircraft requirements slightly by increasing the b - 52 "attrition reserve" by five aircraft to compensate for sustainment issues .

the new requirement is 76 b - 52s , 93 b - 1s , and 21 b - 2s , with 130 bombers being "combat - coded" for operational taskings .

the study presented a replacement aircraft timeline , as requested by congress the previous year , calling for a new bomber to reach initial operational capability ( ioc ) by 2037 .

the study endorsed the air force's focus on modifying the current bomber fleet .

2001 qdr and 2001 long - range strike white paper the 2001 qdr called for a force of 112 "combat - coded" bomber aircraft .

following the completion of the 2001 qdr , the air force updated its 1999 white paper on long - range strike .

the updated 2001 white paper called for a 34-aircraft reduction in "combat - coded" bombers and a total bomber force of 157 aircraft .

to arrive at this force structure , the paper stated that 33 b - 1s and 17 b - 52s would be retired by the end of 2002 .

retirements and other alignments would result in an overall fleet of 76 b - 52s , 60 b - 1s , and 21 b - 2s .

the 96 "combat" aircraft called for in the white paper were 16 less than the 112 "combat - coded" aircraft called for in the 2001 qdr .

the air force stated that savings from retiring b - 1s would be invested in remaining b - 1s , and that "it is far more cost - effective to upgrade current bombers than it is to procure new aircraft. .

the white paper stated that prior conclusions about bomber service lives might no longer be valid due to operational and force - structure changes .

the white paper noted that b - 52s no longer fly regularly at low - level and stated that bomber fleet reductions would provide funding for fleet - wide improvements .

the paper stated that these developments might lead some to conclude that requiring a bomber by 2037 was premature .

2002 nuclear posture review ( npr ) the 2002 nuclear posture review called for a force 76 b - 52s and 21 b - 2s for nuclear missions .

the study supported air force plans at the time for a new bomber in the 2040 time frame , but also stated that "a need for additional or improved bomber capabilities could , however , move the 'need date' closer to the present. .
