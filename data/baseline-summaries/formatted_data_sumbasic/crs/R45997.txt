this report describes the structure , activities , legislative history , and funding history of seven federally - chartered regional commissions and authorities: the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) ; the delta regional authority ( dra ) ; the denali commission ; the northern border regional commission ( nbrc ) ; the northern great plains regional authority ( ngpra ) ; the southeast crescent regional commission ( scrc ) ; and the southwest border regional commission ( sbrc ) ( table a - 1 ) .

the federal regional commissions are also functioning examples of place - based and intergovernmental approaches to economic development , which receive regular congressional interest .

the federal regional commissions and authorities integrate federal and state economic development priorities alongside regional and local considerations ( figure a - 1 ) .

as federally - chartered agencies created by acts of congress , the federal regional commissions and authorities depend on congressional appropriations for their activities and administration , and are subject to congressional oversight .

seven federal regional commissions and authorities were authorized by congress to address instances of major economic distress in certain defined socio - economic regions , with all but one ( alaska's denali commission ) being multi - state regions ( figure b - 1 ) .

the first such federal regional commission , the appalachian regional commission , was founded in 1965 .

the other commissions and authorities may have roots in the intervening decades , but were not founded until 1998 ( denali ) , 2000 ( delta regional authority ) , and 2002 ( the northern great plains regional authority ) .

the most recent commissionsânorthern border regional commission , southeast crescent regional commission , and southwest border regional commissionâwere authorized in 2008 .

four of the seven entitiesâthe appalachian regional commission , the delta regional authority , the denali commission , and the northern border regional commissionâare currently active and receive regular annual appropriations .

certain strategic emphases and programs have evolved over time in each of the functioning federal regional commissions and authorities .

however , their overarching missions to address economic distress have not changed , and their associated activities have broadly remained consistent to those goals as funding has allowed .

in practice , the functioning federal regional commissions and authorities engage in their respective economic development efforts through multiple program areas , which may include , but are not limited to basic infrastructure ; energy ; ecology / environment and natural resources ; workforce / labor ; and business development .

the appalachian regional commission was established in 1965 to address economic distress in the appalachian region .

the arc's jurisdiction spans 420 counties in alabama , georgia , kentucky , maryland , mississippi , new york , north carolina , ohio , pennsylvania , south carolina , tennessee , virginia , and west virginia ( figure 1 ) .

the arc was originally created to address severe economic disparities between appalachia and that of the broader united states ; recently , its mission has grown to include regional competitiveness in a global economic environment .

the delta regional authority was established in 2000 to address economic distress in the mississippi river delta region .

the dra aims to "improve regional economic opportunity by helping to create jobs , build communities , and improve the lives of the 10 million people" in 252 designated counties and parishes in alabama , arkansas , illinois , kentucky , louisiana , mississippi , missouri , and tennessee ( figure 2 ) .

the denali commission was established in 1998 to support rural economic development in alaska .

it is "designed to provide critical utilities , infrastructure , and economic support throughout alaska. .

the denali commission is unique as a single - state commission , and in its reliance on federal funding for both administration and activities .

the northern border regional commission ( nbrc ) was created by the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , otherwise known as the 2008 farm bill .

the act also created the southeast crescent regional commission ( scrc ) and the southwest border regional commission ( sbrc ) .

all three commissions share common authorizing language modeled after the arc .

the nbrc is the only one of the three new commissions that has been both reauthorized and received progressively increasing annual appropriations since it was established in 2008 .

the nbrc was founded to alleviate economic distress in the northern border areas of maine , new hampshire , new york , and , as of 2018 , the entire state of vermont ( figure 4 ) .

the stated mission of the nbrc is "to catalyze regional , collaborative , and transformative community economic development approaches that alleviate economic distress and position the region for economic growth. .

eligible counties within the nbrc's jurisdiction may receive funding "for community and economic development" projects pursuant to regional , state , and local planning and priorities ( table c - 4 ) .

the northern great plains regional authority was created by the 2002 farm bill .

the ngpra was created to address economic distress in iowa , minnesota , missouri ( other than counties included in the delta regional authority ) , north dakota , nebraska , and south dakota .

the ngpra appears to have been briefly active shortly after it was created , when it received its only annual appropriation from congress .

the ngpra's funding authorization lapsed at the end of fy2018 ; it was not reauthorized .

the southeast crescent regional commission ( scrc ) was created by the 2008 farm bill , which also created the nbrc and the southwest border regional commission .

all three commissions share common authorizing language modeled after the arc .

the scrc is not currently active .

the scrc was created to address economic distress in areas of virginia , north carolina , south carolina , georgia , alabama , mississippi , and florida ( figure 6 ) not served by the arc or the dra ( table 13 ) .

the southwest border regional commission ( sbrc ) was created with the enactment of the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , or the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-234 ) , which also created the nbrc and the scrc .

all three commissions share common statutory authorizing language modeled after the arc .

the sbrc was created to address economic distress in the southern border regions of arizona , california , new mexico , and texas ( figure 7 ; table 1 5 ) .

the sbrc has not received an annual appropriation since it was created and is not currently active .

given their geographic reach , broad activities , and integrated intergovernmental structures , the federal regional commissions and authorities are a significant element of federal economic development efforts .

at the same time , as organizations that are largely governed by the respective state - based commissioners , the federal regional commissions and authorities are not typical federal agencies but federally - chartered entities that integrate federal funding and direction with state and local economic development priorities .

this structure provides congress with a flexible platform for economic development efforts .

the intergovernmental structure allows for strategic - level economic development initiatives to be launched at the federal level and implemented across multi - state jurisdictions with extensive state and local input , and more adaptable to regional needs .

the federal regional commissions and authorities reflect an emphasis by the federal government on place - based economic development strategies sensitive to regional and local contexts .

however , the geographic specificity and varying functionality of the statutorily authorized federal regional commissions and authorities , both active and inactive , potentially raise questions about the efficacy and equity of federal economic development policies .

more in - depth analysis of these and other such issues related to the federal regional authorities and commissions , and their role as instruments for federal economic development efforts , is reserved for possible future companion products to this report .
