the president is responsible for appointing individuals to certain positions in the federal government .

in some instances , the president makes these appointments using authorities granted to the president alone .

other appointments , generally referred to with the abbreviation pas , are made by the president with the advice and consent of the senate via the nomination and confirmation process .

this report identifies , for the 114 th congress , all nominations submitted to the senate for full - time positions on 34 regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions .

this report includes profiles on the leadership structure of each of these 34 boards and commissions as well as a pair of tables presenting information on each body's membership and appointment activity as of the end of the 114 th congress .

the profiles discuss the statutory requirements for the appointed positions , including the number of members on each board or commission , their terms of office , whether they may continue in their positions after their terms expire , whether political balance is required , and the method for selecting the chair .

the first table in each pair provides information on full - time positions requiring senate confirmation as of the end of the 114 th congress and the pay levels of those positions .

the second table tracks appointment activity for each board or commission within the 114 th congress by the senate ( confirmations , rejections , returns to the president , and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation ) as well as further related presidential activity ( including withdrawals and recess appointments ) .

in some instances , no appointment action occurred within a board or commission during the 114 th congress .
