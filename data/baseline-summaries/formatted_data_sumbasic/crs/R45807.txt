india is a federal parliamentary republic and the world's most populous democracy , with more than 1.3 billion citizens .

in the spring of 2019 the country held elections to seat its 17 th lok sabha ( house of the people ) , the 545-seat lower chamber of parliament and locus of indian political power .

results were announced on may 23 , with the incumbent bharatiya janata party ( bjp , or indian peoples party ) winning a sweeping and repeat victory under prime minister narendra modi .

having in 2014 become the first party to attain a parliamentary majority ( 52% ) in 30 years , the bjp was able to expand that majority to 56% in 2019 , becoming the first party to win consecutive majorities since 1971 .

the dynastic indian national congress ( hereinafter , congress party ) âwhich had dominated the country's politics from 1947 to 1977 and led a national coalition government from 2004 to 2014âagain failed to win the 10% minimum of seats required to officially lead the lok sabha opposition .

powerful regional and caste - based parties likewise posed no meaningful obstacles to the latest "bjp wave. .

the administration of president donald trump is seeking to expand upon a "strategic partnership" with india formally launched in 2005 .

progress is ongoing , most notably in the area of defense and security cooperation .

the u.s. congress has been supportive of efforts to expand and deepen the bilateral partnership , formally designating india as a "major defense partner" of the united states in 2016 .

areas of engagement are broad and include an array of economic and security initiatives .

recent bilateral frictions have arisen over trade practices , religious freedom , and india's relations with russia and iran .

a state department release congratulated prime minister modi and his ruling national democratic alliance ( nda ) coalition for their "decisive victory," and it applauded the indian people for turning out in historic numbers and the indian government for "exceptional execution of this massive undertaking. .

it went on to declare that the united states and india enjoy a strong strategic partnership that stands on a foundation of shared values , extensive people - to - people ties , and a commitment to a secure and prosperous indo - pacific region .

we look forward to working with the newly elected government on a range of important issuesâ¦ .

we are confident that the strong and upward trajectory of our partnership will continue .

the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee also issued a laudatory statement and , in june , several members of congress penned an open letter to president trump to "highlight the continuing strategic importance of the u.s. - india relationship. .

secretary of state michael pompeo met with modi and other top indian officials in new delhi in june to express enthusiasm about america's "natural strategic partner. .

president trump has yet to visit india , and high - level engagement occurs under the rubric of a "2+2 ministerial dialogue" inaugurated in september 2018 .

nevertheless , many independent observers express concern about emergent frictions and indications that the partnership is becoming dissonant .

a recent substantive overview of the relationship concluded that it "would benefit from some realism about its limitations. .

officials in governments across the indo - pacific region expect the election results to bring general continuity in indian policies .

given the instability and uncertainty that can accompany coalition governance , many likely regarded prime minister modi's convincing reelection with some relief .

modi's internationalist orientation can be seen in his energetic pursuit of diplomacy with numerous major powers and regional governments .

this includes though continued development of the u.s. - india strategic partnership , which is widely seen to be rooted in an array of mutually - held values and increasingly convergent visions for global order , lately conceived by washington as a "shared vision for a free , open , and rules - based indo - pacific region. .

on the economic front , modi's reputation as a reformer and liberalizer has met with mixed reviews .

five years in office realized no major land or labor reforms or meaningful efforts to address bad bank debt that were widely anticipated .

the bjp leader's assumed electoral vulnerabilitiesârelatively lackluster economic expansion ( averaging below 7% annually ) , joblessness , rising prices , and a widely panned 2016 "demonetization" initiativeâdid not end up degrading his impressive political support .

most market - oriented analysts are hopeful , but not entirely confident , that a "modi 2.0" government will redouble efforts to implement the kinds of economic reforms sought by the u.s. and other governments and business interests .

india possesses a robust and competitive multiparty democratic system .

yet its politics also are described as "beset by corruption" by freedom house , a think tank that ranks world countries on levels of political and civil liberties .

in 2017 , india had fallen 10 places on the economic intelligence unit democracy index to 42 nd in the world , due in part to "a rise of vigilantism and violence against minority communities , particularly muslims , as well as other dissenting voices. .

for 2018 , india was ranked 41 st worldwide , but its overall score was unchanged , and it maintained its designation as a "flawed democracy" ( as did the united states ) .

the scale of india's national election presents daunting logistical challenges , and voting was completed in seven phases .

as with each iteration , the event was history's largest democratic exercise: about 880 million peopleâone - ninth of the world's populationâwere eligible to cast ballots in the country's 29 states and 7 union territories , including some 84 million first - time voters .

more than 600 million indians participated , for a turnout rate of 67.4% .

more than 8,400 candidates and a record 669 parties vied for the lok sabha's 543 elected seats ; 36 parties won at least one seat , as did 4 independent candidates .

in addition to being history's largest democratic undertaking , india's 2019 national election was also history's most expensive: participating parties and candidates spent an estimated $8.7 billion on the campaign , more than double the 2014 spending .

the bjp reportedly received nearly three - quarters of all political donations .

such massive outlays raise concerns among many about fairness: there is little transparency in india's campaign finance system , the modi government had lifted caps on corporate donations , and the election commission's oversight is criticized for ineffectiveness .

in the lead - up to the 2019 voting , analysts debated whether the bjp's 2014 sweep was an anomaly in a decades - long era of coalition politics in new delhi , or marked the beginning of a new period of single - party domination as was seen under the congress party prior to 1989 .

the bjp's unexpected and even stronger showing in 2019 suggests that india's national political stage has undergone qualitative change back toward a hegemonic national party .

the bjp won by securing 303 seats with more than 37% of the aggregate vote , significantly exceeding the 272 seats required for majority status , and increasing the party's seat total from 282 in the previous lok sabha .

their closest competitors , the congress party , took 52 seats with 19.5% of the national vote , a net gain of 8 seats ( see table 1 ) .

according to election commission of india data , the bjp won a majority of votes cast in 10 states , as well as in the delhi national capital territory .

it also took 49.6% of the votes cast in uttar pradesh ( up ) , india's most populous state .

no other party was able to garner a majority of votes in any single state .

while the bjp's core support in india's western and north - central "hindi belt" states remained strong , and the party succeeded in expanding its appeal in the country's east , it was shut out completely in seven states , including the major southern states of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu , where regional parties prevailed .

in a sign of the congress party's historic collapse nationally , the party failed to win a single seat in 14 states , and nearly half of the seats the party did win ( 23 ) came from india's two southernmost states , kerala and tamil nadu ( see figure 1 , "map of indian states" ) .

the newly seated lok sabha is , on average , younger , wealthier , and better educated than its predecessor , and the number of female members has increased to 15% ( see text box ) .

upper - caste hindus and political families continue to enjoy disproportionately high representation , and india's large and relatively marginalized muslim minority community of about 190 million ( about 14% of the total ) suffers from a declining voice in parliament: muslim representation in the lok sabha peaked at 10% in 1980 and lingered at about 6% until dropping to 4% in 2014 .

a net gain of three muslim members in 2019 only slightly raised that percentage .

india's parliamentarians are also notable for the numbers who face formal criminal allegations .

because the bjp campaign was run largely on narendra modi's personal popularity rather than an explicit policy platform , it is unclear how modi will use his mandate going forward .

since 2014 , the modi government arguably has realized some foreign policy successes compatible with u.s. interests: sustaining the partnership with the united states , solidifying the partnership with japan , strengthening ties with israel while making new outreach to key persian gulf states such as saudi arabia and the uae , and articulating a vision for the indo - pacific region that tracks well with that of the united states .

modi has successfully projected india as the world's next big economic opportunity after china , but critics argue that he has mostly squandered an opportunity to move india into great power status , with a lack of strategic vision harming india's position vis - ã  - vis major powers and smaller neighbors , alike .

given india's myriad domestic problems , and still - limited capacity to project power , some american observers are skeptical about its near - term potential to play the role sought for it by the u.s. congress and successive administrations .

the modi / bjp victory has empowered the indian leader domestically and this may provide modi and india new opportunities on the global stage .

given modi's reputation for favoring a "muscular" foreign policy , he may now be more willing to resist chinese assertiveness and move closer to the united states .

yet troubles with the united states also could loom: many indian strategic thinkers say their country's national interests are well served by engaging not just with the united states but also with russia and iran , which could limit to new delhi's willingness to abide what some indian observers describe as "america's short - term impulses. .

while new delhi generally welcomes the u.s. "free and open indo - pacific" ( foip ) strategy , indian leaders continue to demur from confronting china .

the united states and india also seek to cooperate on energy , climate change , and space issues , and have sometimes clashing views on immigration .

trade and economic ties , an important and growing part of bilateral relations , have faced recent challenges .

prime minister modi's strong electoral mandate suggests india's mixed economic performance did not hurt his standing with the public , and the results may embolden the bjp to press ahead with its reform agenda with greater vigor ( see text box , below ) .

the trump administration takes issue with the u.s. trade deficit with india and "unfair" trade practices that restrict u.s. exports to and investment in india .

some u.s. policymakers and businesses have been disappointed that , during modi's first term , india did not move forward with market - opening reforms as they had hoped , and instead increased tariffs and trade restrictions .

for example , recent tariff hikes by new delhi on cell phones and other products have elevated long - standing u.s. concerns about india's tariff regime , and president trump has called india the "tariff king. .

other u.s. concerns include inadequate intellectual property protection and enforcement , and restrictive new rules on e - commerce and localization of certain financial data flowsâwhich affect major u.s. companies , such as amazon , walmart - owned flipkart , visa , and mastercard .

the united states and india also often have opposing stances on multilateral trade issues in the world trade organization .

the outlook for bilateral trade relations is unclear .

both sides have taken decisive actions on simmering issues .

president trump terminated india's eligibility for the generalized system of preferences ( gsp ) , effective on june 5 , 2019 , after determining that "india has not assured the united states that india will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. .

this decision followed a u.s. investigation into india's market access practices and petitions by u.s. dairy and medical technology industries .

in 2018 , india was the largest beneficiary of gsp , with over one - tenth ( $6.3 billion ) of u.s. goods imports from india entering duty - free under the program .

india , which called the eligibility termination "unfortunate," announced soon after that it would impose higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 u.s. products , including almonds , apples , and walnuts , in response to u.s .

section 232 ( national - security - based ) steel and aluminum tariffs .

during 2018 , india repeatedly delayed applying retaliatory tariffs , in hopes of negotiating a resolution of bilateral trade issues .

in late june , president trump called india's 2019 imposition of retaliatory tariffs "unacceptable" and said they "must be withdrawn. .

at the june 2019 g - 20 summit , the two sides appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone .

president trump said a "very big" trade deal would be coming with india .

according to india's foreign secretary , the "trade ministers of both countries would meet at an early date and would try to sort out these issues. .

yet lack of progress in recent months reportedly is prompting the administration to consider launching a section 301 investigation of india's trade practicesâthis would make india the focus of the next major , in - depth investigation of unfair trade practices after china .

on one hand , section 301 could be a new way to address long - standing issues of u.s. concern with respect to india .

on the other hand , it could raise the risk of protracted bilateral trade tensions and tit - for - tat escalation of tariffs across many economic sectors .

continuity in india's leadership may lead to continued rapid development of u.s. - india security cooperation , with u.s. leaders hoping that increased indian capabilities will provide greater net security regionally and worldwide ( in spite of some u.s. concerns about new delhi's ties with moscow ) .

president obama and congress recognized india as a "major defense partner" ( mdp ) in 2016 , a unique designation allowing india to receive license - free access to dual - use american technologies .

the mdp designation was created in large part to carry over a presumption of license approvals into the new u.s. administration .

it was linked to india's joining the four major multilateral export control regimes to become eligible to receive licensing for the most advanced defense systems the united states exports .

in mid - 2018 , india received strategic trade authorization tier - 1 status , putting it on par with nato allies , and the two countries concluded a long - sought communications , compatibility , and security agreement ( comcasa ) , a military - to - military "enabling agreement. .

the two governments also seek expanded collaboration via the defense technology and trade initiative , launched in 2012 , which aims to facilitate greater defense trade and technology sharing .

india participates in formalized "quadrilateral consultations" with the united states , japan , and australia while downplaying prospects that the "quad" may become a security - related architecture .

defense trade is a leading facet of the bilateral partnership .

india is now a major purchaser in the global arms market and a lucrative potential customer for u.s. companies .

the two nations have signed defense contracts worth about $15 billion since 2008 , up from $500 million in all previous years combined .

washington seeks to identify sales that can proceed under the technology - sharing and co - production model sought by new delhi while also urging reform in india's defense offsets policy .

since 2002 , the united states and india have held a series of increasingly complex combined bilateral exercises involving all military servicesâindia now conducts more exercises and personnel exchanges with the united states than with any other country .

a first - ever tri - service exercise is set for later in 2019 .

bilateral intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation has accelerated over the past decade .

in addition to intelligence sharing , homeland security cooperation has included growing engagement between respective law enforcement agencies , especially in the areas of mutual legal assistance and extradition , and on cyberterrorism and cybersecurity .

terrorist groups operating from pakistani territory are of special interest .

india broadly endorses the foip strategy pursued by washington , and it benefits from the higher visibility this strategy provides for india's global role and for its immediate region .

yet india has not fully relinquished the "nonalignment" posture it maintained for most of the cold war ( more recently pursuing "strategic autonomy" or a "pragmatic and outcome - oriented foreign policy" ) .

thus , modi has articulated a vision of a free , open , and inclusive indo - pacific , and india remains wary of joining any nascent or potential security architectures that could antagonize beijing .

india - china .

modi's win likely means a continuation of new delhi's multilateralist / multipolar approach to international politics in asia , as well as efforts to resist chinese "assertiveness" in south asia .

india's relations with china have been fraught for decades , with signs of increasing enmity in recent years .

areas of contention include major border and territorial disputes , china's role as pakistan's primary international benefactor , the presence in india of the dalai lama and a self - described tibetan "government," and china's growing presence in the indian ocean region , which many indians view as an encroachment in their neighborhood .

new delhi is ever watchful for signs that beijing seeks to "contain" indian influence both regionally and globally .

china's briâwith "flagship" projects in pakistanâis taken by many in india ( and elsewhere ) as an expression of beijing's hegemonic intentions .

india - pakistan .

the united states has long sought to assist in reducing india - pakistan conflict and its impact on developments in afghanistan .

a surge of indian nationalism grew out of a february 2019 international crisis involving pakistan .

coming just weeks before voting began in india , the confrontation was widely seen to have boosted modi's electoral prospects .

in contrast to his 2014 inauguration , when pakistan's then - prime minister was an invited guest , modi in 2019 omitted pakistani prime minister imran khan from swearing - in festivities .

it is unclear if the indian leader will seek to use his political capital to launch a new peace initiative with islamabad or will continue pursuing punitive policies that aim to isolate pakistan internationally .

some analysts contend that modi now has sufficient standing to change tack .

others , however , suggest that his reelection "will be projected as a vindication of his belligerent policy toward pakistan. .

india - russia .

india maintained close ties with russia throughout much of the cold war and continues to rely on moscow for the bulk of its defense imports .

with the 2017 enactment of the countering america's adversaries through sanctions act ( caatsa , p.l .

115-44 ) in u.s. law , india's continued major arms purchases from russiaâmost prominently a current multi - billion - dollar deal to purchase the russian - made s - 400 air defense systemâcould trigger u.s. sanctions .

although congress subsequently provided for a national security waiver of these sanctions , the administration has consistently counseled india to cancel the purchase and consider u.s. - supplied alternatives , while new delhi insists that it will go forward in pursuit of its own national interest , a position possibly hardened with the bjp mandate .

india - iran .

india has historically friendly relations with iran , a country that lately has supplied about 30% of india's energy imports .

it also opposes any potential acquisition of nuclear weapons by iran and supports the joint comprehensive plan of action .

historically averse to unilateral ( non - u.n. ) sanctions , new delhi until recently enjoyed exemption from u.s. efforts targeting iran's energy sector .

in april 2019 , the trump administration ended such exemptions , and new delhi has issued conflicting statements about its cessation of iranian oil purchases while informing washington that such cessation "comes at a cost. .

continued tensions in the persian gulf and / or a longer - term boycott of iranian oil could be disruptive to the indian economy ; modi's strong mandate could place limits on his willingness to abide such disruption .

other notable relations .

the trump administration's south asia strategy has included calls for greater indian involvement in afghanistan , even as such engagement vexes pakistan ( new delhi has committed about $3 billion to afghan reconstruction to date ) .

islamabad is wary of the indian presence in afghanistan and accuses new delhi of supporting anti - pakistan groups there , a dynamic that can in turn affect u.s. efforts to sustain pakistan's help in facilitating afghanistan reconciliation .

many analysts expect india - afghanistan ties to grow stronger with modi's reelection , and new delhi appears wary of any precipitous u.s. withdrawal from afghanistan .

meanwhile , india's deepening "strategic partnership" with japan is a major aspect of new delhi's broader "act east" policy and a key axis in the greater foip strategies broadly pursued by all three governments participating in a newly established u.s. - japan - india trilateral dialogue .

prime minister modi appears to have a convivial personal relationship with his japanese counterpart and bilateral ties are seen as likely to strengthen going forward .

while prime minister modi and his party have long sought to emphasize development and good governance , the 2019 election cycle revolved around nationalism and other emotive issues , with many observers arguing that hindu majoritarianism is a threat both to india's religious minorities and to the country's syncretic traditions .

according to the u.s. state department and independent watchdogs , india is the site of numerous human rights violations , many of them serious and some perpetrated , or at least tolerated , by state actors .

many observers are concerned about the impact of growing religious bigotry and hindu nationalism on human rights .

the bjp is an openly hindu nationalist party and prime minister modi is a self - avowed hindu nationalist .

in 2005 , modi was denied a u.s. visa over concerns about his role in government during lethal anti - muslim violence in 2002 .

modi hit conciliatory notes in a national address three days after the 2019 election results were announced , vowing to seek the trust of minority groups and to work for the good of all indians .

human rights nongovernmental organizations and social service groups have seen their indian operations constrained in recent years , and observers are watching closely for signs that the modi / bjp mandate will lead to renewed efforts toward hindu nationalist goals .

some of theseâincluding laws preventing religious conversions and cow slaughterâcontinue to cause sparks in u.s. - india relations , including explicit bjp criticism of the u.s. government for alleged "bias" against modi .

future moves by the modi government on other "hindutva" policies could increase national divisions and lead to further international opprobrium .
