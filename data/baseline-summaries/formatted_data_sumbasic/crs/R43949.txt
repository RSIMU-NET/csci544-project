the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) is a federal - state program that provides health coverage to certain uninsured , low - income children and pregnant women in families that have annual income above medicaid eligibility levels but do not have health insurance .

chip is jointly financed by the federal government and the states and is administered by the states .

participation in chip is voluntary , and all states , the district of columbia , and the territories participate .

the federal government sets basic requirements for chip , but states have the flexibility to design their own version of chip within the federal government's basic framework .

as a result , there is significant variation across chip programs .

states may design their chip programs in one of three ways: a chip medicaid expansion , a separate chip program , or a combination approach in which the state operates a chip medicaid expansion and one or more separate chip programs concurrently .

chip benefit coverage and cost - sharing rules depend on program design .

chip medicaid expansions must follow the federal medicaid rules for benefits and cost sharing .

for separate chip programs , the benefits are permitted to look more like private health insurance , and states may impose cost sharing , such as premiums or enrollment fees , with a maximum allowable amount that is tied to annual family income .

federal appropriations for chip are provided in statute .

in recent years , the appropriations had been provided a couple years at a time .

for instance , the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) provided appropriations for fy2014 and fy2015 , and the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra ; p.l .

114-10 ) added appropriations for fy2016 and fy2017 .

however , the continuing resolution enacted on january 22 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-120 ) , and the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 , p.l .

115-123 ) together provided 10 years of chip funding .

currently , chip is funded through fy2027 .

this report provides an overview of chip financing , beginning with an explanation of the federal matching rate .

it describes various aspects of federal chip funding , such as the federal appropriation , state allotments , the child enrollment contingency fund , redistribution funds , and outreach and enrollment grants .

the report ends with a section about the recent legislative activity that has resulted in federal funding for chip being provided through fy2027 .

the federal government's share of chip expenditures ( including both services and administration ) is determined by the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage ( e - fmap ) rate .

the e - fmap rate is based on the fmap rate , which is the federal matching rate for the medicaid program .

the fmap formula compares each state's average per capita income with average u.s. per capita income .

the formula provides higher reimbursement to states with lower incomes ( with a statutory maximum of 83% ) and lower reimbursement to states with higher incomes ( with a statutory minimum of 50% ) .

the e - fmap rate is calculated by reducing the state share under the regular fmap rate by 30% .

statutorily , the e - fmap ( or federal matching rate ) can range from 65% to 85% .

for some chip expenditures , the federal matching rate is different from the e - fmap rate .

for instance , the matching rate for translation and interpretation services is the higher of 75% or states' e - fmap rate plus 5 percentage points .

also , the children's health insurance program reauthorization act ( chipra ; p.l .

111-3 ) included a provision that reduced the matching rate to the regular fmap rate for children with family incomes exceeding 300% of the federal poverty level ( fpl ) with an exception for certain states .

the aca included a provision to increase the e - fmap rate by 23 percentage points ( not to exceed 100% ) for most chip expenditures from fy2016 through fy2019 .

the continuing resolution enacted on january 22 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-120 ) , extended the increase to the e - fmap rate by one year ( i.e. , through fy2020 ) , but the increase for fy2020 is to be 11.5 percentage points rather than 23 percentage points .

the increase to the e - fmap does not apply to certain expenditures , such as translation services , chip children above 300% of fpl ( with an exception for certain states ) , expenditures for administration of citizenship documentation requirements , expenditures for administration of payment error rate measurement , and medicaid coverage of certain breast or cervical cancer patients .

the 23 percentage point increase changed the statutory range of the e - fmap rate to between 88% and 100% .

in fy2018 , 13 states have e - fmap rates of 100% .

figure 1 shows the state distribution of e - fmap rates for fy2018 , with the 23 percentage point increase .

because the federal share of chip is significantly higher with this increase , states are spending through the federal chip funding allocated to them ( i.e. , state chip allotments ) faster with the increased e - fmap rate .

federal chip funding is mandatory spending ( i.e. , funding controlled outside of the annual appropriations process through authorizing laws ) , and this funding is an entitlement to states that adhere to the federal chip rules .

the funding for this program is provided through a mandatory appropriation set in statute .

figure 2 shows the federal appropriation amounts and federal expenditures for chip from fy1998 through fy2016 .

the federal appropriation amount is the maximum amount of federal funding for chip .

most of the federal chip expenditures are from state chip allotments , which are the federal funds allocated to each state to finance its chip program .

in addition to allotments , states could receive shortfall funding , such as child enrollment contingency fund payments , redistribution funds , or medicaid funds .

some chip funding is used to finance some medicaid expenses .

in addition , states can receive outreach and enrollment grants .

fy2018 began on october 1 , 2017 , without federal chip funding having been appropriated for the fiscal year .

the full - year fy2018 appropriation for chip was not provided until january 22 , 2018 , when chip was provided appropriations for fy2018 through fy2023 .

figure 4 shows a timeline of the legislative activity for chip funding from october 1 , 2017 , through february 9 , 2018 , when chip was provided appropriations for fy2024 through fy2027 .

at the beginning of fy2018 , states funded the federal share of their chip programs with unspent funds from their fy2017 allotments ; when states exhausted that funding , redistribution funds were available ( i.e. , unspent allotments from fy2016 and prior years redistributed to shortfall states ) .

since the redistribution funds were insufficient to fully fund all states for fy2018 , each state received a proportionate share of the available funds based on the shortfall in that state .

in december 2017 , some states were expected to exhaust funding from these sources , and short - term funding for chip was provided through the continuing resolutions enacted on december 8 , 2017 ( p.l .

115-90 ) , and december 22 , 2017 ( p.l .

115-96 ) .

on december 8 , 2017 , a law ( p.l .

115-90 ) was enacted to extend continuing appropriations for federal agencies and programs , and this law included language amending the chip statute to add a special rule for redistribution funds available through chip for the first quarter of fy2018 .

the special rule prioritized the allocation of redistribution funds to emergency shortfall states , which were states estimated to exhaust federal chip funding before january 1 , 2018 .

on december 22 , 2017 , a law ( p.l .

115-96 ) was enacted to extend continuing appropriations for most federal agencies and programs ( among other things ) through january 19 , 2018 .

section 3201 of p.l .

115-96 ( 1 ) provided $2.85 billion in appropriations for chip for the period of october 1 , 2017 , through march 31 , 2018 , and ( 2 ) extended the special rule for redistribution funds that was added by p.l .

115-90 for every month through march 2018 .

the short - term funding provided in p.l .

115-96 was available through march 31 , 2018 .

the full - year chip appropriation for fy2018 was included in the continuing resolution enacted on january 22 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-120 ) .

this law also provides chip appropriations for fy2019 through fy2023 , and it extends the child enrollment contingency fund , the qualifying states option , and the outreach and enrollment grants for fy2018 through fy2023 .

in addition , p.l .

115-120 extends the increase to the e - fmap rate by one year ( i.e. , through fy2020 ) , but the increase is to be 11.5 percentage points rather than 23 percentage points ( i.e. , the increase for fy2016 through fy2019 ) .

bba 2018 further extends chip funding for fy2024 through fy2027 , and it also extends the child enrollment contingency fund , the qualifying states option , and the outreach and enrollment grants for fy2024 through fy2027 .
