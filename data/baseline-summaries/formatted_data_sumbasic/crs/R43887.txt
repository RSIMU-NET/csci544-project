originally enacted in 1965 , the older americans act ( oaa ) supports a wide range of social services and programs for individuals aged 60 years and older .

these services include supportive services , congregate nutrition services ( i.e. , meals served at group sites such as senior centers , community centers , schools , churches , senior housing complexes ) , home - delivered nutrition services , family caregiver support , community service employment , the long - term care ombudsman program , and services to prevent the abuse , neglect , and exploitation of older persons .

the oaa contains seven titles .

except for title v , community service employment for older americans ( cseoa ) , all programs are administered by the administration on aging ( aoa ) in the administration for community living ( acl ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .

title v is administered by the department of labor's ( dol's ) employment and training administration .

as such , discretionary funding for oaa titles ii , iii , iv , vi , and vii is provided in annual hhs appropriations ; oaa title v funding is provided in the annual dol appropriations .

title i does not authorize appropriations .

since the enactment of oaa , congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times .

in the past , oaa reauthorization has included extending the act's authorizations of appropriations for a five - year period .

the last oaa reauthorization occurred in 2006 , when congress enacted the older americans act amendments of 2006 ( p.l .

109-365 ) , which authorized appropriations through fy2011 .

although the authorizations of appropriations under the act expired at the end of fy2011 , congress has continued to appropriate funding for oaa - authorized programs and activities .

this report discusses oaa funding .

it begins with an overview of oaa's fy2015 funding and provides a detailed breakdown of current - year funding for each of the act's programs and activities .

the report then reviews oaa's funding history since fy2001 .

next , it summarizes fy2015 legislative activity with respect to oaa appropriations .

it concludes with a discussion of fy2015 funding decisions for selected oaa programs .

the following appendixes provide more detailed oaa funding information and funding history .

appendix a shows the authorizations of appropriations for each title of the act as stipulated by the 2006 older americans act amendments ( p.l .

109-365 ) .

appendix b provides funding levels for oaa programs from fy2006 through fy2015 .

for general background on dol and hhs appropriations , see crs report r43236 , labor , health and human services , and education: fy2014 appropriations .

for more information about the older americans act , see crs report r43414 , older americans act: background and overview .

the fy2015 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( p.l .

113-235 ) funded oaa programs at $1.878 billion , which is $6.5 million ( 0.3% ) more than fy2014 funding .

figure 1 shows the distribution of fy2015 oaa funding by title , with program level detail for title iii state and community programs on aging .

title iii programs received the largest proportion of oaa funding , with 70.7% of funding appropriated to nutrition , supportive services , family caregivers , and health promotion activities .

almost one - fourth of oaa funding ( 23.1% ) was allocated to title v , the cseoa program .

the remaining funds were allocated to aoa - administered activities under titles ii ( 2.7% ) and iv ( 0.7% ) , grants to native americans under title vi ( 1.7% ) , and vulnerable elder rights protection activities under title vii ( 1.1% ) .

for most oaa programs , fy2015 funding was the same as in fy2014 , with two exceptions .

under title iv , aging network support activities received $2.5 million in new fy2015 funding for supportive services for holocaust survivors living in the united states .

also under title iv , elder rights support activities received $4.0 million in new fy2015 funding for an elder justice initiative .

table 1 provides details of fy2013 , fy2014 , and fy2015 funding for oaa programs , as well as changes from fy2014 to fy2015 .

changes are shown in millions of dollars and as a percentage ( not adjusted for inflation ) .

total discretionary funding for oaa programs increased slightly from fy2001 to fy2002 , and remained relatively flat through fy2006 .

annual increases in oaa program funding occurred from fy2006 to fy2010 .

since then , overall oaa funding levels have remained below the fy2010 level ( see figure 2 ) .

oaa funding increased steadily from $1.783 billion in fy2006 to $2.328 billion in fy2010 , an overall increase of 31% over this time period ( not adjusted for inflation ) .

additional funding was provided in fy2009 under the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) .

for fy2010 , a one - time special appropriation funded the cseoa program to serve low - income seniors affected by the recession .

total discretionary funding for oaa programs declined in fy2011 through fy2013 , with fy2013 funding falling below the fy2007 level ( $1.807 billion in fy2013 compared with $1.855 billion in fy2007 ) .

most of the 5.5% reduction from fy2012 to fy2013 is attributable to sequestration .

for fy2014 and fy2015 , total oaa funding was above the fy2013 level but slightly below the fy2012 level .

 ( amounts in this discussion are not adjusted for inflation ) .

for more details on funding for oaa programs for fy2006 through fy2015 , see appendix b .

president obama signed the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 ) , on december 16 , 2014 , which provided $1.878 billion in fy2015 funding for oaa programs and activities .

as with the fy2014 consolidated appropriations act , the fy2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated acl account structure , rather than the previous aoa account structure .

consequently , in this report , fy2014 and fy2015 funding for oaa title ii "program administration" now reflect program administration costs for aging and disability services programs administered by acl , not just aging services programs administered by aoa as in prior years .

the following section highlights differences for selected oaa programs and issues among the fy2015 president's budget request , the senate subcommittee - approved fy2015 labor - hhs - education appropriations bill ( senate bill ) , the house minority fy2015 labor - hhs - education appropriations bill ( h.r .

5464 ) , and final fy2015 funding enacted under p.l .

113-235 .

these programs and issues include funding for the cseoa program , holocaust survivors' support , aging and disability resource centers ( adrcs ) , and the white house conference on aging .

title v , community service employment for older americans ( cseoa ) , also known as the senior community service employment program ( scsep ) , was established to promote useful part - time opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low - income persons aged 55 and older who have poor employment prospects .

the fy2015 budget request proposed to transfer responsibility for administering the cseoa program from dol to acl , stating that participants would benefit from cseoa's integration with other aging services programs administered by acl .

it also proposed $380.0 million in funding for fy2015 , which would be 13% less than fy2014 .

of the 56 state and territorial grantees operating cseoa programs , 17 are in state labor departments , whereas the remainder are in aging , senior services , or health and human services departments .

the fy2015 proposal noted that acl shared cseoa's mission of "helping older americans maintain their independence ( both economic independence and living arrangements ) and active participation in communities" and that the transfer to acl "would consolidate federal oversight of the oaa under one department , streamlining operations and putting federal administration of cseoa in alignment with operations in the field. .

current law does not provide for such a transfer through administrative action alone ; congress would have to pass legislation authorizing such a transfer to take effect .

the fy2012 , fy2013 , and fy2014 president's budget requests similarly proposed transferring cseoa to acl .

if placed in hhs , acl would target the program to persons with the greatest need , to consider "all sources of income" in determining the eligibility of future enrollees , and to target funds to areas "where performance data indicate the potential for the largest impact. .

acl also proposed restructuring cseoa as a community service program , stating that in the past , cseoa was administered alongside workforce investment act programs designed to meet the needs of businesses and workers looking to advance in their careers .

acl found that the cseoa program did not "fit well" in the workforce investment act framework , because "the older scsep worker is not looking to build a resume but rather to increase his or her income and contribute to the community. .

the senate bill would have funded cseoa at the fy2014 level .

in its draft report , the subcommittee recommended keeping cseoa in dol , similar to previous recommendations given in labor - hhs - education committee reports in each of fy2012 to fy2014 .

h.r .

5464 would have funded cseoa under the dol account at $448.3 million ( $13.9 million more than fy2014 funding ) .

final fy2015-enacted funding made no changes to cseoa program administration .

thus , for fy2015 the program remains funded and administered under dol , with the same appropriations as in fy2014 .

p.l .

113-235 also allowed the secretary of labor to reserve not more than 0.5% of the cseoa appropriation for evaluation of the program .

acl estimates that approximately 130,000 holocaust survivors live in the united states , and of those , 25% live in poverty .

the president's fy2015 budget proposed $5.0 million in oaa title iv funding to establish a holocaust survivor assistance fund ( the fund ) , which would also receive matching dollars from private philanthropy .

the fund would have provided supportive services for holocaust survivors , such as legal assistance and case management .

the senate bill did not propose funding for the holocaust survivor assistance fund "due to budget constraints. .

however , the draft report urged acl to prioritize this population within its existing programs .

similarly , h.r .

5464 did not specify funding for holocaust survivors .

although fy2015 final funding did not establish the budget's proposed holocaust survivor assistance fund , it did include $2.5 million in new discretionary funding to provide supportive services for aging holocaust survivors in fy2015 .

the aim of aging and disability resource centers ( adrcs ) is to create "one - stop shop" single entry points for information about the range of public and private long - term services and supports ( ltss ) available to consumers .

adrcs may provide counseling regarding public and private ltss options , as well as access to public programs such as medicaid and department of veterans affairs programs .

adrcs also provide discharge planning and care transition services to help individuals remain in their own homes after a hospitalization , rehabilitation , or skilled nursing facility visit .

there are currently more than 500 adrc sites nationwide , operating in 50 states , two territories , and the district of columbia .

in fy2012 , adrcs had 5.2 million contacts with clients .

from fy2010 through fy2014 , adrcs received $10 million in mandatory funding enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) , in addition to discretionary funding authorized under oaa title ii ( $6.1 million in fy2014 ) .

the president's fy2015 budget proposed no fy2015 discretionary funding for adrcs , and $20.0 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding .

the budget justification noted that since 2003 , aoa and the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) have provided $100 million "to develop the foundational infrastructure" for adrc services .

it also noted that with additional funding , some adrc programs could assist states in meeting requirements for an enhanced federal matching rate under the medicaid balancing incentive payments program .

the senate bill would have provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding for adrcs .

the senate subcommittee also urged acl to improve coordination among adrcs , area agencies on aging ( aaas ) , and centers for independent living ( cils ) to ensure that there is "no wrong door" for consumer access to long - term services and supports .

h.r .

5464 did not specify a particular dollar amount for adrcs .

final fy2015-enacted funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding to adrcs , the same as the fy2014 discretionary amount .

it did not fulfill the president's budget request for additional mandatory funding .

in the past , the white house conferences on aging have offered an opportunity to focus national , state , and local attention on concerns of older individuals and have provided direction to federal policymakers .

the precursor to the decennial white house conferences was the national conference on aging held in 1950 during the truman administration .

eleven years after this first national conference , the first white house conference on aging was held in 1961 .

subsequent white house conferences on aging were held in every decade ( in 1971 , 1981 , 1995 , and 2005. ) .

the president's fy2015 budget request proposed $3.0 million , to be made available through fy2016 , to hold a white house conference on aging in 2015 .

the senate bill provided no dedicated funding for the conference , citing budget constraints .

however , the draft report encouraged acl to support the conference with existing resources from hhs , the white house , and across the federal government .

h.r .

5464 did not specify funding for the white house conference on aging .

furthermore , no dedicated funding for the conference was provided in final fy2015-enacted appropriations .

the white house plans to hold the conference in 2015 in washington , dc .

the conference website notes that "without direct appropriations , the scale and scope of the conference will differ from previous conferences .

however , as we go forward , we expect to use technology and other tools not available in the past to reach and engage more people than was previously possible. .

the white house conference on aging will recognize the 80 th anniversary of social security and the 50 th anniversary of medicare , medicaid , and the older americans act .

policy areas highlighted include retirement security , healthy aging , long - term services and supports , and elder justice .

conference organizers have also announced regional forums and listening sessions to be held through the year to obtain input for the conference .
