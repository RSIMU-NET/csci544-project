the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) administers a computer system of systems that is used to query federal , state , local , tribal , and territorial criminal history record information ( chri ) and other records to determine if an indiv idual is eligible to receive and possess a firearm .

this fbi - administered system is the national instant criminal background check system ( nics ) .

this system , or parallel state systems , must be checked and the transfer approved by an fbi nics examiner or state point of contact ( poc ) before a federally licensed gun dealer may transfer a firearm to any customer who is not similarly licensed federally as a gun dealer .

under current law , persons who buy and sell firearms repeatedly for profit and as a principal source of their livelihood must be licensed federally as gun dealers .

federally licensed gun dealersâotherwise known as federal firearms licensees ( ffls ) âare permitted to engage in interstate and , by extension , intrastate ( i.e. , within a state ) firearms commerce with certain restrictions .

for example , they may not transfer a handgun to an unlicensed , out - of - state resident .

conversely , persons who occasionally buy and sell firearms for personal use , or to enhance a personal collection , are not required to be licensed federally as a gun dealer .

those unlicensed persons , however , are prohibited generally from making interstate firearms transactionsâthat is , engaging in interstate firearms commerceâwithout engaging the services of a federally licensed gun dealer .

on the other hand , current law does not require background checks for intrastate , private - party firearms transactions between nondealing , unlicensed persons , though such checks might be required under several state laws .

nevertheless , it is unlawful for anybody , ffls or private parties , to transfer a firearm or ammunition to any person they have reasonable cause to believe is a prohibited person ( eg , a convicted felon , a fugitive from justice , or an unlawfully present alien ) .

in the 116 th congress , the house of representatives has passed three bills that would significantly expand the federal firearms background check requirements and the current prohibitions on the transfer or receipt and possession of firearms related to domestic violence .

those bills are the bipartisan background checks act of 2019 ( h.r .

8 ) , a bill to expand federal firearms recordkeeping and background check requirements to include private - party , intrastate firearms transfers ; enhanced background checks act of 2019 ( h.r .

1112 ) , a bill to extend the amount of time allowed to delay a firearms transfer , pending a completed background check to determine an individual's eligibility ; and violence against women reauthorization act of 2019 ( h.r .

1585 ) , a bill to expand firearms transfer or receipt and possession prohibitions to include dating partners with histories of domestic violence and stalking misdemeanors .

in addition , several multiple - casualty shootings have highlighted possibly systemic vulnerabilities in the nics - related federal background check procedures , particularly with regard to making records on prohibited persons accessible to federal data systems queried as part of the federal background check process .

this report provides an overview of federal firearms statutes related to firearms transactions in interstate and intrastate commerce , dealer licensing , receipt and possession eligibility , nics background check procedures , analysis of recent legislative action , and discussion about possible issues for congress .

two major federal statutes regulate firearms commerce and possession in the united states .

the gun control act of 1968 ( gca ; 18 u.s.c .

â§921 et seq. ) .

regulates all modern ( nonantique ) firearms .

in addition , the national firearms act , enacted in 1934 ( nfa ; 26 u.s.c .

â§5801 et seq .

 ) , regulates certain other firearms and devices that congress deemed to be particularly dangerous because they were often the weapons of choice of gangsters in the 1930s .

such weapons include machine guns , short - barreled rifles and shotguns , suppressors ( silencers ) , a catch - all class of concealable firearms classified as "any other weapon," and destructive devices ( eg , grenades , rocket launchers , mortars , other big - bore weapons , and related ordnance ) .

congress passed both the nfa and gca to reduce violent crimes committed with firearms .

more specifically , the purpose of the gca is to assist federal , state , local , tribal , and territorial law enforcement in the ongoing effort to reduce crime and violence .

it is not intended to place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on citizens in regard to lawful acquisition , possession , or use of firearms for hunting , trapshooting , target shooting , personal protection , or any other lawful activity .

many observers have long noted that the assassinations of president john f. kennedy and his brother , senator robert f. kennedy , and civil rights leader martin luther king provided the impetus to pass the gca .

perhaps equally compelling were the august 1 , 1966 , university of texas tower mass shooting and social unrest that accompanied the 1960s .

under the attorney general's delegation , the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) is the principal agency that administers and enforces these statutes .

in addition , atf administers several provisions of the arms export control act of 1976 ( aeca ) with regard to the importation of certain firearms , firearms parts , and ammunition that are also regulated under the gca and nfa .

for the most part , however , the fbi maintains nics and administers the background check provisions of the gca .

nonetheless , as discussed below , atf is charged with investigating whether denied persons made false statements in connection with a firearms transfer ; when filling out federal firearms transaction forms .

in addition , atf is also charged with firearms retrieval actions , whenever delayed transactions and incomplete background checks possibly result in prohibited persons acquiring firearms .

after six years of debate , congress passed the brady handgun violence prevention act , 1993 ( brady act ) .

sponsors of the brady act initially proposed requiring a seven - day waiting period for handgun transfers .

instead , congress amended the gca with the brady act to require electronic background checks on any federally unlicensed individual seeking to acquire a firearm from an ffl .

the brady act included both interim and permanent provisions .

under the interim provisions , ffls were required to contact local chief law enforcement officers ( cleos ) to determine the eligibility of prospective customers to be transferred a handgun .

cleos were given up to five business days to make such eligibility determinations .

from february 28 , 1994 , to november 29 , 1998 , under the interim provisions , 12.7 million firearms background checks ( for handguns ) were completed , resulting in 312,000 denials .

the permanent provisions of the brady act became effective when the fbi activated the national instant criminal background check system ( nics ) on november 30 , 1998 .

under these provisions , ffls are required to initiate a background check through nics on any prospective unlicensed customer , who seeks to acquire a firearm from them through a sale , trade , or redemption of firearms exchanged for collateral .

failure to conduct a nics check is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and one year imprisonment , or both .

ffls may engage in firearms transfers among themselves without conducting background checks .

the brady act includes a provision that prohibits the establishment of a registration system of firearms , firearms owners , or firearms transactions or dispositions with nics - generated records , except for records on nics denials for persons who are prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under the gca .

in addition , in the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act , congress included a permanent appropriations limitation that requires the fbi to destroy background check records within 24 hours on persons who are eligible to receive firearms .

from november 30 , 1998 , through 2018 , the fbi nics section facilitated nearly 305 million firearms - related background checks transactions .

corresponding data on individual background checks and denials under the permanent provisions of the brady act are given and discussed below for both the fbi and for point of contact states that have chosen to either fully or partially implement the brady act .

this final section of the report briefly summarizes nics - related legislative action to date in the 116 th congress .

it then provides a summary and some analysis of three bills that have passed the house and await senate action .

in the 116 th congress , the house has passed three bills that would expand federal firearms - related background check requirements .

on january 8 , 2019 , representative mike thompson introduced the bipartisan background checks bill of 2019 ( h.r .

8 ) , a bill that would require a background check for most private - party , intrastate firearms sale , or "universal" background checks .

on february 6 , 2019 , the house committee on the judiciary held a hearing on "preventing gun violence in america. .

on february 8 , 2019 , representative james clyburn introduced the enhanced background checks act of 2019 ( h.r .

1112 ) , a bill to lengthen the number of days a firearms transfer could be delayed pending a final firearms eligibility determination .

on february 13 , 2019 , the house committee on the judiciary amended and ordered reported both bills: h.r .

8 ( h.rept .

116-11 ) and h.r .

1112 ( h.rept .

116-12 ) .

on february 27 and 28 , 2019 , respectively , the house amended and passed h.r .

8 and h.r .

1112 .

on march 7 , 2019 , representative karen bass introduced the violence against women reauthorization act of 2019 ( h.r .

1585 ) .

on march 27 , 2019 , the house committee on the judiciary amended and reported h.r .

1585 .

this bill includes provisions that would expand existing firearms transfer / receipt and possession prohibitions to include dating partners with histories of domestic violence and persons convicted of stalking - related misdemeanor offenses .

the house passed h.r .

1585 on april 4 , 2019 .

also , of note , on march 13 , 2019 , the house appropriations subcommittee on commerce , justice , science , and related agencies held a hearing on "gun violence prevention and enforcement. .

on march 18 , 2019 , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) released its fy2020 congressional budget request that includes a $4.2 million increase for the nics , which would bring the total program budget to $114.7 million for fy2020 .

on the same date , the office of justice programs ( ojp ) released its congressional budget request that includes $75 million for state , local , tribal , and territorial governments to upgrade criminal and mental incompetency records and make those records accessible to nics for firearms eligibility determination purposes .

on june 3 , 2019 , the house committee on appropriations reported an fy2020 commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ( cjs ) appropriations bill ( h.r .

3055 , h.rept .

116-101 ) .

house report language indicates that the bill would fully support the fbi request for increased nics funding .

the bill would also provide $80 million for ojp - administered nics improvement grants under nchip and narip .

on september 26 , 2019 , senate committee on appropriations reported an fy2020 cjs appropriations bill ( s. 2584 ; s.rept .

116-127 ) .

senate report language indicates that the bill $131 million to increase nics capacity and efficacy .

this amount is $16.3 million above the trump administration's fy2020 request .

the bill would also provide $78.3 million for ojp - administered nics improvement grants under nchip and narip , of which $25 is for the latter program .

in addition , on march 26 , 2019 , the senate committee on the judiciary held a hearing on "red flag laws: examining guidelines for state action. .

seventeen states and the district of columbia have passed "red flag" laws .

these laws essentially allow concerned persons , including family members in some cases , to petition a court to file an extreme risk protection order against an individual that would allow for the suspension of that individual's firearms eligibility under certain circumstances .

these state laws vary considerably from state to state .

related proposals in the 116 th congress would make subjects of such protective orders ineligible to receive or possess firearms under federal law in any state or would establish grant programs to encourage states to adopt such laws .

on september 10 , 2019 , the house committee on the judiciary ordered reported such a bill , the extreme risk protection order act ( h.r .

1236 ) .

in addition , this committee also ordered reported the disarm hate act ( h.r .

2708 ) , which make persons convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime ineligible to receive or possess a firearm or ammunition .

the bipartisan background checks act of 2019 ( h.r .

8 ) , a "universal" background check bill , would expand federal firearms background checks and , hence , recordkeeping requirements under the gun control act of 1968 ( gca ; 18 u.s.c .

â§921 et seq. ) .

to include firearms transfers made in the same state ( intrastate ) between unlicensed persons .

h.r .

8 would essentially prohibit unlicensed persons from transferring a firearm to any other unlicensed person , unless a federally licensed firearms dealer , or ffl , takes possession of such firearm and facilitates such a transaction by running a background check on the unlicensed prospective transferee ( buyer ) .

h.r .

8 includes exceptions for transfers between immediate family members ; u.s. military , law enforcement members , or armed private security professionals in the course of official duties ; temporary transfers under circumstances involving an imminent threat of bodily harm or death ; and legitimate activities involving target shooting , hunting , trapping , or fishing .

h.r .

8 would prohibit any implementing regulations that would ( 1 ) require ffls to facilitate private firearms transactions ; ( 2 ) require unlicensed sellers or buyers to maintain any records with regard to ffl - facilitated background checks ; or ( 3 ) place a cap on the fee ffls may charge for facilitating a private firearms transfer .

h.r .

8 would also prohibit ffls from transferring possession of , or title to , any firearm to any unlicensed person , unless the ffl provides notice of the proposed private firearm transfer prohibition under this bill .

further , h.r .

8 would extend a provision of current law that prohibits the doj from charging a fee for a nics background check .

under h.r .

8 , facilitating ffls would be required to treat firearms to be transferred on behalf of any unlicensed persons as if they were part of their business inventory .

thus , they would be required to comply with the gca recordkeeping and background check requirements .

as part of this process , ffls would enter the firearm ( s ) to be exchanged into their bound log of firearms acquisitions and dispositions .

the ffls and unlicensed prospective transferees would then complete and sign a firearms transaction forms ( atf form 4473 ) under penalty of law that everything entered onto that form was truthful .

ffls would then initiate a background check on the intending transferee through nics .

and either the fbi nics section or a state or local authorityâpoint of contact ( poc ) âwould conduct a background check to determine an intending transferee's firearms eligibility .

such a requirement , if enacted , would close off what some have long characterized as the "gun show loophole. .

for the past two decades , many gun control advocates have viewed the legal circumstances that allow individuals to transfer firearms intrastate among themselves without being subject to the licensing , recordkeeping , and background check requirements of the gca as a "loophole" in the law , particularly within the context of these intrastate , private transactions at gun shows and other public venues or through the internet .

gun control advocates also maintain that expanding background checks to cover intrastate , private - party firearms sales would help stem gun trafficking ; that is , the illegal diversion of firearms from legal channels of commerce to the black market , where federal , state , local , tribal , and territorial laws could be evaded .

they maintain that prohibited persons or their friends or acquaintances could easily buy a firearm at a gun show , from an online seller , or in a person - to - person "private" sale .

they also point to studies that suggest that there is moderate evidence that expanded background checks might reduce firearms - related homicides and suicides .

gun control advocates underscore that 20 states and the district of columbia ( dc ) currently have laws that require background checks for certain types of firearms transfers not currently covered by federal law .

although these laws vary considerably from state to state , 11 states and dc require background checks for nearly all firearms transfers .

gun rights advocates contend that intrastate , private transfers are regulated already under federal law , in that it is a felony to transfer a firearm or ammunition knowingly to an underage or prohibited person .

they contend further that most criminals would not submit to a background check .

they ask , "why would anyone submit to a background check unless they believed they were not prohibited and would pass ? .

moreover , they argue that making private - party , intrastate transfers subject to the recordkeeping and background check provisions of the gca could potentially criminalize firearms transfers under circumstances that could be characterized as legitimate and lawful .

for example , it has been argued that h.r .

8 might prohibit a person from sharing a firearm with another person while target shooting on one's own property .

although h.r .

8 would provide exceptions for "temporary transfers" for target shooting and other related activities , some gun rights advocates argue that such exceptions are too narrow .

for example , they argue further that h.r .

8 would prohibit a person from loaning a neighbor a firearm for a hunting trip with a background check being required for both the loan to the neighbor and the return of the firearm to its lawful owner .

perhaps more fundamentally , h.r .

8 would prohibit a person from loaning a firearm to another personâwho may be facing some threat of death or serious bodily injuryâfor self - defense purposes , unless that threat were "imminent. .

gun rights advocates might also see such a measure as a significant step towards a nationalâalbeit decentralizedâregistry of firearms and firearms owners , since its practical implementation would likely necessitate recordkeeping on such transfers .

such advocates cite an obama administration , department of justice official who observed that "universal background checks" are unenforceable without a comprehensive registry of firearms .

legislation to expand federal recordkeeping and background check requirements to cover private , intrastate firearms transfers saw action in the 106 th and 108 th congresses following the april 20 , 1999 , columbine , co , high school mass shooting ; in the 113 th congress following the december 14 , 2012 , newtown , ct , elementary school mass shooting ; and in the 114 th congress following the december 2 , 2015 , san bernardino , ca , social services center all - staff meeting and june 12 , 2016 , orlando , fl , pulse night club mass shootings .

over time , related legislative proposals have varied in the scope and type of intrastate , private party ( nondealer ) firearms exchanges between federally unlicensed persons that would fall under their respective background check provisions .

since the 113 th congress , such proposals fall under two basic types that , respectively , have been labeled as either "universal" or "comprehensive" background check bills .

"comprehensive" background checks would cover transfers at gun shows and similar public venues ( eg , flea markets and public auctions ) and firearms that are advertised via some public fora , including newspaper advertisements and the internet .

"universal" background checks would cover private transfers under a much wider set of circumstances ( sales , trades , barters , rentals , or loans ) , with more limited exceptions .

in the senate , from the 113 th congress forward , the principal sponsors of "universal" background check bills have been senators charles schumer , christopher murphy , and richard blumenthal .

the principal sponsors of "comprehensive" background check amendments have been senators joe manchin and pat toomey .

"universal" background check bills were introduced in the house in the 113 th and 114 th congresses .

while representatives peter king and mike thompson introduced proposals that were similar to manchin - toomey "comprehensive" background check bills in the past three congresses , they have sponsored and supported a "universal" background check proposal ( h.r .

8 ) in the 116 th congress .

the house - passed enhanced background checks act of 2019 ( h.r .

1112 ) would revise the gca background check provision to lengthen the delayed sale period , which is three business days under current law .

under h.r .

1112 , for background checks that do not result in a "proceed with transfer" or "transfer denied," the fbi nics section and poc state officials would have 10 business days to place a hold on a firearms - related transaction .

at the end of 10 business days , the prospective transferee could petition the attorney general for a final firearms eligibility determination .

if the ffl does not receive a final determination within 10 days of the date of the petition , he or she could proceed with the transfer .

the timeliness and accuracy of fbi - administered firearms background checks through nicsâparticularly with regard to "delayed proceeds"âbecame a matter of controversy following the june 17 , 2015 , charleston , sc , mass murder at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church .

the assailant had acquired a handgun from an ffl in the columbia , sc , area .

according to press accounts , the nics check on the assailant was initiated on april 11 , 2015 ( a saturday ) .

the fbi found an arrest record for him , but the arrest record was ambiguous with regard to the arrest's final disposition and the assailant's firearms receipt and possession eligibility .

therefore , the nics response to the ffl was to delay the transfer for three business days as required under federal law .

at his discretion , the ffl made the transfer on april 16 , 2015 ( a thursday ) as allowed under federal law .

according to fbi , the nics check would have remained active in the nics examiner's queue for 30 days ( until may 11 , 2015 ) , and would have remained in an "active status" in the nics system for 88 days ( until july 8 , 2015 ) .

according to the assailant's arrest record , he had been processed for arrest by the lexington county , sc , sheriff's department , so the fbi contacted the lexington county court , sheriff's department , and prosecutor's office .

the lexington county sheriff's department responded that it did not have a record on the alleged assailant and advised the nics examiner to contact the city of columbia , sc , police department .

however , the nics examiner contacted the west columbia , sc , police department , because it was listed on the nics contact sheet for lexington county .

in turn , the west columbia police department responded that it did not have a record on the alleged assailant either .

the nics examiner reportedly focused on lexington county and missed the fact that the city of columbia , sc , police department was listed as the contact for richland county , the county in which most of the city of columbia , sc , is located .

consequently , the nics examiner did not contact the columbia , sc , police department , the agency that actually held the arrest record for the assailant .

if the fbi had ascertained during the 88 days that this person was prohibited , the nics examiner would have likely contacted the ffl to verify whether a firearms transfer had been made after the three - business - day delay , and then would have notified the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives ( atf ) and a firearms retrieval action would have possibly been taken by that agency .

in this case , the fbi did not ascertain that the assailant was possibly a prohibited person until after the june 17 , 2015 , mass shooting .

some gun control advocates have characterized these circumstances as the "charleston loophole. .

in addition to the "charleston loophole," gun control advocates sometimes refer to "delayed proceeds" that could result in a possibly prohibited person acquiring a firearm after three business days have expired as "default proceeds. .

they argue that extending the delayed proceed period would reduce the chance that an otherwise prohibited person might inadvertently be transferred a firearm , a circumstance that would likely necessitate an atf firearms retrieval action had more time been allotted to complete the background check .

according to data acquired by a gun control advocacy group , about 3.59% of fbi - administered background checks in 2017 were unresolved after a delayed proceed response and the three - business - day window had passed .

to this advocacy group , this suggested that a relatively small number of people ( 310,232 ) would be affected , and any inconvenience to them would be outweighed by increasing the probability that a prohibited person might be prevented from acquiring a firearm .

according to the fbi , it referred 6,004 "delayed denial" cases to the atf in 2017 that could have possibly resulted in a finding of ineligibility and subsequent firearms retrieval action .

in addition , the fbi reported that 4,864 of those cases involved individuals who were possibly prohibited and had probably acquired a firearm .

gun rights advocates would counter that a large percentage ( 98.1% ) of background checks that resulted in a delayed proceed response involved persons who were not actually ineligible , prompting them to refer to such default proceed responses as "default infringements. .

they maintain that the "delayed proceeds" should be viewed as an indicator of understaffing and incomplete recordkeeping on prohibited persons .

gun rights advocates underscore further that if the overall timeliness and accuracy of fbi background checks were improved , the process would be less likely to inconvenience an otherwise eligible person and , at the same time , less likely to allow a firearm to be transferred to a prohibited person .

according to the gao , atf processed 3,933 delayed denials in fy2017 .

of those denials , 38 cases were referred to u.s. attorney's offices for prosecution .

nine of those cases were federally prosecuted .

the house - passed violence against women reauthorization act of 2019 ( h.r .

1585 ) includes several provisions that seek to reduce firearms - related intimate partner violence ( homicides and injury ) by amending federal law to prohibit persons convicted of misdemeanor stalking crimes from receiving or possessing a firearm or ammunition .

this bill would also revise provisions related to domestic violence protection orders and a definition of "intimate partner" under current law .

the bill also includes other provisions related to leveraging state , local , tribal , and territorial resources to increase federal investigations and prosecutions of firearms - related eligibility offenses related to domestic violence and stalking .

as discussed earlier , there are nine categories of persons prohibited under current law ( 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( g ) ) from receiving or possessing firearms or ammunition ( eg , convicted felons , fugitives from justice , and unlawfully present aliens ) .

under 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( n ) , a tenth category of prohibited personsâthose under felony indictmentâare prohibited from receiving , but not possessing firearms .

in addition , under 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( d ) , it is unlawful for any person to transfer or otherwise dispose of a firearm or ammunition to any person , if the transferor has reasonable cause to believe the transferee would be prohibited under one of those 10 categories .

two of the categories speak directly to domestic violence: persons under court - order restraints related to harassing , stalking , or threatening an intimate partner or child of such intimate partner ( 18 u.s.c .

â§â§922 ( d ) ( 8 ) and ( g ) ( 8 ) ) ; and persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ( mcdv ) ( 18 u.s.c .

â§â§922 ( d ) ( 9 ) and ( g ) ( 9 ) ) .

according to atf , a qualifying dvpo order includes the following elements .

the defendant / respondent must receive actual notice and opportunity to participate in a hearing before a judge , magistrate , or other judicial official .

after such hearing , a dvpo may be issued by a criminal or civil court , such as a divorce court , family court , magistrate , or general jurisdiction court .

the plaintiff / petitioner is an "intimate partner" of the defendant / respondent ( subject ) .

an intimate partner includes: 1. a spouse or former spouse of the subject ; a person who cohabitates or cohabitated with the subject , who resides or resided in a sexual / romantic relationship with the subject , or 2. a person with whom the subject has or had a child in common ( regardless of whether they ever married or cohabitated ) .

a qualifying court order must also restrain the subject from harassing , stalking , or threatening an intimate partner or child of that intimate partner , or engaging in conduct that would place either of them in reasonable fear of bodily injury .

there must also be a finding that the subject is a credible threat to the physical safety of the intimate partner or child , or explicitly prohibit the use of physical force .

according to atf , a qualifying misdemeanor conviction of domestic violence ( mcdv ) must include the following elements .

such offense is a misdemeanor crime under federal , state , or tribal law and involves the use or attempted use of physical force , or the threatened use of a deadly weapon .

at the time of the offense , the offender must have been: 1 .

a current or former spouse , parent , or guardian of the victim ; 2 .

a person with who the victim shared a child in common ; 3 .

a person who was cohabitating with or had cohabitated with the victim as a spouse , parent , or guardian ; or 4 .

a person who was or had been similarly situated to a spouse , parent , or guardian of the victim .

under current law , the term "intimate partner" means , with respect to a person , the spouse of the person , a former spouse of the person , an individual who is a parent of a child of the person , and an individual who cohabitates or has cohabitated with the person ( 18 u.s.c .

â§921 ( a ) ( 32 ) ) .

h.r .

1585 would expand the "intimate partner" definition to include a dating partner or former dating partner ( as defined in section 2266 [of title 18 , united states code] ) ; and any other person similarly situated to a spouse who is protected by the domestic or family violence laws of the state or tribal jurisdiction in which the injury occurred or where the victim resides .

under 18 u.s.c .

â§2266 ( a ) ( 10 ) , the term "dating partner" refers to a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the abuser ; and the existence of such a relationship is based on a consideration of ( 1 ) the length of the relationship ; ( 2 ) the type of relationship ; and ( 3 ) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship .

h.r .

1585 would make any person convicted of a "misdemeanor crime of stalking" a tenth category of persons prohibited from receiving and possessing a firearm under 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( g ) .

the bill would define such a crime as any misdemeanor stalking offense under federal , state , tribal , or municipal law ; and one that in a course of harassment , intimidation , or surveillance of another person , places that person in reasonable fear of material harm to the health or safety of her - or himself , an immediate family member of that person , a household member of that person , or a spouse or intimate partner of that person ; or that causes , attempts to cause , or would reasonably be expected to cause emotional distress to any of those persons .

the proposed definition is subject to certain mitigating factors .

a person would not be considered to have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of stalking unless ( 1 ) the person was represented by counsel in the case , or ( 2 ) they knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case .

in the case of a prosecution for a misdemeanor crime of stalking for which a person was entitled to a jury trial , a person would not be considered convicted in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried , unless ( 1 ) the case was tried by a jury ; or ( 2 ) the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury , by guilty plea , or otherwise .

h.r .

1585 would also expand the scope of "protection orders" or "court - order restraints" under 18 u.s.c .

â§â§922 ( d ) ( 8 ) and ( g ) ( 8 ) .

under current law these provisions prohibit any person from firearms receipt , possession , or transfer , who is subject to a court order that: ( a ) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice , and at which such person had an opportunity to participate ; ( b ) restrains such person from harassing , stalking , or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person , or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child ; and ( c ) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child ; or by its terms explicitly prohibits the use , attempted use , or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury .

h.r .

1585 would substantively amend the domestic violence protection order prohibition ( 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( g ) ( 8 ) , and â§922 ( d ) ( 8 ) , by reference ) to specifically include restraining orders under state , tribal , or territorial law that are issued after an "ex parte" hearing , and to expand it to include restraining orders related to "witness intimidation. .

the legal term "ex parte" ( "for one party" ) refers generally to court motions , hearings , or orders granted on the request of and for the benefit of one party only without the respondent / defendant being present .

h.r .

1585 would add the following at the end of 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( g ) ( 8 ) ( a ) : in the case of an ex parte order , relative to which notice and opportunity to be heard are providedâ ( i ) within the time required by state , tribal , or territorial law ; and ( ii ) in any event within a reasonable time after the order is issued , sufficient to protect the due process rights of the person .

notwithstanding the reference to "due process" in the amending language , this language could potentially generate considerable debate about the balance between due process and public safety .

in addition , at the end of clause 18 u.s.c .

â§922 ( g ) ( 8 ) ( b ) , it would add , "intimidating or dissuading a witness from testifying in court," which may appear less controversial , but critics might argue that such language has little to do with domestic violence .

as discussed in the body of this report , congress has passed legislation to encourage states to make dvpo and mcdv records accessible promptly to nics .

progress has been made , but many state , tribal , and territorial authorities still find such reporting challenging , if not daunting .

gun control advocates , meanwhile , have argued that the definition of "intimate partner" ought to be expanded under the dvpo and mcdv definitions of "intimate partner" to include current and former dating partners , as well as persons convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses .

expanding the grounds for firearms transfer or receipt and possession ineligibility is one avenue along which intimate partner gun violence could be addressed , perhaps effectively , but such an expansion could also strain ongoing federal - state efforts to ensure that prohibiting records under current law are accurate and reported to nics in a timely manner in order to be accessible electronically during background checks .

appendix a. fbi and poc firearms - related background checks pursuant to the brady act fbi nics section checks and denials , november 30 , 1998 , through 2018 as table a - 1 shows , from november 30 , 1998 , through 2018 , the fbi cjis division's nics section conducted 128.7 million background checks , resulting in nearly 1.6 million denials , for an overall initial denial rate of 1.2% .

about 2.7% of those denials were appealed and eventually overturned .

table a - 2 shows fbi nics section denials by prohibiting category .

over the 20-year and one month period ( november 30 , 1998 , through 2018 ) that nics has been in operation , over half of fbi firearms transfer denials were based on a prior felony conviction .

for 2018 , by comparison , a smaller percentage ( 45.1% ) were based on a felony conviction .

this percentage decrease can be attributed to at least two factors .

one , over time , persons with past felony convictions could be less likely to risk a background check through nics .

two , since the establishment of nics , state and local government submissions of prohibiting recordsâparticularly those related to mental incompentencyâhave increased .

as shown in table a - 2 , such records accounted for 2.5% of denials over the 20-year period , but accounted for 6.1% of denials for 2018 .

as discussed below , congress prioritized such reporting as part of the nics improvement amendments act of 2007 ( p.l .

110-180 ) , in the aftermath of the april 20 , 2007 , va tech mass shooting .

ten years later , congress passed the fix nics act of 2017 in an effort to strengthen and streamline provisions previously enacted under p.l .

110-180 , and authorize future appropriations for grant and other programs designed to assist state , tribes , and territories with improving the quality of prohibiting records and increasing their accessibility to nics ( p.l .

state and local poc background checks and denials , november 30 , 1998 , through 2015 as shown in the table a - 3 below , the bureau of justice statistics ( bjs ) has reported that state and local poc agencies conducted nearly 81.7 million background checks from november 30 , 1998 , through 2015 for firearms transfers and permits .

these checks resulted in nearly 1.46 million denials , for an overall denial rate of 1.8% , according to bjs .

over the same time period , the fbi nics section processed 102.4 background checks , resulting in 1.27 million denials of firearms transfers , for an overall denial rate of 1.2% .

bjs also reports on the reasons ( prohibitors ) for some , but not all , state and local poc denials .

for example , as shown in table a - 3 , while state and local pocs made 119,368 denials for firearms transfers and permits in 2015 , bjs reported the reason for 84,199 ( 70.5% ) of such denials .

similarly , state and local pocs made 102,468 denials in 2014 , but bjs reported the reason for 57,001 ( 55.6% ) of them .

in addition , over the years , bjs sometimes reported for both state and local poc agencies , and in other years only for state poc agencies .

moreover , bjs's methodology for making estimates about state and local poc background checks and denials over the years has been revised .

notwithstanding these data limitations , table a - 4 shows the bjs - reported reasons for some , but not all denials made by state and local pocs for 2014 and 2015 .

looking at the data in table a - 4 , it is notable that there either appears to be no denials based upon dishonorable discharges or renounced u.s. citizenship , or such denials were not estimated by bjs based on data submitted by state and local poc agencies .

in addition , the percentages of felony conviction denials for either year , 2014 or 2015 , are roughly half of the percentages of federal denials made by the fbi nics section .

as a percentage of the total , it could be that these percentages are based on incomplete data and , therefore , are not particularly comparable with the percentages for federal denials , which are based on complete data .

appendix b. nics - queried computer systems and files as part of a nics check , the transferee's information is crosschecked against three computerized databases / systems to determine firearms transfer and possession eligibility .

those systems are the interstate identification index ( iii ) , the national crime information center ( ncic ) , and the nics indices .

if prospective transferees indicate that they are non - u.s. citizens , then their information is also checked against the immigration and naturalization databases maintained by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) .

interstate identification index ( iii ) the iii , or "triple i," is a computerized criminal history index pointer system that the fbi maintains so that records on persons arrested and convicted of felonies and serious misdemeanors at either the federal or state level can be shared nationally .

this criminal history records exchange system includes arrest and disposition information on individuals charged with felonies and certain misdemeanors .

felony crimes generally include any offense that is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year .

under state law , there are misdemeanor crimes that are punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding two years , which are also shared nationally through the iii .

by virtue of this record sharing , other information accessible through iii also includes records on persons under felony indictment , fugitives from justice , persons found not guilty by reason of insanity or adjudicated incompetent to stand trial , persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence , and persons subject to domestic violence protection orders .

all records in iii are supported by fingerprint records which are exchanged through the interstate automated fingerprint identification system ( iafis ) , though nics checks do not entail fingerprint - based background checks under current law .

national crime information center ( ncic ) the ncic is a database of documented criminal justice information that is made available to law enforcement and authorized agencies , with the goal of assisting law enforcement in apprehending fugitives , finding missing persons , locating stolen property , and further protecting law enforcement personnel and the public .

ncic includes 21 files , 10 of which are queried by nics .

those 10 ncic files include wanted persons ; protection orders ; immigration violators ; protective interest ; foreign fugitive ; supervised release ; national sex offender registry ; gang file ; known / appropriately suspected terrorist ( kst ) ; and violent person .

nics indices the nics indices contain records of persons prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal , state , local , tribal , or territorial law that are not shared nationally in either the iii or ncic .

those records include felony arrest and disposition records ( not included in the iii ) ; felony indictments ; fugitives from justice ; addicts and other unlawful users of controlled substances ; involuntary commitments to mental institutions and other related adjudications ; illegal or unlawful aliens ; dishonorable discharges ; renunciations of u.s. citizenship ; domestic violence protection orders ; domestic violence misdemeanor convictions ; previous nics denials under state laws ( by pocs ) ; and previous nics denials made federally ( by nics section ) .
