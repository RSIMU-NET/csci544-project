as congressional policymakers continue to debate telecommunications reform , a major discussion point revolves around what approach should be taken to ensure unfettered access to the internet .

the move to place restrictions on the owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet , to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment , is referred to as "net neutrality. .

there is no single accepted definition of "net neutrality. .

however , most agree that any such definition should include the general principles that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet should not control how consumers lawfully use that network , and they should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network .

a major focus in the debate is concern over whether the regulatory framework as delineated in the federal communications commission's ( fcc's ) 2015 open internet order is the appropriate approach to ensure access to the internet for content , services , and applications providers , as well as consumers , or whether a less regulatory approach contained in the 2017 order is more suitable .

the issue of regulation of and access to broadband networks is currently being addressed in three venues at the fcc , where the commissioners on december 14 , 2017 , adopted ( 3-2 ) an order that went into effect on june 11 , 2018 , that revokes the 2015 regulatory framework in favor of one that reverses the 2015 classification of broadband internet access services as a telecommunications service under title ii of the communications act , provides for a less regulatory approach , and shifts much of the oversight from the fcc to the federal trade commission ( ftc ) and the department of justice ( doj ) ; in the courts , where consolidated petitions for review of the 2017 order are under consideration in the u.s. court of appeals , d.c .

circuit ; and a suit filed in the u.s. district court of the eastern district of california by the doj and various trade groups , challenging the legality of a california internet regulation law , is pending ; in the 116 th congress , where debate over what the appropriate regulatory framework should be for broadband access continues .

whether congress will take broader action to amend existing law to provide guidance and more stability to fcc authority over broadband access remains to be seen .

as consumers expand their use of the internet and new multimedia and voice services become more commonplace , control over network quality and pricing is an issue .

the ability of data bits to travel the network in a nondiscriminatory manner ( subject to reasonable management practices ) , as well as the pricing structure established by broadband service providers for consumer access to that data , have become significant issues in the debate .

debate over what the appropriate regulatory framework should be for broadband access has continued in the 116 th congress .

h.r .

1644 , introduced on march 8 , 2019 , by representative doyle and s. 682 , introduced on march 6 , 2019 , by senator markey , add a new title to the communications act that repeals the 2017 order , stating that the rule "shall have no force or effect," and prohibits the fcc , in most circumstances , from reissuing the rule or enacting a new rule that is substantially the same .

the bills also restore the 2015 order and its subsequent regulations , thereby once again classifying both mobile and fixed broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service under title ii of the communications act and restoring regulations , including those that prohibit blocking , throttling , and paid prioritization and establish a general conduct standard .

an amended version of h.r .

1644 was passed ( 30-22 ) by the house energy and commerce committee on april 3 , 2019 .

a revised version of the subcommittee - passed h.r .

1644 , a manager's amendment in the nature of a substitute ( ains ) offered by representative doyle , was considered by the committee .

the ains contained a provision , in the definition section , to clarify the forbearance provisions in the subcommittee passed bill .

one amendment to the ains , containing a one - year exemption from the 2015 order enhanced transparency requirements for small internet service providers ( that is those with 100,000 or fewer subscribers ) , was also approved prior to committee passage .

an amended version of h.r .

1644 ( containing 12 additional amendments considered on the floor ) passed ( 232-190 ) the house on april 10 , 2019 .

three bills ( h.r .

1006 , h.r .

1096 , h.r .

1101 ) establish a regulatory framework by amending title i of the communications act and h.r .

1006 , introduced on february 6 , 2019 , by representative latta , amends title i of the communications act to address potential negative behaviors of bias providers .

provisions include those that prohibit blocking and unjust and discriminatory behavior , subject to reasonable network management ; establish transparency requirements ; establish fcc enforcement authority , including the authority to issue fines and forfeitures up to $2 million ; in general , prohibit the fcc from imposing regulations on bias services under title ii ; protect the needs of emergency communications , law enforcement , public safety or national security , copyright infringement or other unlawful activity ; and preserve the authority of the department of justice and the federal trade commission .

h.r .

1096 , introduced on february 7 , 2019 , by representative rodgers , amends title i of the communications act to require rules applicable to bias providers that establish transparency requirements ; prohibit blocking and degrading ( throttling ) lawful traffic , subject to reasonable network management ; prohibit paid prioritization ; and contain a savings clause relating to emergency communications , law enforcement , public safety or national security , copyright infringement or other unlawful activity .

h.r .

1101 , introduced on february 7 , 2019 , by representative walden , amends title i of the communications act to establish obligations for bias providers .

these include no blocking or throttling , subject to reasonable network management ; no paid prioritization ; and establishment of transparency rules .

additional provisions require the fcc to enforce these rules through adjudication of complaints and establish , no later than 60 days after enactment , formal complaint procedures to address alleged violations ; protect the needs of emergency communications , law enforcement , public safety or national security , copyright infringement or other unlawful activity ; protect the ability of bias providers to offer specialized services and the right of consumers to choice of service plans or control over their chosen bias ; and establish that bias or any other mass - market retail service providing advanced telecommunications capability shall be considered an information service and that section 706 may not be relied upon as a grant of authority .

a more narrowly focused measure , h.r .

1860 , introduced on march 25 , 2019 , by representative kinzinger , prohibits the fcc from regulating the rates charged for bias .

congressional activity in the 115 th congress sought to address a wide range of issues directly related to the debate over the appropriate framework for the provision of and access to broadband networks .

legislation included congressional review act ( cra ) resolutions to overturn the 2017 order ( h.j.res .

129 and s.j.res .

52 ) ; a measure ( s. 993 ) to nullify the 2015 order ; comprehensive legislation ( h.r .

4682 , h.r .

6393 , s. 2510 , and s. 2853 ) to provide a regulatory framework to outline fcc authority over broadband internet access services ; and measures to address the privacy and transparency regulations of the 2015 order .

publication of the 2017 order in the federal register on february 22 , 2018 , triggered timelines for cra consideration .

cra resolutions to overturn the 2017 order were introduced on february 27 , 2018 , in both the house ( h.j.res .

129 ) by representative doyle , and the senate ( s.j.res .

52 ) by senator markey .

both measures stated that congress disapproves "the rule" ( in this case the fcc 2017 order ) and that the rule "shall have no force or effect. .

if the cra joint resolution is enacted the rule "shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect. .

additionally , the agency , in this case the fcc , may not , in most circumstances , promulgate the same rule again .

s.j.res .

52 passed ( 52-47 ) the senate on may 16 , 2018 , and was sent to the house and held at the desk .

on may 17 , 2018 , representative doyle filed a discharge petition to bring a house floor vote on h.j.res .

129 but the house measure did not come up for consideration .

on the other hand , legislation ( s. 993 ) to nullify the fcc's 2015 open internet order was introduced on may 1 , 2017 , by senator lee .

s. 993 nullified the fcc's 2015 order , prohibited the fcc from reclassifying broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service , and prohibited the fcc from issuing a substantially similar rule absent congressional authorization .

no further action was taken on the measure .

the fcc's adoption ( 3-2 ) of the 2017 order that largely reversed the 2015 regulatory framework ( see " wc docket no .

17-108 ( the fcc 2017 order ) " above ) reopened debate over whether congress should take broader action to amend existing law to provide guidance and more stability to fcc authority .

four measures ( h.r .

4682 , h.r .

6393 , s. 2510 , and s. 2853 ) to provide a regulatory framework to outline fcc authority over broadband internet access services were introduced .

h.r .

4682 , introduced on december 19 , 2017 , by representative blackburn , and s. 2510 , introduced by senator kennedy on march 7 , 2018 , amended the communications act of 1934 to address a broad range of issues .

more specifically , provisions contained in both measures included those which prohibited broadband internet access service ( bias ) providers from blocking lawful content or degrading ( throttling ) lawful internet traffic , subject to reasonable network management ; granted fcc enforcement authority and required the fcc to establish formal complaint procedures to address alleged violations ; preserved the ability of bias providers to offer , with a prohibition on certain practices , specialized services ; established bias as an information service ; and preempted state and local authority over "internet openness obligations" for the provision of bias with exceptions for emergency communications or law enforcement , public safety , or national security obligations .

provisions in h.r .

4682 also established eligibility of bias services for federal universal service fund program support .

h.r .

4682 and s. 2510 were referred to the house committee on energy and commerce and the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation , respectively , but no further action was taken .

s. 2853 , introduced on may 16 , 2018 , by senator thune , also amended the communications act of 1934 to establish a framework to address broadband internet access services .

s. 2853 is similar to h.r .

4682 and s. 2510 in that it classified broadband as an information service , prohibited both blocking and throttling subject to reasonable network management , permitted with limitations the ability to provide specialized services , and provided for a similar role for the fcc .

however , unlike the two previous measures , s. 2853 contained provisions that prohibit paid prioritization and contain transparency obligations ; did not contain specific provisions to preempt state and local authority ; and clarified that section 706 of the telecommunications act of 1996 may not be used as a grant of regulatory authority .

s. 2853 was referred to the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation but no further action was taken .

h.r .

6393 , introduced on july 17 , 2018 , by representative coffman , established a new title , title viii , in the 1934 communications act to provide a regulatory framework for broadband internet access providers .

provisions included those that banned blocking , throttling , and "paid preferential treatment" subject to reasonable network management , and established a general conduct standard .

included among the additional provisions were those that established transparency requirements , granted the fcc oversight over interconnection , permitted specialized services , stated that internet service providers are eligible to receive funds from , and may be required to contribute to , the universal service fund , ensured disability access to broadband equipment and services , and exempted title viii provisions from fcc forebearance authority .

h.r .

6393 was referred to the house committee on energy and commerce but no further action was taken .

congressional action in the 115 th congress also focused on two specific aspects of the 2015 open internet order rules: privacy ( s.j.res .

34 , s. 878 , s. 964 , h.j.res .

86 , h.res .

230 , h.r .

1754 , h.r .

1868 , h.r .

2520 , h.r .

3175 ) and transparency ( s. 228 , h.r .

288 ) .

congress successfully used the congressional review act ( cra ; 5 u.s.c .

paras .

801-808 ) to revoke the customer privacy rules adopted by the fcc under the 2015 open internet order .

legislation ( s.j.res .

34 , h.j.res .

86 ) , in the form of a joint resolution , was introduced by senator flake and representative blackburn , respectively , to overturn the fcc's customer privacy rules .

the identical joint resolutions stated "that congress disapproves the rule submitted by the federal communications commission relating to 'protecting the privacy of customers of broadband and other telecommunications services' ( 81 federal register 87274 ( december 2 , 2016 ) and such rule will have no force or effect. .

s.j.res .

34 passed the senate ( 50-48 ) on march 23 , 2017 , and the house ( 215-205 ) on march 28 , 2017 , and was signed by the president on april 3 , 2017 ( p.l .

115-22 ) .

this action prevents any new rule subject to the joint resolution from taking effect and invalidates any rules that have already been in effect .

additionally , it prevents the agency ( in this case the fcc ) from reissuing the rule in "substantially the same form" or issuing a "new rule that is substantially the same" as the disapproved rule unless specifically authorized by a law enacted after the approved resolution ( cra .

5 u.s.c .

para 801 ( b ) ( 2 ) ) .

additional measures ( h.r .

1754 , h.r .

1868 , h.r .

2520 , h.r .

3175 , s. 878 , and s. 964 ) addressing other aspects of the privacy issue , as it relates to protection of broadband user data privacy , were introduced but received no further action .

legislation ( h.r .

288 , s. 228 ) addressing the transparency requirements contained in the 2015 open internet order was under consideration .

transparency requirements refer to the disclosures that internet service providers are required to provide to their end users and edge providers and include , among other things , network management practices , performance , and commercial terms .

these requirements were expanded upon or "enhanced" in the 2015 open internet order , and small internet service providers ( i.e. , those with 100,000 or fewer subscribers ) were given a temporary exemption from these enhanced requirements .

h.r .

288 , introduced on january 4 , 2017 , by representative walden , addresses the transparency requirements contained in the 2015 order .

h.r .

288 expanded the exemption to include internet service providers with 250,000 or fewer subscribers and sunset the transparency exemption five years from the bill's enactment .

the bill also required the fcc to report to congress 180 days after the bill's enactment on whether the exemption should be made permanent and whether the definition of "small" for exemption purposes should be modified .

h.r .

288 passed the house , by voice vote , on january 10 , 2017 , but received no further action .

s. 228 , introduced on january 24 , 2017 , by senator daines , also addressed the transparency exemption and was largely identical to h.r .

288 .

s. 228 provided for an exemption of the enhanced transparency rule contained in the 2015 open internet order for small businesses .

the term "small business" was defined for purposes of the exemption as any provider of broadband internet access service that has not more than 250,000 subscribers .

the bill also required the fcc to report to congress 180 days after the bill's enactment , on whether the exemption should be made permanent and whether the definition of "small business" for exemption purposes should be modified .

the exemption was to last for five years after enactment or until the fcc completed the above report and a rulemaking to implement those recommendations .

s. 228 was referred to the senate commerce , science , and transportation committee , but no further action was taken .

ten measures ( s. 40 , s. 2283 , s. 2602 , s.j.res .

14 , h.r .

196 , h.r .

279 , h.r .

1212 , h.r .

2666 , h.r .

4596 , and h.j.res .

42 ) addressing broadband regulation were introduced in the 114 th congress .

amended versions of h.r .

4596 , dealing with transparency , and h.r .

2666 , dealing with rate regulation , passed the house on march 16 , 2016 , and april 15 , 2016 , respectively .

draft legislation , offered by the house energy and commerce committee and the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation , had also been a focal point of hearings .

however , no final action was taken on any of these measures .

s. 40 , the online competition and consumer choice act of 2015 , and its companion measure h.r .

196 , introduced on january 7 , 2015 , by senator leahy and representative matsui , respectively , addressed the relationship between a broadband internet access provider and a content provider .

both bills directed the fcc to establish / adopt regulations , within 90 days of enactment , to prohibit broadband internet access providers from entering into agreements with content providers , for pay , to give preferential treatment or priority to their content ( often termed "paid prioritization" ) , and prohibited broadband providers from giving preferential treatment to their own or affiliated content .

these rules applied to the traffic / content that travels between the access provider and the end user , often termed "the last mile. .

exceptions were given to address the needs of emergency communications or law enforcement , public safety , or national security authorities .

h.r .

279 , introduced on january 12 , 2015 , by representative latta , prohibited the fcc from regulating the provision of broadband internet access as a telecommunications service .

more specifically , the bill included provisions that classified broadband internet access service as an "information service," not a telecommunications service , and clarified that a provider of broadband internet access service may not be treated as a telecommunications carrier when engaged in the provision of an information service .

this measure prevented the fcc from regulating providers of broadband internet access services under title ii of the communications act .

representative blackburn , in direct response to the fcc's february 26 , 2015 , adoption of the open internet order , introduced h.r .

1212 , the "internet freedom act," on march 3 , 2015 .

h.r .

1212 blocked the implementation of the fcc's adopted open internet order ( gn docket no .

14-28 ) by stating that it "shall have no force or effect. .

furthermore , it prohibited the fcc from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form or issuing a new rule that is substantially the same , unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the enactment of this act .

exceptions were granted to protect national security or public safety , or to assist or facilitate actions taken by federal or state law enforcement agencies .

similarly s. 2602 , the "restoring internet freedom act," introduced by senator lee , on february 25 , 2016 , also negated the fcc's 2015 open internet order .

s. 2602 was identical to h.r .

1212 but did not contain the provisions relating to exceptions .

a more targeted measure , h.r .

2666 , the no rate regulation of broadband internet access act , introduced by representative kinzinger , on june 4 , 2015 , prohibited the fcc from regulating the rates charged for broadband internet access as defined by the open internet order .

h.r .

2666 was approved ( 15-11 ) by the house communications subcommittee by a party line vote on february 11 , 2016 .

an amended version of h.r .

2666 was approved ( 29-19 ) by the house energy and commerce committee on march 15 , 2016 .

prior to full committee passage of h.r .

2666 , an amendment stating that the bill would not affect the fcc's authority over data roaming , interconnection , truth - in - billing , paid prioritization , and rates charged for services that receive universal service support was approved .

h.r .

2666 passed the house ( 241-173 ) without further amendment , on april 15 , 2016 .

another approach , using the congressional review act ( cra ; 5 u.s.c .

paras .

801-808 ) to overturn the 2015 order , was also under consideration .

h.j.res .

42 , introduced on april 13 , 2015 , by representative doug collins , contained a resolution stating that "congress disapproves the rule submitted by the federal communications commission relating to the matter of protecting and promoting the open internet ... adopted by the commission on february 26 , 2015 … and such rule shall have no force or effect. .

a similar measure , s.j.res .

14 , introduced on april 28 , 2015 , by senator rand paul stated that "congress disapproves the rule submitted by the federal communications commission relating to regulating broadband internet access ... , and such rule will have no force and effect. .

the cra empowers congress to review , under an expedited legislative process , new federal regulations and , if a joint resolution is passed and signed into law , to invalidate such regulations .

attempts were also made , through the appropriations process , to add language that would have delayed the fcc from using its funds to implement the open internet order until the courts address its legality and / or regulate rates .

language attached to the house financial services fy2017 appropriation measure ( h.r .

5485 ) contained among its provisions those that prevented the fcc from using any funds "... to implement , administer or enforce" the open internet order until the legal challenges to the order have been resolved ( title vi §632 ) .

the bill also contained a provision that prohibited the fcc from using fy2017 funds to directly or indirectly regulate the prices , fees , or data caps and allowances charged or imposed by providers of broadband internet access services ( title vi §631 ) .

the funding bill was passed ( 30-17 ) by the house appropriations committee on june 9 , 2016 , and passed the house ( 239-185 ) on july 7 , 2016 .

separately , legislation ( h.r .

4596 , s. 2283 ) addressing the transparency requirements contained in the 2015 open internet order was also under consideration .

transparency requirements refer to the disclosures that internet service providers are required to provide to their end users and edge providers and includes , among other things , network management practices , performance , and commercial terms .

these requirements were expanded upon or "enhanced" in the 2015 open internet order , and small internet service providers were given a temporary exemption from these enhanced requirements .

h.r .

4596 , introduced on february 24 , 2016 , by representative walden , addressed the transparency requirements contained in the 2015 order .

this measure was amended and passed , by voice vote , by the house energy and commerce committee on february 25 , 2016 , and subsequently passed ( 411-0 ) the house on march 16 , 2016 .

h.r .

4596 , as passed by the house , sunset the transparency exemption five years from the bill's enactment and defined small internet service providers as those who have 250,000 subscribers or less .

the bill also required the fcc to report to congress 180 days after the bill's enactment on whether the exemption should be made permanent and whether the definition of "small" for exemption purposes should be modified .

s. 2283 , introduced on november 16 , 2015 , by senator daines , also addressed the transparency exemption .

an amended version of s. 2283 passed the senate commerce committee , by voice vote , on june 15 , 2016 .

the bill , as amended , provided for an exemption of the enhanced transparency rule contained in the 2015 open internet order for small businesses .

the term "small business" was defined for purposes of the exemption as any provider of broadband internet access service that has not more than 250,000 subscribers .

the bill also required the fcc to report to congress 180 days after the bill's enactment on whether the exemption should be made permanent and whether the definition of "small" for exemption purposes should be modified .

the exemption would have lasted for three years after enactment or until the fcc completed the above report and a rulemaking to implement those recommendations .

to some degree the debate in the 114 th congress over broadband regulation became more nuanced .

some looked to the fcc to address this issue using current provisions in the 1934 communications act to protect the marketplace from potential abuses that could threaten the net neutrality concept .

others felt that existing laws are outdated and limited , cannot be used to establish regulations to address current issues , and would not stand up to court review .

they advocated that the fcc should look to congress for guidance to amend current law to update fcc authority before action is taken .

senator thune released a list of 11 principles that he felt should be used as a guide to develop legislation .

these principles are as follows: prohibit blocking ; prohibit throttling ; prohibit paid prioritization ; require transparency ; apply rules to both wireline and wireless ; allow for reasonable network management ; allow for specialized services ; protect consumer choice ; classify broadband internet access as an information service under the communications act ; clarify that section 706 of the telecommunications act may not be used as a grant of regulatory authority ; and direct the fcc to enforce and abide by these principles .

draft legislation , guided by these principles , was offered by the house energy and commerce committee and the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation .

the draft amended the communications act of 1934 to prohibit blocking lawful content and nonharmful devices ( subject to reasonable network management ) , throttling data ( subject to reasonable network management ) , and paid prioritization ; and required transparency of network management practices .

the fcc was directed to enforce these provisions through the establishment of a formal complaint procedure .

the draft permitted , within certain guidelines , the offering of specialized services .

the provision of broadband internet access service ( as well as other mass market retail services providing advanced telecommunications capability ) was classified as an information service .

the draft also prohibited the fcc , or any state commission , from using section 706 of the telecommunications act of 1996 as a grant of authority .

this draft legislation was the focus of hearings , held on january 21 , 2015 , in the senate commerce committee and the house subcommittee on communications and technology .

additional hearings focusing on a wide range of issues related to the net neutrality / broadband regulation debate were held by the senate commerce committee , the house judiciary committee , the house subcommittee on communications and technology , the house committee on oversight and government reform , and the house financial services subcommittee .

seven measures ( h.r .

circuit , which struck down the antiblocking and nondiscrimination rules adopted by the fcc in its open internet order ( verizon communications inc. v. federal communications commission , d.c .

cir. , no.11-1355 ) .

h.r .

3982 , the open internet preservation act of 2014 , and its companion measure s. 1981 , introduced on february 3 , 2014 , restored the antiblocking and nondiscrimination rules struck down by the court until the fcc takes final action , based on section 706 authority , upheld by the court , to establish new rules in its current open internet proceeding .

the fcc was also given the authority to adjudicate cases under those rules that occurred during that period .

h.r .

4880 , the "online competition and consumer choice act of 2014," and its companion measure s. 2476 , introduced on june 17 , 2014 , directed the fcc to establish regulations that prohibit paid prioritization agreements between internet service providers and content providers on the internet connection between the internet service provider and the consumer and prohibit broadband providers from prioritizing or giving preferential treatment to their own traffic , or the traffic of their affiliates , over the traffic of others .

h.r .

5429 , the "open internet act of 2014," introduced on september 9 , 2014 , restored the authority of the fcc to adopt the rules vacated by the u.s. d.c. court of appeals in verizon v. federal communications commission ( the fcc's 2010 open internet order ) .

on the other hand , h.r .

4070 , the internet freedom act , introduced on february 21 , 2014 , stated that the fcc's 2010 open internet rules shall have "no force or effect" and prohibited the fcc from reissuing regulations in the same or substantially the same form unless they were specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the enactment of the act .

exceptions were made for regulations determined by the fcc to be necessary to prevent damage to u.s. national security ; ensure the public safety ; or assist or facilitate actions taken by a federal or state law enforcement agency .

h.r .

4752 , introduced on may 28 , 2014 , amended the communications act of 1934 to prohibit the fcc from reclassifying broadband networks under title ii of the communications act .

the bill included , among other provisions , that the term "information service" is not a telecommunications service but includes broadband internet access service and that a provider of an information service may not be treated as a telecommunications carrier when engaged in the provision of an information service .

the house judiciary committee , subcommittee on regulatory reform , held a hearing on june 20 , 2014 , examining the role of antitrust law and regulation as it related to the broadband access debate .

the senate judiciary committee held a field hearing in vermont on july 1 , 2014 , and a hearing on september 17 , 2014 , to address issues related to an open internet .

a consensus on the net neutrality issue remained elusive and support for the fcc's open internet order was mixed .

 ( see " the fcc 2010 open internet order ," above. ) .

while some members of congress supported the action and in some cases would have supported an even stronger approach , others felt that the fcc had overstepped its authority and that the regulation of the internet is not only unnecessary , but harmful .

internet regulation and the fcc's authority to implement such regulations was a topic of legislation ( h.r .

exceptions were made for regulations that the fcc determined were necessary to prevent damage to national security , to ensure the public safety , or to assist or facilitate actions taken by a federal or state law enforcement agency .

the bill also contained a finding that the internet and ip - enabled services are services affecting interstate commerce and are not subject to state or municipality jurisdiction .

another measure , h.r .

166 , the "internet investment , innovation , and competition preservation act," introduced on january 5 , 2011 , by representative stearns , required the fcc to prove the existence of a "market failure" before regulating information services or internet access services .

the fcc must also conclude that the "market failure" is causing "specific , identified harm to consumers" and that regulations are necessary to ameliorate that harm .

the bill also contained provisions that required any fcc regulation to be the "least restrictive," determine that the benefits exceed the cost , permit network management , not prohibit managed services , be reviewed every two years , and be subject to sunset .

any such regulation was required to be enforced on a nondiscriminatory basis between and among broadband network , service , application , and content providers .

a more narrowly focused limitation was contained within h.r .

3630 , the "middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2011," as passed ( 234-193 ) by the house on december 13 , 2011 .

section 4105 of title iv ( spectrum provisions ) of the bill prohibited the fcc from imposing network access / management requirements on licensees .

more specifically , the provision prohibited the promulgation of auction service rules that restrict a licensee's ability to manage network traffic or prioritize the traffic on its network , or that would require providing network access on a wholesale basis .

however , the provision was removed from the bill prior to final passage ( p.l .

112-96 ) .

legislation to strengthen the fcc's ability to regulate open access by amending title ii of the 1934 communications act was also introduced .

s. 74 , the internet freedom , broadband promotion , and consumer protection act of 2011 , introduced january 25 , 2011 , by senator cantwell , provided for strengthened open access protections .

more specifically , the bill contained among its provisions those that codify the four fcc principles issued in 2005 as well as those to require internet service providers to be nondiscriminatory regarding access and transparent in their network management practices .

the bill also required internet service providers to provide service to end users upon "reasonable request" and offer stand - alone broadband access at "reasonable rates , terms , and conditions" and prohibited internet service providers from requiring paid prioritization .

the bill's requirements applied to both wireline and wireless platforms ; however , the fcc was allowed to take into consideration differences in network technologies when applying requirements .

the fcc was tasked with establishing the necessary rules , and injured parties could be awarded damages by the fcc or a federal district court .

other measures , which proved unsuccessful , were considered to prevent , or at least delay , implementation of the fcc's open internet order .

attempts were made , through the appropriations process , to add language that would prevent the fcc from using its funds to implement the open internet order .

language attached to the fy2011 appropriation measure , h.r .

1 , to prevent the use of fcc fy2011 funds for implementation of the order was passed by the house .

the continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( h.r .

1 ) , passed ( 235-189 ) by the house on february 19 , 2011 , contained an amendment , introduced by representative walden and passed by the house ( 244-181 ) , to prohibit the fcc from using any funds made available by the act to implement the fcc's open internet order adopted on december 21 , 2010 .

no such provision , however , was included in the final fy2011 appropriations bill , h.r .

1473 , passed by congress and signed by the president ( p.l .

112-10 ) .

similarly , language included in the fy2012 financial services and general government appropriations bill ( h.r .

2434 ) , which includes funding for the fcc , contained a provision that barred the fcc from using any funds to implement its open internet order adopted december 21 , 2010 .

this measure passed the house appropriations committee on june 23 , 2011 ( h.rept .

112-136 ) , but no such provision was included in the final fy2012 consolidated appropriations bill , h.r .

2055 , which was signed by president obama ( p.l .

112-74 ) on december 23 , 2011 .

another approach , using the congressional review act to overturn the order , was also considered .

identical resolutions of disapproval were introduced , on february 16 , 2011 , in both the house ( h.j.res .

37 ) and senate ( s.j.res .

6 ) .

these measures stated that congress disapproves of the rule submitted by the fcc's report and order relating to the matter of preserving the open internet and broadband industry practices adopted by the fcc on december 21 , 2010 , and further stated that "such rule would have no force or effect. .

a hearing on h.j.res .

37 was held by the house energy and commerce communications and technology subcommittee on march 9 , 2011 , and the subcommittee passed the measure ( 15-8 ) on a party - line vote immediately following the hearing .

on march 25 , 2011 , the house energy and commerce committee passed ( 30-23 ) h.j.res .

37 .

on april 8 , 2011 , the full house considered and passed ( 240-179 ) h.j.res .

37 .

however , an identical resolution of disapproval ( s.j.res .

6 ) failed to pass the senate on november 10 , 2011 , by a 52-46 vote .

legislation addressing the issue of data usage caps was also introduced .

the data cap integrity act of 2012 ( s. 3703 ) , introduced on december 20 , 2012 , by senator wyden , addressed the usage of data caps by internet service providers ( isps ) and their implementation .

included among the bill's provisions were those that required that an isp that imposes data caps must be certified by the fcc as to accuracy of data cap measurement ; that the cap "functions to reasonably limit network congestion without unnecessarily restricting internet use" ; and that the cap does not discriminate ( that is , for purposes of measuring does not provide "preferential treatment of data that is based on the source or content of the data" ) .

the bill also required isps that apply data caps to provide data tools , or identify commercially available data measurement tools , to consumers for monitoring and management .

civil penalties for violations were to be used to reimburse those violated , and unobligated funds in excess of $5 million ( annually ) were to be transferred from the newly created "data cap integrity fund" to the u.s. department of the treasury for deficit reduction .

although the 111 th congress saw considerable activity addressing the net neutrality debate , no final action was taken .

one stand - alone measure ( h.r .

3458 ) that comprehensively addressed the net neutrality debate was introduced in the 111 th congress .

h.r .

3458 , the internet freedom preservation act of 2009 , introduced by representative edward markey , and also supported by then - house energy and commerce committee chairman waxman , sought to establish a national policy of nondiscrimination and openness with respect to internet access offered to the public .

the bill also required the offering of unbundled , or stand - alone , internet access service as well as transparency for the consuming public with respect to speed , nature , and limitations on service offerings and the public disclosure of network management practices .

the fcc was tasked with promulgating the rules relating to the enforcement and implementation of the legislation .

then - house communications , technology , and the internet subcommittee chairman boucher stated that he continued to work with broadband providers and content providers to seek common ground on network management practices , and chose to pursue that approach .

furthermore , the senate commerce and house energy and commerce committees and communications subcommittees held a series of staff - led sessions with industry stakeholders to discuss a range of communications policies including broadband regulation and fcc authority .

two bills ( s. 1836 , h.r .

3924 ) were introduced in response to the adoption by the fcc of a npr on preserving the open internet .

s. 1836 , introduced on october 22 , 2009 , by senator mccain , prohibited , with some exceptions , the fcc from proposing , promulgating , or issuing any further regulations regarding the internet or ip - enabled services .

exceptions included those relating to national security , public safety , federal or state law enforcement , and universal service fund solvency .

additional provisions reaffirmed that existing regulations , including those relating to calea , remain in force and stated as a general principle that the internet and all ip - enabled services are services affecting interstate commerce and are not subject to state or municipal locality jurisdiction .

h.r .

3924 , introduced by representative blackburn on october 26 , 2009 , was identical to s. 1836 , except for title and the omission of the reference to the universal service fund .

h.con.res .

311 , introduced by representative gene green and 49 other house members on july 30 , 2010 , affirmed that it is the responsibility of congress to determine the regulatory authority of the fcc with respect to broadband internet services and called upon the fcc to suspend any further action on its proceedings until such time as congress delegates such authority to the fcc .

another measure ( h.r .

5257 ) , introduced by representative stearns , addressed the possible reclassification of broadband service and would have required , among other provisions , that the fcc prove the existence of a "market failure" before regulating information services or internet access services .

furthermore , the bill required , among other provisions , that the fcc conclude that the market failure is causing "specific , identified harm to consumers" and if devising regulations must adopt those that are the "least restrictive," permit network management , and are subject to sunset .

still another measure ( s. 3624 ) , introduced by senator demint , contained provisions that required the fcc to prove consumers are being substantially harmed by a lack of marketplace choice before imposing new regulations and to weigh the potential cost of action against any benefits to consumers or competition .

the fcc was given the authority to hear complaints for violations and award damages to injured parties .

the bill also required that any rules the fcc adopted would sunset in five years unless it could make the same finding again .

the net neutrality issue was also narrowly addressed within the context of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) .

the arra contains provisions that require the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) , in consultation with the fcc , to establish "nondiscrimination and network interconnection obligations" as a requirement for grant participants in the broadband technology opportunities program ( btop ) .

the law further directs that the fcc's four broadband policy principles , issued in august 2005 , are the minimum obligations to be imposed .

these obligations were issued july 1 , 2009 , in conjunction with the release of the notice of funds availability ( nofa ) soliciting applications for the program .

the fcc's national broadband plan ( nbp ) , which was required to be written in compliance with provisions contained in the arra , while making no recommendations , did contain discussions regarding the open internet and the classification of information services .

concern over the move by some broadband network providers to expand their implementation of metered or consumption - based billing prompted the introduction of legislation ( h.r .

2902 ) to provide for oversight of volume usage service plans .

h.r .

2902 , the broadband internet fairness act , introduced by former representative massa , required , among its provisions , that any broadband internet service provider serving 2 million or more subscribers submit any volume usage based service plan that the provider is proposing or offering to the federal trade commission ( ftc ) for approval .

the ftc , in consultation with the fcc , was required to review such plans "to ensure that such plans are fairly based on cost. .

such plans were subject to agency review and public hearings .

plans determined by the ftc to impose "rates , terms , and conditions that are unjust , unreasonable , or unreasonably discriminatory" were to be declared unlawful .

violators were subject to injunctive relief requiring the suspension , termination , or revision of such plans and were subject to a fine of not more than $1 million .
