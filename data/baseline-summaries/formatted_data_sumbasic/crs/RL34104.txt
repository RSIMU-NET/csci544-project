this report , state e - government strategies: identifying best practices and applications , is based on research conducted in 2005-2006 under contract by the lyndon b. johnson school of public affairs as a policy research project ( prp ) .

prps are designed to give students a realistic policy research experience , culminating in a final research product for a client .

this prp involved nine students from the masters of public affairs program .

professor sherri greenberg served as the faculty director .

electronic government ( "e - government" ) is currently one of the leading approaches to government reform , with initiatives being carried out at the local , tribal , state , national , and international levels .

however , frequently there is little meaningful coordination or communication between various e - government initiatives .

as a result of independently maturing technologies , there is a risk of creating more so - called "islands of automation" and "stovepipes" within and between levels of government .

these problems are further exacerbated by human and financial resource constraints .

to address these issues , congress is actively overseeing e - government initiatives and is attempting to work with omb and state governments to identify best practices , common standards , and successful strategies .

due to their variation in geography , demographics , and infrastructure , states serve as laboratories of experimentation for e - government .

federal policymakers may find aspects of state e - government planning and implementation useful examples for future decisions regarding the integration of federal information and services .

to that end , graduate students from the lbj school of public affairs at the university of texas at austin undertook a two semester research program to identify some of the best practices in e - government strategies and management being carried out by state governments .

for the purposes of this report , electronic government is defined as the use of information technology ( it ) to integrate government information and services for citizen , business , government , and other institutional uses .

many consider e - government as part of the evolution and extension of traditional governance .

just as in earlier times when the telephone and fax machine were innovations for government transactions , so is e - government today .

a number of factors contributed to the functioning of state e - government programs .

identifying the factors and using them to evaluate programs helped to draw distinctions and make comparisons .

although state e - government programs are markedly different from one another , the factors below are essential in understanding the e - government formulation and implementation process .

in this section , the report addresses a number of issues related to identifying recurring themes in e - government implementation .

these issues include leadership , outsourcing , influence of federal e - government initiatives , strategy development and management , funding , legal and security issues , usage and performance measures , and written strategy documents .

information about these issues was collected by the lbj students from a review of state government documents and surveys that were mailed and e - mailed to each state's office of the chief information officer ( cio ) or equivalent .

roughly 75% ( 37 states and the district of columbia ) completed and returned the survey .

the survey and case studies elicited a number of concluding observations regarding nationwide trends and best practices .

findings in several noteworthy areas are detailed below .
