in a speech on september 24 , 2001 , president george w. bush stated that "money is thelifeblood of terrorist operations today .

we're asking the world to stop payment. .

 ( 1 ) accordingly,during the past year the united states has mounted a wide - ranging domestic and international effortto freeze , seize , and intercept the flow of funds to terrorist groups .

since the september 11 attacks,roughly $121 million in terrorist assets has been frozen worldwide , but less than 20 percent of thistotal has been blocked in the past 11 months .

 ( 2 ) fora variety of reasons that will be discussed in thisreport , traditional anti - money - laundering tools appear to be of limited use in disrupting terroristfinancing , which follows a dynamic different from that of traditional criminal organizations .

inaddition , pre - september 11 financial support for terrorism from middle eastern sources reportedlyhas continued .

 ( 3 ) furthermore , there is an increasingconsensus that pursuit of terrorists' funds couldentail significant domestic and international political costs , e.g .

infringing on civil liberties orreligious freedom , alienating large muslim constituencies , inflicting harm on poor countries , andaggravating conflicts with islamic states .

some observers also criticize the diversion of resourcesfrom traditional criminal investigations ( such as ones focused on drug trafficking ) to tracking the relatively minuscule amounts of money that find their way into terrorist cells through a host ofinformal channels .

how efforts to "follow the money" should be prioritized in and integrated witha comprehensive global struggle against terrorism thus becomes an issue of considerable significancefor u.s. policymakers and for congress .

an overarching goal of u.s. counterterrorism policy since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks hasbeen to expose , disrupt , and incapacitate the financial networks of terrorist groups .

in a speechdelivered on september 24 , 2001 , president george w. bush stated: "we will direct every resourceat our command to win the war against terrorists , every avenue of diplomacy , every tool ofintelligence , every instrument of law enforcement , every financial influence .

we will starve theterrorists of funding. .

 ( 4 ) a key instrument in thiseffort was presidential executive order 13224,issued on september 23 , which blocked "all property and interests in property" of certain designatedterrorists and individuals and entities materially supporting them .

 ( 5 ) as of late november 2002 , some250 individuals and groups , most of them al qaeda - related , had been designated under the order and$36 million in terrorist - related funds in 92 separate accounts reportedly had been frozen by u.s.financial institutions .

 ( 6 ) the vast bulk of terrorist assets and funding sources , though , are considered to lie outside of the united states .

consequently , washington has made considerable effort to enlist support of othernations in the campaign against terrorist financing .

to some extent , international efforts havemirrored u.s. policy .

for example , the united nations security council ( unscr ) , pursuant tounscr resolution 1390 ( january 16 , 2002 ) and related preceding resolutions , maintains aconsolidated freeze list of some 300 individuals and entities linked to al qaeda , osama bin laden,and the taliban .

 ( 7 ) the european union and a numberof individual states maintain their ownterrorism lists and blocking orders .

as a result of these various activities , approximately $85 millionof terrorist bank funds reportedly has been frozen outside the united states in the post - september11 period .

of the total $121 million blocked worldwide , more than 75% reportedly has been linkedto the taliban and al qaeda and the rest to other terrorist entities .

 ( 8 ) the bulk of the activity hasoccurred in a few countries .

although almost 170 nations have blocking orders in force , only 4countries , including the united states , account for about two - thirds of the blocked $121 million,according to u.s. financial data .

how effective the campaign to limit terrorist finance has been is a matter of controversy .

u.s. officials regard the effort as a vital adjunct to the overall fight against terrorism .

they claim thatasset seizures to date have constricted the funds of al qaeda and other terrorist groups .

a treasurydepartment fact sheet of september 2002 noted: "our war on terror is working - - both here in theunited states and overseas .

ï¿½ al qaeda and other terrorist organizations are suffering financiallyas a result of our actions .

potential donors are being more cautious about giving money toorganizations where they fear the money might wind up in the hands of terrorists .

in addition , greaterregulatory scrutiny over financial systems around the world in the future may identify those whowould support terrorist groups or activities. .

 ( 9 ) others have expressed skepticism about the campaign .

as a recent report by a u.n. security council monitoring group observes , "al qaeda continues to have access to considerable financialand other resources. .

as noted above , reports indicate that less than 20 percent of the reported $121million total in blocked terrorist assets have been frozen since mid - january 2002 , which suggests thatthe campaign is yielding sharply diminishing returns .

"government officials have indicated that ithas proved extremely difficult to identify these additional funds and resources," the u.n. reportconcludes .

 ( 10 ) the difficulty may be attributed to various factors .

some observers claim that al qaeda is relying increasingly on non - bank mechanisms to move and store funds , such as converting assetsto untraceable commodities , including gold and diamonds , or moving funds via informal valuetransfer ( "hawala" ) systems that leave virtually no paper trail .

alternatively , al qaeda may haveacquired greater sophistication in laundering funds .

bin laden himself remarked to a pakistanijournalist shortly after the september 11 attacks that his financial backers "are as aware of the cracksinside the western financial system as they are of the lines of their hands. .

 ( 11 ) additionally , the evident fragmentation of terrorist finances poses significant challenges for law enforcement .

many small terrorist cells are virtually self - sustaining , deriving income from legitimatebusinesses or from assorted small criminal scams .

 ( 12 ) in such cases , there is not much of a money trailto follow .

moreover , terrorist operations tend to be cheap ; a u.s. government report notes "therelatively modest funds needed to undertake them elude all but the most concentrated oversight. .

 ( 13 ) apparently the september 11 attacks , which cost an estimated $500,000 , required a strategic infusionof funding from outside ( much of it reportedly from a terror support network in the united arabemirates ) .

 ( 14 ) yet the highly destructive 1993world trade center bombing , according to its"mastermind" ramzi yousef , cost less than $20,000 .

reportedly , the conspirators were able to fundthe operation themselves from criminal activities such as check and credit card fraud , and throughdonations raised from a local charity .

 ( 15 ) a related concern centers on the level of international cooperation in disrupting terror financing .

some of the wellsprings of financial support for terrorism , especially sources in middle easterncountries , reportedly have been little affected by the post - september 11 crackdown .

a report by thecouncil on foreign relations released in october 2002 states , "for years , individuals and charitiesbased in saudi arabia have been the most important sources of funds for al qaeda , and for yearssaudi officials have turned a blind eye to this problem. .

 ( 16 ) u.s. officials publicly state that they arepleased with saudi cooperation , but it is widely believed that some saudi donors continue to financeterror .

 ( 17 ) a july 2002 report by the royalcanadian mounted police states that in saudi arabia aloneindividuals continue to donate $1 to $2 million a month to bin laden through mosques and otherfundraising avenues that also perform legitimate charity work .

 ( 18 ) saudi performance in freezingassets seems to be improving ; between late october and late november 2002 the amount of fundsblocked by the kingdom reportedly increased more than tenfold , but whether this enforcement actionhas significantly curbed the flow of funds to terrorists is uncertain .

washington can continue to tryto pressure the saudis , but for overarching strategic reasons - u.s. - saudi military ties and worlddependence on saudi oil - u.s. leverage in the situation or the readiness to use it is limited .

another controversial topic concerns the scope of the u.s. - led campaign .

u.s. designations under executive order 13224 target international terrorism broadly and include numerous terroristentities that have little or no association with al qaeda .

yet the international community has not yetadopted a unified definition of who is a terrorist and what constitutes terrorist activity .

the universaladage , "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," has particular relevance here .

forinstance , the convention on terrorism of the organization of the islamic states says that "peoples'struggles aimed at liberation and self - determination shall not be considered a terrorist crime. .

 ( 19 ) hamas and hezbollah are excluded under this definition .

moreover , the european union has notincluded hezbollah on its freeze list but only designated the military wing of hamas ( hamas izzal din al qassem ) for sanctions purposes .

 ( 20 ) theu.n .

list is limited to entities linked to al qaedaand the taliban .

in the view of some , differences with european and middle eastern states overdesignations of terrorists could detract from the international fight against al qaeda .

most controversial of all , perhaps , have been the u.s. freezing orders against islamic charities and other nongovernmental organizations ( ngos ) .

certain charities allegedly serving as conduitsfor terrorist funds also support legitimate humanitarian causes .

one targeted organization - - the holyland foundation for relief and development ( hlfrd ) - - disbursed approximately $6 million in2000 , mostly to palestinian refugee families in jordan , lebanon , and israel , according to its annualreport .

 ( 21 ) ( hlfrd is the largest islamic charityin the united states. ) .

the government claims thehlfrd funds flow to the civilian "dawa" infrastructure of hamas , which manages broad - basedcharitable activities for needy families , but also provides support for families of suicide bombers,some with hamas connections .

 ( also , other international donors may support the same causes .

one allegedly hamas - controlled entity that the hlfrd financed - - the al razi hospital in the westbank - - also reportedly received assistance from the u.s. agency for international development aswell as the uae's red crescent society .

 ( 22 ) ) furthermore , the government's policy , has beendescribed as having created the impression that america is intolerant of a religious minority .

givingalms to the less fortunate is a central tenet of islam and charities are seen as performing an importantrole in this respect .

as the director of the muslim affairs council notes , "the administration policyhas interfered with a basic pillar or tenet of islam: zakat or almsgiving ï¿½ in this respect therestriction on muslim charities is an issue of religious freedom. .

 ( 23 ) the above discussion raises a number of significant questions with respect to u.s. counterterrorism policy and efforts to combat terrorist finance .

first , based on the evidence , whatconclusions are to be drawn about current patterns and objectives of terrorist financing ? .

second,have freezing orders and related measures significantly impacted al qaeda's ability to raise,accumulate , and transfer funds ? .

third , does the current u.s. approach carry higher costs thanrewards , and are other aspects of policy - - such as dismantling terror networks and tracing andundermining their leadership - - likely to yield better results ? .

fourth , can the fight against terrorfinance be made more effective , less disruptive , and more compatible with the policies of foreignnations ? .

these questions will be addressed in the discussion that follows .

information presented in this report suggests that , while the current campaign against terroristfinance reportedly has diminished al qaeda's ability to recruit and sustain allegiances , significantfunds still appear to be available to the organization .

efforts to further regulate and introducetransparency into the global financial system are welcome steps ; yet they will not necessarily reduceterrorists' striking capacity because most of the proposed measures cannot with certainty separateout terrorists from other types of lawbreakers .

the plethora of reporting requirements creates a sortof "needle - in - the - haystack" problem for the authorities .

al qaeda's evident ability - - documentedeven before the september 11 attacks - - to exploit non - bank mechanisms of moving and storingvalue , as well as its structure of decentralized self - supporting cells represent additional constraintson law enforcement .

finally , in the view of many observers , the amount of cooperation againstterrorist financing that can be expected from saudi arabia and other gulf states , where support ofpalestinian "freedom fighters" and opposition to u.s. and isreali policies in that region has gone onfor decades , is problematic .

investigation of terrorists' finances can be a useful tool for identifying linkages among terrorist cells and possibly major donor networks .

analyses of records confiscated by green quest and tfosmight contribute more to the anti - terror fight than the actual freezing of assets , which so far has beenmodest .

these collateral benefits are difficult to assess because much of the relevant information remains in the classified realm .

also the treasury department announced in november 2002 thatit was offering a reward of up to $5 million for information "leading to the dismantlement of anysystem used to finance a terrorist organization. .

 ( 85 ) much larger rewards ( $25 million ) have beenissued also for the capture of al qaeda leaders osama bin laden and his aide ayman al - zawahiri,but with no result .

in general , the potential of these investigative tools remains to be developed.terrorists , like criminals , can work through labyrinths of intermediaries , create false trails , andexploit internet money transfers and new payment technologies to disguise the source and ownershipof their illicit proceeds .

overall , although u.s. financial actions against terrorism have produced significant tangible successes , whether measured in terms of immobilization of funds or of knowledge gained aboutterrorist structures , the full impact of those actions is uncertain .

the bush administration's 2002national money laundering strategy promises to "apply the lessons we have learned from thefederal government's effort against money laundering to attack the scourge of terrorism. .

yet suchefforts have made limited headway against money laundering operations such as the black marketpeso exchange that recycles billions of dollars in illegal proceeds , mainly from the drug trade .

terrorists' multitudinous small transactions , often camouflaged as legitimate business or socialactivities , may prove even more difficult for financial investigators to track and shut down .

furthermore , the campaign against terrorist finance has provoked controversy on various religious , public policy , and humanitarian grounds .

the new antiterror standards have been portrayedas selectively anti - islamic .

indeed , the 12 charities designated under executive order 12334 allappear to be associated with islamic causes .

some observers speculate that the u.s. image abroadhas suffered as a result of the freezing of charities' funds .

one u.s. muslim spokesperson agrees,"in an ideal setting , american muslim charities serve a national security interest by promoting apositive image of america throughout the muslim world .

unfortunately , the view that america'smuslims are a harassed or persecuted minority is gaining ground overseas , partly because of theblockage of the muslim charities. .

 ( 86 ) a related issue concerns the bush administration's definition of the terrorist enemy , which , as noted , clearly diverges from that of european and ( especially ) middle eastern states .

the broad u.s.designation of islamic militant groups for freezing purposes is said to have deepened the sense ofambivalence and unease in the entire arab region .

according to one account , "countries such assaudi arabia , egypt , jordan , and syria have urged bush to focus narrowly on blocking off binladen's financial network rather than simultaneously targeting other terrorist groups. .

 ( 87 ) in this view,washington's simultaneously broad and unilateralist approach to terrorism detracts from theinternational coalition against al qaeda , diminishing the chances that arab governments will crackdown on its major supporters .

other possible dysfunctions of the campaign relate to the interruption of assistance flows .

for instance , the crux of the government's case for closing the holy land foundation was that thefoundation's projects in the west bank and gaza allowed hamas to amass popular support "bydistributing charity to people who then associated this social outreach with hamas. .

 ( 88 ) yet thebenefits of cutting funds to hamas - controlled entities in this case can be weighed against thepotential human costs .

the foundation's programs and services have "directly improved the livesof more than 500,000 people," ( 89 ) according to its2000 annual report .

 ( the fact that otherinternational donors , according to the u.s. agency for international development , supported ahamas - built hospital funded by holy land underscores the dilemma associated with charitablegiving in this war - torn region. ) .

in sum , while charities and other financial entities may move money to terrorists , u.s. efforts to shut off this flow have caused controversy .

in the view of some observers , closing down entireenterprises that fill social needs in poor countries in order to keep some funds out of terrorists'hands carries excessively high political and diplomatic costs .

no simple solutions may exist to thisapparent conflict .

however , various "damage control" measures have been proposed to increasetransparency of charities' operations and reduce their vulnerability to freezing actions .

these includerequiring charities to list their donors , to specify exactly how their funds are used , to reveal thenames of their directors , and to disclose financial links to other charitable organizations .

anotherproposal is to treat charities under existing legislation ( the 1970 bank secrecy act and the 2001 usapatriot act ) as financial institutions subject to money laundering risk ; charities would then berequired to submit suspicious activity reports , establish internal audit procedures , and submit tofederal examiners like , say , banks , insurance companies , and hedge funds .

 ( 90 ) more regulatory oversight might afford officials the chance to indict and prosecute individuals ( or branches ) within charities that are disbursing funds to terrorists , while preserving the financialsituation of the organization as a whole .

the united states has proposed to other countries , includingsaudi arabia , that they set up government bodies to better monitor and control charities , so the ideaseems to be gaining currency .

saudi arabia itself has announced plans to set up such a governmentagency .

 ( 91 ) to be sure , wealthy donors who wantto support al qaeda terror bombers need not usecharities as conduits for their funds .

 ( 92 ) yetincreasing regulatory scrutiny could both diminishcharities' role in terrorist finance and allow legitimate funding of projects to proceed , which are theprincipal points at issue here .

recently , the treasury department issued "voluntary best practices"guidelines for charities in response to requests from american muslim communities who reportedreductions in charitable giving and apprehensions among charitable donors as a consequence of treasury's blocking actions ; whether these guidelines will provide sufficient protection to charities,though , remains to be seen .

 ( 93 ) a more difficult problem is reconciling the different u.s. and middle eastern conceptions of what constitutes terrorist activity .

the more encompassing u.s. definition , which reflects u.s.policy in the israeli - palestinian conflict as well as widespread domestic abhorrence of violencedirected against civilians , clearly is at odds with that of much of the islamic world .

 ( 94 ) the ratheregregious fund - raising campaigns in persian gulf states in support of families of palestinian"martyrs," including suicide bombers , epitomizes these conflicting perceptions .

a possible u.s.strategy in this situation would be to pursue the campaign against terror finance on different levels,publicly asserting opposition to terrorism in any form while privately seeking agreement with saudiarabia and other involved states on ways to curb flows of funds to al qaeda .

even with a limiteddiplomatic agenda , though , obtaining meaningful cooperation against terror may prove to be anuphill battle .
