in response to the sustained period of high unemployment during the last recession , which began in december 2007 and ended in june 2009 , congress enacted several temporary laws to extend unemployment ins urance ( ui ) benefits .

for instance , from july 2008 through december 2013 , the now - expired emergency unemployment compensation ( euc08 ) program provided federally financed ui benefits in addition to state - financed , regular benefits available through the permanent - law unemployment compensation ( uc ) program .

this temporary extension of ui benefits took place at a time when the federal government and the states faced serious budgetary pressures .

in recent years , various proposals have been offered to reduce the large and growing federal budget deficits , as well as to make various reforms to the ui system , including measures to alleviate state ui financing stress and to improve the solvency of the ui trust fund .

in this context of increased spending on ui benefits amidst ongoing concerns about the level of federal budget deficits , proposals to restrict the receipt of unemployment benefits by high - income individuals emerged .

for example , in the 112 th congress , the house - passed version of h.r .

3630 , the middle class tax relief and job creation act , included a provision that would have imposed an income tax on unemployment benefits for high - income individuals .

using a scaled approach , the percentage of unemployment benefits subject to tax would have increased with an individual's adjusted gross income ( agi ) — beginning with agi of $750,000 for a single tax filer and $1.5 million for a married couple filing a joint return .

under this proposal , unemployment benefits would have been taxed at 100% for a single tax filer with agi of $1 million and for a married couple filing a joint return with agi of $2 million .

the final version of h.r .

3630 enacted by congress and signed into law by president obama ( p.l .

112-96 , signed on february 22 , 2012 ) extended ui benefits , among other provisions .

it did not , however , include the provision in the house - passed version of the bill that would have restricted unemployment benefit receipt based on income .

while the debate in congress commonly refers to a proposed policy of restricting the receipt of unemployment benefits by "millionaires," various proposals have specified different income thresholds .

for example , one proposal would have placed restrictions on unemployment benefit income for a single tax filer with agi of at least $750,000 ( or at least $1.5 million for a married couple filing a joint return ) .

another proposal would have placed restrictions on unemployment benefit income for a single tax filer with agi of at least $500,000 ( or at least $1 million for a married couple filing jointly ) .

although the proposals varied in how they define high - income individuals , each would have restricted individuals and households with incomes above a specified threshold from receiving unemployment benefits .

this report addresses many of the questions that have arisen regarding such proposals , including the potential number of people who would be affected and the potential savings to federal and state governments .

to place these proposals into context , the report provides a brief overview of the ui system and explains why receipt of ui benefits is not restricted based on income under current law .

it then presents internal revenue service ( irs ) data on the distribution of household income and unemployment benefits for two tax years: 2010 , when ui receipt was at a recent peak , and 2014 , the most recently available data , to shed light on the size of the group potentially affected by such proposals .

the report raises policy considerations such as the potential impact of such proposals on federal expenditures , given the joint federal - state nature of unemployment programs .

finally , it summarizes relevant , recent legislation .

this section addresses some of the policy considerations associated with proposals to restrict the payment of ui benefits to those with high incomes .

these include the potential effect on federal expenditures given the joint federal - state nature of unemployment programs and the potential increase in administrative costs associated with such proposals .

in the 112 th and 113 th congresses , a number of proposals were introduced that would restrict or highly tax the unemployment benefit income of unemployed workers with high incomes .

these bills are summarized below .

as of the date of this report , no bills have been introduced in the 114 th congress to restrict ui receipt based on income .
