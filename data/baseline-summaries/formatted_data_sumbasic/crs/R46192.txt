for several decades the federal government has funded efforts to explore the feasibility of mitigating the release of greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) while burning fossil fuels as a source of energy .

carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) âthe process of capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) at its source , such as a coal - fired power plant , and storing it underground instead of releasing into the atmosphereâhas been proposed as a technological solution for mitigating emissions while using fossil energy .

federal policies on ccs have received support in recent congresses , including support for research and development ( r&d ) and expansion of tax credits for carbon storage .

the u.s. fourth national climate assessment , released in 2018 , states that "the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the united states and are projected to intensify in the futureâbut the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. .

this report focuses on federal policy regarding the underground carbon storage stage of ccs .

underground carbon storage is achieved through geologic sequestration and as an incidental benefit of enhanced oil recovery ( eor ) , which both use injection by well to place co 2 into deep subsurface geologic formations .

geologic sequestration involves storing co 2 by placing it permanently in an underground formation .

this process is being tested in the united states and several other countries , including several large - scale late - stage r&d projects .

eor involves injecting co 2 to produce additional oil and gas from underground reservoirs and has been used in the united states since the 1970s .

both geologic sequestration and eor are regulated under the safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) for the purpose of protecting underground sources of drinking water ( usdws ) .

the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) and delegated states administer sections of sdwa relevant to underground injection and carbon storage .

the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) also engages in underground carbon storage through supporting r&d activities .

congress has supported carbon storage via underground injection through recent legislation directing doe to expand r&d activity and increasing the federal tax credit for underground carbon storage .

as congress considers policies on underground carbon storage , including geologic sequestration and eor , members may wish to consider the current regulatory framework and status of federal and federally sponsored activities in this area .

this report provides background on underground injection and geologic sequestration processes and related federal r&d .

it then analyzes the federal framework for regulating land - based underground injection of co 2 both for geologic sequestration and eor .

finally , it includes a discussion of several policy issues for congress and recent relevant federal legislation .

not covered in this report are research and management of ccs elements not directly related to underground injection , including carbon capture and the pipeline and transportation infrastructure for captured co 2 .

regulation of geologic sequestration on federal land and offshore geologic sequestration of co 2 are also beyond the scope of this report .

for additional information on the technical aspects of ccs , see crs report r44902 , carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) in the united states , by peter folger .

over the last decade , the focus of federal carbon storage r&d efforts , including geologic sequestration and eor , has shifted from small demonstration projects to exploration of its technical and commercial viability for storing large volumes of captured co 2 .

doe leads the federal government's underground carbon storage r&d as part of the agency's fossil energy programs .

doe's work includes conducting fundamental laboratory research on wells , storage design , geologic settings , and monitoring and assessment of the injected co 2 .

in 2003 , doe created the regional carbon sequestration partnerships ( rcsp ) programâa set of public - private partnerships across the united states to characterize , validate , and develop large - scale field testing of co 2 injection and storage methods .

the rcsp program supports these r&d projects , which include carbon storage through geologic sequestration and eor , through partnerships with the petroleum and chemical industries and public and private research institutions .

congress has supported doe's carbon storage work through appropriations and , beginning in 2005 , through enacting legislation directing doe to establish programs in this area .

the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact , p.l .

109-58 ) , section 963 , directed doe to carry out a 10-year carbon capture r&d program to develop technologies for use in new and existing coal combustion facilities .

among the specified objectives of this program , congress directed doe , "in accordance with the carbon dioxide capture program , to promote a robust carbon sequestration program" and continue r&d work through carbon sequestration partnerships .

epact section 354 directed the agency to establish a demonstration program to inject co 2 for the purposes of eor while increasing the sequestration of co 2 .

the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa , p.l .

110-140 ) amended epact section 963 and expanded doe's work in carbon sequestration r&d and demonstration .

eisa title vii , subtitle a , directed doe to conduct fundamental science and engineering research in carbon capture and sequestration and to conduct geologic sequestration training and research .

subtitle a also specifically directed doe to carry out at least seven large - scale projects testing carbon sequestration systems in a diversity of formations , which could include rcsp projects .

subtitle b directed doe to conduct a national assessment for onshore capacity for co 2 sequestration .

to date in the united states , nine doe - supported projects have injected large volumes of co 2 into underground formations as part of ccs systems or related eor r&d projects ( see appendix b ) .

three of these active projects involve injection into saline formations for geologic sequestration ( for demonstration purposes ) , five involve injection for eor purposes , and one involves both sequestration and eor .

four of these projects are currently injecting and / or storing co 2 .

the petra nova facility in texas is the first operating industrial - scale coal - fired electricity generating plant with a ccs system in the united states .

the captured co 2 is transported by pipeline to an oil field where it is injected for eor .

the project is jointly owned by several energy companies and was partially funded by doe .

in decatur , il , adm is injecting co 2 from its ethanol production plant into an onsite sandstone formation for geologic sequestration .

the air products carbon capture project in port arthur , tx , has been injecting co 2 captured from steam methane reformers since 2013 as part of eor operations .

each of these projects received funds from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) .

the michigan basin project in otsego county , mi , is injecting co 2 from a natural gas facility for eor .

doe provides partial funding for this project through the rcsp program .

all of the projects operate through collaborations among doe , industry , and local research institutions .

five other projects that injected co 2 were implemented through the rcsp program .

the projects included sequestration into various underground formations and storage associated with eor with volumes of co 2 injected and stored ranging from a few hundred tons to over 1 million tons ( considered commercial - scale ) .

the rcsp program is currently in the development phase , which doe defines as large - scale field testing of high volumes of co 2 storage .

these projects have completed injection and are now in the post - injection monitoring phase .

all of the existing rcsp projects are scheduled to end by july 2022 , but doe is in the process of selecting additional projects for the program .

in the united states , while numerous large - scale storage r&d projects are ongoing , none of the projects injecting co 2 solely for geologic sequestration are operating in a commercial capacity .

worldwide , public - private partnerships have implemented several co 2 geologic sequestration projects in diverse regions .

there are two active projects , both in norway , where facilities at the sleipner gas field in the north sea and snohvit in the barents sea conduct offshore sequestration under the norwegian continental shelf .

chevron's gorgon injection project , a natural gas production facility in australia , plans to begin sequestering co 2 in 2020 and store a total of 100 million tons of co 2 .

canada , japan and algeria have carried out smaller - scale ccs projects with sequestration in saline reservoirs .

this section provides an overview of the federal framework for regulating underground injection of co 2 for both geologic sequestration and eor .

it describes the primary federal statute for underground injection control ( uic ) , the general federal and state roles in developing and implementing uic regulations , and the uic well classes .

the section analyzes the differences between wells used solely for geologic sequestration and wells used for eor .

it also outlines the regulatory requirements for transitioning from eor wells to geologic sequestration wells .

if congress were to address carbon storage through underground injection , there are a variety of policy issues members may consider .

several policy issues relate to the current sdwa uic regulatory framework and what elements of co 2 injection are covered under the statute's purpose and approach .

congress may also wish to consider other issues that may have implications for co 2 injection and storage policy , including current pathways of federal support for ccs and underground carbon storage , project cost , and stakeholder perspectives on ccs and fossil fuels .

 table 2 , below , lists legislation introduced in the 116 th congress that includes provisions relating to geologic sequestration of co 2 ( as of date of report publication ) .

legislation in the 116 th congress has focused on research and development of ccs , including carbon storage through eor and geologic sequestration , and adjustments to the 45q carbon storage tax credit .
