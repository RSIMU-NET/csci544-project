t his report describes selected health care - related provisions that are scheduled to expire during the first session of the 116 th congress ( i.e. , during calendar year [cy] 2019 ) .

for purposes of this report , expiring provisions are defined as portions of law that are time - limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached , absent further legislative action .

the expiring provisions included in this report are those related to medicare , medicaid , state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and private health insurance programs and activities .

the report also includes health care - related provisions that were enacted in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 ) or last extended under the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l .

115-123 ) .

in addition , this report describes health care - related provisions within the same scope that expired during the 115 th congress ( i.e. , during cy2017 or cy2018 ) .

although the congressional research service ( crs ) has attempted to be comprehensive , it cannot guarantee that every relevant provision is included here .

this report generally focuses on two types of health care - related provisions within the scope discussed above .

the first type of provision provides or controls mandatory spending , meaning that it provides temporary funding , temporary increases or decreases in funding ( eg , medicare provider bonus payments ) , or temporary special protections that may result in changes in funding levels ( eg , medicare funding provisions that establish a floor ) .

mandatory spending is controlled by authorization acts ; discretionary spending is controlled by appropriations acts .

the second type of provision defines the authority of government agencies or other entities to act , usually by authorizing a policy , project , or activity .

such provisions also may temporarily delay the implementation of a regulation , requirement , or deadline , or establish a moratorium on a particular activity .

expiring health care provisions that are predominantly associated with discretionary spending activitiesâsuch as discretionary authorizations of appropriations and authorities for discretionary user feesâare excluded from this report .

certain types of provisions with expiration dates that otherwise would meet the criteria set forth above are excluded from this report .

some of these provisions are excluded because they are transitional or routine in nature or have been superseded by congressional action that otherwise modifies the intent of the expiring provision .

for example , statutorily required medicare payment rate reductions and payment rate re - basings that are implemented over a specified time period are not considered to require legislative attention and are excluded .

the report is organized as follows: table 1 lists the relevant provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2019 .

table 2 lists the relevant provisions that expired during 2018 or 2017 .

the provisions in each table are organized by expiration date and applicable health care - related program .

the report then describes each listed provision , including a legislative history .

the summaries are grouped by provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2019 followed by those that expired in 2018 or 2017 .

appendix a lists demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2019 or that expired in 2018 or 2017 and are related to medicare , medicaid , chip , and private health insurance programs and activities or other health care - related provisions that were enacted in the aca or last extended under the bba 2018 .

appendix b lists all laws that created , modified , or extended the health care - related expiring provisions described in this report .

appendix c lists abbreviations used in the report .

medicare pays ltchs for inpatient hospital care under the ltch pps , which is typically higher than payments for inpatient hospital care under the ipps .

effective for cost - reporting periods beginning in fy2016 , ltchs are paid the ltch pps rate for patients that meet one of the following two criteria: ( 1 ) had a prior three - day intensive - care - unit stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay or ( 2 ) is assigned to an ltch pps case - mix group that is based on the receipt of ventilator services for at least 96 hours and had a prior hospital stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay .

discharges involving patients who have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or rehabilitation do not qualify for the ltch pps rate .

for ltch discharges that did not qualify for the ltch pps based on these criteria , a site neutral payment rate is being phased - in for cost - reporting periods beginning fy2016 through fy2019 .

subsequent legislation provided for other criteria to temporarily receive payment under the ltch pps .

see section " temporary extension of long - term care hospital ( ltch ) site neutral payment policy transition period ( ssaâ â§1886 ( m ) ( 6 ) ( b ) ( i ) ; 42â u.s.c.â â§1395ww ( m ) ( 6 ) ( b ) ( i ) ) " for details related to site neutral payment .

the c onsolidated a ppropriations a ct , 20 16 , division h , title ii , section 231 , provided an additional temporary criterion for payment under the ltch pps for discharges before january 1 , 2017 .

specifically , the ltch pps rate would apply to an ltch discharge if all three of the following are satisfied: ( 1 ) the ltch is a grandfathered hospital - within - hospital ; ( 2 ) the ltch is located in a rural area ; and ( 3 ) the patient discharged has a severe woundâdefined as a stage 3 or 4 wound , unstageable wound , nonhealing surgical wound , infected wound , fistula , osteomyelitis , or wound with morbid obesity .

cures act , division c , section 15 0 10 , reinstated , after a lapse period and with some modifications , the temporary criterion for payment under the ltch pps related to certain spinal cord conditions for discharges occurring in cost - reporting period beginning during fy2018 .

the reinstated temporary criterion , similar to the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 criterion , applies only to a grandfathered hospital - within - hospital .

it eliminates the requirement from consolidated appropriations act of 2016 that an ltch be located in a rural area and narrows the definition of a severe wound that was used in consolidated appropriations act of 2016 .

in addition , unlike the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 criterion , only discharges associated with diagnosis - related groups relating to cellulitis or osteomyelitis are eligible for the reinstated temporary criterion .

the temporary criterion for certain severe wound discharges for payment under the ltch pps expired for discharges in cost - reporting periods beginning during fy2019 and subsequent years .

congress has passed several bills to promote the widespread adoption of health information technology ( hit ) and to support the electronic sharing of clinical data among hospitals , physicians , and other health care stakeholders .

hit encompasses interoperable electronic health records ( ehrs ) âincluding computerized systems to order tests and medications , and support systems to aid clinical decision makingâand the development of a national health information network to permit the secure exchange of electronic health information among providers .

arra , section 4101 , which incorporated the health information technology for economic and clinical health act ( hitech ) , authorized medicare and medicaid incentive payments to acute - care hospitals and physicians who attest to being meaningful users of certified ehr technology .

the law instructed the hhs secretary to make the measures of "meaningful use" more stringent over time , which cms has done in stages .

beginning in cy2015 , hospitals and physicians that were or are not meaningful ehr users are subject to a medicare payment adjustment ( i.e. , penalty ) unless they qualify for a hardship exception .

cures act , section 16003 , exempted physicians who furnish "substantially all" of their services to patients in ambulatory surgery centers from a meaningful use payment penalty in cy2017 and cy2018 because physicians who provide services to beneficiaries in ascs faced additional difficulties in meeting some of the meaningful use criteria .

the exemption as specified in the cures act expired december 31 , 2018 .

current law states that this exemption is to sunset "as of the first year that begins more than 3 years after the date on which the secretary determines , through notice and comment rulemaking , that certified ehr technology applicable to the ambulatory surgical center setting is available. .

this has yet to occur .

under medicare advantage ( medicare part c , or ma ) cms pays private health plans a per - enrollee amount to provide all medicare - covered benefits ( except hospice ) to beneficiaries who enroll in their plan .

ssa section 1853 ( o ) ( 4 ) requires the hhs secretary to use a five - star quality rating system to adjust maximum possible payments to high - performing ma plans .

high star quality also results in an increase in an ma organization's rebate if its contract bid is less than the maximum amount that medicare will pay .

in addition , the five - star quality ratings are publicly reported and can be used by beneficiaries when considering which ma , part d , or medicare advantage - prescription drug ( ma - pd ) plan to enroll in .

the social security act authorizes the hhs secretary to terminate a contract with an ma organization or a perscription drug plan ( pdp ) if the hhs secretary determines that the ma organization or pdp has failed substantially to carry out the contract , is carrying out the contract in a manner inconsistent with the efficient and effective administration of the medicare program , or no longer meets the applicable medicare program conditions .

cms amended its regulations in 2012 to include a ground for contract termination relating to an ma organization's or a pdp's rating under the five - star system .

specifically , under the regulation , cms may terminate a contract with an ma organization or a pdp if the plan receives a "summary plan rating of less than 3 stars for 3 consecutive contract years. .

the regulation applies to plan ratings issued by cms after september 1 , 2012 .

cms has terminated some ma organizations' contracts on this basis .

cures act , division c , section 17001: through the end of plan year 2018 , the hhs secretary is prohibited from terminating an ma organization's contract ( or part d contract ) solely because the contract failed to achieve a minimum quality rating under the five - star rating system .

the hhs secretary has the authority to terminate an organization's ma or part d contract based solely on the organization's receipt of a part c or part d summary rating of less than three stars for three consecutive contract years .

the secretary issued a memorandum to ma plans indicating that the first star rating released after december 2018 is the first that could count toward termination .

star ratings are released in the fall of one year , displayed for beneficiary use the next year , and then used for payment purposes the following year .

as such , the cy2020 rates ( released fall cy2019 and used for payment purposes in cy2021 ) are the first that could apply toward potential termination .

the soonest possible effective date for a cms termination of an ma contract under this policy would be december 31 , 2022 .

ltchs generally treat patients who have been discharged from acute - care hospitals but require prolonged inpatient hospital care due to their medical conditions .

ltch patients have an average length of inpatient stay longer than 25 days .

ltchs can be ( 1 ) freestandingâa hospital generally not integrated with any other hospital ; ( 2 ) co - located with another hospital , either located in the same building as another hospital or in a separate building on the hospital's campus ; or ( 3 ) a satellite facility of an ltchâa separately located facility ( which may be co - located with another hospital ) that operates as part of the ltch .

beginning in fy2005 , cms implemented a new medicare payment regulation for ltchs that are co - located with other hospitals and ltch satellite facilities to limit inappropriate patient shifting driven by financial rather than clinical considerations .

under the new policy , if such an ltch received more than 25% of its medicare patients from any single referring hospital , the ltch is paid the lower of the ltch pps or the ipps payment for discharges that exceeded the threshold .

beginning in fy2008 , cms expanded the 25% patient threshold adjustment policy to include all ltchs .

mmsea , section 114 ( c ) ( 1 ) , delayed the application of cms's 25% patient threshold adjustment for freestanding ltchs and "grandfathered hospitals - within - hospitals" ltchs for three years from the enactment of mmsea ( december 29 , 2007 ) .

mmsea section 114 ( c ) ( 2 ) delayed the application of cms's 25% patient threshold adjustment for ltchs or satellite facilities co - located with another hospital if ( 1 ) ltchs or satellite facilities located in a rural area or co - located with an urban single or metropolitan statistical area ( msa ) dominant hospital receive no more than 75% of their medicare inpatients from such co - located hospitals or ( 2 ) other ltchs or satellite facilities co - located with another hospital receive no more than 50% of their medicare inpatients from such co - located hospitals .

arra , section 4302 ( a ) , modified the beginning of the delays in mmsea sections 114 ( c ) ( 1 ) and 114 ( c ) ( 2 ) from the date of enactment of mmsea ( december 29 , 2007 ) to july 1 , 2007 .

this section also modified the end date for the delay under mmsea section 114 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( ltchs co - located with another hospital ) from three years from the date of enactment to three years from october 1 , 2007 ( or july 1 , 2007 , in the case of a satellite facility described in 42 c.f.r .

â§412.22 ( h ) ( 3 ) ( i ) ) .

in addition , arra section 4302 ( a ) modified the delay under mmsea section 114 ( c ) ( 1 ) to include ltchs or satellite facilities that , as of the date of enactment under mmsea , were co - located with a provider - based off - campus location of an ipps hospital that did not provide services payable under the ipps at the off - campus location .

aca , section 3106 , extended the delay of the 25% patient threshold adjustment two additional years .

psra , section 1206 ( b ) ( 1 ) , extended the delay of the 25% patient threshold adjustment four additional years to expire after june 30 , 2016 ( or after september 30 , 2016 , for certain ltchs co - located with another hospital ) .

cures act , division c , section 15006 , delayed the 25% patient threshold adjustment for discharges occurring october 1 , 2016 , through september 30 , 2017 .

this provision reinstated the psra delay that expired after june 30 , 2016 ( and extended the psra delay that expired after september 30 , 2016 , for certain ltchs co - located with another hospital ) .

the statutory delay in cms applying the 25% patient threshold adjustment to ltchs expired after september 30 , 2017 .

however , the hhs secretary extended the delay through fy2018 and eliminated it beginning fy2019 through rulemaking .

under medicare , ltchs were exempt from the ipps when it was established in 1983 .

instead , ltchs were paid on a reasonable - cost basis subject to certain limits established by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 ( tefra ; p.l .

97-248 ) .

under the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 ( bbra 99 ; p.l .

106-113 ) , the ltch pps was established , which provides a per - discharge payment based on the average costs and patient mix of ltchs .

the ltch pps typically provides higher medicare payment rates for inpatient hospital care than the ipps .

the rapid increase in both the number of ltchs and ltch payments led to enactment of a temporary moratorium on the development of new ltchs and a moratorium on new ltch beds , with certain exceptions .

mmsea , section 114 ( d ) , established a three - year moratorium from the date of enactment ( december 29 , 2007 ) on the development of new ltchs , with exceptions for ( 1 ) ltchs that began their qualifying period for medicare reimbursement before the enactment of mmsea ; ( 2 ) ltchs that had a binding written agreement before the enactment of mmsea for the actual construction , renovation , lease , or demolition of an ltch , and had expended at least 10% of the estimated cost of the project ( or $2.5 million , if less ) ; and ( 3 ) ltchs that had obtained an approved certificate of need in a state where one is required on or before the date of enactment of mmsea .

mmsea section 114 ( d ) also established a three - year moratorium from the date of enactment ( december 29 , 2007 ) on the increase in beds in existing ltchs , with exceptions for ( 1 ) ltchs located in a state where there is only one other ltch and ( 2 ) ltchs that request an increase in beds following the closure or decrease in the number of beds of another ltch in the state .

arra , section 4302 , amended the three - year moratorium on the increase in beds in existing ltchs by providing an exception to ltchs that had obtained a certificate of need for such an increase in ltch beds on or after april 1 , 2005 , and before the enactment of mmsea .

aca , section 3106 ( b ) , extended the moratoria established under mmsea an additional two years ( expiring after december 29 , 2012 ) .

psra , section 1206 ( b ) ( 2 ) , reinstated the moratoria under mmsea beginning january 1 , 2015 , and expiring after september 30 , 2017 ; however , psra did not allow any exceptions to the reinstated moratoria .

pama , section 112 ( b ) , amended the moratoria reinstated by psra to begin with enactment of psra ( december 26 , 2013 ) rather than january 1 , 2015 .

further , this section provided the same exceptions on the development of new ltchs that had been provided under mmsea but did not provide exceptions for the increase in ltch beds .

cures act , division c , section 15004 , reinstated the exception to the moratorium on the increase in ltch beds effective as if it had been enacted by pama , april 1 , 2014 , to coincide with the previously reinstated exception for new ltchs .

the moratorium on the development of new ltchs and on the increase of beds in existing ltchs expired as of september 30 , 2017 .

the 2009 outpatient prospective payment system ( opps ) final rule required that therapeutic hospital outpatient services be furnished under the direct supervision of a physician .

however , beginning in cy2010 , cms instructed its contractors not to evaluate or enforce the supervision requirements for therapeutic services provided to outpatients in critical access hospitals ( cahs ) .

cms extended this non - enforcement instruction for cy2011 and expanded it to include small rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds .

subsequently , cms extended the instruction for cy2012 and cy2013 , the non - enforcement instruction has been extended several more times through legislation and rules .

an act to provide for the extension of the enforcement instruction on supervision requirements for outpatient therapeutic services in critical access and small rural hospitals through 2014 ( p.l .

113-198 ) , required the hhs secretary to extend the non - enforcement instruction through cy2014 .

an act to provide for the extension of the enforcement instruction on supervision requirements for outpatient therapeutic services in critical access and small rural hospitals through 2015 ( p.l .

114-112 ) , required the hhs secretary to extend the non - enforcement instruction through cy2015 .

cures act , section 16004 , extended the non - enforcement instruction through cy2016 .

bba 2018 , section 51007 , extended the non - enforcement instruction through cy2017 retroactively .

although the non - enforcement instruction has statutorily expired , the cy2018 opps / ambulatory surgery center ( asc ) final rule with comment period re - established the non - enforcement policy beginning on january 1 , 2018 , and extended the instruction through december 31 , 2019 .
