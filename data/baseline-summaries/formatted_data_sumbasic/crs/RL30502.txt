4577 / h.r .

5658 ) .

however , p.l .

106-346 , signed by the president october 23 , providessupplemental funding for certainof those accounts ( title v ) .

the president , through the office of management and budget ( omb ) is required to submit to congress , annually , the budget of the united states government .

on february 7 , 2000 , the budget for fy2001 was submitted .

 ( 1 ) congress has established a procedure by which it passes a concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget for the government and setting forthbudgetary levels for several years in the future .

 ( 2 ) thehouse and senate appropriations committees then allocate the discretionary funding levels ( 302 ( b ) ) allocations to each of the subcommittees .

see the section of this report entitled "major funding trends" for adiscussion of the fy2001 allocations for treasuryand general government appropriations .

appropriations for the department of the treasury , in addition to funding the operations of the department , fund the work of a group of law enforcementorganizations , which include the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms ; the customs service ; the secretservice ; the financial crimes enforcement network ; and the federal law enforcement training center .

treasury appropriations also cover the internal revenueservice , the financial management service , and thebureau of the public debt .

for the most part , the u. s. postal service has become self - supporting .

federal contributions are limited to payments to the postal service fund tocompensate for revenues foregone ( e.g . , free postal service for the blind. ) .

appropriations for the executive office of the president provide salaries and expenses for the white house office , operations of the residences of the presidentand vice president , and most other agencies within the executive office of the president ( eop ) .

organizations suchas the council of economic advisers , thenational security council , the office of management and budget , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) are funded through these provisions .

specific funding for drug control initiatives is appropriated for distribution to other entities by the ondcp .

among the independent agencies financed through this appropriation are the federal election commission , the general services administration , the nationalarchives and records administration , the office of personnel management , the office of special counsel , and theunited states tax court .

the treasury and general government appropriation always has at least two titles in addition to the four covering the funding for specific agencies .

these generaltitles apply restrictions or "rules of the road" governmentwide and , quite often , contain authority for defined actions .

for example , each year , there is standardlanguage which prohibits the use of any appropriated funds for the purpose of employing individuals who are notu.s .

citizens or citizens of nations eitherspecified in that section of the act or on the state department list of nations covered by treaties ; which requires thatall agencies maintain drug - free workplaces ; and which authorizes the expenditure of funds appropriated under any act to be used to pay the travel expenses ofimmediate family members if a federalemployee serving overseas has died or has a life - threatening illness .

see below for a presentation of new provisionsin titles v and vi .

in addition to the 21 fy2001 continuing funding resolutions , ( 9 ) there were four legislative measures designed to provide appropriations for all the treasury andgeneral government accounts and one to provide partial funding for selected accounts .
