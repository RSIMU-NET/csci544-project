this report provides a status update on fy2013 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies ( l - hhs - ed ) .

this bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to three federal departments: the department of labor ( dol ) , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of education ( ed ) .

in addition , the bill provides annual appropriations for more than a dozen related agencies , including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

discretionary funds represent less than one - quarter of the total funds appropriated in the l - hhs - ed bill .

nevertheless , the l - hhs - ed bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic non - defense federal programs among the various appropriations bills ( the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs ) .

the bulk of this report is focused on discretionary appropriations because these funds receive the most attention during the appropriations process .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , as well as various related policy issues addressed in the bill , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion and for research on human embryos and stem cells .

see the key policy staff table at the end of this report for information on which analysts to contact at the congressional research service with questions on specific agencies and programs funded in the l - hhs - ed bill .

this report is divided into several sections .

the current section provides an explanation of the scope of the l - hhs - ed bill ( and hence , the scope of this report ) , as well as an introduction to important terminology and concepts that carry throughout the report .

next is a series of sections describing the status of funding for fy2013 .

these sections describe the continuing resolutions that have governed fy2013 appropriations levels for l - hhs - ed programs ( p.l .

113-6 , p.l .

112-175 ) , as well as disaster relief appropriations ( p.l .

113-2 ) .

there is also a summary of congressional actions on fy2013 l - hhs - ed appropriations bills during the 112 th congress .

this is followed by an overview of the fy2013 president's budget request and ( for context ) a review of the conclusion of the fy2012 appropriations process .

the next section provides a brief summary and analysis of proposed mandatory and discretionary fy2013 appropriations under the senate committee bill from the 112 th congress ( s. 3295 ) and the fy2013 president's budget , by bill title , compared to comparable fy2012 funding levels .

all numbers in this section — and throughout the report as a whole ( except as noted ) — are drawn from ( or estimated based on ) amounts provided in the committee report ( s.rept .

112-176 ) accompanying s. 3295 from the 112 th congress .

 ( there is no similar analysis for the draft bill that was approved by the house appropriations l - hhs - ed subcommittee because this draft bill was not introduced or reported out of committee prior to the conclusion of the 112 th congress. ) .

the following section provides a summary of budget enforcement activities for fy2013 .

this includes a brief description of the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ) , the recent fy2013 sequestration order , and an overview of house and senate work on a budget resolution and 302 ( b ) allocations ( i.e. , budget enforcement caps ) .

finally , the report concludes with overview sections for each of the major components of the bill: the department of labor , the department of health and human services , the department of education , and related agencies .

these sections provide selected highlights of fy2013 appropriations actions based on the senate committee bill from the 112 th congress and the president's request .

note that these sections do not currently include tables showing funding levels for individual programs .

for that level of detail , see the table beginning on p. 240 of the committee report ( s.rept .

112-176 ) accompanying s. 3295 , as well as programmatic details discussed throughout the text of the committee report .

note also that analysis of the draft house subcommittee bill from the 112 th congress is not provided in these sections .

congress did not enact a regular l - hhs - ed appropriations bill prior to the beginning of fy2013 .

instead , fy2013 funding for programs typically supported by the l - hhs - ed bill was temporarily provided by a six - month continuing resolution ( cr ) , p.l .

112-175 , which was later superseded by a full - year cr ( p.l .

113-6 , division f ) .

on january 29 , 2013 , president obama signed into law the disaster relief appropriations act , 2013 ( p.l .

113-2 ) .

overall , the law provided $50.7 billion in supplemental funding and legislative provisions to address immediate losses from hurricane sandy and to support mitigation for future disasters .

programs and activities within l - hhs - ed received roughly $827 million , which was distributed as follows: $800 million to the hhs public health and social services emergency fund ( phssef ) account .

of this total , the law called for hhs to transfer $500 million to the social services block grant , $100 million to the head start program , and at least $5 million to the hhs office of the inspector general for oversight and accountability activities .

the law gave the hhs secretary discretion over the remaining $195 million , including the authority to transfer those funds throughout the department for activities such as the repair and rebuilding of nonfederal biomedical or behavioral research facilities .

$25 million to the dol workforce investment act dislocated worker national reserve to support employment services and job training for dislocated workers .

$2 million to the social security administration limitation on administrative expenses ( lae ) account for expenses directly related to hurricane sandy .

 ( these funds were made available from certain unobligated balances at the social security administration. ) .

 table 1 provides a timeline of fy2013 l - hhs - ed appropriations actions initiated by congress during the 112 th congress .

the remainder of this section provides additional detail on these and other steps toward full - year l - hhs - ed appropriations .

this section is focused on bills targeted specifically to l - hhs - ed appropriations and does not include information on broader spending bills , such as continuing resolutions or disaster supplementals , which are discussed above .

on february 13 , 2012 , the obama administration released its fy2013 budget .

the president's budget requested $166 billion in discretionary funding for accounts funded by the l - hhs - ed bill ( +1% from comparable fy2012 ) , based on estimates shown in the senate committee report .

in addition , the president's budget requested roughly $612 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding ( based on the most recent current law estimates ) , for a total of roughly $778 billion ( +5% from comparable fy2012 ) for the l - hhs - ed bill as a whole .

on december 23 , 2011 , president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( h.r .

2055 , h.rept .

112-331 , p.l .

112-74 ) .

this appropriations "megabus" provided fy2012 appropriations for nine of the twelve regular appropriations bills , including l - hhs - ed .

 ( prior to december 23 , l - hhs - ed funding for fy2012 had been provided by a series of short - term continuing resolutions: p.l .

112-68 , p.l .

112-67 , p.l .

112-55 , p.l .

112-36 , and p.l .

112-33 . ) .

also on december 23 , president obama signed into law the disaster relief appropriations act , 2012 ( h.r .

3672 , p.l .

112-77 ) , which provided additional l - hhs - ed funding for certain program integrity activities at the social security administration .

combined , these laws provided an estimated $164 billion in discretionary funding for accounts traditionally funded by the l - hhs - ed bill .

in addition , the laws provided an estimated $577 billion in mandatory funding for l - hhs - ed accounts , for a total of roughly $741 billion .

these fy2012 estimates , as reported in the s.rept .

112-176 ( accompanying the fy2013 senate committee bill ) , take into account the 0.189% across - the - board rescission required for most discretionary l - hhs - ed accounts in fy2012 , as well as estimated transfers and adjustments for comparability or other activities .

 ( for additional details on amounts provided by bill title , see table 2 in this report or see crs report r42010 , labor , health and human services , and education: fy2012 appropriations . ) .

 table 2 displays the total amount of fy2012 discretionary and mandatory l - hhs - ed funding ( adjusted for comparability ) provided , by title , compared to the fy2013 president's request and the fy2013 senate committee bill ( referred to as the fy2013 proposals in this report ) .

the amounts shown in this table reflect total budget authority provided in the bill ( i.e. , all funds appropriated in the current bill , regardless of the fiscal year in which the funds become available ) , not total budget authority available for the current fiscal year .

when taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding , hhs received more than three - quarters of the fy2012 l - hhs - ed appropriations ; the same would also be true under both of the fy2013 proposals shown in table 2 ( see figure 2 for the composition of the fy2013 senate committee bill from the 112 th congress ) .

this is largely due to the sizable amount of mandatory funding included in the hhs appropriation , the majority of which is for medicaid grants to states and payments to health care trust funds .

after hhs , the department of education and related agencies represent the next - largest shares of total l - hhs - ed funding , accounting for roughly 9% to 10% each in fy2012 and the fy2013 proposals .

unlike hhs , the majority of appropriations for ed are discretionary .

however , the bulk of funding for the related agencies goes toward mandatory payments and administrative costs of the supplemental security income program at the social security administration .

finally , the department of labor accounts for the smallest share of total l - hhs - ed funds: roughly 2% in fy2012 and the fy2013 proposals .

when looking only at discretionary appropriations , however , the overall composition of l - hhs - ed funding is noticeably different ( see figure 2 ) .

rather than being dominated by hhs alone , the majority of all discretionary appropriations ( 84% ) are split relatively evenly between hhs and ed in fy2012 and in the two fy2013 proposals .

the department of labor and the related agencies then combine to account for a roughly even split of the remaining 16% of discretionary l - hhs - ed funds in fy2012 and in the fy2013 proposals .

note that all figures in this section are based on regular l - hhs - ed appropriations only ; they do not include funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process ( eg , direct appropriations for unemployment insurance benefits payments ) .

all amounts in this section are rounded to the nearest million or billion ( as labeled ) .

the dollar changes and percent changes discussed in the text are based on unrounded amounts .

note that all figures in this section are based on regular l - hhs - ed appropriations only ; they do not include funds for hhs agencies provided through other appropriations bills ( eg , funding for the food and drug administration ) or outside of the annual appropriations process ( eg , direct appropriations for medicare or pre - appropriated mandatory funds provided by authorizing laws , such as the patient protection and affordable care act [aca , p.l .

111-148 ] ) .

all amounts in this section are rounded to the nearest million or billion ( as labeled ) .

the dollar changes and percent changes discussed in the text are based on unrounded amounts .

note that all figures in this section are based on regular l - hhs - ed appropriations only ; they do not include funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process ( eg , certain direct appropriations for federal direct student loans and pell grants ) .

the fy2013 l - hhs - ed bill reported by the senate committee on appropriations from the 112 th congress ( s. 3295 , s.rept .

112-176 ) would have provided $69.56 billion in combined mandatory and discretionary funding for related agencies funded through this bill .

this amount is $3.29 billion ( +5.0% ) more than the comparable fy2012 funding level of $66.26 billion and $31.95 million ( - 0.1% ) less than the fy2012 president's budget request of $69.59 billion , based on estimates reported in s.rept .

112-176 .

 ( see table 7 . ) .

of the total recommended for related agencies in the fy2013 senate committee bill , roughly $14.14 billion ( 20.3% ) would have been discretionary .

this amount is $318 million ( +2.3% ) more than the estimated discretionary funding level for fy2012 ( $13.83 billion ) and $32 million ( - 0.2% ) less than the discretionary total requested in the fy2013 president's budget .

in general , the largest share of funding appropriated to related agencies in the l - hhs - ed bill goes to the social security administration ( ssa ) .

when taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding , the ssa accounted for 97% of the entire related agencies appropriation in fy2012 ( $64 billion ) .

the bulk of mandatory ssa funding from the l - hhs - ed bill supports the supplemental security income program ( $52.4 billion in fy2012 ) .

when looking exclusively at discretionary funding , the ssa remains the largest component of the related agencies appropriation , constituting roughly 83% of discretionary funds in fy2012 ( $11.5 billion ) .

the majority of discretionary ssa funding covers administrative expenses for social security , ssi , and medicare .

after the ssa , the next - largest agency of the related agencies appropriation is the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) , which constituted roughly 2% of all funding and 8% of discretionary funding in fy2012 ( $1.1 billion ) .

typically , each of the remaining related agencies receives less than $1 billion from the annual l - hhs - ed appropriations bill .

one highlight for the related agencies section of the fy2013 senate committee bill from the 112 th congress ( s. 3295 ) , as compared to comparable fy2012 funding levels and proposed funding levels from the fy2013 president's budget , involves funding provided to the ssa for program integrity activities .

these activities consist of continuing disability reviews and redeterminations of ssi eligibility .

the senate committee bill would have increased the appropriation for program integrity activities from the fy2012 level of $756.05 million to $1.02 billion , with $273 million coming from base funding and $751 million coming from the budget cap adjustment authorized by the bca .

also of note , the senate committee bill would have provided the president's requested funding level of $1.06 billion for the cncs , which is $13.76 million ( +1.3% ) more than fy2012 funding level of $1.05 billion .
