in congress , multiple bills and resolutions have been introduced related to china's handling of a novel coronavirus outbreak in wuhan , china , that expanded to become the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) global pandemic .

this report provides a timeline of key developments in the early weeks of the pandemic , based on available public reporting to date .

the timeline starts with the onset of symptoms among the first known patients later identified as having covid - 19 .

the timeline documents the subsequent responses in china , at the world health organization ( who ) , and in the united states through january 31 , 2020 , the day u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) secretary alex m. azar ii declared the pandemic had become a public health emergency for the united states .

the report opens with short sections on disease terminology and the chinese geographic and political context of the outbreak in its early weeks .

the report next offers discussion of select issues raised by the timeline .

a detailed timeline follows .

a concise timeline is included in an appendix .

on february 11 , 2020 , the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the novel coronavirus "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" ( sars - cov - 2 ) .

the name references the virus' genetic link to the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreak , which began in china's guangdong province and sparked global panic , infecting 8,096 people worldwide and causing 774 deaths .

also on february 11 , who named the disease caused by sars - cov - 2 "coronavirus disease 2019" ( covid - 19 ) .

earlier , from january 30 , 2020 , to february 11 , who referred to the virus by the interim name "2019 novel coronavirus" ( 2019 ncov ) , and to the disease by the interim name , "2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease" ( 2019-ncov acute respiratory disease ) .

china initially referred to the illness its doctors were observing in wuhan as "pneumonia of unknown cause. .

beginning on january 1 , 2020 , official chinese sources began referring to it as a "viral pneumonia. .

on january 12 , 2020 , the day after china shared the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus with who and on an open - source platform , wuhan authorities began using the term , "novel coronavirus infection pneumonia. .

the government and media in china continue to refer to the disease by that name .

chinese doctors first identified cases of the disease later named covid - 19 in wuhan , capital of china's hubei province .

wuhan , with a population of 11.2 million , is the largest city in central china , a region comprised of six provinces with a combined population of 368 million .

situated at the intersection of the yangtze river and its largest tributary , the hanshui river , the city is a major transportation hub , with river , highway , high - speed rail , and air links to the rest of china .

until the pandemic led airlines to suspend service , the city also offered direct air routes to destinations around the world .

wuhan is a major industrial base and boasts a concentration of elite universities and research centers .

the wuhan municipal health commission , the city's health agency , is in the third tier of a national health hierarchy that extends from the national health commission in beijing down through the health commission of hubei province , whose offices are also located in wuhan .

the wuhan municipal health commission reports both to the wuhan people's government and to the provincial health commission .

the wuhan municipal health commission directly oversees a dozen hospitals and the wuhan center for disease control and prevention ( wuhan cdc ) , which has a staff of about 220 .

wuhan is divided into 13 districts .

each has its own health bureau and cdc , which report both to the district government and the next higher - level entity in their hierarchies , the wuhan municipal health commission and wuhan cdc .

jianghan district , home to the huanan seafood wholesale market , where a number of earliest known covid - 19 patients worked , has a population of 730,000 .

population density in jianghan district is on par with manhattan .

in china's political system , communist party secretaries are the most powerful officials at every level of government .

they oversee the party bureaucracy and make major decisions .

a deputy party secretary usually serves concurrently as head of the parallel state bureaucracy , which implements the party's decisions .

at the national level , communist party general secretary xi jinping is china's top leader .

he serves concurrently as chairman of the party's central military commission and as state president .

the party's second - most senior official , li keqiang , serves as premier of the state council , or cabinet , overseeing china's state bureaucracy .

both men are members of china's most senior decisionmaking body , the seven - man communist party politburo ( or political bureau ) standing committee .

at the outset of the epidemic , the top officials of hubei province were party secretary jiang chaoliang and governor wang xiaodong , with the latter serving concurrently as a provincial deputy party secretary .

the party removed jiang from office on february 13 , 2020 , and replaced him with former shanghai mayor ying yong , an associate of party general secretary xi .

governor wang remains in office .

in the city of wuhan , the top officials at the outset of the epidemic were party secretary ma guoqiang , who served concurrently as a deputy party secretary for hubei province , and mayor zhou xianwang , who served concurrently as the city's deputy party secretary .

the party removed ma from his provincial and municipal party posts on february 13 , 2020 , and replaced him with the former party secretary of the eastern china city of jinan , wang zhonglin .

mayor zhou remains in office .

at the outset of the epidemic , the top officials of the hubei provincial health commission were party secretary zhang jin and director liu yingzi .

the party removed both from their posts on february 11 , 2020 , replacing them with a former deputy director of china's national health commission , wang hesheng .

the top official of the wuhan municipal health commission remains zhang hongxing .

he has served as both party secretary and director of the commission since early 2019 .

note that when times are listed , the timeline also notes the time zone , whether chinese standard time ( cst ) for china , eastern standard time ( est ) for the eastern part of the contiguous united states , or central european time ( cet ) for geneva , switzerland , the headquarters location for who .

retrospectively , the date the earliest known covid - 19 patient first developed symptoms remains unclear .

in a march 2020 report , the hong kong - based south china morning post , citing chinese "government data seen by the post ," indicates that the first known patient was a 55-year - old from hubei province who became ill on november 17 .

asked in march 2020 about the post report , china cdc director gao fu states , "there is no solid evidence to say we already had clusters in november. .

in a january 24 , 2020 , article in the lancet medical journal , doctors from a wuhan infectious disease hospital and their co - authors state that among the first 41 cases in wuhan later identified as being covid - 19 , the first patient showed symptoms on december 1 .

in january 11-12 communications with who and in an authoritative february 17 report , chinese authorities provide december 8 as the day when the first known patient later identified as having covid - 19 became symptomatic .

doctors at wuhan central hospital take fluid samples from the lungs of a 65-year - old patient with pneumonia and send them to vision medicals , a genomics company in guangzhou , guangdong province , for testing .

another wuhan hospital sends a sample from a pneumonia patient to publicly - listed genomics company bgi genomics for analysis .

dr. zhang jixian , director of respiratory and critical care medicine at the hubei provincial hospital of integrated chinese and western medicine in wuhan , files a report with her supervisors about three members of a single family whom she found to be suffering from pneumonia of unknown cause .

she later recalls concluding , "it is unlikely that all three members of a family caught the same disease at the same time unless it is an infectious disease. .

the hospital notifies center for disease control for its district of wuhan , jianghan district .

vision medicals , the genomics company to which wuhan central hospital sent samples from the lungs of the 65-year - old patient for analysis on december 24 , calls with the results .

according to an account dr. zhao su , the hospital's head of respiratory medicine , gave news organization caixin in february 2020 , "they just called us and said it was a new coronavirus. .

wuhan central hospital admits a 41-year - old man with pneumonia , collects biological samples from him , and sends the swabs to another laboratory , capitalbio medlab co. ltd. , for analysis .

the hubei provincial hospital of integrated chinese and western medicine has identified additional cases of pneumonia of unknown cause .

other hospitals in wuhan are reporting similar cases .

wuhan municipal cdc organizes an expert team to investigate .

bgi genomics is the first known entity to complete sequencing of the novel coronavirus virus , based on the sample sent to it on december 26 .

a bgi genomics source later tells caixin the company did not know the virus was responsible for multiple illnesses and so did not understand the significance of its work at the time .

 ( cst ) : the wuhan municipal health commission issues an "urgent notice" intended only for medical institutions in wuhan .

it states that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause have emerged from the city's huanan seafood wholesale market .

it orders hospitals to compile statistics on all such cases admitted in the previous week and report them by email to the health commission by 4 p.m. a later investigation by the national state supervisory commission , an agency tasked with investigating graft and malfeasance among public servants , will reveal that someone leaks the notice online within 12 minutes of its being issued .

about 12 p.m. cst : dr. ai fen , head of the emergency department at wuhan central hospital , receives a wechat message from a former classmate at another hospital , tongji hospital , asking about a message circulating online: "don't go to huanan [market] .

dr. ai telephones the hospital's public health department and its infectious disease department to report the finding and tells the director of the respiratory disease department in person .

then she draws a red line around the "sars" finding and shares an image of the report online with her classmate at tongji hospital , as well as with a group of colleagues .

she will later say she does so "to remind everyone to pay attention to protecting themselves. .

cst : the wuhan municipal health commission issues a second "urgent notice" to medical institutions , instructing them on how to manage patients with pneumonia of unknown cause and ordering them to track such cases and report them in a timely fashion to district cdcs and the wuhan municipal health commission .

a later investigation by china's state supervisory commission will reveal that someone leaks the notice online within 10 minutes of its being issued .

the wuhan municipal health commission alerts china's national health commission and china cdc in beijing to the cases .

the national health commission dispatches a working group and the first of several expert teams to wuhan .

it reads , "news resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in wuhan , china .

their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not sars ; however the samples are still under examination , and cases have been isolated for treatment .

i would greatly appreciate if you have relevant information to share with us. .

taiwan's central epidemic command center later notes , "to be prudent , in the email we took pains to refer to atypical pneumonia , and specifically noted that patients had been isolated for treatment .

public health professionals could discern from this wording that there was a real possibility of human - to - human transmission of the disease. .

between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. cst : wuhan's jianghan district government suspends operation of the huanan seafood wholesale market linked to cases of atypical pneumonia .

 ( in addition to selling seafood , the market also sold live wild animals , including hedgehogs , badgers , snakes , and turtledoves. ) .

the official tells her not to speak to anyone , including her husband , about the pneumonia cases .

she will comply , but will later express regret about lives lost because she didn't "keep screaming. .

using samples from patients at wuhan's jinyintan hospital , the wuhan institute of virology identifies the novel coronavirus and sequences its genome .

the team reports its work to chinese authorities and submits the sequence to genbank , a genetic sequence database operated by the u.s. national institutes of health that serves as "an annotated collection of all publicly available dna sequences. .

 ( china's official timelines omit mention of the team's work , perhaps because it was not coordinated by china's national health commission .

china's official timelines state that successful sequencing of the genome happened two days later , with china cdc's reported sequencing of the virus on january 7. ) .

who issues its first formal public statement on the outbreak , a "disease outbreak news" item .
