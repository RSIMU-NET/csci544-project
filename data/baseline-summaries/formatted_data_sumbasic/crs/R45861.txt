relations between the united states and russia have shifted over timeâsometimes reassuring and sometimes concerningâyet most experts agree that russia is the only nation that poses , through its arsenal of nuclear weapons , an existential threat to the united states .

while its nuclear arms have declined sharply in quantity since the end of the cold war , russia retains a stockpile of thousands of nuclear weapons , with more than 1,500 warheads deployed on missiles and bombers capable of reaching u.s. territory .

the united states has always viewed these weapons as a potential threat to u.s. security and survival .

it has not only maintained a nuclear deterrent to counter this threat , it has also signed numerous arms control treaties with the soviet union and later russia in an effort to restrain and reduce the number and capabilities of nuclear weapons .

the collapse of the 1987 intermediate - range nuclear forces ( inf ) treaty and the possible expiration of the 2010 new strategic arms reduction treaty ( new start ) in 2021 may signal the end to mutual restraint and limits on such weapons .

the 2018 national defense strategy identifies the reemergence of long - term , strategic competition with russia and china as the "the central challenge to u.s. prosperity and security. .

it notes that russia seeks "to shatter the north atlantic treaty organization and change european and middle east security and economic structures to its favor. .

it argues that the challenge from russia is clear when its malign behavior is "coupled with its expanding and modernizing nuclear arsenal. .

the 2018 nuclear posture review ( npr ) amplifies this theme .

it notes that "russia has demonstrated its willingness to use force to alter the map of europe and impose its will on its neighbors , backed by implicit and explicit nuclear first - use threats. .

the npr describes changes to russia's nuclear doctrine and catalogues russia's efforts to modernize its nuclear forces , arguing that these efforts have "increased , and will continue to increase , [russia's] warhead delivery capacity , and provides russia with the ability to rapidly expand its deployed warhead numbers. .

congress has shown growing concern about the challenges russia poses to the united states and its allies .

it has expressed concerns about russia's nuclear doctrine and nuclear modernization programs and has held hearings focused on russia's compliance with arms control agreements and the future of the arms control process .

moreover , members have raised questions about whether u.s. and russian nuclear modernization programs , combined with the demise of restraints on u.s. and russian nuclear forces , may be fueling an arms race and undermining strategic stability .

this report seeks to advise this debate by providing information about russia's nuclear doctrine , its current nuclear force structure , and its ongoing nuclear modernization programs .

it is divided into five sections .

the first section describes russia's nuclear strategy and focuses on ways in which that strategy differs from that of the soviet union .

the second section provides a historical overview of the soviet union's nuclear force structure .

the third section details russia's current force structure , including its long - range intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbm ) , submarine - launched ballistic missiles ( slbm ) , and heavy bombers and shorter - range nonstrategic nuclear weapons .

this section also highlights key elements of relevant infrastructure , including early warning , command and control , production , testing , and warhead storage .

it also describes the key modernization programs that russia is pursuing to maintain and , in some cases , expand its nuclear arsenal .

the fourth section focuses on how arms control has affected the size and structure of russia's nuclear forces .

the fifth section discusses several potential issues for congress .

the soviet union conducted its first explosive test of a nuclear device on august 29 , 1949 , four years after the united states employed nuclear weapons against japan at the end of world war ii .

after this test , the soviet union initiated the serial production of nuclear devices and work on thermonuclear weapons , and it began to explore delivery methods for its nascent nuclear arsenal .

the soviet union tested its first version of a thermonuclear bomb in 1953 , two years after the united states crossed that threshold .

the soviet stockpile of nuclear warheads grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s , peaking at more than 40,000 warheads in 1986 , according to unclassified estimates ( see figure 1 ) .

within this total , around 10,700 warheads were carried by long - range delivery systems , the strategic forces that could reach targets in the united states in the mid - 1980s .

by the 1960s , the soviet union , like the united states , had developed a triad of nuclear forces: land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbms ) , submarine - launched ballistic missiles ( slbms ) , and heavy bombers equipped with nuclear weapons .

in 1951 , the soviet union conducted its first air drop test of a nuclear bomb and began to deploy nuclear weapons with its long - range aviation forces soon thereafter .

bomber aircraft included the m - 4 bison , which barely had the range needed to attack the united states and then return home .

the tu - 95 bear strategic bomber , which had a longer range , entered service in 1956 .

later modifications of the bear bomber have since been the mainstay of the soviet / russian nuclear triad's air leg .

in 1956 , the soviet union tested and deployed its first ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead , the ss - 3 , a shorter - range , or theater , missile .

it tested and deployed the ss - 4 , a theater ballistic missile that would be at the heart of the 1962 cuban missile crisis , by 1959 .

soviet missile ranges were further extended with the deployment of an intermediate - range ballistic missile , the ss - 5 .

the 1957 launch of the sputnik satellite on a modified ss - 6 long - range missile heralded the soviet union's development of icbms .

by the end of the decade , the soviet union had launched an ss - n - 1 slbm from a zulu - class attack submarine of the soviet navy .

the undersea leg of the triad would steadily progress over the following decade with the deployment of slbms on the golf class attack submarine and then the hotel and yankee class nuclear - powered submarines .

manned since 1959 by a separate military service called the strategic rocket forces , the icbm leg came to dominate the soviet nuclear triad .

during the 1960s , the soviet union rapidly augmented its force of fixed land - based icbms , expanding from around 10 launchers and two types of missiles in 1961 to just over 1,500 launchers with eight different types of missiles in 1971 .

because these missiles were initially based on soft launch pads or in vertical silos that could not withstand an attack from u.s. nuclear warheads , many concluded that the soviet union likely planned to use them in a first strike attack against u.s. missile forces and u.s. territory .

moreover , the united states believed that the design of soviet icbms provided the soviet union with the ability to contemplate , and possibly execute , a successful disarming first strike against u.s. land - based forces .

half of the icbm missile types were different variants of the largest missile , the ss - 9 icbm .

the united states referred to this as a "heavy" icbm due to its significant throwweight , which allowed it to carry a higher - yield warhead , estimated at around 20 megatons .

the united states believed , possibly inaccurately , that the missile's combination of improved accuracy and high yield posed a unique threat to u.s. land - based missiles .

concerns about soviet heavy icbms persisted throughout the cold war , affecting both u.s. force structure decisions and u.s. proposals for arms control negotiations .

although smaller and less capable than its land - based forces , the sea - based leg of the soviet triad was built up during the 1960s , with the deployment of slbms on golf - , hotel - , and yankee - class submarines .

these submarines carried intermediate - range ( rather than intercontinental - range ) missiles , but their mobility allowed the soviet union to threaten targets throughout europe and , to a lesser extent , in the united states .

the soviet union began the decade with 30 missile launchers on 10 submarines and ended it with 228 launchers on 31 submarines .

by the end of the 1960s , the united states and the soviet union had initiated negotiations to limit the numbers of launchers for long - range missiles .

the emerging parity in numbers of deployed nuclear - armed missiles , coupled with several nuclear crises , had paved the way for a recognition of their mutual deterrence relationship and arms control talks .

as noted below , the interim agreement on offensive armsânegotiated as part of the strategic arms limitation talks ( salt i ) and signed in 1972âcapped the construction and size of icbm silo launchers ( in an effort to limit the number of heavy icbms in the soviet force ) and limited the number of launchers for slbms .

it did not , however , limit the nuclear warheads that could be carried by icbms or slbms .

as a result , the soviet union continued to modernize and expand its nuclear forces in the 1970s .

during this time , the soviet union commissioned numerous delta - class strategic missile submarines , armed with the single - warhead , intercontinental - range ss - n - 8 slbm ; developed the tu - 22m backfire intermediate - range bomber aircraft ; began to develop a new supersonic strategic heavy bomber ( eventually the tu - 160 blackjack ) ; and began to deploy the ss - 20 intermediate - range ballistic missile in 1976 , which , along with other missiles of its class , would be eliminated under the 1987 inf treaty .

the soviet union also pursued an extensive expansion of its land - based icbm force .

it not only developed a number of new types of icbms , but , in 1974 , it began to deploy these missiles with multiple warheads ( known as mirvs , or multiple independent reentry vehicles ) .

during this time frame the soviet union developed , tested , and deployed the 4-warhead ss - 17 icbm , 10-warhead ss - 18 icbm ( a new heavy icbm that replaced the ss - 9 ) , and 6-warhead ss - 19 icbm .

because each of these missiles could carry multiple warheads , the salt i limit on icbm launchers did not constrain the number of warheads on the soviet missile force .

moreover , the icbm force began to dominate the soviet triad during this time ( see figure 2 ) .

u.s. analysts and officials expressed particular concern about the heavy ss - 18 icbm and its subsequent modifications .

the soviet union deployed 308 of these missiles , each with the ability to carry up to 10 warheads and numerous decoys and penetration aides designed to confuse missile defense radars .

these concerns contributed to a debate in the u.s. defense community about a "window of vulnerability" in the u.s. - soviet nuclear balance due to a soviet advantage in cumulative ballistic missile throwweight .

some asserted that the soviets' throwweight advantage could translate into an edge in the number of warheads deployed on land - based missiles .

they postulated that the soviet union could attack all u.s. land - based missiles with just a portion of the soviet land - based force , leaving it with enough warheads after an initial nuclear attack to dominate and possibly coerce the united states into surrendering without any retaliation .

others disputed this theory , noting that the united states maintained a majority of its nuclear warheads on sea - based systems that could survive a soviet first strike and that the synergy of u.s. land - based , sea - based , and air - delivered weapons would complicate , and therefore deter , a soviet first strike .

recent research examining the records of soviet planners and officials suggests that soviet missile developments during the 1970s did not seek to achieve , and did not have the capabilities needed for , a first - strike advantage or a warfighting posture .

instead , the soviet union began to harden its missile silos so they could survive attack and to develop an early warning system , thus moving toward a second - strike capability .

moreover , the 1980s saw soviet planners worrying about maintaining their second - strike capability in light of u.s. strategic offense and missile defense programs .

the united states was modernizing its land - based icbms , ballistic missile submarines and slbms , and heavy bombers .

each of the new u.s. missiles would carry multiple warheads , and the soviets believed all would have the accuracy to target and destroy soviet land - based missiles .

in march 1983 , president reagan announced the strategic defense initiative , a missile defense program that he pledged would make ballistic missiles "impotent and obsolete. .

the ss - 18 icbm , with its capacity to carry 10 warheads and penetration aids , provided a counter to these u.s. capabilities .

during the 1980s , development continued across all three legs of the soviet nuclear triad .

the typhoon - class strategic submarine and the tu - 160 blackjack bomber entered into service .

anti - ship cruise missiles were joined by modern as - 15 land - attack cruise missiles .

the soviet union continued to improve the accuracy of its fixed , silo - based missiles and began to deploy mobile icbms , adding both the road - mobile , single warhead ss - 25 missile and the rail - mobile , 10-warhead ss - 24 missile .

by the end of the 1980s , prior to the signing of the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty ( start ) , the soviet union had completed the backbone of what was to become the russian nuclear triad of the 1990s .

its air leg consisted of bear , backfire , and blackjack bombers .

its undersea leg consisted of delta - and typhoon - class submarines with mirv slbms .

its icbm leg consisted of the ss - 18 , ss - 19 , and ss - 25 missiles .

during the cold war , the soviet union produced and deployed a wide range of delivery vehicles for nonstrategic nuclear weapons .

at different times during the period , it deployed devices small enough to fit into a suitcase - sized container ; nuclear mines ; shells for artillery ; short - , medium - , and intermediate - range ballistic missiles ; short - range , air - delivered missiles ; and gravity bombs .

the soviet union deployed these weapons at nearly 600 bases , with some located in warsaw pact countries in eastern europe , some in the soviet union's non - russian republics along its western and southern perimeter , and others throughout the soviet union .

estimates vary , but many analysts believe that by 1991 the soviet union had more than 20,000 of these weapons .

before the collapse of the warsaw pact in 1989 , the numbers may have been higher , in the range of 25,000 weapons .

like the soviet union , the russia federation maintains a triad of nuclear forces consisting of icbms , slbms , and heavy bombers .

the total number of warheads in the soviet and russian arsenal and the number deployed on soviet and russian strategic forces began to decline in the late 1980s ( see figure 1 and figure 2 above ) .

these reductions were primarily driven by the limits in the 1991 start i treaty , the 2002 strategic offensive reductions treaty , and the 2010 new start treaty .

the reductions also reflect the retirement of many older soviet - era missiles and their replacement with new missiles that carry fewer warheads , as well as the effects of the fiscal crisis in the late 1990s , which slowed the deployment of the next generation of russian missiles and submarines .

moreover , under the nunn - lugar cooperative threat reduction program , the united states helped russia , ukraine , belarus , and kazakhstan move soviet - era nuclear weapons back to russian territory and to dismantle portions of the soviet union's nuclear arsenal .

russia deploys its strategic nuclear forces at more than a dozen bases across its territory .

these bases are shown on figure 4 , below .

russia is currently modernizing most of the components of its nuclear triad .

the current phase of modernization essentially began in 1998 .

the soviet union replaced its land - based missiles frequently , with new systems entering the force every 10-15 years and modifications appearing every few years .

russia has not kept up this pace .

when it began the most recent modernization cycle , it was in the midst of a financial crisis .

the crisis not only reduced the number of new missiles entering the force each year , but slowed the process .

as a result , some of the systems that have had been under development since the late 1990s and early 2000s began to enter the force in the late 2000s , but others will not do so until the 2020s .

the number of warheads on soviet strategic nuclear delivery vehicles reached its peak in the mid - 1980s and began to decline sharply by the early 1990s ( see figure 2 ) .

this decline continued , with a few pauses , through the 1990s and 2000s .

while a number of factors likely contributed to this decline , most experts agree that these reductions were shaped by the limits in bilateral arms control agreements .

congress has held several hearings in recent years where it has sought information about russian nuclear weapons and raised concerns about the pace and direction of russia's nuclear modernization programs .

specifically , some members have questioned whether russia and the united states are approaching a new arms race as both modernize their forces ; they have addressed concerns about the future size and structure of russia's nuclear forces if the new start treaty lapses in 2021 , and they have sought to understand the content of and debate about russia's nuclear doctrine .

this section reviews some of the key issues discussed in these hearings .

the united states and russia are both pursuing modernization programs to rebuild and recapitalize their nuclear forces .

each began this process to replace existing systems that have been in service since the cold war and are reaching the end of their service lives .

in many cases , both nations have extended the life of these aging systems .

russia retains some ballistic missiles that the soviet union first fielded in the 1980s ( and , therefore , were expected to be replaced by the early 2000s ) ; it may retire many of these over the next 10 years as it completes its current modernization programs .

the united states extended the life of its ohio - class submarines from 30 to 42 years by refueling their reactor cores , and it extended the lives of both land - based and submarine - based missiles by replacing the propellant in existing motors and replacing guidance systems .

the united states plans to begin fielding new systems in the late 2020s .

many analysts and observers have identified an arms race dynamic in these parallel modernization programs .

some believe that russia is at faultâthat the united states is falling behind because russia began to deploy new missiles and submarines in the early 2000s , while the united states will not field similar systems until the late 2020s , and because russia is developing new and more exotic systems , as described above .

david trachtenberg , the principal deputy under secretary of defense for policy , raised this point in april 2018 , when he noted that "it takes two to race. .

he stated that the united states is "not interested in matching the russians system for system .

the russians have been developing an incredible amount of new nuclear weapons systems , including the novel , nuclear systems that president putin unveiled to great fanfare a number of months ago. .

franklin miller , a former pentagon and national security council official , made a similar point during a senate armed services committee hearing in early 2019 when he noted that "the [u.s.] program is not creating a nuclear arms race .

russia and china began modernizing and expanding their nuclear forces in the 2008-2010 timeframe and since then have been placing large numbers of new strategic nuclear systems in the field .

the united states has not deployed a new nuclear delivery system in this century and the first products of our nuclear modernization program will not be deployed until the mid to late 2020s. .

others argue that the united states is spurring the arms race , in that the expansive u.s. modernization program might heighten the mistrust between the two nations and provide russia with an incentive to expand its programs beyond what was needed to replace aging soviet - era systems .

former secretary of defense william perry raised this point in an interview in 2015 , when the obama administration offered its support to the full scope of u.s. nuclear modernization programs .

he noted that "we're now at the precipice , maybe i should say the brink , of a new nuclear arms race" that "will be at least as expensive as the arms race we had during the cold war , which is a lot of money. .

some have disputed the notion that the modernization programs are either evidence of an arms race or an incentive to pursue one .

both nations are modernizing their forces because existing systems are aging out ; neither is pursuing these programs because the other is modernizing its forces , and neither would likely cancel its programs if the other refrained from its efforts .

as former secretary of defense ashton carter noted in 2016 , "in the end , though , this is about maintaining the bedrock of our security and after too many years of not investing enough , it's an investment that we , as a nation , have to make because it's critical to sustaining nuclear deterrence in the 21 st century. .

russia seems to be in a similar position ; it delayed a planned modernization cycle in the late 1990s and has been pursuing a number of programs at a relatively slow pace since that time .

moreover , the new types of strategic offensive arms introduced recently seem to be more of a response to concerns about u.s. missile defense programs than a response to u.s. offensive modernization programs .

the new start treaty is due to lapse in 2021 unless the united states and russia agree to extend it for a period of no more than five years .

the trump administration is reportedly conducting an interagency review of new start to determine whether it continues to serve u.s. national security interests , and this review will inform the u.s. approach to the treaty's extension .

among the issues that might be under consideration are whether the united states should be willing to extend new start following russia's violation of the inf treaty , whether the limits in the treaty continue to serve u.s. national security interests , and whether the insights and data that the monitoring regime provides about russian nuclear forces remain of value for u.s. national security .

russia's nuclear modernization programs , in general , and its development of new kinds of strategic offensive arms have also figured into the debate about the extension of new start .

for example , general john hyten , the commander of u.s. strategic command ( stratcom ) , has stated that he believes new start serves u.s. national security interests because its monitoring regime provides transparency and visibility into russian nuclear forces , and because its limits provide predictability about the future size and structure of those forces .

however , in testimony before the senate armed services committee in february 2019 , general hyten expressed concern about russia's new nuclear delivery systemsâthe poseidon underwater drone , the burevestnik nuclear - powered cruise missile , the kinzhal air - launched ballistic missile , and the tsirkon hypersonic cruise missileâwhich would not count under new start's limits .

he noted that these weapons could eventually pose a threat to the united states and that he believed the united states and russia should expand new start so they would count them under the treaty .

some analysts have questioned whether this approach makes sense .

as noted above , russia is not likely to deploy these systems until later in the 2020s and , even then , the numbers are likely to be relatively small .

on the other hand , russia began to deploy the avangard hypersonic glide vehicle in late december 2019 and may deploy the sarmat heavy ballistic missile in 2020 or 2021 .

both will count under new start if it remains in force .

if russia refuses to count the more exotic weapons under new start and the treaty expires , it will no longer be bound by any numerical limits on the number of long - range missiles and heavy bombers it can deploy , or the number of nuclear warheads that could be deployed on those missiles and bombers .

because russia is already producing new missiles like the yars , it could possibly accelerate production if new start expires to increase the number of warheads added to the force .

russia could also possibly add to the number of warheads deployed on some of these missiles , increasing them from four warheads to six to eight warheads per missile .

in addition , russia would likely have to limit the deployment of the sarmat missile and retire old ss - 18 missiles to remain under new start limits , but it could deploy hundreds of new warheads on the sarmat between 2021 and 2026 if the treaty were not in place .

according to some analyses , if russia expanded its forces with these changes , it could possibly add more than 1,000 warheads to its force without increasing the number of deployed missiles between 2021 and 2026 .

the 2018 nuclear posture review ( npr ) adheres to the view that russia has adopted an "escalate to de - escalate" strategy and asserts that russia "mistakenly assesses that the threat of nuclear escalation or actual first use of nuclear weapons would serve to 'de - escalate' a conflict on terms favorable to russia. .

the npr's primary concern is with a scenario where russia executes a land - grab on a nato ally's territory and then presents u.s. and nato forces with a fait accompli by threatening to use nuclear weapons .

the npr thus recommends that the united states develop new low - yield nonstrategic weapons that , it argues , would provide the united states with a credible response , thereby "ensuring that the russian leadership does not miscalculate regarding the consequences of limited nuclear first use. .

while some experts outside government agree with the assessment of russian nuclear doctrine described in the nuclear posture review , others argue that it overstates or is inconsistent with russian statements and actions .

some have argued that the npr's "evidence of a dropped threshold for russian nuclear employment is weak. .

they note that , although some russian authors and analysts advocated such an approach , was not evident in the government documents published in 2010 and 2014 .

as a result , they argue that the advocates for this type of strategy may have lost the bureaucratic debates .

others have reviewed reports on russian military exercises and have disputed the conclusion that there is evidence that russia simulated nuclear use against nato in large conventional exercises .

one analyst has postulated that russia may actually raise its nuclear threshold as it bolsters its conventional forces .

according to this analyst , "it is difficult to understand why russia would want to pursue military adventurism that would risk all - out confrontation with a technologically advanced and nuclear - armed adversary like nato .

while opportunistic , and possibly even reckless , the putin regime does not appear to be suicidal. .

as a study from the rand corporation noted , russia has "invested considerable sums in developing and fielding long - range conventional strike weapons since the mid - 2000s to provide russian leadership with a buffer against reaching the nuclear thresholdâa set of conventional escalatory options that can achieve strategic effects without resorting to nuclear weapons. .

others note , however , that russia has integrated these "conventional precision weapons and nuclear weapons into a single strategic weapon set," lending credence to the view that russia may be prepared to employ , or threaten to employ , nuclear weapons during a regional conflict .
