the asset management industry operates in a complex system with many components .

asset management companies have two major product categoriesâpublic funds and private funds .

additionally , a number of intermediaries , such as investment advisers and custodians , provide distribution channels , safeguards , and other essential services to investors and issuers .

nearly half , or 44.8% , of all u.s. households own some form of public funds .

when operating as expected , the industry functions to pool assets , share risks , allocate resources , produce information , and protect investors .

asset management companiesâalso referred to as investment management companies , money managers , funds , or investment fundsâare collective investment vehicles that pool money from various individual or institutional investor clients and invest on their behalf for financial returns .

the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) is the primary regulator of the asset management industry .

the main statutes that govern the asset management industry at the federal level include the investment company act of 1940 ( p.l .

76-768 ) , the investment advisers act of 1940 ( p.l .

76-768 ) , the securities act of 1933 ( p.l .

73-22 ) , and the securities exchange act of 1934 ( p.l .

73-291 ) .

public and private funds are distinguished by the types of investors who can access them and by the regulation applied to them .

public funds , such as mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( etfs ) , closed - end funds , and unit investment trusts ( uits ) , are broadly accessible to investors of all types .

private funds are limited to more sophisticated institutional and retail ( individual ) investors , thus the name private fund .

the main types of private funds are hedge funds , venture capital funds , and private equity .

the first part of this report provides an overview of the asset management industry and its regulation .

although there is no single definition for the industry , the report generally covers public and private investment funds and the industry components that serve those funds .

the report also illustrates some of the industry's key risk exposures and the regulations designed to disclose , monitor , and mitigate them .

the second part of this report considers current trends and policy issues , including ( 1 ) whether the asset management industry affects the financial stability of the united states ; ( 2 ) whether regulation of the asset management industry provides sufficient protection for the retail investors who invest money in the industry ; and ( 3 ) the impact of financial technology , or "fintech," on the industry , and whether the current regulatory framework is adequate to address these new technologies .

many types of asset management companies exist .

further , the different types of asset management companies are subject to different regulatory requirements .

this section highlights major types of asset management companies , including public funds , private funds , and other forms of asset management .

the asset management industry operates in a complex system with many components , including different types of funds and various intermediaries .

this section explains the operation of a typical public fund as well as other prominent actors supporting the fund and the efficient operations of the industry .

the asset management industry's legislative history is relatively long and complex .

the current regulatory regime governing the asset management industry was not a comprehensive design from inception , but rather developed through many iterations of adjustments and expansions .

therefore , the asset management industry is overseen by a somewhat fragmented regulatory regime with areas of disconnect between business practices and the legal definitions describing them .

congress created the sec during the great depression to restore public confidence in the u.s. capital markets .

early policymaking in the 1930s focused on full disclosure , with the specific intention that publicly traded companies tell the whole truth about any material issues pertaining to their securities and the risks associated with investing in them .

however , congress realized that the disclosure - based approach alone was not enough to deter fraudulent and abusive activities in the asset management industry , which flourished in the 1920s and 1930s .

congress thus directed the sec to conduct a 1â½ - year study of the issue in the public utility holding company act of 1935 .

the sec took four years , resulting in a four - part study with six additional supplemental reports .

based on the sec research and subsequent hearings , in 1940 , congress introduced two new laws to govern the asset management industryâthe investment company act of 1940 and the investment advisers act of 1940 .

these statutes and regulations required those who manage and distribute funds to treat investors fairly and honestly .

the textbox below describes the individual laws , which generally apply to the asset management industry as follows: asset management companies must comply with the investment company act of 1940 or gain exemption from its requirements .

funds' portfolio managers or investment advisers generally must register with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 .

the funds themselves are securities , and thus subject to federal securities regulation in relation to securities offering and trading , including the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 .

over the past several decades , the asset - management industry has undergone several changes that may have important implications for public policy .

this section discusses a number of these changes , including ( 1 ) the industry's overall growth ; ( 2 ) increased reliance on capital markets for financing rather than bank loans by american businesses ; ( 3 ) a shift from active to passive investment style ; and ( 4 ) the expansion of private securities markets .

the increased importance of the asset - management industry raises a variety of policy issues .

this section discusses several of these issues , including financial stability , investor protection , and financial innovation .

the asset - management industry is large , complex , and governed by a host of intersecting federal regulations primarily overseen by the sec .

the industry has undergone a number of changes , including increases in its size , changes in the relative importance of capital markets and banks , shifts away from active and toward passive investment management , and increases in the volume of private securities offerings .

some of these trends raise important policy issues , including financial stability , investor protection , and the promotion of financial innovation .

as a general matter , asset - management companies have generated fewer financial - stability concerns than some other financial institutions .

this is largely because asset managers generally are agents who provide investment services rather than principals who invest for their own accounts .

but it does not mean that the industry is free of financial stability risks .

specific structural vulnerabilities , for example , redemption risk and liquidity mismatch , among other vulnerabilities , could be observed in the context of certain mmfs , etfs , and leveraged lending , but their implications are uncertain .

the asset - management industry is governed by a range of investor - protection rules that raise various policy issues , including the appropriate level of investor access to certain types of funds , fund disclosure , and proxy voting .

finally , the need to balance financial innovation with investor protection has generated a number of important debates surrounding digital asset custody and the entry of technology firms into financial services .
