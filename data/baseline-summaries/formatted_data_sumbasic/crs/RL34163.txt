most capital punishment cases are state cases .

there are several federal crimes , however , for which the death penalty is a sentencing option .

legislation to amend federal capital punishment law introduced in the 110 th congress included proposals to amend the constitution to remove impediments to imposition of the death penalty , to abolish the federal death penalty , to increase the number of federal capital offenses , and to adjust the procedure under which capital cases are tried and sentencing determinations are made .

none were enacted .

this is an overview of some of those proposals .

the united states constitution does not mention capital punishment or death penalty in so many words .

it does , however , prohibit imposition of cruel and unusual punishments as well as the deprivation of life without due process of law .

the supreme court recently held that the eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment precludes imposition of the death penalty for rape of child under twelve years of age when the victim was neither killed nor intended to be killed .

two constitutional amendments were offered at least in partial response .

h.j.res .

96 ( representative chabot ) would simply have amended the constitution to state that "the penalty of death for the forcible rape of a child who has not attained the age of 12 years does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. .

h.j.res .

83 ( representative broun ) is equally terse although seemingly more sweeping: "the death penalty is permitted under the constitution and does not constitute cruel and usual punishment , including when the death penalty is imposed for the rape of a child under sixteen years old. .

both proposals would have removed any eighth amendment impediment to capital punishment as a sentencing option in child rape cases .

the broun proposal was apparently designed to remove any eighth amendment impediment to capital punishment as a sentencing option in any case .

at some point , due process concerns may have contained the sweep of the proposals had they been accepted .

h.j.res .

80 ( representative mccollum ) , in contrast , would have abolished capital punishment as a sentencing alternative for either state or federal crimes .

the proposed amendment would have extended to both pending and subsequent capital cases .

existing federal law treats capital cases differently .

there is no statute of limitations for capital offenses .

there is a preference for the trial of capital cases in the county in which they occur .

defendants in capital cases are entitled to two attorneys , one of whom "shall be learned in the law applicable to capital cases. .

the attorney general must ultimately approve the decision to seek the death penalty in any given case .

defendants are entitled to notice when the prosecution intends to seek the death penalty , and at least three days before the trial , to a copy of the indictment as well as a list of the government's witnesses and names in the jury pool .

defendants have twice as many peremptory jury challenges in capital cases as in other felony cases and prosecutors more than three times as many .

should the defendant be found guilty of a capital offense the sentencing hearing procedures set forth in chapter 228 of title 18 of the united states code come into play .

the chapter divides federal capital offenses into three categories for purposes of determining whether the death penalty should be imposed in light of the aggravating and mitigating facts presented in the case .

the first group consists of espionage and treason ; the second , of homicide offenses ; and the third , of drug offenses .

in homicide cases , the sentencing hearing involves two determinations: whether the defendant acted with the intent required in section 3591 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the chapter and whether the weighing of the pertinent aggravating and mitigating circumstances warrant imposition of the death penalty in section 3592 ( c ) .

in order to keep the two inquiries distinct and to avoid confusion and unfair prejudice , federal courts will generally permit the inquiries to be conduct sequentially .

the same list of mitigating factors applies to each of the three categories of capital offenses .

the list consists of seven specific statutory factors – impaired capacity , minor participation , disparate treatment of codefendants , no prior criminal record , mental or emotional disturbance , and victim consent – but also includes a catch - all , open - ended factor .

each of the three categories has its own list of statutory aggravating factors .

they share a catch - all , open - ended aggravating factor available for each of the three categories of capital offenses which the jury may weigh , but the death penalty may only be imposed after first finding at least one of the more specific , designated aggravating factors .

the list of designated aggravating factors relating to espionage and treason is the shortest of the three: prior espionage or treason conviction , grave risk to national security , and grave risk of death .

the list of the designated homicide aggravating factors contains sixteen entries , including the fact that the murder was committed during the course of one of group of other federal offenses .

the drug aggravating factors focus on prior convictions , the risk to children , the use of firearms , and lethal adulteration .

the jury must unanimously agree that an aggravating factor has been established before the factor may be weighed in determining whether to impose the death penalty ; on the other hand the finding of a single juror is sufficient for consideration of a mitigating factor .

the death penalty may only be imposed if the jury unanimously finds that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors ; or if the court so finds in the absence of a jury .

during the 110 th congress , proposals were offered that would have modified existing law relating to: - where a capital offense may be tried , - the appointment of counsel in capital cases , - the pre - trial notification which the parties must exchange in capital cases , - the procedures that apply when the defendant claims to be mentally retarded , - adjustments in the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances , - jury matters , and - the site of federal executions .

s. 607 ( senator vitter ) would have outlawed interference with federal disaster relief efforts ; when death resulted from a violation of the proscription , the defendant might have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment .

h.r .

3806 ( representative forbes ) would have made sabotage committed against a nuclear facility a capital offense if a death resulted from the commission of the offense .

it is a federal capital offense under existing law to murder a member of the united states armed forces during or on account of the performance of their duties , 18 u.s.c .

1114 .

h.r .

3884 ( representative murphy ) would have made it a federal offense to murder a member of the united states armed force regardless of whether the offense were committed during or on account of the performance of the victim's duties , proposed 18 u.s.c .

1123 .

the bills drafted to counter gang violence – eg , h.r .

3150 ( representative keller ) , h.r .

880 ( representative forbes ) – frequently included two new federal death penalty offenses .

one would have proscribed the use of interstate facilities with the intent to commit multiple murders and would have been a capital offense where death resulted .

the second , modeled after the provision that condemned the use of a firearm during or in relation to a crime of violence or a drug offense , would have outlawed crimes of violence committed during or in relation to a drug trafficking offense and would have made the offense punishable by death if a death results .

the murder committed during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense appeared as a capital offense in other bills as well ( h.r .

1118 ( representative keller ) ; h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) ; s. 1860 ( senator cornyn ) ) ; as does the new capital multiple murder proposal ( h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) ; s. 1860 ( senator cornyn ) ) .

in addition , h.r .

3150 would have condemned murder along with other violent crimes in furtherance or in aid of a criminal street gang , an offense it would have made punishable by death .

existing law proscribes overseas murder and assault committed against americans by terrorists , 18 u.s.c .

2332 .

h.r .

2376 ( representative franks ) , h.r .

3147 ( representative wilson ) , h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) , s. 1320 ( senator kyl ) , and s. 1860 ( senator cornyn ) would have proscribed overseas kidnaping of americans by terrorists and propose the death penalty as a sentencing option when a death results .

several of the immigration bills – eg , h.r .

1645 ( representative gutierrez ) , s. 330 ( senator isakson ) , s. 1348 ( senator reid ) – would have proscribed evasion of border inspection and made the offenses punishable by death , imprisonment for any term of years , or for life if death results from a violation , proposed 18 u.s.c .

556 .

rather than amend existing non - capital federal terrorist offenses to make them capital offenses when they result in a death , h.r .

855 ( representative lungren ) , h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) , and s. 1860 ( senator cornyn ) would have created a new separate federal offense which outlaws the commission of , or attempt or conspiracy to commit various federal terrorist offenses when a death results , proposed 18 u.s.c .

2339e .

violations would have been punishable by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life .

its impact might have been less dramatic than might appear at first glance since many of its predicate offenses are already capital crimes or would have been elevated to capital offenses elsewhere in the bills .

nevertheless , as a consequence of section 2339e the following would have become capital offenses when a death occurs during the course of their commission: - 18 u.s.c .

81 ( arson within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ) , - 18 u.s.c .

175 or 175b ( biological weapons ) , - 18 u.s.c .

351 ( congressional , cabinet , and supreme court murder or kidnaping ) , - 18 u.s.c .

831 ( nuclear materials ) , - 18 u.s.c .

842 ( m ) or ( n ) ( plastic explosives ) , - 18 u.s.c .

956 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( conspiracy to murder , kidnap , or maim persons abroad ) , - 18 u.s.c .

1030 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 1030 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( a ) ( i ) ( protection of computers ) , - 18 u.s.c .

1361 ( destruction of government property or contracts ) , - 18 u.s.c .

1362 ( destruction of communication lines , stations , or systems ) , - 18 u.s.c .

1366 ( a ) ( destruction of an energy facility ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2155 ( destruction of national defense materials , premises , or utilities ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2156 ( national defense material , premises , or utilities ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2332d ( financial transactions with terrorist supporting countries ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339 ( harboring terrorists ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339a ( providing material support to terrorists ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339b ( providing material support to terrorist organizations ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339c ( financing of terrorism ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339d ( military - type training from a foreign terrorist organization ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2340a ( torture ) , - 21 u.s.c .

960a ( narco - terrorism ) , - 42 u.s.c .

2122 ( prohibitions governing atomic weapons ) , - 42 u.s.c .

2284 ( sabotage of nuclear facilities or fuel ) , - 49 u.s.c .

46504 ( second sentence ) ( assault on a flight crew with a dangerous weapon ) , - 49 u.s.c .

46505 ( b ) ( 3 ) or ( c ) ( explosive or incendiary devices , or endangerment of human life by means of weapons , on aircraft ) , - 49 u.s.c .

60123 ( b ) ( destruction of interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility ) .

on the other hand , some of predicate offenses do not outlaw attempts to violate their proscriptions .

in these cases , section 2339e would have established not only a new federal capital offense but a new federal crime when death results from the attempt: - 18 u.s.c .

1203 ( hostage taking ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339 ( harboring terrorists ) , - 18 u.s.c .

2339d ( receipt of foreign terrorist military training ) .

h.r .

855 ( representative lungren ) , h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) , h.r .

3147 ( representative wilson ) , and s. 1860 ( senator cornyn ) would have established the death penalty as a sentencing option when death results as a consequence of a violation of: 18 u.s.c .

832 ( participation in foreign programs involving weapons of mass destruction ) ; 18 u.s.c .

2332g ( anti - aircraft missile offenses ) ; 42 u.s.c .

2272 ( atomic weapons offenses ) ; 18 u.s.c .

2332h ( radiological dispersal device offenses ) ; and 18 u.s.c .

175c ( variola virus ( small pox ) offenses ) .

the gang bills would have rewritten the federal criminal gang statute ( 18 u.s.c .

521 ) to permit imposition of capital punishment for a death - resulting violation of the newly crafted provisions whose predicate offenses include various crimes of violence , money laundering , drug offenses , credit card fraud , travel act violations , and interstate transportation of stolen property , h.r .

880 ( representative forbes ) , h.r .

3150 ( representative keller ) .

h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) and s. 1860 ( senator cornyn ) had the same proposal .

the travel act , 18 u.s.c .

1952 , among other things , outlaws interstate travel to commit a crime of violence in furtherance of various drug , gambling , or extortion offenses .

h.r .

3156 ( representative lamar smith ) and s. 1850 ( senator cornyn ) would have permitted imposition of the death penalty when a violation results in death .

s. 447 ( senator feingold ) / h.r .

6875 ( representative kucinich ) would have eliminated the death penalty as a sentencing option for federal and military capital offenses .

it would have prohibited imposition of the death penalty and provided that prisoners under sentence of death at the time of enactment shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release .

it would have repealed the procedures for implementation of the death penalty , 18 u.s.c .

ch .

228 .

it would have eliminated as well 18 u.s.c .

3235 which dictates that the trial of a capital offense be conducted in the county in which it occurred .

it would have amended the statute of limitations of 18 u.s.c .

3281 to list specific previous capital offenses which may be tried at any time .

it would have mades comparable adjustments in the code of military justice .

the general statute of limitations for federal crimes is 5 years , 18 u.s.c .

3282 .

federal crimes punishable by death may be prosecuted at any time , 18 u.s.c .

3281 .

federal crimes of terrorism as defined in 18 u.s.c .

2332b ( g ) ( 5 ) ( b ) that result in death or involve a risk of death may also be prosecuted at any time , 18 u.s.c .

3286 ( b ) .

moreover , federal sexual offenses and crimes against children proscribed by 18 u.s.c .

1201 or 18 u.s.c .

chs .

109a ( sexual abuse ) , 110 ( sexual exploitation of children ) , or 117 ( travel of illicit sexual purposes ) may likewise be brought any time , 18 u.s.c .

3299 .

s. 447 / h.r .

6875 would have replaced the language of section 3281 for crimes carrying the death penalty with a list of federal crimes ( now punishable by death ) which may be prosecuted at any time notwithstanding the bill's elimination of the death penalty .

the list was not exhaustive .

some of the omissions were covered by exceptions for crimes against children , sex offenses , or the federal crimes of terrorism .

some were not .

the crimes which now can be prosecuted at any time but which s. 447 / h.r .

6875 would appear to have made subject to the general 5-year statute of limitations were violations of: 7 u.s.c .

2146 ( killing federal animal transportation inspectors ) 15 u.s.c .

1825 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( c ) ( killing those enforcing the horse protection act ) 18 u.s.c .
