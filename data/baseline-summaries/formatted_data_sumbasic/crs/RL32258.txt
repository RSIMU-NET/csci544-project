during the 108th congress , the house of representatives and the senate finance committeeapproved two different versions of a bill that would have reauthorized and revised the temporaryassistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant .

this legislation , h.r .

4 , alsoincluded many changes to the child support enforcement ( cse ) program , a component of thegovernment's social safety net .

in 1996 , congress passed significant changes to the cse programas part of its reform of welfare .

h.r .

4 was passed by the house in february 2003 .

thesenate finance committee reported a substitute version of the bill in september 2003 ( s.rept.108-162 ) .

on march 29-april 1 , 2004 , the senate debated h.r .

4 ; disagreement aroseregarding amendments to the bill , a motion to limit debate was overruled , and the senate did notvote on passage of the bill .

table 1 provides a detailed and comprehensive comparison of the cse provisions of thehouse - passed and senate finance committee reported versions of h.r .

4 ( the welfarereauthorization bill ) with current law .

the table specifies the section number in each of the bills inwhich the provision is found .

as noted earlier , h.r .

4 passed the house but not the senate during the 108th congress .

there is some concern that the widely favored cse provisions that were in h.r.4 were not debated as a separate stand - alone bill .

nevertheless , it seems likely that the109th congress will consider the substantive and numerous cse changes that were included in h.r.4 as part of any new tanf reauthorization bill .
