the federal reserve's ( fed's ) responsibilities as the nation's central bank fall into four main categories: ( 1 ) monetary policy , ( 2 ) provision of emergency liquidity through the lender of last resort function , ( 3 ) supervision of certain types of banks and other financial firms for safety and soundness , and ( 4 ) provision of payment system services to financial firms and the government .

the 115 th congress is considering a number of bills that would affect the fed's monetary policy , lender of last resort , and regulatory responsibilities .

although these bills contain numerous wide - ranging changes , most provisions can be grouped into five broad categories: fed g overnance .

some proposals would change the fed's institutional structure â€” how officials are selected , how policy decisions are reached , and so on .

o versight and disclosure .

some proposals aim to make the fed more accountable to congress by increasing congressional oversight or requiring the fed to disclose more information to congress and the public .

p olicy rules ( e. g. , the taylor rule ) .

some proposals would require the fed to compare its monetary policy decisions to those prescribed by a policy rule such as the taylor rule and report those findings to congress .

t he fed's emergency lending powers .

some proposals would reduce the fed's discretion to provide emergency assistance under section 13 ( 3 ) of the federal reserve act .

the fed's balance sheet .

some proposals would alter the types of assets that the fed is allowed to purchase and hold on its balance sheet .

this report analyzes these provisions and the policy debate surrounding them .

it does not cover legislation that would change fed - administered regulation of depository institutions , systemically important financial institutions , and financial market utilities .

4293 ( which passed the house on april 11 , 2018 ) , and h.r .

4061 ( which passed the house on april 11 , 2018 ) .

the proposals in this report are wide ranging and diverse but are united by the goals of increasing the fed's accountability to congress and decreasing fed discretion .

whereas some provisions make minor changes , taken together the proposals would arguably reduce the fed's independence from congress somewhat .

there is a long - standing policy debate about how independent regulatory agencies should be from congress and the president , with proponents for independence arguing that it will lead to more technocratic decisionmaking and opponents arguing it leads to opaque , undemocratic , and unresponsive decisionmaking .

for decades , the fed has enjoyed an unusual degree of independence from congress and the president compared with other government agencies , which has typically been justified in terms of insulating its monetary policy decisions from political pressures .

to some extent , a trade - off between independence and accountability is unavoidable .

besides the taylor rule , few of the provisions reviewed in this report directly relate to monetary policy , but may indirectly influence monetary policy through changes in how decisions are made , who makes decisions , and congress's oversight of those decisions .
