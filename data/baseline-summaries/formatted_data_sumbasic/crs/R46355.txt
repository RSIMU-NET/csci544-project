the strategic petroleum reserve ( spr ) , the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil , has played a role in u.s. energy policy for over 40 years .

the spr's focus has evolved as conditions in the u.s. and world oil markets have changed .

as created , the spr's purpose was to "diminish the vulnerability of the united states to the effects of a severe energy supply interruption , and provide limited protection from the short - term consequences of interruptions in supplies of petroleum products. .

additionally , as a signatory to the international energy program ( iep ) agreement , the united states is obligated to maintain strategic petroleum stock holdings in preparation for a coordinated response during an emergency .

due to changes to the oil market over the past several years , the role of the spr may be of congressional interest .

from the mid - 1970s through the present day , the united states has absorbed a number of significant spikes in the price of crude oil and petroleum products from supply disruptions .

whether driven by disruptions in the physical supply of petroleum , unexpected demand growth , or by uncertainties owing to international conflicts and instabilities , oil price volatility has had consequences for the u.s. economy .

the price of crude oil historically rises or falls with the world economy .

however , supply generally does not smoothly follow demand , and numerous factors can impact crude oil prices ( eg , supply , demand , available supply , value of the dollar , geopolitical risks ) .

thus , oil prices can be volatile .

volatility in crude oil prices can disrupt or enable oil industry investments and productionâfactors that can have a ripple effect on the global economy .

the oil market also responds to geopolitical events .

crude oil and petroleum products are globally traded commodities and as such , global price fluctuations affect u.s. prices and the economy .

several signs suggest an oil market that may be better equipped to respond to supply disruptions: a trend in lower crude oil prices beginning in 2014 , the role of organization of the petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , new u.s. capacity in the market , and evolving consumption patterns .

technological advancements employed in the united states have added significantly to u.s. crude oil production .

in december 2015 , congress lifted restrictions on u.s. crude oil exports .

the united states is exporting crude oil at record levels , causing u.s. crude oil and petroleum product net imports to decline .

according to u.s. energy information administration ( eia ) data , the united states was a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products from september 2019 through january 2020 , the most recent data .

however , oil markets remain volatile .

an oversupplied oil market , as experienced in early 2020 , can contribute to lower crude oil prices .

while low crude oil prices can often mean lower gasoline prices for consumers , it also can create economic challenges for oil producers and others along the supply chain , some of which may lead to long - term impacts .

during a time of oversupply and low prices , some policymakers have discussed the possibility of having the department of energy ( doe ) purchase crude oil to increase oil stockpiles in the spr .

however , such a purchase would require appropriations from congress .

the creation of the spr came about because of events during the 1973 arab - israeli war .

the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries ( oapec ) reduced crude oil production and imposed an embargo on the united states and other countries supporting israel .

while some arab crude oil did reach the united states , the average actual nominal price of imported crude oil tripled from 1973 to 1974 .

petroleum , a globally traded commodity , is subject to international demand and supply conditions ; in the absence of additional regulations , a petroleum - consuming nation pays the market price for petroleum , even in a supply emergency .

however , the availability of strategic stocks can help mitigate the magnitude of the market's reaction to a crisis or guarantee supply to certain consumers ( eg , the military , strategic industries ) .

congress's motivation in creating the spr focused on a deliberate and dramatic physical supply disruption and on mitigating the economic effects of a shortage stemming from international events .

in the event of a supply interruption , proponents reasoned that introducing petroleum into the u.s. market from the spr could offset the lost supply and in doing so help calm markets , mitigate sharp price spikes , and reduce economic disruptions .

congress did not necessarily design the spr to provide price support in the event of an oversupplied market .

however , 42 u.s.c .

â§6240 does authorize the secretary of energy to acquire crude oil for the spr with the objective of minimizing costs , so long as there are appropriated funds to do so .

authority for drawdown and sale of petroleum from the spr is codified into law under 42 u.s.c .

â§6241 .

there are several authorized reasons to release oil from the spr .

presidential authority to authorize a drawdown depends on ( 1 ) making the determination that a severe energy supply interruption exists or ( 2 ) a finding that a drawdown would prevent an impact of a severe domestic supply disruption .

further , iep obligates the united states to join in an iea - coordinated response to a supply disruption .

other sales have been authorized for various reasons including to generate revenue to reduce the budget deficit , to test the functionality of the spr , and to fund the modernization of the spr .

additionally , authorities exist for the acquisition of crude oil to fill the spr , and the option for exchanges in specific scenarios outlined below .

once a drawdown is authorized , doe releases spr oil by conducting a public sale to the highest bidder in a competitive auction .

doe publishes a "notice of sale" that includes the volume , characteristics , and location of the petroleum for sale ; delivery dates and procedures for submitting offers ; and measures for assuring performance and financial responsibility .

bids are reviewed by doe and awards offered .

doe estimates that oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after the appearance of a notice of sale .

through 2019 , the spr released over 230 million barrels for various purposes ( figure 2 ) .

presidents have ordered releases on three occasions , some 58.9 million barrels in total , in response to severe energy supply interruptions in coordination with other iea member countries .

the spr has also provided exchanges totaling around 75 million barrels through 2019 to mitigate temporary supply interruptions .

the borrowers repay their loans by replacing the crude oil plus an additional smaller volume as a premium .

the spr has had three test sales .

in 2014 , doe initiated a test sale to determine if recent infrastructure changes could impact the spr's drawdown capabilities and to exercise sales procedures .

the test ran successfully with some lessons learned , including some pipeline and storage capacity limitations .

a number of other sales reached around 88 million barrels through 2019 were authorized for various reasons ( eg , to generate revenue to reduce the budget deficit as well as to modernize the spr ) .

congress originally created the spr to provide security against severe petroleum supply interruptions and to adhere to iep obligations .

the spr's role has expanded over the years as conditions in the u.s. and world oil market have changed .

today those market conditions continue to shift and as such , congress may consider further modifications to spr legislation .

some policy considerations include if the united states maintains net export status , should congress reconsider the size of the spr ? .

further , u.s. public and commercial oil stocks are well over the 90-day iep obligation .

however , some view the oil in the spr as a national security asset that the united states should maintain at current levels .

releases from oil reserves tend to balance supply disruptions in the short term and provide psychological support to the market that may stabilize oil prices .

should congress consider expanding the role of the spr to provide economic security by alleviating extreme price volatility ? .

given the change in conditions , congress may consider different options for utilizing the spr .

the section that follows discusses some of these developments and possible policy options .

the role of the united states in the global oil market has shifted since the 1970s during a time of rapidly rising prices and perceived resource scarcity .

in addition to creating the spr , congress , through the epca , restricted u.s. - produced crude oil exports .

trade policy with respect to oil has undergone significant changes in recent years to accommodate technological and market developments .

as the u.s. oil market moved toward higher production levels , some policies have come into question .

consequently , in december 2015 , congress passed the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) which repealed section 103 of epca ( p.l .

94-163 ) , removing any restrictions to crude oil exports .

net - exporters of oil do not have a stockholding obligation under the iep .

some have noted that with the reduction of net imports , the size of the spr could be reconsidered .

for similar reasons to lifting restriction on crude oil exports , and with the relatively recent increases in domestic crude oil production , some stakeholders see less need for an oil stockpile .

they contend the change in oil markets warrants a reduction in the size of that stockpile .

u.s. crude oil and petroleum product imports have been in decline .

the eia reports that in september 2019 , the united states exported 89,000 million barrels per day more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported .

the eia further projected that , in most forecasts , the united states will be a net petroleum exporter on an annual basis around 2020 .

however , even if the united states reaches net export status , eia and iea projections indicate that the united states may return to a net importer between 2040 and 2050 .

some contend maintaining the stockpile has value , regardless of net export status .

for instance , keisuke sadamori , iea's director for energy markets and security , testified during a senate hearing in 2019 , oil security is not only an issue for net - importers , and security concerns such as regional extreme weather events and terrorist attacks can affect all countries .

in a global market , even in net exporting countries , oil consumers will be economically harmed by spiking oil prices , and if a disruption tips the world economy into recession , the pain will be felt by exporting and importing countries alike .

finally , the united states is not guaranteed to remain a net exporter indefinitely .

in may 2018 , the government accountability office ( gao ) released a report on the future of the spr analyzing doe's planning approach .

gao recommended that doe should expand or amend their planning approach to include "an additional analysis that takes into account private - sector response , oil market projections , and costs and benefits of a wide range of different spr sizes. .

additionally , market conditions may be changing .

since january 2020 , oil prices have fallen due to of a number of factors including overproduction and constrained demand , largely due to a reduction in travel from the covid - 19 pandemic .

prolonged periods of depressed prices could affect u.s. oil production , exports , employment , and industry consolidation .

if u.s. production and subsequently exports were to decline , the prospect of the united states becoming a net exporter may be delayed or eliminated .

iea members can use both public and commercial stocks to meet their 90-day obligation .

in january 2020 , the united states had 423 days of net imports of commercial crude oil stocks , equaling around 697 days when combined with spr stocks , according to iea methodology .

both public and privately held oil stocks have important roles to play in providing security in times of oil market disruptions .

similarly , both public and private oil stocks have some role in oil price determination and movements .

as the world oil market and the u.s. market evolve , it is reasonable to reassess the role of each of these components of u.s. energy security .

management of commercial stocks can affect the price of oil in multiple ways .

these effects are limited by the storage capacity of the system as a whole , but that capacity can be augmented or reduced .

numerous oil industry firms hold commercial stocks of crude oil at refineries , bulk terminals , and in pipelines .

the purpose of these stocks is to ensure the continuous operation of the refining industry , which transforms crude oil into petroleum products used by consumers .

commercial oil companies are more likely to store oil for the short - term , rather than as a long - term security stock .

some experts contend that commercial stocks cannot provide a level of security proportional to that of the spr .

the role of sales from the spr into the commercial market during a supply disruption is linked to the size of commercial stocks and the availability of additional production capacity .

generally , the level of private oil stocks closely follows the level of oil production and changes in the price of oil .

if global supply is greater or less than current demand , commercial stocks of oil may rise or fall accordingly .

in a market where there is no physical shortage , oil companies may have limited interest in purchasing spr oil unless they want to build crude oil stocks or have spare refining capacity to turn the crude into useful products .

conversely , during a supply disruption , commercial stocks would likely move to market before the spr , as doe must solicit buyers through a notice of sale .

further , the spr takes approximately 13 days from an initial decision to hold a sale to ultimate delivery of that oil .

for instance , in response to the attack against saudi arabia's oil production in september 2019 , president trump authorized the release of oil from the spr , as needed .

in response to prior events , presidents have ordered a release in coordination with other iea member countries .

in this case , the iea did not announce a coordinated release , but monitored the situation closely .

although the united states had the capacity to replace most of the saudi oil taken off the market by the attack , no release from the spr occurred as commercial stocks supplied the market and prices stabilized .

generally , according to gao , most experts interviewed in the may 2018 report agreed that the private sector is in a better position to respond to supply disruptions than they were in the 1970s .

conversely , doe noted in the same report that the united states does not have a requirement for the private sector to respond to a supply disruption .

further , according to gao , doe does not have analysis on how the private sector would respond to supply disruptions .

petroleum is a globally traded commodity and subject to international demand and supply conditions .

volatility in crude oil prices can disrupt or enable oil industry investments and productionâfactors that can have a ripple effect on the global economy .

however , the storage of petroleum can provide some price relief or even alleviate a physical shortage of supply to certain consumers ( eg , the military , strategic industries ) .

congress's motivation in creating the spr focused on a deliberate and dramatic physical supply disruption and on mitigating the economic effects of a shortage stemming from international events .

as market conditions continue to change , congress may consider options for utilizing the spr in an oversupplied low oil price environment .

global oil prices declined nearly 60% between january and mid - april 2020 , as a result of a number of factors .

these factors included reduced demand and economic impacts related to the evolving covid - 19 pandemic , and the failure of opec and a group of non - opec countries ( opec+ ) , including russia , to come to an agreement regarding oil production during their march 2020 meeting .

while low oil prices are generally positive for consumers ( translating into lower gasoline prices ) and oil refiners ( translating into lower costs ) , sustained low prices could result in financial stress for companies operating in the u.s. oil exploration and production ( e&p ) sector .

due to these recent developments , a plan to sell crude oilâas required in fy2020 by p.l .

116-94 âfrom the spr was suspended .

discussions transitioned from selling oil from the spr to purchasing oil to fill it to capacity .

acquiring crude oilâdirect purchases or royalty - in - kindâfor spr storage could absorb a limited amount of market oversupply .

physical spr capacity is approximately 713.5 million barrels , while actual inventories are 635 million barrels .

at the direction of president trump , doe issued a solicitation to purchase an initial 30 million barrels of crude oil as part of a plan to acquire 77 million barrels .

however , on march 25 , 2020 , doe cancelled this solicitation , noting , "given the current uncertainty related to adequate congressional appropriations for crude oil purchases associated with the march 19 , 2020 solicitation , the department is withdrawing the solicitation .

should funding become secure for the planned purchases , the department will reissue the solicitation. .

whether increasing spr inventories might contribute to oil market rebalancing is uncertain .

even if congress appropriated funding to purchase crude oil , the spr's available capacity is limited ( currently around 77 million barrels ) and the impact could be marginal depending on a number of factors ( i.e. , duration and volume of crude oil oversupply ) .

however , congress authorized the spr to store up to 1 billion barrels .

while not an immediate solution , congress could consider appropriating funds to expand the spr's physical capacity to the authorized 1 billion barrels .

on april 2 , 2020 , doe ( under exchange authority 42 u.s.c .

â§6239 ( f ) ( 5 ) ) announced a solicitation for the storage of 30 million barrels in exchange for a fixed premium of barrels , returning the difference by march 31 , 2021 .

this would allow crude oil to be temporarily stored in the spr sites , potentially providing some financial relief to some u.s. producers .

several petroleum associations applauded the effort , stating , for example , "the oil producers of louisiana praise the president , his administration , and louisiana's federal delegation for taking swift , decisive action to help support the nation's energy producers with the spr's exchange for storage. .

however , challenges remain , as spare storage capacity at cushing , ok ( the designated delivery point for nymex crude oil futures contracts ) is limited or unavailable .

the futures price is a contract , usually monthly , for delivery of a certain amount of crude oil , on a specified date in the future , and at a particular location ( cushing , ok , for west texas intermediate ( wti ) crude oil ) .

as available storage becomes more limited , futures prices may continue to fall as owners of crude oil discount their price in order to entice buyers .

this apparently was the case with wti where some traders grew concerned over storage availability in cushing , forcing some to sell their futures contracts .

despite federal efforts to make capacity available at the spr and other measures , cushing storage capacity is a key factor for wti prices .

when acquiring petroleum for the spr , the secretary is to consider , to the extent possible , four objectives under 42 u.s.c .

â§6240 .

among these , the secretary is to minimize market impacts from purchases .

acquiring spr crude oil to reduce oversupply and increase prices could conflict with that objective .

however , the degree of impact on the market may be hard to determine , and a threshold level is not explicitly defined .

furthermore , included in doe's objectives is to minimize the cost and presumablyâdepending on prices in march 2021 when the above noted exchange expiresâdoe's exchange could result in a comparatively low - cost petroleum acquisition .

crude oil price increases generally result from actual or anticipated market tightening ; that is , an increase in demand , a reduction in supply , or both .

there is a general recognition that a release from the spr would likely only provide temporary relief from rising prices ; however , high prices alone are not an authorized circumstance to trigger a release from the spr .

high prices are generally a consequence of a severe supply interruption .

for instance , in 2011 , the price increases were thought to be largely attributable to the loss of libyan production during the revolution in that country .

the judgment that a release of crude oil from the spr provides some temporary relief from rising prices seems well founded .

the u.s. government bases its notice of sale on the previous five - day average of the price of the grade of crude oil it intends to sell , and accepts bids it considers responsive .

if the notice itself does not prompt , or contribute to , a softening of prices , there may be limited interest on the part of the oil industry in bidding on spr supply .

although the possibility exists that prices might decline if additional refined product is released into the market , it is impossible to predict what long - term quantitative effect an spr crude drawdown would have .

for example , in response to prolonged oil supply disruption from the libyan civil war , the iea coordinated a petroleum release on june 23 , 2011 .

following the announcement of a 30 million barrel release of oil from the spr , the price of crude oil declined by about 5% that day .

about one week later , prices began to exceed pre - announcement levels .

the announcement of the spr release stated that the oil would be delivered to market by the end of august 2011 .

oil prices began to decline in that month and generally declined through september 2011 .

however , several other factors may have contributed to the price of crude oil .

for instance , the prices of crude oil declined in may 2011 following the death of osama bin laden and a rise in the u.s. dollar .

some observers do not support use of the spr to mitigate high crude oil prices .

these observers prefer allowing the market to resolve itself and for government not to intervene .

further , observers may contend that market conditions and current and anticipated geopolitical events are affecting prices more than short - term physical supply concerns or that speculative bidding in the oil commodity futures market has driven price volatility more than the current supply - demand balance .

in this context , use of the spr would have limited impact on market conditions .

congress could reduce the size of the spr and sell off excess petroleum for the benefit of other programs while still maintaining the 90-day net import requirement .

however , determining the optimal level of oil holdings in the spr is likely to remain controversial .

analytical tools common in public policy analysis , such as cost - benefit analysis , dynamic programming , or other optimization techniques , depend on determining the value of variables that are highly uncertain in this case .

the responsiveness of the adjustment of oil quantities on both the demand and the supply sides of the market , the price volatility of oil , and the probabilities of different degrees of political / military disruption in the oil market are all uncertain .

in addition the 90-day net import requirement is a dynamic calculation based on a combination of market factors .

bayou choctaw the bayou choctaw storage site is located in iberville parish , la .

the site has six storage caverns , with a storage capacity of 76 million barrels , and an inventory of 71.8 million barrels , as of april 2020 .

the bayou choctaw site began full operation in 1987 and has remained operational since then .

in november 2011 , doe acquired a replacement cavern for cavern 20 , after it had experienced leaching , which posed an environmental risk .

bayou choctaw has a design drawdown rate of 0.5 million barrels per day , and a design fill rate of 110 thousand barrels per day .

 ( the other three spr storage sites have a combined fill rate specified as 225 thousand barrels per day. ) .

big hill the big hill storage site is located in jefferson county , tx .

the site has 14 storage caverns , a combined storage capacity of 170 million barrels , and a cavern inventory of 143.3 million barrels as of april 2020 .

the big hill site began full operation in 1991 and has remained operational since then .

big hill has a design drawdown rate of 1.1 million barrels per day .

section 168 of the epca authorizes foreign oil to be stored in unused space to increase world oil stockpiling .

in 1998 , the u.s. commerce department designated big hill as a special purpose foreign trade zone , which exempts foreign oil storage from customs or certain taxes .

doe noted in their spr calendar year 2016 annual report to congress that despite this designation , big hill has not stored foreign oil .

bryan mound the bryan mound storage site is located in brazoria county , tx .

the site has 19 storage caverns with a total storage capacity of 247.1 million barrels , and a cavern inventory of 230.2 million barrels as of april 2020 .

the bryan mound site began operation in 1986 and has remained operational since then .

in 2013 , after failing a mechanical integrity test ( mit ) , one of bryan mound's then - 20 storage caverns was determined to be at risk .

it was subsequently emptied , bringing the total to 19 caverns .

pumping to transfer the oil to other caverns began in march 2015 and completed in december 2016 .

additionally , in 2018 , two of the three aboveground storage tanks at bryan mound were unusable and required maintenance .

this reduces the site's drawdown rate from 1.5 million barrels per day to 1.35 million barrels per day .

according to doe's strategic petroleum reserve annual report for calendar year 2018 , these tanks are to be converted to external floating roof tanks during the spr modernization programâlife extension 2 project .

west hackberry the west hackberry storage site is located in cameron parish , la .

the site has 21 operable storage caverns with a combined storage capacity of 220.4 million barrels , and a cavern inventory of 189.7 million barrels as of april 2020 .

the west hackberry site began full operation in 1988 and has remained operational since then .

in 2012 , cavern 6 had a well stability issue and plans to remove oil from the cavern were instituted .

in december 2017 , all accessible oil was transferred out of cavern 6 to the other 21 storage caverns .
