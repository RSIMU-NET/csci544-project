president clinton signed the fy2001 department of transportation ( dot ) appropriations act ( p.l .

106-346 ) into law on october 23 , 2000 .

the house and senate had approved the conferenceagreement ( h.rept .

106-940 ) on october 6 , 2000 .

the fy2001 act provides $57.978 billion fordot .

this is an increase of more than 14% over enacted fy2000 funding .

the fy2001 act appearsto be in conformance with the requirements of both the transportation equity act for the 21stcentury ( tea - 21 ) and the wendell h. ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century ( fair21 ) .

it also includes , in modified form , a senate provision to strengthen state drunk driverblood alcohol standards to 0.08% .

in addition , the enacted bill permits the federal motor carriersafety administration ( fmcsa ) to collect and analyze public comments and data on its proposedhours of service rules , but prohibits fmcsa from taking final action during fy2001 .

the fy2001 act includes conference agreement provisions not found in either the senate or house bills , such as , additional appropriations of $1.37 billion for miscellaneous highway projects,$600 million for the woodrow wilson memorial bridge , and $55 million for the appalachiandevelopment highway system .

also provided is $720 million for the emergency relief federal aidhighway program .

on december 21 , 2000 , president clinton signed the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

106-554 ) which provided for a 0.22% government - wide rescission .

the act rescinded roughly$125 million from the dot budget .

the act also included just over $20 million in additionaltransportation spending .

transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget .

it is also consideredpart of the discretionary budget .

funding for the dot budget is derived from a number of sources.the majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds .

the remainder of dotfunding is from federal treasury general funds .

the transportation trust funds include: the highwaytrust fund , the transit account of the highway trust fund , the airport and airway trust fund , and theinland waterways trust fund .

all of these accounts derive their respective funding from specificexcise and other taxes .

together , highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dot appropriations , and can account for 60% to 70% of total federal transportation spending in any given year .

mosthighway and the majority of transit programs are funded with contract authority derived by the linkto the highway trust fund .

this is very significant from a budgeting standpoint .

contract authorityis tantamount to , but does not actually involve , entering into a contract to pay for a project at somefuture date .

under this arrangement , specified in title 23 u.s.c. , authorized funds are automaticallymade available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriationslegislation .

appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover theseobligations .

where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process , transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation .

that is , the authority tospend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to obligate fundsfor these programs is also in place .

prior to the fy1999 dot appropriations act , changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes inbudget / contract authority and by placing limitations on obligations .

the principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds to congressional budgetagreements .

the authority to set a limitation on obligations for contract authority programs gave appropriators considerable leeway in allocating funds among the various federal transportationactivities in function 400 , which includes agencies such as the coast guard and the federal aviationadministration .

in addition , the inclusion of the highway and transit programs and their trust - fundgenerated revenue streams in the discretionary budget provided appropriators with additionalflexibility as part of the annual process by which available funds were allocated amongst the 13standing appropriations subcommittees in the house and the senate .

with release of the clinton administration's fy2001 budget proposal onfebruary 7 , 2000 , the budget debate began in earnest .

in proposing an overalltransportation spending level of nearly $55 billion , the administration continued toemphasize its safety , research , environmental , infrastructure , and mobility prioritieswhich complement vice president gore's proposals concerning the administration's"livability agenda. .

additional issues arose during congressional consideration of theappropriations legislation .

the fy2001 dot appropriations debate was lesscontentious than last year's debate .

it can be argued this is a direct result of a lessconstrained budgetary environment .

the fy2001 dot appropriations bill that president clinton sighed into law ( p.l .

106-346 ) on october 23 , 2000 , provided for total funding substantially aboveboth the president's request and fy2000 funding .

the $57.978 billion provided fordot for fy2001 is 14% above the fy2000 level and significantly higher than theadministration's request for a 7.8% increase .

 ( 1 ) nearlyall agencies got increases butthe big gainers were the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) and the federalaviation administration ( faa ) which got 16% and 25% increases over fy2000levels , respectively .

the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

106-554 ) , which was signed by president clinton on december 21 , 2000 , included both agovernment - wide rescission and some additional dot spending .

the rescission cutsthe fy2001 dot budget by roughly $125 million .

the act also earmarked over $20million in additional spending .

the fy2001 enacted totals in table 3 at the end ofthis report and the fy2001 enacted columns in the charts are rescission adjustedfigures .

because president bush's fy2002 budget submission , when released , willinclude the official rescission adjustments for fy2001 , the adjusted figures in thisreport should be considered estimates .

the early course of the house and senate appropriations bills was strongly influenced by the constraints of the budget caps that appropriators were workingunder .

this environment continued through passage of the house and senate versionsof h.r .

4475 .

once it was clear that legislation would be introduced toraise the spending caps enough to fund agencies not protected by funding guaranteesthe issues were few and were worked out in conference .
