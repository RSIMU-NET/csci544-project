most of the mandatory growth is due to rising demand for domestic nutrition assistance .

most programs see an increase in funding over fy2009 .

among the important policy issues resolved in the act are dairy financial assistance and imports of poultry from china .

p.l .

111-80 includes $350 million for dairy farmer assistance in response to low farm milk prices , along the lines of the senate bill , to be split with $60 million to purchase dairy products and $290 million for direct payments to farmers .

p.l .

111-80 also allows poultry imports from china under specified preconditions , along the lines of the senate bill .

the agriculture appropriations bill — formally known as the agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act — provides funding for the following agencies and departments: all of the u.s. department of agriculture ( except the forest service , which is funded by the interior appropriations bill ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services , and in the house , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) .

in the senate , cftc appropriations are handled by the financial services appropriations subcommittee .

jurisdiction for the appropriations bill rests with the house and senate committees on appropriations , particularly each committee's subcommittee on agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies .

these committees are separate from the agriculture authorizing committees — the house committee on agriculture and the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry .

table 1 summarizes the steps in the passage of the bill in each chamber .

before enactment of the fy2010 appropriation , agencies affected by the bill were funded at fy2009 levels under a continuing resolution that ran until october 31 , 2009 ( p.l .

111-68 ) .

the fy2010 appropriation marks a return to regular order for passing the agriculture appropriations bill , which was last enacted separately in fy2006 .

in fy2009 , neither the house nor senate acted on a stand - alone version of the bill , and an agriculture appropriations bill had not reached the senate floor since the fy2006 bill ( table a - 1 in the appendix ) .

the fy2010 appropriation is also the earliest that an agriculture appropriations bill has been enacted since fy1999 ( figure a - 1 ) .

table a - 1 has links to each appropriation and annual crs report .

the agriculture appropriations bill funds all of the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) except for the forest service .

this amounts to about 94% of usda's total appropriation .

the forest service is funded through the interior appropriations bill .

usda carries out widely varied responsibilities through about 30 internal agencies and offices staffed by about 100,000 employees ; about 34,000 of those employees are in the forest service .

the order of the following sections reflects the order that the agencies are listed in the agriculture appropriations bill .

see table 3 for more details on the amounts for specific agencies .

the enacted appropriation provides a direct appropriation for the food and drug administration ( fda ) of $2.357 billion for fy2010 , $7 million more than in either the house or senate bills , and $306 million ( +15% ) more than fy2009 .

in addition , the enacted appropriation includes $922 million in user fees .

the combined program level for fy2010 thus would be $3.279 billion for fy2010 , up 23% from the fy2009 program level ( up 14% from fy2009 before adding newly authorized user fees described below ) .

the $922 million funded by user fees is up about 50% from $613 million in fy2009 , but three - fourths of the increase in user fees is accounted for by $235 million in newly authorized user fees to support a new center for tobacco products .

the new user fees were included in anticipated house and senate floor amendments , since authorizing language for the tobacco product user fees was enacted after the house appropriations bills was reported .

regarding the $2.357 billion of appropriated funding , the 15% increase would increase support for food and medical product safety that would cover , for example , more foreign and domestic inspections .

both bills or reports recommend priority attention to products for neuroblastoma , and mention a proposed standard of identity to prevent the misbranding and adulteration of honey .

the house committee report also noted increases for research in biomarkers , collection and analysis of data on foodborne illnesses , research on screening tests for bloodborne diseases , adverse events from medical devices used in pediatric hospitals , evaluations of drug risk evaluation and mitigation strategies , over - the - counter sunscreen testing and labeling ; and the upcoming dietary guidelines advisory committee report .

the senate committee report encouraged fda to increase inspection of imported shrimp for banned antibiotics , to issue guidance regarding antibiotic development and to work with others to promote development and appropriate use of antibacterial drugs for humans , to continue activities on antimicrobial resistance , and to clarify the relationship of dietary supplements to a definition of food .

the senate bill mentions a $2 million increase ( +25% ) for the cosmetics program , and $3 million for demonstration grants for improving pediatric device availability .

the enacted appropriation instructs fda to report on adverse events and seizures associated with brand and generic anti - epileptic drugs , specifically the pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs that fda rates as therapeutically equivalent , and to recommend changes to current bioequivalence testing .

the enacted appropriation directs fda to report on safety challenges associated with imported seafood .

it also directs fda to report regarding personal care products for which organic content claims are made , to include recommendations on the need for labeling standards and premarket approval of labeling .

for more background of fda appropriations issues , see crs report r40792 , food and drug administration appropriations for fy2010 , by [author name scrubbed] .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets .

the cftc's functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges , registration and supervision of futures industry personnel , prevention of fraud and price manipulation , and investor protection .

although most futures trading is now related to financial variables ( interest rates , currency prices , and stock indexes ) , congressional oversight remains vested in the agriculture committees because of the market's historical origins as an adjunct to agricultural trade .

appropriations for the cftc are under the jurisdiction of the agriculture subcommittee in the house , and the financial services and general government subcommittee in the senate .

in the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , the cftc was funded in division a , agriculture and related agencies .

in the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 , the cftc was funded in division a , financial services and general government .

the fy2010 enacted appropriation provides $168.0 million , 4.6% more than the administration's request and 15.1% more than the fy2009 enacted .

the administration had requested $160.6 million , 10% more than the fy2009 enacted amount of $146.0 million .

the senate financial services appropriations bill recommended $177.0 million , and the house agriculture appropriations bill approved $161.0 million .
