the mission of hhs is to "enhance the health and well - being of americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound , sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine , public health , and social services. .

hhs is currently organized into 11 main agencies , called "operating divisions" ( listed below ) , which are responsible for administering a wide variety of health and human services programs , and conducting related research .

in addition , hhs has a number of "staff divisions" within the office of the secretary ( os ) .

these staff divisions fulfill a broad array of management , research , oversight , and emergency preparedness functions in support of the entire department .

hhs operating divisions eight of the hhs operating divisions are part of the u.s. public health service ( phs ) .

phs agencies have diverse missions in support of public health , including the provision of health care services and supports ( eg , ihs , hrsa , samhsa ) ; the advancement of health care quality and medical research ( eg , ahrq , nih ) ; the prevention and control of disease , injury , and environmental health hazards ( eg , cdc , atsdr ) ; and the regulation of food and drugs ( eg , fda ) .

the three remaining hhs operating divisionsâacf , acl , and cmsâare not phs agencies .

acf and acl largely administer human services programs focused on the well - being of vulnerable children , families , older americans , and individuals with disabilities .

cmsâwhich accounts for the largest share of the hhs budget by farâis responsible for administering medicare , medicaid , and the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , in addition to some aspects of the private health insuranceâ market .

 ( for a summary of each operating division's mission and links to agency resources related to the fy2020 budget request , see the appendix . ) .

the initial president's budget request for fy2020 was submitted to congress on march 11 , 2019 , about five weeks after the statutory deadline .

 ( additional components of the fy2020 request were released in subsequent weeks. ) .

the delay in the budget submission was attributable , in part , to protracted negotiations over seven of the fy2019 annual appropriations acts , which resulted in a five - week partial government shutdown .

 ( five of the 12 annual appropriations acts had already received full - year appropriations for fy2019 when the shutdown commenced. ) .

at hhs , the fy2019 shutdown primarily affected fda , ihs , and atsdr .

the remaining hhs operating and staff divisions generally had already received full - year fy2019 funding prior to the start of the fiscal year ( division b of p.l .

115-245 ) .

full - year appropriations for fda , ihs , and atsdr were ultimately enacted on february 15 , 2019 , almost five months after the start of the fiscal year ( p.l .

116-6 ) .

in light of this delay , the source of the fy2019 numbers contained in the fy2020 president's budget materials varies by hhs agency .

in the case of fda , ihs , and atsdr , amounts shown for fy2019 were estimated based on annualized funding levels under the fy2019 continuing resolution ( division c of p.l .

115-245 , as amended ) , not final full - year enacted levels .

by contrast , amounts shown for the remaining hhs agencies generally reflect enacted full - year appropriations provided in division b of p.l .

115-245 .

under the president's budget request , hhs would spend an estimated $1.286 trillion in outlays in fy2020 ( see table 1 ) .

this is $56 billion ( +5% ) more than estimated hhs spending in fy2019 and about $166 billion ( +15% ) more than actual hhs spending in fy2018 .

historical estimates by the office of management and budget ( omb ) indicate that hhs has accounted for at least 20% of all federal outlays in each year since fy1995 .

most recently , omb estimated that hhs accounted for 27% of all federal outlays in fy2018 .

figure 1 displays proposed fy2020 hhs outlays by major program or spending category in the president's request .

as this figure shows , mandatory spending typically accounts for the vast majority of the hhs budget .

in fact , two programsâmedicare and medicaidâare expected to account for 86% of all estimated hhs spending in fy2020 .

medicare and medicaid are "entitlement" programs , meaning the federal government is required to make mandatory payments to individuals , states , or other entities based on criteria established in authorizing law .

this figure also shows that discretionary spending accounts for about 8% of estimated fy2020 hhs outlays in the president's request .

although discretionary spending represents a relatively small share of total hhs spending , the department nevertheless receives more discretionary money than most federal departments .

according to omb data , hhs accounted for 7% of all discretionary budget authority across the government in fy2018 , the same as the department of homeland security .

the department of defense was the only federal agency to account for a larger share of all discretionary budget authority in that year ( 47% ) .

 figure 2 provides a breakdown of the fy2020 hhs budget request by operating division .

when taking into account both mandatory and discretionary budget authority ( i.e. , total budget authority shown in figure 2 ) , cms accounts for the largest share of the request ( nearly $1.17 trillion ) .

the majority of the cms budget request would go toward mandatory spending programs , such as medicare and medicaid .

when looking exclusively at discretionary budget authority , funding for cms is comparatively smaller , accounting for just $3.6 billion of the hhs discretionary request .

the largest share of the discretionary request would go to the phs agencies ( roughly $59.4 billion in combined funding for fda , hrsa , ihs , cdc , atsdr , nih , and samhsa ; no funds would go to ahrq under the request ) .

nih would receive the largest amount ( $33.5 billion ) of discretionary budget authority of any hhs operating division , and acf would receive the second - largest amount ( $18.3 billion ) .

table 3 puts the fy2020 request for each hhs operating division and the office of the secretary into context , displaying it along with estimates of funding provided over the three prior fiscal years ( fy2017-fy2019 ) .

these totals are inclusive of both mandatory and discretionary funding .

the amounts in this table are shown in terms of budget authority ( ba ) and outlays .

ba is the authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or other financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures involving federal government funds .

outlays occur when funds are actually expended from the treasury ; they could be the result of either new budget authority enacted in the current fiscal year or unexpended budget authority that was enacted in previous fiscal years .

as a consequence , the ba and outlays in this table represent two different ways of accounting for the funding that is provided to each hhs agency through the federal budget process .

for example , table 3 shows $0 in fy2020 ba for ahrq because the president's budget proposes to eliminate this agency ; however , the table shows an estimated $299 million in fy2020 ahrq outlays , reflecting the expected expenditure of funds previously provided to the agency .

this appendix provides for each operating division a brief summary of its mission , the applicable appropriations bill , the fy2020 budget request level , and links to additional resources related to that request .
