this is an overview of the most prominent features of federal habeas corpus law .

federal habeas corpus as we know it is by and large a procedure under which a court may review the legality of an individual's incarceration .

it is most often invoked after conviction and the exhaustion of the ordinary means of appeal .

it is at once the last refuge of scoundrels and the last hope of the innocent .

it is an intricate weave of statute and case law whose reach has flowed and ebbed over time .

prior to enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act ( aedpa ) , the most recent substantial recasting of federal habeas law and the supreme court cases that immediately preceded it , it was said that federal habeas was "the most controversial and friction producing issue in the relation between federal and state courts.... commentators [were] critical , ... federal judges [were] unhappy , ... state courts resented [it] , .

 .

[and] prisoners thrive[d] on it as a form of occupational therapy.... " the aedpa was passed and yet the debate goes on .

judges , academics and political figures regularly urge that the boundaries for federal habeas be readjusted ; some would make it more readily available ; others would limit access to it .

debate has been particularly intense in capital punishment cases .

there , unlike most other cases , the decisions of the state courts stand unexecuted while they await completion of federal habeas corpus proceedings ; there , unlike most other cases , an erroneously executed sentence is beyond any semblance of correction or compensation .

the aedpa offers states expeditious habeas procedures in capital cases under certain circumstances ; no state has yet been able to take full advantage of the offer , and as a consequence , congress adjusted the method of determining qualification in the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act .

an unsuccessful endeavor to curtail access of guantanamo bay detainees to habeas relief provided the supreme court with an opportunity to further explain the scope of congressional authority over habeas jurisdiction under the suspension clause .

the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , p.l .

104-132 , 110 stat .

1214 ( 1996 ) ( aedpa ) , codified , supplemented , and expanded upon the court's limitations on the availability of the writ .

aedpa was the culmination and amalgamation of disparate legislative efforts , including habeas proposals , some them stretching back well over a decade .

its adjustments help define the contemporary boundaries of the current writ .

federal prisoners who claim that they are being held by virtue of a conviction or sentence rendered contrary to the constitution or laws of the united states must ordinarily repair to section 2255 of title 28 of the united states code for collateral review .

congress added section 2255 when it revised title 28 in 1948 to expedite review .

the section "replaced traditional habeas corpus for federal prisoners... .

the purpose and effect of the statute was not to restrict access to the writ but to make postconviction proceedings more efficient. .

the section "was intended to mirror â§2254 in operative effect," although there are occasionally differences between the two .

when the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act ( aedpa ) amended the provisions governing access to habeas by state prisoners , but in some instances it made comparable changes in section 2255 .

thus , both the state inmate's habeas petition and federal convict's section 2255 motion must be filed within a year after their direct appeals become final .

"an appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus. .

as for procedural default , "[w]here the petitionerâwhether a state or federal prisonerâfailed property to raise his claim on direct review , the writ is available only if the petitioner establishes cause for the waiver and shows actual prejudice resulting from the alleged violation. .

the supreme court has yet to address the question of whether the teague rule , which requires a new constitutional interpretation be claimed on direct appeal rather in habeas , applies to section 2255 .

the court has noted , however , that the lower federal courts have applied the teague rule to section 2255 .

the statutory provisions governing both petition and motion restrict relief for second or successive invocations in much the same manner , but they do so in different terminology .

for many years , one of the most interesting and perplexing features of federal habeas involved the question of congress' authority to restrict access to the writ .

the constitution nowhere expressly grants a right of access to the writ , although it might be seen as attribute of the suspension clause or the due process clause or both .

yet the suspension clause says no more than that "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it," u.s. const .

art.i , â§9 , cl.2 .

and the due process clause speaks with an equal want of particularity when it declares that , "no person shall ... deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law," u.s. const .

amend .

v. balanced against this , is the power of congress to "ordain and establish" the lower federal courts , u.s. const .

art .

iii , â§1 ; to regulate and make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court , u.s. const .

art .

iii , â§2 , cl.2 ; to enact all laws necessary and power to carry into effect the constitutional powers of the courts as well as its own , u.s.const .

art .

i , â§8 , cl.18 ; and the power to suspend the privilege to the writ in times of rebellion or invasion , u.s. const .

art .

i , â§9 , cl.2 .

in the past , when it seemed that congress had extinguished the habeas jurisdiction of the lower courts , the supreme court observed that it retained jurisdiction to issue the writ on a petition filed originally with the supreme court , following a denial for want of jurisdiction or other action in a lower court .

when legislation finally attempted to seal off this avenue to the great writ as well , the court confirmed that separation of powers concerns reflected in the suspension clause preclude absolute denial of access to the writ ( or to an adequate substitute ) except under the circumstances noted in the suspension clause .
