g eorge washington , bob hope , joe louis , the wright brothers , robert frost , francis albert "frank" sinatra , and mother teresa of calcutta share a common bond in american history .

these notable personages , together with approximately 300 other individuals and the american red cross , have been accorded the unique distinction of being awarded a congressional gold medal .

through these awards , congress has expressed public gratitude for distinguished contributions , dramatized the virtues of patriotism , and perpetuated the remembrance of great events .

this tradition , of authorizing individually struck gold medals bearing the portraits of those so honored or images of events in which they participated , is rich with history .

although congress has approved legislation stipulating specific requirements for numerous other awards and decorations , there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of congressional gold medals .

when such an award has been deemed appropriate , congress has , by special action , provided for the creation of a personalized medal to be given in its name , which would in each instance truly record the approbation of a grateful country .

congress from the outset was "imbued with the conviction that only the very highest achievements [were] entitled to such a distinction , and that the value of a reward is enhanced by its rarity ! .

instituting such a tradition was considered "both a legitimate function and powerful instrument of nationality. .

"few inventions," colonel david humphrey wrote in 1787 , "could be more happily calculated to diffuse the knowledge and preserve the memory of illustrious characters and splendid events than medals — whether we take into consideration the imperishable nature of the substance whence they are formed , the facility of multiplying copies , or the practice of depositing them in the cabinets of the curious. .

with these words , humphrey , who had the responsibility for having the first gold medals struck in paris , captured the essence of the feelings which inspired the continental congress to choose medals as its highest distinction and expression of national appreciation .

following a long - standing historical practice , congress commissioned gold medals as tributes for what were considered to be the most distinguished achievements .

silver and bronze medals , and ceremonial swords , were awarded for less eminent , but still notable , accomplishments .

of these , only the gold medal has been continuously awarded to the present day .

the continental congress had not yet proclaimed its independence from great britain when , on march 25 , 1776 , george washington , commander of the continental army , was tendered the first congressional gold medal for his "wise and spirited conduct" in bringing about british evacuation of boston .

during the next 12 years , the continental congress authorized an additional six gold medals for revolutionary military and naval leaders .

in 1777 , major general horatio gates was recognized for his "brave and successful efforts" in bringing about the surrender of the british army at saratoga .

two years later , a similar honor was bestowed upon major general anthony wayne in 1779 for his courageous assault on the british at stony point , ny .

a gold medal was also given to major henry lee in commemoration of the skill and bravery he exhibited against the british at paulus hook , nj .

brigadier general [author name scrubbed] and major general nathaniel greene were praised for their gallant efforts in south carolina during 1781 .

six years later , john paul jones was similarly honored for his "valor and brilliant services" in capturing the serapis .

following the ratification of the constitution , the first gold medal authorized by the congress of the united states was given to captain thomas truxtun in 1800 for his gallant effort during the action between the united states frigate constellation and the french ship la vengeance .

in 1805 , commodore edward preble received a gold medal for gallantry and good conduct during the war with tripoli .

in the 20 th and 21 st centuries , congress continued to broaden the scope of such honors to include recognition of excellence in such varied fields as the arts , athletics , aviation , diplomacy , entertainment , exploration , medicine , politics , religion , and science .

thirty - one of the congressional gold medals authorized to date have gone to non - americans .

in 1847 , 10 officers and men belonging to or attached to french , british , and spanish ships - of - war in the harbor of vera cruz captured congressional attention for aiding in the rescue of officers and crew of the united states brig somers .

eight years after congress paid tribute to dr. frederick a .

rose of the british navy in 1858 , captain robert creighton , of the british ship three bells , won acclaim for aiding in the rescue of survivors from the steamship san francisco .

gold medals were also given to señor domicio da gama , señor rómulo s. naón , and señor eduardo suárez , the diplomatic representatives of argentina , brazil , and chile who acted as mediators between the united states and mexico in 1914 ; and to norwegian explorer roald amundsen and italian explorer umberto nobile for their participation in american explorer lincoln ellsworth's polar flight of 1925 and his 1926 transpolar flight .

in 1969 , president nixon was authorized to present a gold medal in the name of the united states and in the name of congress to the widow of the late british prime minister winston churchill .

canadian ambassador to iran kenneth taylor was honored in march 1980 for his efforts in securing the safe return of six american embassy officials in their escape from tehran .

congress recognized simon wiesenthal of austria in 1980 for his dedicated action in bringing to justice nazi war criminals who had gone into hiding at the end of world war ii .

early in 1982 , her majesty queen beatrix of the netherlands was awarded a gold medal in recognition of the bicentennial anniversary of diplomatic and commercial relations between her country and the united states .

natan ( anatoly ) and avital shcharansky of the former soviet union were applauded in 1986 for their "supreme dedication and total commitment to the cause of individual human rights and freedoms. .

during the 105 th congress , the president was authorized to award gold medals to three additional foreign recipients — mother teresa of calcutta , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , a turkish citizen , and nelson rolihlahla mandela of the republic of south africa .

in the 106 th congress , pope john paul ii was cited .

british prime minister tony blair in 2003 became the first briton since winston churchill to be awarded the congressional gold medal .

three years later , tenzin gyatso , tenzin , the fourteenth dalai lama , earned recognition .

daw aung san suu kyi of burma won acclaim in 2008 , as did dr. muhammad yunus in 2010 .

in 2012 , a congressional gold medal was awarded to raoul wallenberg in recognition of his achievements and heroic actions during the holocaust .

in 2014 , a gold medal was awarded to shimon peres .

after a congressional gold medal bill has been approved by both houses of congress and signed into law by the president , officials of the united states mint meet with the sponsors of the legislation and members of the honoree's family to discuss possible designs for the medal .

photographs of the honoree are also examined during this meeting .

mint engravers then prepare a series of sketches of possible designs for consideration and comment by the commission of fine arts and subsequently the secretary of the treasury , who makes the final decision on the medal's design .

once the secretary of the treasury , in consultation with the honoree's family , has made a selection , the design is sculptured , a die is made , and the medal is struck at the philadelphia mint .

the mint then notifies the white house and arrangements are made for a formal presentation by the president .

the cost of issuing a congressional gold medal , generally about $30,000 , is charged against the united states mint public enterprise fund .

congress established this revolving fund "in the treasury of the united states ... to be available to the secretary for numismatic operations and programs of the united states mint without fiscal year limitations. .

the authorizing legislation in each case typically includes a provision stating that the "secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck ... at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medals ( including labor , materials , dies , use of machinery , and overhead expenses ) and the cost of the gold medal. .

monies received from the sales of the bronze duplicates are deposited in the united states mint public enterprise fund .

in the house , there are no chamber or committee rules regarding the procedures for gold medal bills .

rule 28 ( a ) ( 7 ) of the house republican conference , however , prohibits the republican leader from scheduling any bill or resolution for consideration under suspension of the rules which directs the secretary of the treasury to strike a congressional gold medal unless the recipient is a natural person ; the recipient has performed an achievement that has an impact on american history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient's field long after the achievement ; the recipient has not received a medal previously for the same or substantially the same achievement ; the recipient is living or , if deceased , has not been deceased for less than 5 years or more than 25 years ; and the achievements were performed in the recipient's field of endeavor , and represent either a lifetime of continuous superior achievements or a single achievement so significant that the recipient is recognized and acclaimed by others in the same field , as evidenced by the recipient having received the highest honors in the field .

the rules of the house republican conference also place an indirect restriction on the number of gold medals that may be awarded annually .

rule 28 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( f ) prohibits the republican leader from scheduling , or requesting to have scheduled , any bill for consideration under suspension of the rules which "directs the secretary of the treasury to strike a congressional gold medal ...[that causes] the total number of measures authorizing the striking of such medals in that congress to substantially exceed the average number of such measures enacted in prior congresses. .

a waiver on the restriction can be granted by the majority of the elected leadership of the conference .

in addition , because the restriction only applies to bills considered under suspension of the rules , it appears that an otherwise - prohibited bill could be brought to the floor under an alternative procedure , such as a special rule .

in the senate , the banking , housing , and urban affairs committee in the 115 th congress requires that at least 67 senators must cosponsor any congressional gold medal bill before being considered by the committee .

although congress has approved legislation stipulating requirements for numerous other awards and decorations , there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of congressional gold medals .

when a congressional gold medal has been deemed appropriate , congress has , by legislative action , provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis .

crs research did not identify any statutory restrictions on the number of gold medals that may be awarded by congress or struck by the u.s. mint .

furthermore , since each award made by congress is itself statutory law , it is unlikely that any statutory limitation on the annual number of congressional gold medals that could be struck would prevent the enactment of legislation authorizing additional medals .

as of this writing , there have been no proposals in the 115 th congress to change the procedures or criteria for awarding congressional gold medals .

during the 109 th congress , however , on january 26 , 2005 , the house , by a vote of 231 to 173 , approved h.r .

54 , the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 , sponsored by representative michael n. castle .

the bill would have amended section 5111 of title 31 of the united states code by adding the following new subsection: ( e ) congressional gold medal standards — ( 1 ) maximum number — beginning on the date of the enactment of the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 , the secretary of the treasury may strike not more than 2 congressional gold medals for presentation pursuant to an act of the congress in any calendar year .

 ( 2 ) program requirements — the secretary may strike congressional gold medals only in accordance with the following requirements: ( a ) recipients — only an individual may be a recipient of a congressional gold medal .

 ( b ) timing — no gold medal may be presented posthumously on behalf of any individual except during the 20-year period beginning 5 years after the death of the individual ( unless the act of congress authorizing the striking of such medal was enacted before the death of such individual ) .

during house debate on h.r .

54 , representative castle emphasized that his measure sought "to maintain the prestige of the medal by limiting the number that may be awarded each year," and to "clarify that recipients are individuals and not groups. .

passage of the measure , he argued , "will ensure the future integrity and true honor of the award .

it is my goal that every recipient , [p]resident , civil rights leader , military hero , inventor , or noted healer , who receives the congressional gold medal will remain part of a unique honor bestowed by the united states congress. .

house financial services committee chairman michael g. oxley characterized the proposed legislation as a "commonsense effort to maintain the prestige of this award. .

by limiting the number of medals that can be struck each year , and by "limiting the recipients to individuals rather than groups , maintains the prestige and honor of receiving a congressional gold medal .

combined with the requirement of a minimum co - sponsorship level of two - thirds of the house is the best way to preserve the integrity of the gold medal. .

representative joseph crowley in opposing the legislation told his house colleagues , "we are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent a problem. .

"who that received this medal in the past," he asked , "was not worthy of it ? .

he also expressed dismay "that the committee on rules refused to allow consideration of a key amendment that would strike a section of bill that only permits the granting of congressional gold medals to individuals. .

although crowley tended "to agree with the notion that distributing what is an exceptional honor to too many individuals could devalue the symbolic worth of a gold medal , there are occasions when more than one person is justified to receive the medal for their honorable actions in tandem with others. .

he continued by emphasizing that had this bill already been law , "congress would not have been able to issue" a congressional gold medal "to the little rock nine," to "president and mrs. reagan," or to "martin luther king and coretta scott king. .

the house adopted by voice vote an amendment to h.r .

54 offered by representative oxley that would make the legislation effective immediately upon passage , instead of the original effective date of january 1 , 2006 .

two amendments offered by representative crowley , both of which were defeated , would have ( 1 ) raised the number of gold medals that could be approved from two per calendar year to six per congress , or an overall increase of two medals per congress ; and ( 2 ) required that there be an equitable distribution of gold medals approved between those sponsored by the majority and minority parties .

later the same day , h.r .

54 was received in the senate , read twice , and referred to the senate committee on banking , housing , and urban affairs .

there was no further action on the bill .
