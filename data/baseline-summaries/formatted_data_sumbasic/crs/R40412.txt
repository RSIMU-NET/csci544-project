the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) was signed into law by president obama on february 17 , 2009 .

the stated purposes of the law include the following: 1 .

to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery .

2 .

to assist those most impacted by the recession .

3 .

to provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health .

4 .

to invest in transportation , environmental protection , and other infrastructure that will provide long - term economic benefits .

5 .

to stabilize state and local government budgets , in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases .

several energy provisions in the law are designed to help address these purposes , including a number of appropriations provisions in division a and several tax incentive provisions in division b .

for appropriation provisions with a specific energy funding figure , house and senate action on h.r .

1 is included in addition to the final arra appropriation .

for appropriation provisions that do not have a specific energy funding figure , only the final arra appropriation is reported .

each of the energy program funding provisions described below includes a brief explanation and the enacted appropriation figure .

most of the energy efficiency and renewable energy spending initiatives in arra are contained under title iv .

the law specifies ( §1603 of division a ) that unless otherwise provided in the act , all appropriations are to be obligated by the end of fiscal year 2010 ( fy2010 ) .

the house ( §1601 ) and senate ( §1101 ) versions of h.r .

1 were identical .

the enacted law ( §1101 ) would extend the placed - in - service date for wind facilities for three years , through the end of 2012 .

for other qualifying resource facilities ( closed - loop biomass , open - loop biomass , geothermal , small irrigation , incremental hydropower , landfill gas , municipal waste , and marine / hydrokinetic ) , the ptc would be extended through the end of 2013 .

the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) estimates the cost at $13.1 billion over 10 years .

the renewable energy industry found that current market conditions have created an uncertain future tax position for potential investors in ptc - supported projects , making financing difficult .

as a temporary alternative to the ptc , the house proposed ( sec .

1602 ) that ptc - eligible facilities that are placed in service in 2009 and 2010 would be allowed to choose a 30% investment tax credit ( itc ) in place of the production credit .

the senate provision ( sec .

1102 ) was identical , except that it would set the same expiration dates as those set for the ptc ( sec .

1101 ) , namely , a four - year period ( through the end of 2012 ) for wind facilities and a five - year period ( through the end of 2013 ) for other renewable energy facilities .

the law follows the senate proposal .

jct estimates the cost at $285 million over 10 years .

[note: subtitle g has a provision regarding a temporary program for grants in place of the ptc and itc programs. .

under previous law , the itc had to be reduced if the qualifying property was also financed with industrial development bonds ( idbs ) or with any other federal , state , or local subsidized financing program .

the house proposed ( sec .

1603b ) to repeal that limit on the itc , allowing businesses and individuals to qualify for the full itc even if the property is financed with idbs or other subsidized financing .

the senate provision ( sec .

1103b ) was identical to the house proposal , as is the law ( §1103b ) .

the jct cost estimate is included as part of the estimated cost of the next provision .

under previous law , businesses were allowed to claim a 30% tax credit for qualified small wind - energy property ( capped at $4,000 ) and individuals were allowed to claim a 30% tax credit for qualified solar water - heating property ( capped at $2,000 ) , qualified small wind - energy property ( capped $4,000 ) , and qualified geothermal heat pumps ( capped at $2,000 ) .

the house ( sec , 1603a ) proposed to repeal all of the dollar caps .

the senate provision ( sec .

1103a ) was identical , as is the law ( §1103a ) .

jct estimates the cost at $604 million over 10 years .

the house provision ( sec .

1611 ) , senate provision ( sec .

1111 ) , and conference provision ( §1111 ) are identical .

for nonprofit entities , $1.6 billion of new clean renewable energy bonds would be authorized to finance facilities that generate electricity from wind , closed - loop biomass , open - loop biomass , geothermal , small irrigation , hydropower , landfill gas , marine renewable , and municipal waste ( trash ) combustion facilities .

of the $1.6 billion authorization for such projects , one - third would be available to state / local / tribal governments , one - third to public power providers , and one - third to electric cooperatives .

jct estimates the cost at $578 million over 10 years .

the organizational structure and purpose of this program , and an initial $800 million authorization , were established by the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-343 , division b , §301 ) .

state and local governments can issue the bonds for a broad range of purposes that include capital expenditures to reduce energy use in publicly owned buildings by at least 20% ; implementing green community programs ; rural development involving electricity production from renewables ; research facilities and grants for the development of cellulosic ethanol or other nonfossil fuels ; technologies to capture and sequester carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel use ; increasing the efficiency of technologies for producing nonfossil fuels ; automobile battery technologies and other technologies to reduce fossil fuel use in transportation , or technologies to reduce energy use in buildings ; mass commuting facilities that reduce energy use ( including pollution reduction for vehicles used for mass commuting ) ; demonstration projects that promote commercialization of green building technology ; conversion of agricultural waste for fuel production ; advanced battery manufacturing technologies ; technologies to reduce peak electricity demand ; technologies that capture and sequester carbon dioxide emitted from fossil - fuel - fired power facilities ; and public education campaigns to promote energy efficiency .

the house provision ( sec .

1612 ) and conference provision ( §1112 ) are identical .

the senate provision ( sec .

1112 ) differed from the house - passed version only in that it did not address private activity bonds .

arra authorizes $2.4 billion of energy conservation bonds ( ecbs ) to finance state , municipal and tribal government programs , greenhouse gas reduction initiatives , and loans and grants to implement green community programs .

jct estimates the cost at $803 million over 10 years .

[note: subtitle g has a provision regarding labor standards for creb and ecb programs. .

eesa ( p.l .

110-343 , division b ) re - established for one year ( 2009 ) a 10% investment tax credit for home energy efficiency improvements , with caps of $50 for fans , $150 for furnaces and boilers , and $300 for shell improvements .

the house - passed arra bill ( sec .

1621 ) , senate - passed bill ( sec .

1121 ) , and enacted law ( §1121 ) have identical provisions .

arra increases the credit to 30% for 2009 and extends it through 2010 .

also , arra eliminates the individual equipment dollar caps and sets a new aggregate cap of $1,500 .

jct estimates the cost at $2.03 billion over three years .

eesa ( p.l .

110-343 , division b ) established a 30% itc for a variety of residential energy efficiency and renewable energy equipment .

under that law , caps were set on the credit for certain equipment and the credit had to be reduced if the qualifying residence received subsidized financing .

the house version of h.r .

1 proposed ( sec .

1622 ) to repeal the several caps and to allow the full itc , even if the property received subsidized financing .

the senate provision ( sec .

1122 ) was identical to the house proposal , as is the law ( §1122 ) .

arra eliminates the caps on residential wind , geothermal , and solar thermal equipment .

it also repeals the subsidized financing reduction for residential solar , geothermal , wind , and fuel cells .

jct estimates the cost at $268 million over nine years .

qualified transportation fringe benefits provided by an employer are excluded from an employee's gross income for income tax purposes and from an employee's wages for payroll tax purposes .

the benefits include parking , transit passes , vanpool benefits , and qualified bicycle commuting reimbursements .

under previous law , up to $230 ( for 2009 ) per month of employer - provided parking was excludable from income .

up to $120 ( for 2009 ) per month of employer - provided transit and vanpool benefits was excludable from gross income .

the senate - passed bill ( sec .

1251 ) proposed to increase the monthly exclusion for employer - provided transit , vanpool , and bicycle commuting benefits to the same level as the exclusion for employer - provided parking .

there was no similar provision in the house bill .

arra ( §1151 ) includes the text of the senate proposal , increasing the benefit for transit , vanpools , and bicycle commuting to $230 per month .

the provision is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 .

jct estimates the cost at $192 million over 10 years .

epact2005 established tax credits for the installation of retail and residential alternative fuel refueling systems .

eligible fuels include ethanol , natural gas , liquefied petroleum gas , and hydrogen .

the retail credit is valued at 30% of the system , up to $30,000 .

for residential systems , the credit is capped at $1,000 .

for calendar years 2009 and 2010 , arra increases the tax credit to 50% for all fuels except hydrogen , and raises the limitations to $50,000 for retail systems and $2,000 for residential systems .

for hydrogen , the 30% credit is maintained , but the credit limit is raised to $200,000 .

the jct cost estimate is included as part of the estimated cost of the next provision .

eesa ( p.l .

110-343 ) established a tax credit for the purchase of new plug - in vehicles ( plug - in hybrids and pure electric vehicles ) .

the credit is based on the battery capacity of the vehicle , and is capped at $7,500 for light - duty vehicles and up to $15,000 for the heaviest vehicles .

when total u.s. sales of vehicles eligible for the credit reaches 250,000 , the credit begins to phase out .

arra modifies the existing tax credit to cap the per - vehicle credit at $7,500 for light - duty vehicles and heavy - duty vehicles up to 14,000 pounds gross weight .

it also replaces the 250,000 total vehicle limit for phase - out of the credit with a 200,000 per - manufacturer limit .

further , arra eliminates the credit for heavier vehicles ( after 2009 ) , and establishes a credit of up to $2,500 for low - speed four - wheeled vehicles , as well as two - and three - wheeled electric vehicles .

it also establishes a credit of up to $4,000 for the conversion of an existing vehicle to battery power .

arra also allows taxpayers otherwise subject to the alternative minimum tax ( amt ) to claim plug - in credit ( as well as other alternative fuel and advanced vehicle credits ) .

jct estimates the cost at $2.0 billion over 10 years .

the senate bill ( sec .

1302 ) proposed to establish a new 30% percent itc to support the development of facilities that manufacture "advanced energy property. .

there was no similar provision in the house - passed bill .

the enacted law ( §1302 ) establishes a credit that can be used to re - equip , expand , or establish a facility that is designed to manufacture equipment that is used to produce renewable energy ( solar , wind geothermal , and other ) , fuel cells , microturbines , energy storage systems for electric / hybrid vehicles , certain electric grid equipment , renewable fuels property , energy efficiency technologies , smart grid equipment , plug - in hybrid vehicles , and equipment to capture and sequester carbon dioxide .

arra allows up to $2.3 billion in credits to be allocated .

jct estimates the cost at $1.6 billion over 10 years .

the renewable energy industry found that current market conditions have created an uncertain future tax position for potential investors in itc - supported projects , in addition to ptc - supported projects , making financing difficult .

as an additional temporary alternative , the house proposed ( sec .

1721 ) that projects eligible for the ptc or itc could substitute a grant worth up to 30% of the project cost .

doe would administer the grant program , which would be in place only for tax years 2009 and 2010 .

also , certain existing dollar caps set for the tax credits , such as the caps for fuel cells and microturbines , would have remained in place for the grants .

a similar proposal in the senate did not get incorporated into the senate - passed version of h.r .

1 .

it differed from the house provision in that it would be administered by the department of the treasury and it would require that applicants "share ownership" with the department by providing stock warrants , debt instruments , or other measures that might be required by the department .

the enacted provision ( §1603 ) follows the house proposal , except that treasury will administer the program , not doe .

the law appropriates "such sums as may be necessary" and it terminates on september 30 , 2011 .

jct estimates the cost at $5 million over 10 years .

the house ( sec .

1701 ) and senate ( sec .

1901 ) proposed , and the law ( §1601 ) requires , that living wage provisions be applied to projects financed by clean renewable energy bonds ( crebs ) and energy conservation bonds ( ecbs ) .
