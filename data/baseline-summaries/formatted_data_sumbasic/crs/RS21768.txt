rs21768 - - satellite television: reauthorization of the satellite home viewer improvement act ( shvia ) - - background and key issues updated january 5 , 200 .

the three most common methods by which consumers receive television signals are broadcast , cable , and direct broadcast satellite ( dbs ) .

broadcast television is free to consumers,who receive the signals via over - the - air ( rooftop or "rabbit ear" ) antennas .

cable and dbs compete in themultichannel video programming distribution ( mvpd ) marketplace , whereproviders offer packages of video ( and sometimes audio ) programming for a monthly fee .

according to the federalcommunications commission ( fcc ) , there are 107 milliontelevision households in the united states .

 ( 1 ) of those,88% subscribe to an mvpd service .

cable tv serves 75% of mvpd subscribers , while dbs serves 22% .

theremainder useother mvpd services that are described in the fcc report .

cable and satellite offer greater programming choices,and sometimes better signal quality , than broadcast television , but canbe costly .

congress has fostered competition in the mvpd marketplace , partially in an attempt to keep cable tvrates in check .

two major companies offer dbs services today:directv ( a subsidiary of news corp. ) and echostar , which markets its service as dish tv .

another company,rainbow dbs ( a subsidiary of cablevision ) offers a comparatively smallnumber of satellite channels through a service called voom .

the satellite home viewer improvement act .

the 1999 satellite home viewer improvement act ( shvia ) ( 2 ) extended andexpandedupon provisions of the 1988 satellite home viewer act ( shva ) , as amended in 1994 .

in passing shva andshvia ( as well as the 1984 and 1992 cable acts ( 3 ) ) , congress hasattempted to balance the interests of the broadcast , satellite , and cable industries , with the goal of ensuring that asmany households as possible have access to free local televisionprogramming , while expanding consumer choices in programming and service providers .

shva , enacted in the early days of satellite television , allowed satellite companies to retransmit broadcast network and superstation programming only to households that could notreceive "viewable" signals via over - the - air antennas because they are too distant from the transmitters , or in areaswhere tv signals are blocked by buildings or terrain ( formally called"unserved households" ) .

the limitation was designed to protect the nationwide system of broadcast networkaffiliates , which depend on advertising revenue based on their number ofviewers .

the goal is to preserve "localism," where consumers can watch local news , weather , andcommunity - oriented programs .

the availability of local programming is largelydependent on network affiliates , which in turn are dependent on viewers .

under shva , satellite companies couldretransmit broadcast network programming only to unservedhouseholds , so the majority of viewers would watch their local affiliate .

but the small percentage of consumers inunserved households could also receive network programs , eventhough they came from an "out - of - market" affiliate .

these out - of market signals are called "distant networksignals. .

shva created a five - year "compulsory copyright license" ( 4 ) whereby satellite companies may retransmit distant network signals to unserved households withoutpermission from thecopyright owners , and the government sets the price the satellite companies pay as copyright royalties .

the satellitecompanies pay the royalties to the copyright office of the library ofcongress , which passes them on to the copyright owners .

a similar compulsory copyright license was given tocable companies in 1976 , although the cable license is permanent .

thesatellite distant network signal license is codified in �119 of the copyright act ( title 17 u.s.c .

 ) , and was renewedfor another five years in 1994 .

it was extended for a further five yearsin shvia , and is now set to expire on december 31 , 2004 .

shvia also exempts satellite companies from therequirement to obtain retransmission consent from broadcasters torebroadcast distant network signals , and that provision expires on the same date .

shvia significantly expanded upon shva by allowing satellite companies to retransmit local broadcast network programming back into the same market area where it originated - - called "local - into - local" service .

the law permits , but does not require , satellite companies to offer local - into - localservice .

shvia created a royalty - free compulsory copyright licensefor local - into - local satellite signals that is codified in �122 of the copyright act , and is permanent , like the cablelicense .

according to their websites , on november 30 , 2004 , echostaroffered local - into - local in 160 of the 210 designated market areas ( dmas ) ( 5 ) in the country , and directv offered it in 130 dmas .

under shvia , unservedhouseholds could receivedistant network signals even if local - into - local service is offered in their area .

local versus distant network signals .

the distinction between local and distant network signals is important for understandingshvia .

a local signal is received within a broadcast network television affiliate's local market area .

a distantnetwork signal is from elsewhere in the country .

for example , if aconsumer lives in denver and receives a signal from a denver network affiliate , that is a local signal .

if a consumerlives in west virginia and receives a signal from that denvernetwork affiliate via satellite , it is a distant network signal .

eligibility for distant network signals - - "white areas," and "grade b" signals .

determining which consumers are eligible toreceive distant network signals via satellite is complicated and is discussed is more detail in crs report rs20425 .

generally , only consumers living in unserved households - - wherebroadcast television reception is extremely poor or non - existent - - may receive distant network signals via satellite .

unserved households , colloquially known as "white areas," aredefined based on the fcc's "grade b" signal intensity standard .

congress mandated in shva that the grade bstandard be used for this purpose , and , in shvia , directed the fcc toreview whether the grade b standard still should be used .

in 2000 , the fcc concluded that it should .

 ( 6 ) computer models are used to mathematically predictwhich households canreceive at least a grade b signal ; if they cannot , they are unserved for purposes of shvia .

in 1999 , the fccadopted an improved model , called the individual location longely - rice ( illr ) , to predict signal intensity at specific households , instead of in a general area .

some satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers who were not eligible to receive them , leading to court challenges by the networks to try to force the satellitecompanies to obey the law .

one landmark case was a 1998 ruling by a miami judge [ cbs broadcasting v. primetime 24 joint venture , 48 f. supp.2d 1342 ( s.d.fla .

1998 ) ]under which over 2 million consumers reportedly had , or were scheduled to have , distant network signals terminatedby their satellite companies .

that action was pending whencongress debated shvia .

congress "grandfathered" those consumers who were receiving distant network signalsillegally if they could not receive a grade a signal .

for newsubscribers , the original rules apply .

exceptions were made for recreational vehicles , commercial trucks , andconsumers using "c - band" satellite dishes .

 ( 7 ) insummary , under shvia,the following consumers could receive distant network signals until december 31 , 2004: if they do not receive a signal of grade b intensity from the local affiliate of a particular network ; if their satellite dish is installed on an rv or commercial truck , or if they had been receiving distant network signals illegally and those signals were terminated orscheduled to be terminated under the 1998 miami court ruling , and they do not receive a signal of grade a intensity from the local affiliate of the network ( "grandfatheredsubscribers" ) .

consumers using c - band dishes are not subject to the five - year limitation .

they may receive distant network signals they were receiving before october 31 , 1999 indefinitely.consumers who believe they cannot receive a grade b signal , despite predictive models showing that they can , mayrequest a waiver ( see crs report rs20425 for more information onthe waiver process ) .

the issue of who may receive distant network signals via satellite remains controversial even with the advent of local - into - local service .

first , distant network signals primarily serveconsumers in the most rural parts of the country who also are likely to be in the dmas that do not yet receivelocal - into - local service from the dbs providers .

second , some consumerswant distant network signals not because of reception problems with their own local signals , but because they wantgreater programming choices , or to watch network programmingairing at different times in the various u.s. time zones .

on november 20 , 2004 , congress passed the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act ( shvera ) , also known as the william j .

"billy" tauzin satellite televisionact , as title ix , division j , of the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act ( h.r .

4818 , p.l .

108-447 ) .

thatfinal version was a compromise between h.r .

4518 , which passed the house on october 6 , 2004 , and legislation that was pending in the senate .

h.r .

4518 ( l. smith ) had been reported from the house judiciarycommittee ( h.rept .

108-660 ) on september 7 , 2004 .

as passed , it incorporated many of the provisions of h.r .

4501 ( upton ) , which was reported from the house energyand commerce committee on july 22 ( h.rept .

108-634 ) .

in the senate , s. 2013 ( hatch ) was reported,amended , from senate judiciary ( no written report ) on june 17 , and s. 2644 ( ensign / mccain ) was reported , amended , from the senate commerce committee ( s.rept .

108-427 ) on december 7 .

neither bill reached the senate floor .

extension of compulsory copyright license .

the compulsory copyright license was the chief impetus behind consideration ofshvera because it was due to expire on december 31 , 2004 .

 ( 8 ) certain satellite subscribers ( see bulleted list above ) would lose access to distant network signalsif the license was notextended .

copyright owners , often represented by the motion picture association of america ( mpaa ) , object tothe compulsory licenses .

they argue that the cable and satellitecompanies should be required to negotiate copyright royalties like everyone else .

prices for the cable and satellitecompulsory licenses are set by different methods and on differentcycles .

prices for the satellite license had last been set in 1997 .

as required by law , the copyright office , througha copyright arbitration royalty panel ( carp ) , set a price based on"fair market value": 27 cents per subscriber per year for both distant network and superstation signals .

the satellitecompanies objected because the prices were a significant increase,and much higher than what cable companies pay ( see crs report 98-140 ( pdf ) ) .

in shvia , congress rolled the ratesback by 45% for distant network signals , and 30% for superstationsignals .

the mpaa argued that if the distant network signal license was extended , the royalty rates should be substantially increased and adjusted annually .

the copyright office wanted paritybetween the cable and satellite licenses and recommended that the satellite distant network signal license be renewedfor five more years while both licenses were reexamined .

thesatellite broadcasting and communications association ( sbca ) , representing the dbs companies , wanted thedistant network signal license made permanent .

the nationalassociation of broadcasters ( nab ) wanted the distant network signal license extended only for five years , andlimited to areas where local - into - local is not available .

the final versionof shvera extended the license for another five years , and allowed the parties to reach a voluntary agreement onthe royalty rate .

if they cannot reach agreement , the rate is to be set bya carp process .

shvera also requires most subscribers to choose between local - into - local service or distantnetwork signals if local - into - local is available in their area .

generally,existing subscribers who are currently receiving distant network signals because they live in white areas ( not thosewho were grandfathered in shvia ) may continue to receive bothdistant and local - into - local signals .

other existing subscribers must choose one or the other .

new subscribers maynot receive distant network signals once local - into - local is availablein their area .

"digital white areas" .

to date , white areas ( or unserved households ) have been defined based on the transmission of analogtelevision signals .

the broadcast television industry , however , is transitioning from analog to digital signals , andeventually will cease transmitting analog signals ( see crs report rl31260 ) .

sbca and the digital transition coalition ( dtc ) want "digital white areas" to be defined , similar tothe existing analog white areas , where satellite companies would beallowed to provide distant digital network signals to subscribers unable to receive local network digital signalsterrestrially .

sbca and the dtc argue that allowing satellite tvcompanies to provide digital distant network signals to unserved households would spur the broadcasters to convertto digital more quickly .

the nab called sbca's proposal "a recipefor mischief," disputing the assessment that broadcasters are moving slowly on digital tv .

the final version ofshvera contains complex wording about digital white areas , and bothsides declared victory .

the details are explained in crs report rs21990 ( pdf ) .

essentially , subscribers who areunserved for purposes of analog tv signals , and meet certain conditionsregarding the availability of analog or digital local - into - local service , will also be considered unserved for purposesof digital tv signals and receive distant digital signals .

othersatellite tv subscribers may receive distant digital signals only under very narrow circumstances that appear tominimize the number of eligible households .

local - into - local issues: more consumer choices ( including "significantly viewed" stations ) , and echostar's "two - dish" policy .

as discussed earlier , local - into - local allows satellite companies to retransmit a local station's signal back into thedma from which it originated .

the use of dmas to define the areasinto which a particular signal can be retransmitted is mandated by shvia .

however , dmas often cross stateborders , so a consumer in one state may receive programming from anotherstate when subscribing to local - into - local service .

also , consumers within a state that might have only one networktv station may not be eligible to receive that station's signalbecause , based on dma boundaries , it is a distant network signal that the consumer is ineligible to receive ( becausethe consumer can receive a grade b signal from a station in aneighboring state ) .

shvera permits additional stations to be retransmitted to subscribers in certain states becauseof such factors .

subscribers in new hampshire are allowed toreceive via satellite signals from the one network station licensed in that state .

subscribers in vermont are allowedto receive the signals of any network station licensed in that state .

subscribers in four oregon counties ( umatilla , grant , malheur , and wallowa ) that are in dmas principallycomposed of counties in a neighboring state are allowed to receive a signalfrom any network station licensed in oregon .

subscribers in two adjacent mississippi counties ( wilkinson andamite ) that are in a dma composed primarily of counties in another stateare allowed to receive any network station from the state capital ( jackson ) .

shvera also allows satellitecompanies to retransmit out - of - market " significantly viewed " stations .

asexplained in crs report rl32641 ( p. 11 ) , to be "significantly viewed," stations must meet threshold viewershiplevels based on the number of over - the - air viewers .

for networkstations , a market share of at least 3% of total weekly viewing hours and a net weekly circulation of 25% ; forindependent stations , 2% of total weekly viewing hours and a net weeklycirculation of 5% .

another issue was echostar's policy that , in some areas , consumers must obtain a second satellite dish to receive all their local programs .

that is because echostar uses satellites indifferent orbital locations to transmit the programming and separate antennas are needed to point toward thedifferent satellites .

the nab and others complained that the practice isdiscriminatory because the channels for which the second dish is needed are primarily religious or foreign languagestations .

echostar responded that there is no cost for the second dish,the channels all appear on the tv program guide , and no special steps must be taken by the consumer to access thoseprograms once the second dish is installed .

nonetheless , shverarequires satellite companies to offer all local channels on a single dish within 18 months of the law's enactment ( except that digital tv service signals and non - digital tv service signalsmay be on separate dishes ) .
