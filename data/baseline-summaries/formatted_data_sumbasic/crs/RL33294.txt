in a review of the fy2006 doe budget , the american academy for the advancement ofscience ( aaas ) examined earmarks for doe energy research and development ( r&d ) programsand found that ... earmarks eat up whatever increases there are for mostenergy programs and cut deeply into core r&d programs .

energy r&d earmarks total $266 millionin 2006 , more than double the previous record from last year , and make up one out of every fiver&d dollars .

but they are especially concentrated in some areas , including biomass r&d wherethey make up more than 50% of total program funds , hydrogen ( 27% ) , and wind energy ( 33% ) , ratiosfar higher than in previous years .

as a result , there will be enormous cuts to competitively awardedr&d grants in those areas .

 ( 8 ) table 1 , below , shows the funding trends for earmarks under programs in doe's office ofenergy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) and doe's office of electricity delivery andenergy reliability ( oe ) .

these trends are illustrated in figure 1 , at the end of this report .

the tableshows that eere funding earmarks have more than tripled , from $46.0 million in fy2003 to $159.0million in fy2006 .

table 1: earmark funding trends for eere andoe ( $ millions ) sources: doe budget requests fy2005 , fy2006 , and fy2007 and h. rept .

for fy2006 , table 3 ( below ) shows a $30.7 million increase in renewable energy r&dearmarks , including increases of $16.4 million for biomass & biorefinery , $8.3 million for windenergy , and $4.1 million for solar energy .

of the $42.5 million increase for energy efficiency r&dearmarks , nearly half ( $20.3 million ) was for vehicle technologies .

also , table 3 shows a $28.8million increase for electricity r&d earmarks under the office of electricity ( oe ) .

do the eere earmarks seriously weaken r&d programs , as some opponentscontend , or do they merely provide a more equitable , although perhaps more decentralized,distribution of r&d funding , as some proponents argue ? .

if renewable energy earmarks under eere continue at the same or higherlevels in fy2007 , would they lead to new cuts in staff positions at nrel ? .

if congress were to approve the administration's requested increases for theaei renewable energy initiatives , would earmarks continued at the same or higher levels act to diluteor otherwise erase some of the technological stimulation that the aei aims to generate for itshydrogen , biomass / biorefinery , and solar energy goals ? .
