in a criminal law context , bail is most often thought of as the posting of security to ensure the presence of an accused at subsequent judicial proceedings — that is , "[t]o obtain the release of ( oneself or another ) by providing security for future appearance. .

the term itself is less frequently used now , however , due in part to the practice of release on personal recognizance , which consists of permitting an individual to pledge his word , rather than his property , for his future appearance .

moreover , today , an individual's release pending subsequent criminal proceedings is often predicated on conditions other than , or in addition to , the posting of an appearance bond , secured or unsecured .

as a consequence , rather than speaking of bail , existing federal law refers to release or detention pending trial , to release or detention pending sentencing or appeal , and to release or detention of a material witness .

this report provides an overview of federal law in each of these areas , as well as in the area of extradition from the united states to another country .

american bail law has its origins in england , where it was said that "the right to be bailed ... is as old as the law of england itself. .

blackstone wrote that "by the ancient common law , before and since the conquest , all felonies were bailable , till murder was excepted by statute: so that persons might be admitted to bail before conviction almost in every case. .

in the beginning , however , officials enjoyed considerable discretion over the circumstances under which bail might be granted or denied .

the first statute of westminister of 1275 limited that discretion when it listed the criminal offenses which were bailable and those which were not .

yet , if an individual was imprisoned without charge , the question of whether the crime charged was bailable never arose .

if an individual was imprisoned without bail and his jailer failed to make a timely return on his writ of habeas corpus , the right to bail would become meaningless .

 ( a writ of habeas corpus instructed the sheriff or other custodian to whom it was addressed to return to the court which issued the writ and to justify the prisoner's detention. ) .

the same was true if an individual was imprisoned and his bail set at an exorbitant amount .

at the dawn of the american colonial period , parliament had occasion to visit each of these concerns .

first in the petition of right , it precluded pretrial imprisonment without a criminal charge and confirmed the availability of habeas corpus relief for those who were held without charge .

then in the habeas corpus act of 1679 , it imposed a three - day deadline for return on a habeas writ , thus eliminating a custodian's use of delay to frustrate a pretrial prisoner's right to bail .

finally , in the bill of rights of 1689 , it prohibited excessive bail .

in this country , the right to bail appears to have been widely recognized during the colonial period and in the early years of the republic .

the 1641 massachusetts body of liberties included a right to bail section: no mans person shall be restrained or imprisoned by any authority whatsoever , before the law hath sentenced him thereto , if he can put in sufficient securitie , bayle or mainprise , for his appearance , and good behaviour in the meane time , unless it be in crimes capitall , and contempts in open court , and in such cases where some expresse act of [the general] court doth allow it .

the u.s. bill of rights and many of the constitutions of the original states featured excessive bail clauses , and less often , right to bail clauses .

the continental congress made a right to bail part of the northwest ordinance ( "... all persons shall be bailable , unless for capital offences , where the proof shall be evident , or the presumption great ..." ) , and the first congress added a similar clause to the first judiciary act ( "and upon all arrests in criminal cases , bail shall be admitted , except where the punishment may be death , in which cases it shall not be admitted but by the supreme or a circuit court , or by justice of the supreme court , or a judge of a district court , who shall exercise this discretion thereto , regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence , and of the evidence , and usage of law ..." ) .

the revised statutes of 1878 mirrored the provisions of the judiciary act .

the revised statutes included additional provisions relating to bail for habeas petitioners , and the arrest and subsequent proceedings concerning individuals previously admitted to bail .

these continued in place with little substantive revision until the bail reform act of 1966 .

in the mid - 1960s , the state of federal bail troubled congress for two reasons .

first , congress believed that , in spite of the presumption of innocence , an accused's prospects of pretrial release turned primarily on his wealth .

"every witness before the subcommittees agreed that , at least in noncapital cases , the principal purpose of bail is to assure that the accused will appear in court for his trial .

there is no doubt , however , that each year thousands of citizens accused of crimes are confined before their innocence or guilt has been determined by a court of law , not because there is any substantial doubt that they will appear for trial but merely because they cannot afford money bail .

there is little disagreement that this system is indefensible. .

it further believed that a poor defendant suffered considerable disadvantages as a consequence .

"there was widespread agreement among witnesses that the accused who is unable to post bond , and consequently is held in pretrial detention , is severely handicapped in preparing his defense .

he cannot locate witnesses , cannot consult his lawyer in private , and enters the courtroom — not in the company of an attorney — but from a cell block in the company of a marshal .

furthermore , being in detention , he is often unable to retain his job and support his family , and is made to suffer the public stigma of incarceration even though he may later be found not guilty. .

second , it feared that the existing bail system permit had no real means of holding those charged with a crime whose release would pose a danger to the community or someone in the community .

congress addressed the first concern in the bail reform act of 1966 , but was unable to reach consensus on the second , preventive detention , until several years later .

"this legislation does not deal with the problem of the prevention detention of the accused because of the possibility that his liberty might endanger the public , either because of the possibility of the commission of further acts of violence by the accused during the pretrial period , or because of the fact that he is at large might result in the intimidation of witnesses or the destruction of evidence.... obviously , the problem of preventive detention is closely related to the problem of bail reform .

a solution goes beyond the scope of the present proposal and involves many difficult and complex problems which require deep study and analysis .

the present problem of reform of existing bail procedures demands an immediate solution .

it should not be delayed by consideration of the question of preventive detention. .

the 1966 bail reform act amended federal law to require the pretrial release of an individual charged with a noncapital federal offense upon personal recognizance or an unsecured appearance bond , unless the court determined they were likely to be insufficient to assure the appearance of the accused at trial .

the court was to assess the risk of flight by considering the nature and circumstances of the offense charged , the weight of the evidence against the accused , the accused's family ties , employment , financial resources , character and mental condition , the length of his residence in the community , his record of convictions , and his record of appearance at court proceedings or of flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at court proceedings .

should the court conclude that an accused would otherwise pose a risk of flight , it was to impose the least restrictive of a series of conditions that included first , third - party custody ; then , travel and associational limitations ; then , cash or secured bail ; and , finally , nighttime incarceration .

the accused was given an explicit right to appeal the imposition of any such conditions .

release was also required in capital cases and following conviction , unless the court concluded that no condition or series of conditions could overcome the risk of flight or danger to the community posed by the defendant .

for several years thereafter , debate continued over the wisdom and constitutionality of pretrial preventive detention in noncapital cases .

some found preventive detention incompatible with the right to bail they considered implicit in either the eighth amendment's excessive bail clause or the fifth amendment's due process clause or in both .

others felt the right was subject to reasonable legislative regulation .

history seemed to provide support for either view .

on one hand , the excessive bail clause in the english bill of rights was clearly enacted to prevent judges from frustrating the right to bail by requiring excessive bail .

 ( "unfortunately , the [habeas corpus] act closed one loophole and opened another .

the acknowledgment of discretion in clause iii allowed bail to be set at prohibitively high amounts... .

the bill of rights corrected the practice of setting excessive bail in criminal cases ..." ) .

moreover , until the mid - 20 th century , congress and the vast majority of state constitutions had consistently recognized a right to bail in noncapital cases save only when the accused posed a risk of flight .

on the other hand , both the english and the federal right to bail had always been a matter of statute — that is , a matter subject to reasonable legislative regulation .

dicta in various supreme court cases seemed equally conflicted .

in stack v. boyle , the court noted that "this traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense , and serves to prevent the infliction of punishment prior to conviction... .

unless this right to bail before trial is preserved , the presumption of innocence , secured only after centuries of struggle , would lose its meaning. .

yet shortly thereafter it observed in carlson v. landon that the [excessive] bail clause was lifted with slight changes from the english bill of rights act .

in england that clause has never been thought to accord a right to bail in all cases , but merely to provide that bail shall not be excessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail .

when this clause was carried over into our bill of rights , nothing was said that indicated any different concept .

the eighth amendment has not prevented congress from defining the classes of cases in which bail shall be allowed in this country .

thus in criminal cases bail is not compulsory where the punishment may be death .

indeed , the very language of the amendment fails to say all arrests must be bailable .

in 1984 , congress amended federal bail law to permit the use of preventive detention in certain limited instances when the accused posed a danger to the public or particular members of the public .

three years later , the supreme court in salerno held that the legislation offended neither the eighth amendment's excessive bail clause nor the fifth amendment's due process clause: in our society liberty is the norm , and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception .

we hold that the provisions for pretrial detention in the bail reform act of 1984 fall within that carefully limited exception .

the act authorizes the detention prior to trial of arrestees charged with serious felonies who are found after an adversary hearing to pose a threat to the safety of individuals or to the community which no condition of release can dispel .

the numerous procedural safeguards detailed above must attend this adversary hearing .

we are unwilling to say that this congressional determination , based as it is upon that primary concern of every government — a concern for the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens — on its face violates either the due process clause of the fifth amendment or the excessive bail clause of the eighth amendment .

the court explained that the regulatory character of the regime immunized it from substantive due process assault: unless congress expressly intended to impose punitive restrictions , the punitive / regulatory distinction turns on whether an alternative purpose to which the restriction may rationally be connected is assignable for it and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned to it .

we conclude that the detention imposed by the act falls on the regulatory side of the dichotomy .

the legislative history ... indicates that congress did not formulate the pretrial detention provisions as punishment for dangerous individuals .

congress instead perceived pretrial detention as a potential solution to a pressing societal problem .

there is no doubt that preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal .

nor are the incidents of pretrial detention excessive in relation to the regulatory goal congress sought to achieve .

its tailored procedural safeguards shielded it from procedural due process ( "finally , we may dispose briefly of respondents' facial challenge to the procedures of the bail reform act.... we think [its] extensive safeguards sufficient to repel a facial challenge" ) , and excessive bail challenges ( "nothing in the text of the bail clause limits permissible government considerations solely to questions of flight .

the only arguable substantive limitation of the bail clause is that the government's proposed conditions of release or detention not be excessive in light of the perceived evil.... we believe that when congress has mandated detention on the basis of a compelling interest other than prevention of flight , as it has here , the eighth amendment does not require release on bail" ) .

three justices — marshall , brennan , and stevens — found the majority's arguments unpersuasive .

the basic structure of federal bail law is as the 1984 bail reform act left it , although congress has made a number of adjustments in the years since , most notably relating to the rebuttable presumption of flight and dangerousness .

federal law treats bail following conviction but prior to sentencing in one of three ways depending upon the crime of conviction .

first , a defendant may not be detained prior to sentencing for an offense for which the u.s .

sentencing guidelines do not recommend a sentence of imprisonment .

second , when the defendant has been convicted of a capital offense , a 10-year federal crime of terrorism , a 10-year controlled substance offense , a crime of violence , or a violation of 18 u.s.c .

§1591 ( commercial sex trafficking ) , the defendant must be detained unless the court finds that the defendant is not likely to flee or pose a safety concern and either that a motion for acquittal or a new trial is likely to be granted , or that the prosecution has recommended no sentence of imprisonment be imposed , or that exceptional reasons exist for granting bail .

third , in any other case , the defendant must be detained , unless the court concludes that the defendant is unlikely to flee or pose a safety concern if released conditionally or on his own recognizance .

when a defendant appeals following conviction , the judge or magistrate may release him on condition or recognizance , if the judicial official is convinced that the defendant poses neither a flight risk nor a safety concern and that his appeal raises substantial questions that offer the prospect of success .

"a question is substantial if the defendant can demonstrate that it is 'fairly debatable' or is 'debatable among jurists of reason.' .

an additional requirement applies when the defendant has been sentenced to prison upon conviction for a capital offense , a 10-year federal crime of terrorism , a 10-year controlled substance offense , or a crime of violence .

in such cases , bail is available only under exceptional circumstances .

the circumstances considered exceptional have variously been described as uncommon , unusual , unique , and rare .

when the government alone appeals , the pretrial bail provisions of section 3142 apply , unless the government is simply appealing the sentence imposed .

when the government appeals the sentence imposed , the defendant must be detained if he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment ; otherwise , section 3142 applies .

a number of consequences flow from an individual's failure to appear or to honor the conditions imposed upon his release .

he may be prosecuted for contempt of court ; he may be prosecuted separately for failure to appear ; his release order may be revoked or amended ; security pledged for his compliance may be forfeited ; he may be subject to arrest by his surety ; and he may prosecuted for any crimes that constituted a violation of his bail conditions .

the u.s .

probation and pretrial service office conducts preliminary investigations and otherwise assists the courts in their administration of federal bail law .

its officers enjoy statutory authority to provide judges and magistrates with information relevant to initial bail determinations ; prepare reports relevant for the review of release and detention orders ; supervise bailees released into its custody ; operate halfway houses , treatment facilities , and the like for those released on bail ; inform the court and prosecutors of release order violations ; advise the court on the availability of third - party custodians ; help bailees secure employment , medical , legal , and social services ; prepare reports on supervision of pretrial detainees ; prepare reports on the bail system ; prepare pretrial diversion reports for prosecutors ; contract for the performance of its responsibilities ; supervise and report on prisoners conditionally released following hospitalization for mental disease or defect ; carry firearms ; provide services for juveniles ; and perform other functions assigned to it by the bail laws .

federal law authorizes the arrest and detention or bail of individuals with evidence material to the prosecution of a federal offense .

with limited variations , federal bail laws apply to material witnesses arrested under section 3144 .

thus , arrested material witnesses are entitled to the assistance of counsel during bail proceedings and to the appointment of an attorney when they are unable to retain private counsel .

release is generally favored ; if not , release with conditions or limitations is preferred , and finally as a last option detention is permitted .

an accused is released on his word ( personal recognizance ) or bond unless the court finds such assurances insufficient to guarantee his subsequent appearance or to ensure public or individual safety .

a material witness , however , need only satisfy the appearance standard .

a material witness who is unable to do so is released under such conditions or limitations as the court finds adequate to ensure his later appearance to testify .

if neither word nor bond nor conditions will suffice , the witness may be detained .

the factors a court may consider in determining whether a material witness is likely to remain available include his deposition , character , health , and community ties .

federal bail laws make no mention of bail in extradition cases .

the federal courts instead adhere to the doctrine announced by the supreme court over a century ago that "bail should not ordinarily be granted in cases of foreign extradition" except under "special circumstances. .

the doctrine has withstood constitutional challenge .

there is no precise definition of what constitutes "special circumstances" ; the category is reserved for those extraordinary characteristics of a case which the court feels merit the designation .

in the past , they have included , singularly or in some combination , factors such as unusual delays prior to extradition ; the likelihood that extradition may not be granted ; the likelihood that the individual will prevail following extradition ; the ill health of the individual ; the availability of bail under the laws of both countries for the offense for which extradition was sought ; the adverse impact on third parties of a refusal to grant bail ; the fact that the individual was a minor ; religious prerogatives lost if bail was not granted ; and lack of urgency to prosecute previously evidenced by the requesting nation .

on the other hand , a partial list of what have not been found to be "special circumstances" includes a significant bond and an unblemished record ; requesting country would grant release on bail ; united states would grant bail for comparable offense ; relatively short delay between the alleged offense and the request for extradition ; length of delay measured against the seriousness of the alleged offense ; anticipation of lengthy extradition proceedings ; need for dependents' financial and emotional support ; need to confer with counsel ; prison conditions ; defendant's health ; defendant being likely to prevail in foreign trial ; the defendant being a highly trained doctor available to administer to the public ; character evidence ; need to consult with counsel and assist in gathering evidence to support defense ; release of defendant's brother ; and advanced age or infirmity .

in addition , the individual must establish that if released he will not flee or pose a danger and may be made subject to whatever relevant conditions the court deems to impose .
