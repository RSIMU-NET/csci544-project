c ompanies that provide cable television service ( cable operators ) are subject to regulation at the federal , state , and local levels .

under the communications act of 1934 ( communications act ) , as amended , the federal communications commission ( fcc or commission ) exercises regulatory authority over various operational aspects of cable serviceâsuch as technical standards governing signal quality , ownership restrictions , and requirements for carrying local broadcast stations .

at the same time , a cable operator must obtain a "franchise" from the relevant state or local franchising authorities for the region in which it seeks to provide cable services .

franchising authorities often require cable operators to meet certain requirements , provide certain services , and pay fees as a condition of their franchise .

as a result , the franchising process is an important component of cable regulation .

in the early history of cable regulation , the fcc did not interfere with franchising authority operations , opting instead for a system of "deliberately structured dualism. .

the cable communications policy act of 1984 ( cable act ) codified this dualist structure by adding title vi to the communications act .

title vi requires cable operators to obtain franchises from state or local franchising authorities and permits these authorities to continue to condition the award of franchises on an operator's agreement to satisfy various requirements .

however , title vi also subjects franchising authorities to a number of important statutory limitations .

for instance , franchising authorities may not charge franchise fees greater than 5% of a cable operator's gross annual revenue and may not "unreasonably refuse" to award a franchise .

as explained below , the fcc issued a series of orders restricting the requirements and costs that franchising authorities may impose on cable operators .

the fcc issued its first such order in 2007 ( first order ) after gathering evidence suggesting that some franchising authorities were imposing burdensome requirements on new entrants to the cable market .

the first order clarified when practices by franchising authorities , such as failing to make a final decision on franchise applications within time frames specified in the order , amount to an "unreasonabl[e] refus[al]" to award a franchise in violation of the cable act .

the first order also provided guidance on which costs count toward the 5% franchise fee cap , and it maintained that franchising authorities could not refuse to grant a franchise based on issues related to non - cable services or facilities .

the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit ( sixth circuit ) upheld the first order in its 2008 decision in alliance for community media v. fcc .

shortly after issuing the first order , the fcc adopted another order ( second order ) , extending the first order's rulings to incumbent cable operators as well as new entrants .

in a later order responding to petitions for reconsideration ( reconsideration order ) , the fcc affirmed the second order's findings and further clarified that "in - kind" ( i.e. , noncash ) payments exacted by franchising authorities , even if related to the provision of cable service , generally count toward the maximum 5% franchise fee .

in 2017 , the sixth circuit reviewed aspects of the second order and reconsideration order in its decision in montgomery county v. fcc , upholding some rules and vacating others .

in response , the fcc adopted a new order on august 1 , 2019 ( third order ) .

the third order seeks to address the defects identified by the sixth circuit by clarifying the commission's reasoning for counting cable - related , in - kind payments toward the 5% franchise fee cap and for applying the first order's rulings to incumbent cable operators .

the third order also explicitly asserts the cable act's preemption of state and local laws to the extent they impose fees or other requirements on cable operators who provide non - cable service , such as broadband internet , over public rights - of - way .

some municipalities have criticized this order for , among other things , hampering their ability to control public rights - of - way and reducing their ability to ensure the availability of public , educational , and government ( peg ) programming in their communities .

several cities have filed legal challenges to the order that are currently before the sixth circuit .

as an aid to understanding the complex and evolving nature of the law in this area , this report provides a basic overview of the federal legal framework governing the cable franchising process .

the report begins with a historical overview of the law's evolution , from the communications act through the cable act and its later amendments , to the fcc's various orders interpreting the act .

next , the report details several key issues that have arisen from the fcc's orders , specifically ( 1 ) the circumstances under which a franchising authority might be found to have unreasonably refused to award a franchise ; ( 2 ) the types of expenditures that count toward the 5% cap on franchise fees ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which title vi allows franchising authorities to regulate "mixed - use" networks , that is , networks through which a cable operator provides cable service and another service such as telephone or broadband internet .

the report concludes with a discussion of other legal issues that may arise from pending challenges to the fcc's third order and offers some considerations for congress .

a summary of federal restrictions on local authority to regulate cable operators and a glossary of some terms used frequently in this report are found in the appendix .

as the foregoing discussion reflects , the fcc's post - 2007 orders have focused on several key issues within title vi's framework .

most notably , the commission has addressed ( 1 ) when certain franchise requirements amount to an "unreasonable refusal" to award the franchise under section 621 ; ( 2 ) the types of costs that are subject to the 5% franchise fee cap under section 622 ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which franchising authorities may regulate "mixed - use" networks operated by cable operators .

this section first reviews the relevant statutory provisions from which each of these three issues arise and then discusses the fcc's interpretations of those provisions .

several cities , franchising authorities , and advocacy organizations have filed petitions for review of the third order in various courts of appeals , and these petitions have been consolidated and transferred to the sixth circuit .

in their petitions , the petitioners generally allege that the third order violates the communications act and the u.s. constitution and is arbitrary and capricious under the apa .

the same parties filed a motion with the fcc to stay the third order , which the commission recently denied .

while the petitions challenging the order state their legal theories in general terms , this case will likely raise complex issues of statutory interpretation , as well as administrative and constitutional law .

for instance , petitioners could argue , as commenters did during the rulemaking process for the third order , that the text and structure of title vi contradicts the fcc's broad interpretation that a franchise fee should include most cable - related , in - kind expenses .

pointing to provisions such as section 611 ( b ) , which authorizes franchising authorities to impose peg and i - net requirements without any reference to the franchise fee provision , some commenters argued that title vi treats the cost of complying with franchise requirements as distinct from the franchise fee .

a reviewing court would likely apply the chevron framework to resolve such statutory arguments .

while it is difficult to predict how a reviewing court would decide any given issue , the sixth circuit's decision in montgomery county indicates that the court might uphold the third order's legal interpretation of the franchise fee provision under the chevron doctrine .

specifically , as discussed above , the sixth circuit held that section 622's definition of franchise fee is broad enough to include "noncash exactions. .

given this decision , the sixth circuit could potentially hold that the franchise fee definition is broad enough to accommodate the fcc's interpretation and that the fcc's interpretation is reasonable and entitled to deference .

even were the sixth circuit to reach that conclusion , however , that is not the end of the analysis .

as the sixth circuit's decision in montgomery county also demonstrates , the fcc's rulings may be vacated regardless of whether the commission's statutory interpretation enjoys chevron deference if the court concludes that the fcc's interpretation is arbitrary and capricious under the apa .

a federal agency's determination is arbitrary and capricious if the agency "has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider , entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem , offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency , or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise. .

in montgomery county , the sixth circuit held that the fcc had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to give "scarcely any explanation at all" for expanding its franchise fee interpretation to cable - related in - kind expenses and for failing to identify a statutory basis for extending its mixed - use rule to incumbents .

while the commission took pains to address these concerns in the third order , it remains to be seen whether a court would find those efforts sufficient or accept other arguments as to why the fccs interpretations should be held arbitrary and capricious .

for instance , those challenging the third order might argue that the commission failed to address evidence that "runs counter" to its rules or failed to consider important counterarguments .

one such area of focus for petitioners in their motion to stay the third order was the fcc's alleged failure to address potential public safety effects of the third order's treatment of cable - related in - kind contributions .

in addition , the third order's assertion of preemption may come under scrutiny from state or local challengers who seek to regulate mixed - use networks .

a recent d.c .

circuit decision struck down the fcc's attempt to preempt "any state or local requirements that are inconsistent with [the fcc's] deregulatory approach" to broadband internet regulation .

additionally , in a recent opinion concurring in the u.s. supreme court's denial of a petition for certiorari in a case involving a state's effort to regulate voice over internet protocol service , justice thomas , joined by justice gorsuch , voiced concerns about allowing the fcc's deregulatory policy to preempt state regulatory efforts .

both the d.c .

circuit and justices thomas and gorsuch expressed skepticism that the fcc has statutory authority to preempt state and local regulation in areas where the fcc itself has no statutory authority to regulate .

cities and local franchising authorities may seize on the reasoning in these opinions to argue that title vi's preemption provision cannot extend to non - cable services that fall outside title vi's purview .

lastly , along with statutory interpretation and administrative law issues , challengers to the third order may assert constitutional arguments .

as mentioned , the third order prevents state and local governments from relying on state law to regulate non - cable services provided by cable operators .

however , some commenters have argued that the third order violates the anti - commandeering doctrine , a constitutional rule that prohibits the federal government from compelling states to administer federal regulations .

the supreme court recently clarified the anti - commandeering doctrine in murphy v. ncaa .

in murphy , the court struck down the professional and amateur sports protection act of 1992 , which prohibited states from legalizing sports gambling .

justice alito , writing for the court , reasoned that the anti - commandeering doctrine prohibits congress from "issu[ing] direct orders to state legislatures," compelling them to either enact certain legislation or to restrict them from enacting certain legislation .

the court explained that the anti - commandeering doctrine promotes accountability , because , when states regulate at congress's command , "responsibility is blurred. .

justice alito further explained that the doctrine "prevents congress from shifting the costs of regulation to the states. .

the court contrasted unlawful commandeering with permissible "cooperative federalism" regimes .

under such regimes , congress allows , but does not require , states to implement a regulatory program according to federal standards , and a federal body implements the program when a state refrains from doing so .

according to some commenters , the fcc's third order violates the anti - commandeering doctrine because it "effectively command[s] local government[s] to grant right - of - way access on the terms the commission , not local government or the states set. .

further , some commenters , including the national association of telecommunications officers and advisors and national league of cities , argue that the third order would violate the accountability and cost - shifting principles animating the anti - commandeering doctrine , as explained in murphy .

according to these commenters , the fcc's "mixed - use rule unquestionably blurs responsibility" because residents unhappy with cable operators' use of the right - of - way for non - cable purposes would "blame their local elected officials," and the mixed - use rule would shift cost to local governments by "usurp[ing]" the "compensation local governments may be entitled to for use of the [rights - of - way] for non - cable services. .

ultimately , this issue may turn on whether title vi , as interpreted by the fcc's rules , is a permissible "cooperative federalism" program under murphy .

in its third order , the commission argued title vi was such a program because it "simply establishes limitations on the scope of [states' authorities to "award franchises" to cable operators] when and if exercised. .

the fcc further maintained that , rather than "requir[ing] that state or local governments take or decline any particular action," its rules were "simply requiring that , should state and local governments decide to open their rights - of - way to providers of interstate communication services within the commission's jurisdiction , they do so in accordance with federal standards. .

it remains to be seen , however , how broadly lower courts will apply murphy 's cooperative federalism distinction .

beyond the various legal arguments discussed above , there are notable disagreements over the practical impact of the fcc's rules .

on the one hand , localities and their representative organizations have claimed that the commission's third order will "gut[] local budgets" and that , by subjecting in - kind franchise requirements such as peg and i - net requirements to the 5% cap , it will force franchising authorities to "choose between local peg access and i - nets , and the important other public services supported by franchise fees. .

similarly , the two fcc commissioners who dissented from the third orderâjessica rosenworcel and geoffrey starksâmaintained in their dissents that the third order was part of a broader trend at the commission of "cutting local authorities out of the picture" and that it would , among other things , diminish the "value of local public rights - of - way. .

in response , the fcc's chairman , ajit pai , and other commissioners in the majority contended that the rule would benefit consumers because the costs imposed by franchising authorities through in - kind contributions and fees get "passed on to consumers" and discourage the deployment of new services like "faster home broadband or better wi - fi or internet of things networks. .

given the competing arguments relating to the fcc's interpretation of title vi's scope , congress may be interested in addressing the issues raised by the third order .

for instance , congress might address the extent to which section 622's definition of "franchise fee" includes cable - related , in - kind expenses such as peg and i - net services .

it might also address whether title vi preempts state and local governments from relying on their police powers or other authorities under state law to regulate non - cable services provided by cable operators .

however , congress also might consider federalism issues implicated by any attempt to prohibit state and local authorities from regulating such services .

as discussed in the previous section , the anti - commandeering principle prohibits direct orders to states that command or prohibit them from enacting certain laws , but permits lawful "cooperative federalism" regimes where congress gives states a choice of either refraining from regulating a particular area or regulating according to federal standards .

thus , congress may avoid anti - commandeering issues by setting federal standards for regulation of ancillary non - cable services rather than prohibiting states from regulating these services .
