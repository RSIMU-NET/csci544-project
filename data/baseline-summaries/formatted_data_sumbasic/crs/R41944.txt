the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules ; these benefits include medical care , disability compensation and pensions , education , vocational rehabilitation and employment services , assistance to homeless veterans , home loan guarantees , administration of life insurance as well as traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers , and death benefits that cover burial expenses .

the department carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals ( bva ) .

the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) is responsible for , among other things , providing compensation , pensions , and education assistance .

the national cemetery administration ( nca ) is responsible for maintaining national veterans' cemeteries ; providing grants to states for establishing , expanding , or improving state veterans' cemeteries ; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons , among other things .

the veterans health administration ( vha ) is responsible for health care services and medical and prosthetic research programs .

the vha is primarily a direct service provider of primary care , specialized care , and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system .

veterans generally must enroll in the va health care system to receive medical care .

eligibility for enrollment is based primarily on previous military service , disability , and income .

once enrolled , veterans are assigned to one of eight categories ( see the appendix ) .

the va provides free inpatient and outpatient medical care to veterans for service - connected conditions and to low - income veterans for nonservice - connected conditions .

this report focuses on appropriations for vha .

it begins with a brief overview of the va's budget for fy2011 ( the current fiscal year ) as a whole .

it then presents a brief overview of vha's budget formulation , description of the accounts that fund the vha , and a summary of the fy2011 vha budget .

the report ends with a section discussing recent legislative developments pertaining to the fy2012 vha budget .

the va's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts .

mandatory funding supports disability compensation , pension benefits , education , vocational rehabilitation , and life insurance , among other benefits and services .

discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services , including medical care .

figure 1 provides a breakdown of fy2011 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary programs .

in fy2011 , the total va budget authority was approximately $120.6 billion ; discretionary budget authority accounted for about 47% ( $56.3 billion ) of the total , with about 86.3% of this discretionary funding going toward supporting va health care programs , including medical and prosthetic research .

the va's mandatory budget authority accounted for about 53% of the total va budget authority , with about 81% of this mandatory funding going toward disability compensation and pension programs .

similar to most federal agencies , the va begins formulating its budget request approximately 10 months before the president submits the budget to congress in early february .

vha's budget request to congress begins with the formulations of the budget based on the enrollee health care projection model ( ehcpm ) .

the model estimates the amount of budgetary resources vha will need to meet the expected demand for most of the health care services it provides .

the ehcpm's estimates are based on three basic components: the projected number of veterans who will be enrolled in va health care , the projected utilization of va's health care services — that is , the quantity of health care services enrollees are expected to use — and the projected unit cost of providing these services .

each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of va health care and the veterans who access va's health care services .

the ehcpm makes projections three or four years into the future based on data from the most recent fiscal year .

for instance , in 2010 , vha used data from fy2009 to develop its health care budget estimate for the fy2012 request , including the advance appropriations request for fy2013 .

as noted previously , vha is funded through four appropriations accounts .

these are supplemented by other sources of revenue .

although the appropriations account structure has been subject to change from year to year , the appropriation accounts used to support the vha traditionally include medical care , medical and prosthetic research , and medical administration .

congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities through a larger appropriations account for construction for all va facilities .

in fy2004 , "to provide better oversight and [to] receive a more accurate accounting of funds," congress changed the vha's appropriations structure .

specifically , the department of veterans affairs and housing and urban development and independent agencies appropriations act , 2004 ( p.l .

108-199 , h.rept .

108-401 ) , funded vha through four accounts: ( 1 ) medical services , ( 2 ) medical administration ( currently known as medical support and compliance ) , ( 3 ) medical facilities , and ( 4 ) medical and prosthetic research .

brief descriptions of these accounts are provided below .

the president submitted his fy2012 budget request to congress on february 14 , 2011 .

the administration requested a total of $128.3 billion for the va as a whole .

this includes $69.5 billion in mandatory spending and $58.8 billion in discretionary spending ( table 3 ) .

the administration's fy2012 budget request for vha ( medical services , medical support and compliance , medical facilities , and medical and prosthetic research ) is $51.4 billion .

in total , the fy2012 budget request for vha is $54.6 billion , including medical care collections ( table 4 ) .

the president's budget is also proposing to set up a $953 million contingency fund that would provide additional funds up to $953 million to become available for obligation if the administration determines that additional funds are required due to changes in economic conditions in 2012 .

funding for this contingency fund would be derived by revising the fy2012 advance appropriations request — included in the fy2011 president's budget request — by lowering the advance appropriations by $713 million to reflect the 2011 and 2012 estimated civilian pay freeze and by requesting an additional $240 million for the medical services account in fy2012 ( table 4 ) .

furthermore , the president's budget is requesting $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for fy2013 for the three medical care accounts ( medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) .

the president's budget request would provide $41.4 billion for the medical services account , $5.7 billion for the medical support and compliance account , and $5.4 billion for the medical facilities account ( table 4 ) .

the house budget committee reported a concurrent resolution on the fy2012 budget ( h.con.res .

34 ; h.rept .

112-58 ) on april 11 , 2011 .

the house passed h.con.res .

34 on april 15 .

according to the committee report accompanying h.con.res .

34 for veterans programs: the resolution calls for $128.3 billion in budget authority and $127.1 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2012 .

discretionary spending , mainly veterans' health care , is $59.0 billion in budget authority and $57.9 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2012 .

this resolution also provides for up to $52.5 billion in advance appropriations consistent with the veterans health care budget and reform transparency act of 2009 .

mandatory spending in 2012 is $69.4 billion in budget authority and $69.3 billion in outlays .

the house military construction and veterans affairs appropriations subcommittee approved a draft fy2012 military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations bill ( milcon - va appropriations bill ) on may 13 , 2011 .

on may 24 , the full house appropriations committee voted to report the measure .

on june 14 , the house passed the milcon - va appropriations bill for fy2012 ( h.r .

2055 ; h.rept .

112-94 ) .

the house - passed bill provides a total of approximately $127.8 billion for the va .

this amount is 5.9% above the fy2011-enacted amount and $476 million below the fy2012 president's request ( table 3 ) .

the house - passed measure provides $51.1 billion for vha for fy2012 ( see table 4 ) .

this is an increase of 5.2% over the fy2011-enacted amount and $218 million less than the president's request .

additionally , h.r .

2055 , as passed by the house , provides $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for fy2013 for three relevant accounts ( medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) , the same amount as the administration's request .

the bill also provides $531 million for the medical and prosthetic research account , a 4.3% increase over the president's request of $509 million ( table 4 ) .

the house - passed measure did not provide the additional $240 million requested by the president .

according to the committee report accompanying h.r .

2055 : the committee does not provide this additional fy 2012 funding .

as the economy begins to recover , it seems unlikely that economic conditions will generate unmet medical services needs , particularly since the account has weathered the worst of the recession without budget shortfalls .

the committee's recommendation does not include rescission of $664,000,000 of fy 2011 and fy 2012 funding that remains in the medical care accounts from the cancelled pay raises .

rather , the committee permits the funding to remain in the account to cover any unanticipated medical service costs .

the bill includes language indicating that the $664,000,000 will be available only in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year upon approval of the appropriations committees of a request from the va to release the funding due to unanticipated needs related to economic conditions .

during floor debate of the milcon - va appropriations bill , fy2012 , representative john culberson offered h.amdt .

409 , which was agreed upon by the house .

this amendment set aside $20 million from the medical services account for fy2012 for suicide prevention outreach .

on june 28 , the senate appropriations committee , subcommittee on military construction , veterans affairs and related agencies marked up the fy2012 military construction , veterans affairs ( va ) and related agencies appropriations bill ( milcon - va appropriations bill , fy2012 ) and the full committee reported the measure with an amendment in the form of a substitute on june 30 ( h.r .

2055 ; s.rept .

112-29 ) .

the senate passed the bill on july 20 .

the senate - passed version of the milcon - va appropriations bill for fy2012 provides a total of approximately $128.1 billion for the department of veterans affairs ( va ) as a whole .

this amount is 6.2% above the fy2011-enacted amount of $120.6 billion , and $182 million below the president's budget request of $128.3 billion ( table 3 ) .

the senate – passed version of h.r .

2055 provides a total of $51.2 billion for vha .

this is a 5.3% increase over the fy2011-enacted amount and $168 million less than the president's request ( table 4 ) .

similar to the house - passed version , the senate - passed version of the milcon - va appropriations bill , fy2012 , provides $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for fy2013 for the three relevant accounts , the same as the administration's request .

the measure also provides $581 million for the medical and prosthetic research account , a 14.1% increase over the president's request and 9.4% increase over the house - passed amount for this account ( table 4 ) .

as was the case with the house - passed measure , the senate bill did not provide the additional funding of $240 million or the $953 million contingency fund requested by the president .

according to the senate appropriations committee report: in addition to funding for vha's regular medical services programs , the administration's budget submission requested a separate $953,000,000 contingency fund within the medical services account in the event that the current economic climate results in a spike in veterans turning to the va for their medical care .

the request was partially offset by a rescission of $713,000,000 which was the cumulative 2011 and 2012 pay freeze .

the balance , $240,000,000 , was requested above the advance appropriation provided to the department for fiscal year 2012 .

under the proposal , the contingency funds would become available for obligation only if the administration determined that additional funds were required due to unanticipated demand for va medical services , and only if the office of management and budget [omb] approved the request .

the committee remains committed to providing the department with every resource it requires to meet the needs of veterans , but it does not believe that the creation of a contingency fund , which takes control of medical resources out of the hands of the department and places it within the jurisdiction of omb , is prudent policy .

further , the department's fiscal year 2013 request assumes that the va will carry $500,000,000 over from fiscal year 2012 .

the committee believes that before requesting a contingency fund the va should utilize funding that is available to the department .

toward this end , the committee recommendation does not rescind $664,000,000 which remains in the medical care accounts from the cancelled pay raises , and rather leaves the funding within the medical services account for use by the department to address unanticipated demand , should it materialize .

congress did not pass the milcon - va appropriations bill for fy2012 before the fiscal year began on october 1 , 2011 , and funded most of the va through a series of short - term continuing resolutions ( crs ) — p.l .

112-33 , p.l .

112-36 , p.l .

112-55 , p.l .

112-67 , and p.l .

112-68 .

however , three of the four accounts — medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities — that make up vha were not affected since these accounts were provided advance appropriations in the full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ) .

on december 15 , 2011 , house and senate conferees of h.r .

2055 reported a conference agreement ( h.rept .

112-331 ) , which was titled the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 , and included nine appropriations bills .

division h of this measure contained the milcon - va appropriations act , 2012 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ; h.rept .

112-331 ) , was enacted into law on december 23 , 2011 .

the measure provides a total of $122.2 billion for the department of veterans affairs .

this is a 4.7% decrease from the president's request of $128.1 billion ( table 3 ) .

this change reflects the new budget estimates provided in the administration's mid - session review .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ; h.rept .

112-331 ) , provides a total of $51.2 billion for vha for fy2012 .

this is a 5.3% increase over the fy2011-enacted amount of $48.6 billion and 0.3% less than the president's request of $51.4 billion .

the enacted amount includes $581 million for the medical and prosthetic research account , a 14.2% increase over the requested amount of $509 million , and 9.5% over the house - passed amount of $531 million ( table 4 ) .

p.l .

112-74 also provides $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for fy2013 for three relevant accounts ( medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) , the same amount as the administration's request ( table 4 ) .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ) , did not approve the president's proposal to set up a $953 million contingency fund .
