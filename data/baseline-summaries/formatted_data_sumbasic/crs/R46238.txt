t he freedom of information act ( foia ) confers on the public a right to access federal agency information .

before foia's enactment , the administrative procedure act ( apa ) had required agencies to make certain government information available to the public .

but the exceptions to disclosure in the apa's public information section had , in the estimation of foia's drafters , "become the major statutory excuse for withholding government records from public view. .

the exceptions were broad , authorizing agencies , for example , to withhold information if doing so was "in the public interest" orâfor "matters of official record"âwhen information was "held co nfidential for good cause found. .

in addition , the apa's public information section lacked a provision authorizing a person to seek judicial review of an agency's decision to withhold information .

to rectify the apa's perceived failure to provide the public with adequate access to government information , congress enacted foia in 1966 as an amendment to the apa .

in foia , congress sought to establish a statutory scheme that embodied "a broad philosophy of 'freedom of information'" and ensured "the availability of government information necessary to an informed electorate. .

to effectuate congress's desire for robust public access to agency information , foia establishes a three - part system of disclosure by which agencies must disclose a large swath of records and information .

first , foia directs agencies to publish "substantive rules of general applicability," procedural rules , and specified other important government materials in the federal register .

second , on a proactive basis , agencies must electronically disclose a separate set of agency information including , among other things , final adjudicative opinions and certain "frequently requested" records .

and third , foia's request - driven system of disclosure requires that , "[e]xcept with respect to the records made available under" the statute's proactive disclosure provisions , agencies disclose covered records to individuals , corporations , and others upon request .

foia's tripartite system of disclosure aims to open up a vast array of federal agency information and records to private individuals , researchers , journalists , corporations , and other parties .

in addition , disclosure under foia may bring information to congress's attention that may inform its oversight of foia - covered agencies .

as one court has remarked , "foia is the legislative embodiment of justice brandeis's famous adage" that "[s]unlight is .

the best of disinfectants. .

while foia's main purpose is to inform the public of the operations of the federal government , the act's drafters sought to protect certain private and governmental interests from the new law's disclosure obligations .

foia thus contains nine exemptions from disclosure that authorize , but do not require , agencies to withhold information or records that are otherwise subject to release or availability under the statute .

most of foia's nine enumerated exemptions are designed to protect against fairly general harms that may arise from disclosure , while others concern very specific types of information , and one incorporates numerous exemptions contained in other federal statutes .

and along with its nine exemptions , foia contains three records "exclusions" that cover certain "especially sensitive law enforcement records. .

if records protected by an exclusion are subject to a foia request , an agency may "treat the records as not subject to the requirements of" foia .

lastly , the statute authorizes requesters to challenge in federal court an agency's decision to withhold requested records .

federal district courts may "enjoin [an] agency from withholdingâ agencyâ records"â and "orderâ the production of anyâ agencyâ recordsâ improperly withheld. .

this report provides an overview of foia .

first , the report examines key terms that dictate the scope of agencies' disclosure obligations under foia .

the report then provides an overview of foia's three disclosure requirements .

following that discussion , the report reviews each of foia's nine exemptions and , in a later section , its three records exclusions .

after an overview of selected issues concerning judicial review of agency decisions to withhold information under foia , this report discusses two topics of potential interest to congress: foia's "special access" provisionâwhich provides that foia does not authorize agencies "to withhold information from congress" âand the status of congressional records under foia .

lastly , this report discusses three other laws that , like foia , govern the availability of specific types of government information and constitute significant elements of the federal government's open government and information legal regimes: the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) ; government in the sunshine act ( sunshine act ) ; and privacy act .

foia generally requires each federal "agency" to make "agency records" available to the public and specifically to "any person" who requests them .

foia does not , however , require every federal entity to disclose government information to the public , nor must an agency disclose every piece of information that may be located within a covered entity .

and not all persons have a right to receive records under the act .

three key statutory terms inform foia's general scope: ( 1 ) â "agency" ; ( 2 ) "agency records" ; and ( 3 ) "any person. .

the meaning of each of these terms determines which entities must comply with foia , what materials must be disclosed under the act , and to whom foia grants the right to request and receive records .

foia sets forth a three - part system for disclosing government information .

the first two disclosure schemes require agencies to affirmatively disclose specific categories of information to the public , either through publication in the federal register or electronic disclosure .

the third disclosure provision requires that , "[e]xcept with respect to the records made available" pursuant to foia's affirmative disclosure requirements , agencies disclose covered records after receiving a request from "any person. .

as explained above , foia establishes a statutory right of public access to a wide array of government information .

however , foia's drafters also desired to protect certain private and governmental interests from the law's broad disclosure mandate .

foia reflects this desire by exempting a variety of records and information from mandatory disclosure pursuant to nine enumerated exemptions .

information protected by foia's exemptions ranges from certain classified national security information to geological information pertaining to wells .

together , the statute's policy of otherwise maximum disclosure and its exemptions seek to strike a "balance between the right of the public to know and the need of the government to keep information in confidence to the extent necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy. .

foia's exemptions are codified at 5 u.s.c .

â§ 552 ( b ) .

table 1 lists each exemption .

all nine exemptions are explained more fully below .

despite the scope afforded to agencies to withhold certain records by foia's exemptions , the statute is fundamentally a disclosure statute .

in that vein , the supreme court has directed that foia's exemptions should "be narrowly construed. .

the statute reflects foia's presumption in favor of disclosure by explicitly requiring that agencies "take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information" and disclose "[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record" that has been requested "after deletion of the portions which are exempt. .

more fundamentally , foia's exemptions do not impose mandatory withholding obligations on agencies , and pursuant to the 2016 amendments to foia , an agency may not withhold government information protected by an exemption unless it "reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption," or if disclosing the information is legally prohibited .

such limitations on the potential breadth of foia's exemptions may aid in the implementation of the statute's prodisclosure mandate .

the supreme court has instructed that , due to the "exclusivity" of foia's exemptions , the act does not authorize an agency to withhold a covered record or information that is not protected by an applicable exemption .

and in american immigration lawyers association v. executive office for immigration review , the d.c .

circuit held that , when disclosing a record under foia , an agency may not redact information from that record on the basis that the information is "non - responsive," but instead is limited by foia's nine exemptions in the types of information it may redact .

the court explained that , although an agency may apply a foia exemption to withhold matter from a record , "once an agency identifies a record it deems responsive to a foia request , the statute compels disclosure of the responsive record .

 .

 .

as a unit. .

thus , per the court , although "the focus of the foia is information , not documents" when the agency is deciding whether to exempt matter from a record , "outside of that context , foia calls for disclosure of a responsive record , not disclosure of responsive information within a record. .

an agency may be prohibited by another source of law from disclosing material that is exempt under foia .

for example , under foia's exemption 3 , certain statutes that prohibit or place limits on agencies' disclosure of information may serve as bases under foia for withholding covered information .

an agency's disclosure of information protected by an exemption 3 withholding statute , therefore , could , depending on the statute's terms , violate that particular statute .

as another example , although foia's exemption 4 authorizes an agency to withhold certain confidential "commercial or financial information" and trade secrets , the trade secrets act ( tsa ) imposes criminal penalties for disclosing certain confidential materials if disclosure is not "authorized by law. .

thus , while exemption 4 grants agencies discretion to withhold information covered by both the exemption and the tsa , the tsa would prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of the information .

ultimately , however , if records within foia's coverage are not exempt under foia or prohibited from being disclosed by another law , an agency must disclose such records upon request .

under certain circumstances , an agency may be held to have waived its ability to apply an exemption to a requested record due to its prior disclosure of information .

for example , the d.c .

circuit has "held .

 .

 .

that the government cannot rely on an otherwise valid exemption claim to justify withholding information that has been 'officially acknowledged' or is in the 'public domain.' .

courts often have held that an agency's prior disclosure of information to congress has not foreclosed application of an exemption in response to a subsequent foia request .

however , whether an agency has waived an exemption is necessarily dependent on "the specific nature and circumstances of the prior disclosure. .

in addition to its nine exemptions , foia also contains three records exclusions .

foia's exclusions allow an agency , in response to a request for certain law enforcement records , to "treat the records as not subject to the requirements of" foia .

as the attorney general ' s memorandum on the 1 9 86 amendments to the freedom of information act explains , when an agency receives a request for records that fall within the coverage of an exclusion , the agency is authorized to withhold the records and "respond to the request as if the excluded records d[o] not exist. .

foia's exclusions , in other words , allow agencies to "withhold documents without comment. .

conversely , when an agency invokes a foia exemption in response to a request for records , it is required to "reveal the fact of and grounds for any withholdings" to the requester .

foia's exclusions , therefore , are designed to allow agencies to better avoid disclosure of the narrow categories of records to which they apply .

each of foia's three exclusions is codified at 5 u.s.c .

â§ 552 ( c ) .

exclusion ( c ) ( 1 ) .

the first exclusion covers records protected by exemption 7 ( a ) ( i.e. , records whose disclosure "could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings" ) , but only if the relevant law enforcement proceeding or investigation concerns a "possible" criminal violation ; and the agency has "reason to believe" both that the pendency of the proceeding or investigation is unknown to the subject of the proceeding or investigation , and revealing the records' existence "could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. .

the exclusion was intended to prevent an agency from "tipping off" an individual about the existence of an investigation of which he or she is a subject by stating , in response to a foia request , that requested records are exempt from disclosure under exemption 7 ( a ) .

while agencies can rely on this exclusion to prevent such an outcome , by its terms , exclusion ( c ) ( 1 ) is only available to an agency while the conditions described in its text continue .

accordingly , once the investigation becomes public , this exclusion no longer applies .

exclusion ( c ) ( 2 ) .

the second exclusion applies to records that are "maintained by a criminal law enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier. .

when a third party requests such records "according to the informant's name or personal identifier," exclusion ( c ) ( 2 ) â authorizes the agency to "treat the records as not subject to the requirements of" foia .

the attorney general's memorandum on the 1986 amendments to foia describes foia's second exclusion as contemplating "the situation in which a sophisticated requester could try to ferret out an informant in his organization by forcing a law enforcement agency" to invoke foia's exemption for records relating to a confidential source ( exemption 7 ( d ) ) , an action that would likely corroborate the requester's suspicion that the individual subject to the request is a confidential informant .

the memorandum cites as an example the situation in which a criminal organization that suspects one of its members is a criminal informant either requires that the suspected informant request law enforcement records about himself or herself , or else compels the individual to submit a privacy waiver to allow a member of the organization to make such a request .

exclusion ( c ) ( 2 ) authorizes law enforcement agencies to protect against the disclosure of the identities of their confidential informants in such situations .

however , like exclusion ( c ) ( 1 ) , an agency's ability to use the second exclusion is subject to an important limitation: an agency may not use the second exclusion if "the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed. .

exclusion ( c ) ( 3 ) .

foia's third exclusion protects a subset of fbi records concerning "foreign intelligence," "counterintelligence," or "international terrorism. .

the fbi may treat such records as excluded from foia if "the existence of the records is classified information as provided in" exemption 1 .

exclusion ( c ) ( 3 ) seeks to prevent the harm that may occur from an agency's publicly claiming the protection of exemption 1 in response to a request and , therefore , admitting that such sensitive records do indeed exist .

like the other exclusions , however , the third exclusion's protective ambit is limitedâan agency may only use exclusion ( c ) ( 3 ) for such time "as the existence of [such] records remains classified information. .

foia not only established a statutory right of access to agency records , but also provided a means for requesters to enforce that right through judicial review of agency decisions to withhold records .

conversely , parties may initiate legal actions to prevent agencies from disclosing information requested under foia in certain situations .

these aspects of foia and foia - related litigationâjudicial review of agencies' withholding decisions and so - called reverse - foia litigationâare discussed below .

while congress is not subject to foia , the act raises questions of particular relevance to the legislative branch .

for example , per the act , an agency may not "withhold information from congress" on the basis that such information is exempt under foia .

there are different views , however , about what "congress" means in this instanceâin particular , whether this withholding prohibition applies to requests from individual members of congress , or whether the provision is limited to access requests from each house of congress or congressional committees .

in addition , although congress is under no obligation to disclose its own materials under foia , whether a congressional document possessed by an agency is subject to foia depends on whether or not congress clearly expressed its determination to retain control over the document .

although this section only discusses the two topics just mentioned , foia implicates congressional interests in many other ways .

for example , congress has often expressed its interest in the frequency with which agencies use exemptions to withhold information from requesters , as well as the general backlog of foia requests .

further , foia evidences congress's general interest in executive branch transparency , and congress has amended foia several times since its 1965 enactment , often due or in response to judicial interpretations of the act or agencies' administration thereof .

foia is the primary statutory mechanism by which the public may gain access to federal government records and information .

but other lawsâspecifically faca , the sunshine act , and the privacy actâalso set forth rights and limitations on the public's access to government information or activities .

faca governs the establishment and operation of certain advisory committees created to supply advice and recommendations to federal agencies or the president .

among other things , the statute generally mandates the public availability of an advisory committee's "records , reports , transcripts , minutes , appendixes , working papers , drafts , studies , agenda , or other documents," and members of the public are authorized under faca to attend and participate in advisory committee meetings .

the availability of an advisory committee's papers is subject to foia's exemptions .

another general open government statute , the sunshine act , imposes transparency obligations on the meetings of certain multimember boards and commissions .

the statute requires that covered agencies allow the public to attend their meetings and have access to relevant information .

meetings and information required to be disclosed under the act are subject to ten exemptions that resemble foia's .

lastly , the privacy act governs the "collection , maintenance , use and dissemination" of agency records that contain individually identifiable information about u.s. citizens and lawful permanent residents .

the act forbids the disclosure of covered records without the written consent or request of the individual identified by the record , subject to twelve exceptions .

one privacy act exception covers records for which disclosure is "required" by foia .

under this exception , an agency record subject to the privacy act that is not protected by any of foia's exemptionsâand which therefore must be disclosed under foia upon requestâis not prohibited from being disclosed by the privacy act .

the privacy act also permits individuals to request access to records that pertain to them and to seek the amendment of such records , subject to exemptions .
