figure 1 compares the major components of the fy2018 energy and water development bill at each stage of consideration , along with the fy2017 enacted levels .

president trump submitted his fy2018 budget proposal to congress on may 23 , 2017 .

the budget requests for agencies included in the energy and water development appropriations bill totaled $34.189 billion ( including offsets ) — $4.261 billion ( 11.1% ) below the fy2017 appropriation .

the largest proposed increase was for doe nuclear weapons activities , up by $994 million ( 10.7% ) .

for the first time since fy2010 , under the request , doe would have received new funding to pursue an nrc license for a proposed nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain , nv , totaling $120 million ( including funding for interim nuclear waste storage ) .

the fy2018 budget request proposed substantial reductions from the fy2017 level for doe energy research and development ( r&d ) programs , including a cut of $1.454 billion ( 69.6% ) in energy efficiency and renewable energy , $388 million ( 58.1% ) in fossil fuels , and $314 million ( 30.8% ) in nuclear .

doe science programs would have been cut by $920 million ( 17.1% ) .

programs targeted by the budget for elimination or phaseout included the advanced research projects agency — energy ( arpa - e ) , loan guarantee programs , and the arc .

funding would have been cut for the army corps by $1.035 billion ( 17.0% ) , and the bureau of reclamation and cup by $211 million ( 16.0% ) .

after passing a series of continuing resolutions , congress largely rejected the administration's proposed fy2018 budget cuts in the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-141 ) , which was signed into law march 23 , 2018 .

appropriations for energy and water development programs , provided by division d of the act , rose by a total of $4.768 billion over the fy2017 level ( 12.4% ) , to $43.219 billion .

that total is $9.030 billion ( 26.4% ) above the administration's fy2018 request .

doe programs receiving major funding increases for fy2018 include energy efficiency and renewable energy programs ( totaling $2.322 billion , up 11.1% ) , nuclear energy r&d ( $1.205 billion , up 18.5% ) , science programs ( $6.260 billion , up 16.1% ) , arpa - e ( $353 million , up 15.5% ) and atomic energy defense activities ( $21.605 billion , up 9.2% ) .

the administration's request for the yucca mountain repository and interim nuclear waste storage was not approved .

funding for the corps totaled $6.827 billion ( up 13.1% ) , and for reclamation and cup $1.480 billion ( up 12.4% ) .

leading up to the enactment of the omnibus funding measure , the house appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2018 energy and water development appropriations bill with a manager's amendment by voice vote on july 12 , 2017 .

the committee - approved bill had total funding of $37.641 billion without scorekeeping adjustments — $809 million below fy2017 and $3.45 billion above the administration request ( h.r .

3266 , h.rept .

115-230 ) .

h.r .

3266 was combined with three other appropriations bill into h.r .

3219 , the make america secure appropriations act , 2018 , which was passed with amendments by the house on july 27 , 1017 .

the text of h.r .

3219 was then included without further amendment in an fy2018 omnibus appropriations measure ( h.r .

3354 ) that was passed by the house on september 14 , 2017 .

the house - passed omnibus bill includes the administration's proposed funding increase for doe weapons activities , funding for yucca mountain , a decrease in funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) r&d , and the elimination of arpa - e and the loan programs .

most of the administration's proposed reductions in nuclear and fossil energy r&d were not agreed to by the house , nor was the proposed elimination of the arc .

the senate appropriations committee approved its version of the energy and water development appropriations bill ( s. 1609 , s.rept .

115-132 ) on july 20 , 2017 , with total funding of $39.27 billion , including $545.4 million in rescissions .

the committee recommended funding increases to doe's weapons activities , funding for support of nuclear waste storage at private facilities , a decrease in funding for eere r&d , and elimination of the title 17 loan guarantee program .

the committee recommended against the elimination of arpa - e , instead approving an increase from the fy2017 enacted level .

for fy2017 , funding for energy and water development programs was provided by division d of the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , an omnibus funding measure passed by congress may 4 , 2017 , and signed into law the following day .

total funding for division d was $38.89 billion , offset by $436 million in rescissions .

that total was $1.27 billion above the obama administration request and $1.54 billion over the fy2016 level , excluding rescissions .

the obama administration also had proposed $2.26 billion in new mandatory funding for doe , which was not approved .

proposed reductions for the corps , reclamation , and cup were also rejected .
