the open world leadership center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the united states .

the first program was authorized by congress in 1999 to support the relationship between russia and the united states .

the program encouraged young federal and local russian leaders to visit the united states and observe its government and society .

established at the library of congress as the center for russian leadership development in 2000 , the center was renamed the open world leadership center in 2003 , when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries .

in 2004 , congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees , subject to congressional consideration .

the center is housed in the library and receives services from the library through an inter - agency agreement .

open world requested $10.06 million for fy2014 .

the house subcommittee mark would have provided $1.0 million .

as stated above , an amendment to restore funding for open world to the fy2013 post - sequester level was debated and withdrawn during the full committee markup .

the house report states: for many years the committee has had concern with the placement of the open world leadership center ( owlc ) in the legislative branch .

the committee understands the program has some strong champions on the committee .

however , with further reductions being made to every program within the legislative branch , the committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the owlc .

the committee directs the executive director of the owlc to retain any necessary prior year funds in the trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill be utilized for the orderly shutdown .

the senate - reported bill would have provided $4.0 million , as well as a provision allowing the librarian of congress to transfer up to $6.0 million in non - appropriated funds to open world .

the fy2014 act provided $6.0 million .

previously , the fy2013 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act contained an anomaly for open world , providing it with $8.0 million , not including sequestration or the across - the - board rescission .

fy2012 level was $1.38 million ( - 12.1% ) less than the $11.38 million provided in fy2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ) .

the fy2011 level represented a decrease of $623,000 ( - 5.2% ) from the $12.00 million provided for fy2010 , and the fy2010 level represented a decrease of $1.90 million ( - 13.7% ) from the $13.90 million provided in the fy2009 omnibus .

the fy2009 level was a $4.92 million increase ( 54.8% ) over the $8.98 million provided in fy2008 , which was a decrease of $4.88 million ( - 35.2% ) from the $13.86 million provided in fy2007 and fy2006 .

the location and future of open world , as well as its inclusion in the legislative branch budget , have been a topic of discussion at appropriations hearings in recent fiscal years .

the fy2013 house - reported bill would have provided $1.0 million , a decrease of $9.0 million ( - 90.0% ) , from the $10.0 million provided in fy2012 and requested for fy2013 .

the house report states that this funding level would "cover the cost associated with the shutdown" and directed that "the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the legislative branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill. .

h.amdt .

1281 , agreed to by recorded vote ( 204-203 , roll no .

373 ) , eliminated this funding .

p.l .

113-6 provided $8.0 million for fy2013 , not including the across - the - board rescission or sequestration .

2551 ) would have provided $1.0 million , a decrease of 91.2% from the fy2011 level of $11.38 million .

the house report stated , "the program has some strong champions on the committee , but with reductions being made to most every program within the federal budget the committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses. .

the senate - reported bill , in contrast , would have provided $10.0 million ( - 12.1% below the fy2011 level ) .

the senate report stated that "despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule. .

the consolidated appropriations act provided the senate - reported level of $10.0 million .

additionally , the fy2010 house appropriations committee report stated that "the legislative branch subcommittee has been clear that it expects the open world program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible. .

this sentiment was also expressed in the conference report , which stated , the conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the open world center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the legislative branch appropriations bill in future years .

the committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request .

the location within the legislative branch was discussed during a hearing on the fy2009 budget .

ambassador john o'keefe , the executive director of open world , testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the library of congress , which may be seen as more neutral and nonpartisan .

the fy2009 explanatory statement directed the open world leadership center board of trustees to work with the state department and the judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism .

the subcommittees also had discussed this issue during the fy2008 appropriations cycle , and language was included in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act requiring open world to prepare a report by march 31 , 2008 , on "potential options for transfer of the open world leadership center to a department or agency in the executive branch , establishment of the center as an independent agency in the executive branch , or other appropriate options. .

in 2004 , gao issued a report on the open world program , examining program participation , purpose , and accountability .

the center was created by congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs .

the center requested $430,000 for fy2014 .

the house subcommittee mark would have provided $407,508 .

an amendment offered at the full committee reduced this to $0 .

the fy2014 house report ( h.rept .

113-173 ) states: the fiscal year 2012 conference agreement ( house report 112 â€“ 331 ) directed that future budget requests from the john c. stennis center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification as requested in house report 112 â€“ 148 .

the john c. stennis center has repeatedly ignored this directive .

the senate - reported bill would have provided $430,000 , which was the level contained in the fy2014 act .

previously , $430,000 , not including the across - board - rescission or sequestration , was provided for the center in fy2013 .

the fy2013 senate - reported bill would have provided the requested level of $430,000 .

the fy2013 house - passed bill did not provide funding for the stennis center , and the house report stated: the fiscal year 2012 conference agreement ( h.rept .

112-331 ) directed that future budget requests from the john c. stennis center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification as requested in h.rept .

112-148 .

the committee did not receive such justification and therefore has not provided the requested funding .

the $430,000 and directive for budget justifications included in the fy2012 conference report followed language in h.rept .

112-148 , the fy2012 house report , which stated: the center was created by congress in 1988 with an appropriation of $7.5 million which subsequently was transferred to the john c. stennis trust fund and invested in non - expendable corpus special issue certificates of indebtedness with the u.s. treasury .

as reflected in the current budget of the united states , the center has $15 million invested with the treasury , and at a 2 percent return should generate $300,000 that can be utilized for the annual operation of the program .

since the principal of the fund has doubled from the original appropriation and with reduced funding within the legislative branch , the committee has provided zero funding for the john c. stennis center for public service training and development .

the committee directs that any further budget request from the john c. stennis center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification .

the stennis center was funded at $430,000 in fy2011 ( less 0.2% from an across - the - board rescission ) , fy2010 , fy2009 , fy2008 ( less 0.25% rescission from an across - the - board rescission ) , and fy2007 .

h.j.res .

59 was introduced on september 10 , 2013 , and passed the house on september 20 .

on september 27 , the senate passed h.j.res .

59 with an amendment .

subsequent actions to resolve differences between the house and senate , which included the consideration of various house amendments to that senate amendment , were unsuccessful prior to the beginning of the fiscal year .

because none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for fy2014 was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year , a funding gap ensued on october 1 , 2013 .

congressional action on fy2014 appropriations between october 2 and october 15 was generally limited to a number of narrow crs to provide funding for certain programs or classes of individuals , none of which would have provided funding for the legislative branch .

since the antideficiency act generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations , and pursuant to opinions issued in 1980 and early 1981 by then - attorney general benjamin civiletti further clarifying the need for the federal government to begin terminating regular activities upon the occurrence of a funding gap , a partial shutdown began on october 1 , 2013 .

many legislative branch activities were restricted to those "excepted" pursuant to the act , which include activities necessary to protect life and property .

some activities also continued pursuant to authorities cited in a 1990 gao nondecision letter , which states: " ... congress and its agents may incur obligations to support congress's exercise of its constitutional powers. .

on october 16 , 2013 , the senate passed h.r .

2775 with an amendment that , in part , provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous fiscal year's projects and activities .

later that same day , the house agreed to the senate amendment to h.r .

2775 .

the cr was signed into law on october 17 , 2013 ( p.l .

113-46 ) , thus terminating the funding gap that same day .

with some routine exceptions , the cr provided budget authority through january 15 , 2014 .
