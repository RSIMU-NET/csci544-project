the united states has actively pursued the development of hypersonic weapons as a part of its conventional prompt global strike ( cpgs ) program since the early 2000s .

in recent years , it has focused such efforts on hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles with shorter and intermediate ranges for use in regional conflicts .

although funding for these programs has been relatively restrained in the past , both the pentagon and congress have shown a growing interest in pursuing the development and near - term deployment of hypersonic systems .

this is due , in part , to the growing interest in these technologies in russia and china , leading to a heightened focus in the united states on the strategic threat posed by hypersonic flight .

open - source reporting indicates that both china and russia have conducted numerous successful tests of hypersonic glide vehicles , and both are expected to field an operational capability as early as 2020 .

experts disagree on the potential impact of competitor hypersonic weapons on both strategic stability and the u.s. military's competitive advantage .

nevertheless , current under secretary of defense for research and engineering ( usd r&e ) michael griffin has testified to congress that the united states does not "have systems which can hold [china and russia] at risk in a corresponding manner , and we don't have defenses against [their] systems. .

although the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 ( fy2019 ndaa , p.l .

115-232 ) accelerated the development of hypersonic weapons , which usd r&e identifies as a priority research and development area , the united states is unlikely to field an operational system before 2023 .

however , the united states , in contrast to russia and china , is not currently considering or developing hypersonic weapons for use with a nuclear warhead .

as a result , u.s. hypersonic weapons will likely require greater accuracy and will be more technically challenging to develop than nuclear - armed chinese and russian systems .

in addition to accelerating development of hypersonic weapons , section 247 of the fy2019 ndaa required that the secretary of defense , in coordination with the director of the defense intelligence agency , produce a classified assessment of u.s. and adversary hypersonic weapons programs , to include the following elements: ( 1 ) an evaluation of spending by the united states and adversaries on such technology .

 ( 2 ) an evaluation of the quantity and quality of research on such technology .

 ( 3 ) an evaluation of the test infrastructure and workforce supporting such technology .

 ( 4 ) an assessment of the technological progress of the united states and adversaries on such technology .

 ( 5 ) descriptions of timelines for operational deployment of such technology .

 ( 6 ) an assessment of the intent or willingness of adversaries to use such technology .

this report was delivered to congress in july 2019 .

similarly , section 1689 of the fy2019 ndaa requires the director of the missile defense agency to produce a report on "how hypersonic missile defense can be accelerated to meet emerging hypersonic threats. .

the findings of these reports could hold implications for congressional authorizations , appropriations , and oversight .

the following report reviews the hypersonic weapons programs in the united states , russia , and china , providing information on the programs and infrastructure in each nation , based on unclassified sources .

it also provides a brief summary of the state of global hypersonic weapons research development .

it concludes with a discussion of the issues that congress might address as it considers dod's funding requests for u.s. hypersonic technology programs .

several countries are developing hypersonic weapons , which fly at speeds of at least mach 5 ( five times the speed of sound ) , but none have yet introduced them into their operational military forces .

there are two primary categories of hypersonic weapons hypersonic glide vehicles ( hgv ) are launched from a rocket before gliding to a target .

hypersonic cruise missiles are powered by high - speed , air - breathing engines , or "scramjets," after acquiring their target .

unlike ballistic missiles , hypersonic weapons do not follow a ballistic trajectory and can maneuver en route to their destination .

as vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former commander of u.s. strategic command general john hyten has stated , hypersonic weapons could enable "responsive , long - range , strike options against distant , defended , and / or time - critical threats [such as road - mobile missiles] when other forces are unavailable , denied access , or not preferred. .

conventional hypersonic weapons use only kinetic energyâenergy derived from motionâto destroy unhardened targets or , potentially , underground facilities .

hypersonic weapons could challenge detection and defense due to their speed , maneuverability , and low altitude of flight .

for example , terrestrial - based radar cannot detect hypersonic weapons until late in the weapon's flight .

figure 1 depicts the differences in terrestrial - based radar detection timelines for ballistic missiles versus hypersonic glide vehicles .

this delayed detection compresses the timeline for decision - makers assessing their response options and for a defensive system to intercept the attacking weaponâpotentially permitting only a single intercept attempt .

furthermore , u.s. defense officials have stated that both terrestrial - and current space - based sensor architectures are insufficient to detect and track hypersonic weapons , with usd r&e griffin noting that "hypersonic targets are 10 to 20 times dimmer than what the u.s. normally tracks by satellites in geostationary orbit. .

some analysts have suggested that space - based sensor layersâintegrated with tracking and fire - control systems to direct high - performance interceptors or directed energy weaponsâcould theoretically present viable options for defending against hypersonic weapons in the future .

indeed , the 2019 missile defense review notes that "such sensors take advantage of the large area viewable from space for improved tracking and potentially targeting of advanced threats , including hgvs and hypersonic cruise missiles. .

other analysts have questioned the affordability , technological feasibility , and / or utility of wide - area hypersonic weapons defense .

as physicist and nuclear expert james acton explains , "point - defense systems , and particularly [terminal high - altitude area defense ( thaad ) ] , could very plausibly be adapted to deal with hypersonic missiles .

the disadvantage of those systems is that they can only defend small areas .

to defend the whole of the continental united states , you would need an unaffordable number of thaad batteries. .

in addition , some analysts have argued that the united states' current command and control architecture would be incapable of "processing data quickly enough to respond to and neutralize an incoming hypersonic threat. .

 ( a broader discussion of hypersonic weapons defense is outside the scope of this report. ) .

as congress reviews the pentagon's plans for u.s. hypersonic weapons programs during the annual authorization and appropriations process , it might consider a number of questions about the rationale for hypersonic weapons , their expected costs , and their implications for strategic stability and arms control .

this section provides an overview of some of these questions .

although the department of defense is funding a number of hypersonic weapons programs , it has not established any programs of record , suggesting that it may not have approved requirements for hypersonic weapons or long - term funding plans .

indeed , as assistant director for hypersonics ( usd r&e ) mike white has stated , dod has not yet made a decision to acquire hypersonic weapons and is instead developing prototypes to "[identify] the most viable overarching weapon system concepts to choose from and then make a decision based on success and challenges. .

as congress conducts oversight of u.s. hypersonic weapons programs , it may seek to obtain information about dod's evaluation of potential mission sets for hypersonic weapons , a cost analysis of alternative means of executing these mission sets , and an assessment of the enabling technologiesâsuch as space - based sensors or autonomous command and control systemsâthat may be required to employ or defend against hypersonic weapons .

assistant director for hypersonics ( usd r&e ) mike white has noted that dod is prioritizing offensive programs while it determines "the path forward to get a robust defensive strategy. .

this approach is reflected in dod's fy2021 request , which allocates $206.8 million for hypersonic defense programsâof a total $3.2 billion request for all hypersonic - related research .

similarly , in fy2020 , dod requested $157.4 million for hypersonic defense programsâof a total $2.6 billion for all hypersonic - related research .

although the defense subcommittees of the appropriations committees increased fy2020 appropriations for both hypersonic offense and defense above the fy2020 request , they expressed concerns , noting in their joint explanatory statement of h.r .

1158 "that the rapid growth in hypersonic research has the potential to result in stove - piped , proprietary systems that duplicate capabilities and increase costs. .

to mitigate this concern , they appropriated $100 million for dod to establish a joint hypersonic transition office to "develop and implement an integrated science and technology roadmap for hypersonics" and "establish a university consortium for hypersonic research and workforce development" in support of dod efforts .

given the lack of defined mission requirements for hypersonic weapons , it may be challenging for congress to evaluate the balance of funding for hypersonic weapons programs , enabling technologies , supporting test infrastructure , and hypersonic missile defense .

analysts disagree about the strategic implications of hypersonic weapons .

some have identified two factors that could hold significant implications for strategic stability: the weapon's short time - of - flightâwhich , in turn , compresses the timeline for responseâ and its unpredictable flight pathâwhich could generate uncertainty about the weapon's intended target and therefore heighten the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation in the event of a conflict .

this risk could be further compounded in countries that co - locate nuclear and conventional capabilities or facilities .

some analysts argue that unintended escalation could occur as a result of warhead ambiguity , or from the inability to distinguish between a conventionally armed hypersonic weapon and a nuclear - armed one .

however , as a united nations report notes , "even if a state did know that an hgv launched toward it was conventionally armed , it may still view such a weapon as strategic in nature , regardless of how it was perceived by the state firing the weapon , and decide that a strategic response was warranted. .

differences in threat perception and escalation ladders could thus result in unintended escalation .

such concerns have previously led congress to restrict funding for conventional prompt strike programs .

other analysts have argued that the strategic implications of hypersonic weapons are minimal .

pavel podvig , a senior research fellow at the united nations institute for disarmament research , has noted that the weapons "don't â¦ change much in terms of strategic balance and military capability. .

this , some analysts argue , is because u.s. competitors such as china and russia already possess the ability to strike the united states with intercontinental ballistic missiles , which , when launched in salvos , could overwhelm u.s. missile defenses .

furthermore , these analysts note that in the case of hypersonic weapons , traditional principles of deterrence hold: "it is really a stretch to try to imagine any regime in the world that would be so suicidal that it would even think threating to useânot to mention to actually useâhypersonic weapons against the united states ... would end well. .

some analysts who believe that hypersonic weapons could present a threat to strategic stability or inspire an arms race have argued that the united states should take measures to mitigate risks or limit the weapons' proliferation .

proposed measures include expanding new start , negotiating new multilateral arms control agreements , and undertaking transparency and confidence - building measures .

the new start treaty , a strategic offensive arms treaty between the united states and russia , does not currently cover weapons that fly on a ballistic trajectory for less than 50% of their flight , as do hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles .

however , article v of the treaty states that "when a party believes that a new kind of strategic offensive arm is emerging , that party shall have the right to raise the question of such a strategic offensive arm for consideration in the bilateral consultative commission ( bcc ) . .

accordingly , some legal experts hold that the united states could raise the issue in the bcc of negotiating to include hypersonic weapons in the new start limits .

however , because new start is due to expire in 2021 , unless extended through 2026 , this solution is likely to be temporary .

as an alternative , some analysts have proposed negotiating a new international arms control agreement that would institute a moratorium or ban on hypersonic weapon testing .

these analysts argue that a test ban would be a "highly verifiable" and "highly effective" means of preventing a potential arms race and preserving strategic stability .

other analysts have countered that a test ban would be infeasible , as "no clear technical distinction can be made between hypersonic missiles and other conventional capabilities that are less prompt , have shorter ranges , and also have the potential to undermine nuclear deterrence. .

these analysts have instead proposed international transparency and confidence - building measures , such as exchanging weapons data ; conducting joint technical studies ; "providing advance notices of tests ; choosing separate , distinctive launch locations for tests of hypersonic missiles ; and placing restraints on sea - based tests. .
