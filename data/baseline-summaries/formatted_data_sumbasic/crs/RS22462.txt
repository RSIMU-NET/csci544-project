mexico held presidential and congressional elections on july 2 , 2006 .

the presidential vote was the second since the end of the institutional revolutionary party's ( pri ) 71-year authoritarian rule in 2000 .

president vicente fox of the national action party ( pan ) was constitutionally prohibited from seeking re - election .

the three major candidates were populist andrã©s manuel lã³pez obrador of the party of the democratic revolution ( prd ) , conservative felipe calderã³n hinojosa of the pan , and roberto madrazo of the pri .

mexican law requires only a plurality of votes in a presidential race and does not provide for a second round of voting .

after a highly contested election , pan candidate felipe calderã³n was named president - elect of mexico on september 5 , 2006 , and is due to be sworn into office on december 1 , 2006 .

according to the final vote count , calderã³n won just under 36% of the vote , defeating prd candidate andrã©s manuel lã³pez obrador by less than 234,000 votes .

voter turnout was 59% .

although mexico's federal elections institute ( ife ) planned to announce results on july 2 , the vote was too close to call .

at the end of the preliminary vote count , calderã³n held a slight lead over lã³pez obrador , prompting the prd candidate to call for a full recount of the votes .

lã³pez obrador challenged the july election results , alleging fraud at the polling places and illegal interference in the election by president fox and conservative business groups .

mexico's federal electoral tribunal ( tepjf ) , whose decisions cannot be appealed , issued a series of decisions related to fraud allegations in the presidential campaign and vote .

first , it ordered a recount of 9% of polling places in early august .

in a unanimous decision issued august 28 , the tribunal held that although there were some irregularities , the election was fair .

the tribunal annulled nearly 238,000 votes as a result of irregularities .

on september 5 , 2006 , the tribunal ruled unanimously that , although president fox's comments jeopardized the election , they did not amount to illegal interference in the campaign .

the tribunal also found that commercials paid for by business groups at the end of the campaign were illegal but that the impact of the ads was insufficient to warrant the annulment of the presidential election .

as a result of these findings , the tribunal named felipe calderã³n president - elect on september 5 , 2006 .

after the vote , andrã©s manuel lã³pez obrador led a campaign of civil disobedience , including the blockade of mexico city's principal avenue , paseo de la reforma , until mid - september .

it reportedly cost mexico city businesses over $500 million in revenue .

on september 1 , 2006 , prd members of congress prevented president fox from delivering the state of the union address at the mexican congress .

lã³pez obrador rejected the election tribunal's september 5 ruling and was named the "legitimate president" of mexico at a democratic convention held on september 16 at the zocalo , mexico city's main square .

the prd candidate is due to be sworn in as president of a "parallel government" on november 20 .

the convention also created three committees: one responsible for political negotiation , another to coordinate future civil disobedience , and a third to call a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution .

it is not clear how this parallel government will operate or how much support it has .

in mid - september prd founder cuahtã©moc cã¡rdenas criticized lã³pez obrador's tactics as undemocratic and criticized him for surrounding himself with advisors who helped to orchestrate what many believe to be carlos salinas de gortari's fraudulent defeat of cuahtã©moc cã¡rdenas in the 1988 elections .

mexico has a bicameral legislature comprised of a 500-member chamber of deputies and a 128-member senate .

mexican voters elected a completely new congress on july 2 , 2006 .

consecutive re - election is prohibited .

deputies are elected to three - year terms with 300 elected by direct vote and 200 proportionally elected from party lists in five 40-member districts .

senators are elected to six - year terms .

each of mexico's 32 states directly elects three senators ; the two from the slate winning the plurality of votes and the first candidate from the second - place list .

another 32 senators are elected by proportional vote from national party lists .

both the pan and prd gained significant representation in the new congress sworn in on september 1 , 2006 , while the pri was significantly weakened in both houses .

the pri delegation in the chamber of deputies fell from the largest to the third largest ; pri fell to the second largest delegation in the senate .

although the pan is the largest party in both houses , it failed to win a majority .

given the tension between the pan and prd stemming from the presidential election , some analysts believe the pri will be influential in the upcoming congress as the pan delegation seeks additional votes to pass legislation .

the united states and mexico have a multifaceted relationship , with recent emphasis on migration , border security , drug trafficking , trade , and energy policy .

president - elect felipe calderã³n is likely to continue mexico's advocacy for immigration reform in the united states .

differences over migration policy and border security are likely to continue to strain u.s. - mexico relations .

during the campaign , calderã³n indicated his support for legalization of mexicans who have been illegally present in the united states for five years .

he also opposed construction of additional barriers along the u.s. - mexican border .

in september 2006 , president - elect calderã³n charged that the border fence under consideration by the u.s. congress will be ineffective in combating illegal immigration .

in october , the mexican government officially requested that president bush veto the secure fence act of 2006 ( h.r .

6061 ) approved by congress on september 29 , 2006 , that would authorize construction of a border fence along 700 miles of the u.s. - mexico border .

president bush is expected to sign the bill and on october 4 , 2006 , signed the department of homeland security appropriations act for 2007 , which provides $1.2 billion to build the fence .

calderã³n recently re - emphasized his support for the extradition of drug kingpins to the united states and called for mexico's political parties to work together to develop legislative and law enforcement solutions to the drug violence that plagues mexico .

nafta stipulates further opening of agricultural trade in 2008 , including the sensitive bean and corn crops , causing concern in mexico about the potentially adverse effects on domestic production .

president - elect calderã³n indicated during the campaign that he would address these concerns within the nafta framework , in contrast to lã³pez obrador's call to re - open nafta negotiations .

president - elect calderã³n has also proposed the opening of mexico's oil industry to private investment .

president - elect felipe calderã³n pledged to continue the active foreign policy pursued by the fox administration .

during the campaign he expressed hope of restoring mexico's ambassador to venezuela .

calderã³n also presented himself as an alternative regional influence to venezuelan president hugo chã¡vez .

his first trip abroad as president - elect , in early october , was to nine central and south american nations .

calderã³n has indicated that he will re - orient mexico's foreign policy to emphasize its relationships with its southern neighbors .
