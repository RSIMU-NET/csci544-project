the main priorities for u.s. policy regarding haiti during the second session of the 110 th congress are to continue to improve security , promote sustainable economic development , and strengthen fragile democratic processes now that an elected government is in place .

the haitian government and the international donor community are implementing an interim assistance strategy that addresses haiti's many needs simultaneously .

the current challenge is to accomplish short - term projects that will boost public and investor confidence , while at the same time pursuing long - term development plans that will improve living conditions for haiti's vast poor population and construct government institutions capable of providing services and stability .
