rs21828 - - insurance regulation: international developments april 28 , 2004 summary events and entities outside the united states are affecting or may affect the competitiveposition of u.s. insurers , intwo ways .

first , supranational organizations are developing international standards for insurance accounting andfor aspects of supervision , such as reinsurancesupervision .

second , u.s. insurers are operating under a much more fragmented regulatory regime than theircompetitors in other countries , such as the u.k.,that are consolidating and modernizing their supervision .

international standards and regulatory competition areimportant parameters on the u.s. industry'saccess to capital and therefore on its ability to provide innovative and traditional risk financing in the united states .

this report was written under the researchsupervision of barbara miles , government and finance division , and will be updated as events warrant .

economists generally agree that , while capital markets are not perfectly integrated internationally , they are farmore integrated than was true only 20 yearsago .

 ( 1 ) this integration has created pressures forenhancing transparency in the capital markets and for curtailing risks of "contagion. .

 ( 2 ) several supranationalorganizations are addressing these pressures , some specifically with respect to insurance .

new internationalaccounting standards may import new definitionsof "insurance," and new transparency standards for reinsurers may help buyers shop for risk financing .

at the sametime , many other developed countries aresynthesizing their supervision of financial services , while in the united states insurance regulation remainsfragmented .

these trends will likely affect thecompetitive positions of u.s. insurers and reinsurers , though it is not clear presently what the direction and scopeof those changes might be .

the international accounting standards board ( 3 ) ( iasb ) has determined to create principles - based accounting for insurance contracts in two stages .

phase iwas released on march 31 , 2004 , as international financial reporting standard 4 ( ifrs 4 ) .

 ( 4 ) it is scheduled to become effective in the europeanunion ( eu ) on january 1 , 2005 .

european insurers have objected to phase i because , among other things , it would require themto measure derivatives at fair or marketvalue and to show their annual gains and losses on them .

derivatives do not appear on european balance sheetscurrently , as they have little or no initial cost .

u.s. insurers that are publicly traded already measure their derivatives at fair value .

 ( 5 ) u.s. insurers objected to several other aspects of ifrs 4 .

 ( 6 ) phase ii has just begun and will likely be implemented in 2008 .

 ( 7 ) the u.s. standard - setter - - the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) - - hasagreed to work with iasb in converging international and u.s. accounting standards .

 ( 8 ) the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) hasdecided to work closely with the iasb to incorporate its regulatory perspectives into development of phase ii .

 ( 9 ) several issues will have significant effect onthe capital positions of u.s. insurers .

one will be whether and how to measure insurance liabilities at fair value .

another will be whether and how to unbundlevarious kinds of insurance contracts .

insurers are also concerned about how the iasb will treat reserves for lossesand expected investment income andpremium on long - term contracts , among other issues .

they fear that the phase ii rules will lead to greater volatilityin their public disclosures , and thus affecttheir capital positions - - and the market's perception of their capital positions - - unfairly and incorrectly , in theirview .

 ( 10 ) whether those fears are justified orappropriate is unclear at this stage - - but it is clear that phase ii of the iasb's proposals will greatly affect insurers'competitive position in the financialservices sector .

rightly or wrongly , insurance has been identified as "the weakest link in the finance - industry chain. .

 ( 11 ) reinsurance has been identified as "occupyingaposition of systemic importance to the insurance industry ...." ( 12 ) reinsurers lost about $40 billion on september 11 , 2001 , and they lost about that much as theequities bubble burst .

 ( 13 ) financial supervisorsbegan to regard reinsurance - - again , rightly or wrongly - - as a systemic risk .

 ( 14 ) in september 2002 , the financial stability forum ( fsf ) ( 15 ) said that though the reinsurance industry had performed well , fsf members were concerned aboutthe opaqueness of the reinsurance market and of individual reinsurers' disclosures .

it charged the internationalassociation of insurance supervisors ( iais ) with producing data on the market and with enhancing reinsurers' disclosures qualitatively and quantitatively .

 ( 16 ) the iais's task force - - known as task forcere - - submitted its report to the fsf in march 2004 .

 ( 17 ) it described how data on the international reinsurance market will be gathered and published , notedthat the iais has drafted a standard on what non - life reinsurers should disclose about their technical performance,and said that iais would be preparing globalreinsurance market reports .

 ( 18 ) data on u.s.reinsurers will be compiled by the naic and will likely be available to the treasury , the federal reserve board,and the sec .

 ( 19 ) the fsf , in receiving the report,urged that "more work be done in this complex area. .

 ( 20 ) in october 2003 , the iais adopted a new standard on supervising reinsurers .

 ( 21 ) the standard addresses reinsurers' risk management , relations with its cedinginsurers , investments and liquidity , economic capital requirements , and corporate governance .

it also imposes onthe home supervisor of an internationallyactive reinsurer the obligation to share information about that reinsurer with other ( "host" ) supervisors .

it expresslycontemplates "a global supervisoryframework" based on "a system of accreditation of home supervisors"and this standard .

 ( 22 ) though iais has begun a survey of its members' supervision ofreinsurers , it has not fixed a timetable for creating a global regulatory regime for reinsurers .

 ( 23 ) .

some developed nations have unified their own supervisory regimes for financial services .

comprehensiveregulatory reform of financial services began inaustralia in 1996 .

since then the u.k. , germany , and japan have also unified their national supervisory regimesfor all financial services sectors .

each countryhas taken a slightly different approach .

australia formed one agency to craft and administer consistent andcomparable disclosure requirements for a broadrange of products , including deposit accounts , securities , insurance products , and pensions .

it formed anotheragency to perform prudential supervision forbank and non - bank financial intermediaries .

germany unified financial supervision of banks , securities , andinsurance into one regulatory agency to achieveconsistent supervision of different sectors and of cross - sectoral issues .

japan's new financial services agency,which reports directly to the prime minister'soffice , supervises banks , private insurers , securities , and securities markets .

 ( 24 ) perhaps of greatest interest - - because it is most accessible - - is the u.k.'s undertaking to unify its supervision of financial services .

the unification processbegan in 1997 , and the new financial services authority ( fsa ) acquired its full powers in 2001 .

it now regulatesbanking , insurance , pensions , and securities,though the process of integrating those functions continues .

 ( 25 ) the fsa's enabling legislation gave it four objectives - - maintaining market confidence,promoting public awareness , protecting consumers , and reducing financial crime .

in pursuing those objectives , thefsa is directed to: use its resources in the most efficient and effective manner ; recognize that a firm's senior management bears ultimate responsibility for its risk management andinternalcontrols ; make sure that burdens imposed on firms and markets are in proportion to the expected benefits forconsumers and theindustry ; facilitate innovation in the financial services markets ; acknowledge the "international character of financial services and markets and the desirability ofmaintaining the competitive position ofthe united kingdom ; " ( 26 ) minimize regulation's adverse effects on competition ; and promote competition among regulated entities .

 ( 27 ) according to the fsa , the "insurance sector is a key part of the uk financial services industry .

it is important , both from an economic and social perspective,that the uk has an insurance market that operates effectively [and] remains competitive in european and worldmarkets...." ( 28 ) according to the fsa , itscreation "as a single regulator highlighted differences between the regulation of insurance and other sectors inrespect of similar types of risks. .

 ( 29 ) accordingly,it has undertaken a major overhaul of insurance regulation to strengthen it and "to establish a common , risk - basedapproach to regulation across all financialsectors. .

 ( 30 ) in revising its insurance regulation , the fsa has cooperated closely with and contributed to both the formulation of eu directives on insurance and reinsuranceas well as iais standards .

the eu's financial services action plan ( fsap ) , due to be completed next year , containsdirectives that will directly affect therelative competitive positions of u.s. and u.k. insurers including lloyds .

 ( 31 ) in addition , the european commission ( ec ) has proposed a directive onreinsurance that would allow a reinsurer domiciled and licensed in an eu country , under the new standards , to dobusiness throughout the eu without furtherregulation or collateral .

the directive is intended to , among other things , improve access to foreign markets - - particularly the united states .

 ( 32 ) unified supervision of financial services may not be successful .

certainly neither australia's nor the u.k.'s financial supervisory authority has been free fromfailures .

the efforts are noteworthy , however , for two reasons .

one is that their changes may , like the proposedeu directive on reinsurance , directly affect thecompetitive positions of u.s. insurers and reinsurers .

the other is their express emphasis on maintaining thecompetitiveness of their domestic insurers in aworldwide market .

 ( 33 ) .

representative oxley , chairman of the house financial service committee , has outlined a road - map toinsurance regulatory reform .

he and representativebaker , chairman of the subcommittee on capital markets , insurance and government - sponsored entities , haveproposed achieving uniformity in some aspectsof state - based insurance regulation by imposing federal standards but not federal regulation .

 ( 34 ) chairman oxley , in expressing his support forsuch reforms,said that " ( i ) nsurers are facing increasing competition from other financial services sectors which have significantlylower regulatory costs... .

if insurers cannotraise new capital , this marketplace is at risk for a major collapse .

without change , consumers face a world withfewer options , less competition , and lesscoverage. .

 ( 35 ) at the subcommittee's hearing onmarch 31 , 2004 , representative kanjorski expressed support for those goals and initial doubt about whetherthe proposal as outlined could achieve them .

senator hollings , ranking member of the senate committee oncommerce , science , and transportation hasintroduced s. 1373 , the insurance consumer protection act , to mandate federal regulation of insurance .

as congress continues its efforts to modernize insurance regulation , entities in other countries are taking steps that will affect the competitive positions of u.s.insurers .

the naic is working closely with congress to assist in its efforts .

it is also working closely withinternational entities , particularly the iais , todevelop new international standards for insurance regulation .

it remains to be seen whether or how all these effortswill coordinate for the benefit of the unitedstates as a whole .
