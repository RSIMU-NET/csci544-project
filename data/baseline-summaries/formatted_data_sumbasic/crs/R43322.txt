a national security letter ( nsl ) is roughly comparable to an administrative subpoena .

an nsl needs no prior judicial approval .

intelligence agencies issue them for intelligence gathering purposes to telephone companies , internet service providers , consumer credit reporting agencies , banks , and other financial institutions , directing the recipients to turn over certain customer records and similar information .

the 111 th and 112 th congresses as well as the 113 th congress saw a number of proposals to amend nsl authority .

none were enacted .

in the 112 th congress , they were closely associated with the scheduled expiration of various provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) .

in the 113 th congress , they were often grouped with legislation that addressed the exercise of fisa authority .

the house passed such a bill , h.r .

3361 , and many of its features were included in s. 2685 .

s. 2685 , however , failed to secure the three - fifths vote necessary for cloture .

congress took no final action on s. 2685 , h.r .

3361 , or any other nsl proposal prior to adjournment .

prior to the usa patriot act , the nsl statutes were four .

one , 18 u.s.c .

2709 , obligated communications providers to supply certain customer information upon the written request of the director of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) or a senior fbi headquarters official .

when customer identity , length of service , and toll records were sought , the letters had to certify ( 1 ) that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation and ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe the information pertained to a foreign power or its agents .

when only customer identity and length of service records ( but not toll records ) were sought , the letters had to certify ( 1 ) again that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation , but ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the customer information pertained to use of the provider's facilities to communicate with foreign powers , their agents , or those engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities .

in like manner a second statute , section 1114 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the right to financial privacy act , obligated financial institutions to provide the fbi with customers' financial records upon written certification of the fbi director or his designee ( 1 ) that the records were sought for foreign counterintelligence purposes and ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the records were those of a foreign power or its agents .

and so it was with a third , section 626 of the fair credit report act , which obligated consumer credit reporting agencies to provide customer identification , and the names and addresses of financial institutions at which a designated consumer maintained accounts .

here too , the obligation was triggered by written certification of the fbi director or his designee ( 1 ) that the information was necessary for a foreign counterintelligence investigation , and ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the consumer was either a foreign power , a foreign official , or the agent of a foreign power and was engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities .

the fourth , section 802 of the national security act , was a bit different .

it reached a wider range of potential recipients at the demand of a large group of federal officials , but for a more limited purpose .

it rested the obligation to provide consumer reports , together with financial information and records , upon consumer reporting agencies , financial agencies , and financial institutions , or holding companies .

the requirement was triggered by the certification of senior officials of law enforcement and intelligence agencies , but confined to information pertaining to federal employees with access to classified information and being sought for clearance purposes and inquiries into past or potential security leaks .

bills in 113 th congress that would have amended the nsl statutes and related provisions proposed adjustments in four areas: ( 1 ) the grounds for issuing an nsl ; ( 2 ) confidentiality requirements , enforcement , and judicial review ; ( 3 ) reports and audits ; and ( 4 ) sunset and repeal .

some were focused on a single category ; others were more comprehensive .
