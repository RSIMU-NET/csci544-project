rs21815 - - fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of 2004 ( s. 2290 , 108th congress ) updated january 21 , 200 .

"any individual [or , if he is deceased , his personal representative] who has suffered from a[n eligible] disease or condition .

 .

 .

may file a claim with the office for an award with respectto such injury" ( � 113 ( a ) ) .

the claimant would have to "prove , by a preponderance of the evidence , that he suffersfrom an eligible disease or condition" ( � 111 ( 2 ) ) .

he would not haveto prove that his injury "resulted from the negligence or other fault of any person" ( � 112 ) .

the statute of limitations would be four years from the date the claimant first "received a medical diagnosis of an eligible disease or condition," or "discovered facts that would have leda reasonable person to obtain a medical diagnosis with respect to an eligible disease or condition" ( � 113 ( b ) ( 1 ) ) .

if,however , a claimant had filed a timely claim that was pending infederal or state court on the date of enactment of the bill , such claim would have to be dismissed , and the statuteof limitations to file a claim under the bill would be four years from thedate of enactment of the bill ( � 113 ( b ) ( 2 ) ) .

"not later than 90 days after the filing of a claim , the administrator shall provide to the claimant ( and the claimant's representative ) a proposed decision accepting or rejecting the claimin whole or in part and specifying the amount of the proposed award , if any" ( � 114 ( b ) ) .

any claimant not satisfiedwith the proposed decision of the administrator would be entitled , onwritten request made within 90 days , to a hearing or to a review of the written record , by a representative of theadministrator" ( � 114 ( c ) ) .

after a hearing or review , or if no hearing orreview is requested within 90 days , the administrator would issue a final decision ( � 114 ( d ) ) .

a claimant wouldthen have 90 days to petition for judicial review of the final decision ( �302 ( a ) ) .

review would be by the u.s. court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant resides at the time ofthe issuance of the final order ( � 302 ( b ) ) .

the court would uphold thedecision unless it determined "that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence , is contrary to law , or is notin accordance with procedure required by law" ( � 302 ( c ) ) .

the administrator would "establish a comprehensive asbestos claimant assistance program" ( � 104 ( a ) ) , including a "legal assistance program" ( � 104 ( d ) ) .

attorneys could charge nomore than 2 percent of the amount of the award for filing an initial claim , and "10 percent with respect to any claimunder appellate review" ( � 104 ( e ) ) .

the term "appellate review" isnot defined , so it is not clear whether it would include both the hearing or review by the representative of theadministrator , and judicial review .

the amount of an award under s. 2290 would be determined pursuant to the benefit table in section 131 ( b ) , which prescribes different amounts for different medicalconditions , and , in cases of lung cancer , different amounts for smokers , nonsmokers , and ex - smokers , as it definesthose terms .

 ( 5 ) beginning in 2006 , awards would beincreasedannually by a cost - of - living adjustment ( � 131 ( b ) ( 5 ) ) .

awards "shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation" ( � 134 ( a ) ) .

but the term "collateral source compensation" would refer only to "the compensation that theclaimant received , or is entitled to receive , from a defendant or an insurer of that defendant , or compensation trustas a result of a judgment or settlement for an asbestos - related injurythat is the subject of a claim filed under section 113" ( � 3 ( 6 ) ) .

s. 2290 provides explicitly that collateralsource compensation would not include workers' compensation orveterans benefits ( � 134 ( b ) ) , but it would apparently also not include any other compensation , such as disability orhealth insurance payments , or medicare or medicaid , that was not paidby "a defendant or an insurer of that defendant , or compensation trust. .

a claimant , in other words , could receiveall these amounts in addition to his award from the asbestos injuryclaims resolution fund .

asbestos claimants would not receive lump - sum awards , but "should receive the amount of the award through structured payments from the fund , made over a period of three years , andin no event more than four years after the date of final adjudication of the claim" ( � 133 ( a ) ( 1 ) ) .

the asbestos resolution claims fund would be paid for by "defendant participants" and "insurer participants. .

defendant participants would apparently be companies that have beensued for injuries caused by exposure to asbestos , and insurer participants would be the insurers of suchcompanies .

 ( 6 ) subject to a "contingent call formandatory additional payments" ( �204 ( m ) ) , "the total payments required of all defendant participants over the life of the fund shall not exceed" $57.5billion ( �202 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) .

"[t]he aggregate annual payments of defendantparticipants" would be at least $2.5 billion for the first 23 years of the fund , unless the $57.5 billion is receivedsooner ( � 204 ( h ) ( 1 ) ) .

after the $57.5 billion has been paid , theadministrator could , if necessary , issue a contingent call for mandatory additional payments of up to an aggregatemaximum of $10 billion .

the administrator would first , however,have to publish a notice in the federal register and consider comments from defendant participants on the necessityof additional payments ( � 204 ( m ) ) .

"the total payment required of all insurer participants over the life of the fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000" ( � 212 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( a ) ) .

insurer participants would pay prescribed amountsfor 27 years ( � 212 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( c ) ) .

the united states government would not be liable for any asbestos claims , even ifthe fund is inadequate to pay them ( � 406 ( b ) ) .

the administrator would be authorized to sue any participant for failure to pay any liability imposed under the bill .

in addition to the amount due , the administrator could seek punitivedamages , the costs of the suit , "including reasonable fees incurred for collection , expert witnesses , and attorney'sfees," and "a fine equal to the total amount of the liability that has notbeen collected" ( � 223 ( c ) ) .

"at any time after seven years following the date on which the administrator begins processing claims , if the administrator determines that .

 .

 .

the fund will not have sufficientresources," then the fund would sunset ( � 405 ( f ) ) .

if the fund sunsets , then claimants could again file or pursuelawsuits .

"[t]he applicable statute of limitations" would be deemedtolled for the time during which a claim had been pursued against the fund , and "the applicable statute of limitationswould apply , except that claimants who filed a claim against thefund" before sunset would have two years after sunset to file a claim ( � 405 ( f ) ( 6 ) ) .

claims would have to be filedin federal district court , and "federal common law" would govern,"except that where national uniformity is not required the court must utilize otherwise applicable state law .

 .

have prior asbestos expenditures greater than$1,000,000" ( � 202 ( b ) ) .

a "debtor" would be defined as a company,including its subsidiaries , that has filed in bankruptcy within a year preceding enactment of the bill , but a "debtor"would not include a company whose bankruptcy had been finallyadjudicated ( � 201 ( 3 ) ) .

the term "prior asbestos expenditures" - - the amount of which would determine the amount that a defendant participant would have to contribute to the fund - - would be defined as"the gross total amount paid .
