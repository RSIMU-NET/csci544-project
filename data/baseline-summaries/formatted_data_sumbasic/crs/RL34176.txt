the inspector general act , as amended , will reach its 30 th anniversary in 2008 , and today there are more than 60 offices of inspectors general ( oigs ) .

this longevity and growth built on the efforts of the committee on oversight and government reform ( then the committee on government operations ) in spearheading their origination , beginning in 1976 .

substantial bipartisan and bicameral support was necessary at their creation , given the across - the - board opposition by executive agencies early on , and for their continued development .

there are two types of inspectors general ( igs ) : ( 1 ) federal establishment igs are appointed by the president with senate confirmation , and may be removed only by the president except in the case of impeachment ; and ( 2 ) designated federal entity ( dfe ) igs are appointed and removed by the agency head in usually smaller agencies .

the establishing mandates and statutory supports for the igs provide a useful vantage point to view the current proposals to modify the igs , their statutory powers and political power .

in combating waste , fraud , and abuse , igs have been granted a substantial amount of independence , authority , and resources .

in combination , these assets are probably greater than those held by any similar internal auditing - investigating office at any level of government , here or abroad , now or in the past .

some of these purposes and powers of the igs include their charges to conduct and supervise audits and investigations within an agency ; provide leadership and coordination for recommending policies and activities to promote the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of programs and operations ; have access to agency information and files and subpoena power for records and documents ; receive complaints from agency employees whose identities are to remain confidential ( with certain stated exceptions ) ; implement the cash incentive award program for employee disclosures of waste , fraud , and abuse ; hold independent law enforcement authority in offices in establishments ; receive a separate appropriations account for offices in establishments ; be appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in relevant professions ( for establishment igs and the ig for the u.s .

postal service ) ; remain in office without term or tenure limits ; report suspected violations of federal criminal law immediately and directly to the attorney general ; and operate under only the "general supervision" of the agency head , who is prohibited ( with only a few express exceptions ) from preventing or prohibiting an ig from initiating or carrying out an audit or investigation .

along with these , igs have critical reporting requirements to keep the agency head and congress "fully and currently informed" through specified reports and otherwise ( which includes testifying at hearings and meeting with members and staff ) .

the reports include semi - annual reports as well as immediate reports regarding "particularly serious or flagrant problems. .

for both types , the ig reports are submitted to the agency head who transmits them unaltered , but with comments deemed necessary , to congress within a designated period of time .

the resulting connections between the igs and congress not only enhance legislative oversight capabilities , but also provide an avenue for potential support for ig findings , conclusions , and recommendations for corrective action .

h.r .

928 and s. 1723 attempt to address recent , and in some cases , longstanding , congressional concerns regarding oigs .

despite their institutional arrangements and authorities , modifications to the ig act have been seen as useful to enhance the ig's independence and power .

along these lines is the wide range of proposed changes in these two bills .

their overarching theme is to strengthen and clarify the authority , tenure , resources , oversight , and independence of the inspectors general .

the bills' specific proposals and considerations set up additional protections for igs , including "for cause" removal and terms of office ; consolidation and codification of two existing councils established by executive order into a single council of the inspectors general on integrity and efficiency ; the reporting of the ig's initial budget and appropriations estimates to the office of management and budget , the agency head , and congressional committees ; program evaluation in ig semi - annual reports ; and the grant of law enforcement authority to igs in designated federal entities .

additionally , h.r .

928 , as passed by the house , and s. 1723 would require that dfe igs , like their establishment ig counterparts , be appointed "without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting , auditing , financial analysis , law , management analysis , public administration , or investigations. .

the bush administration has taken exception to several provisions in h.r .

928 âremoval for cause , transmittal of budget requests to congress , and an independent ig councilâand , on october 1 , 2007 , threatened a veto of the legislation .

in the face of this threat , the house passed h.r .

928 by a veto - proof margin on october 3 , 2007 .

while the version of h.r .

928 passed by the house and s. 1723 are identical in most respects , other than those provisions discussed above , s. 1723 adds several provisions .

first , s. 1723 would require both establishment and designated federal entity igs "to appoint a counsel to the inspector general who shall report to the inspector general. .

second , s. 1723 states the mission of the cigie differently from the one stated in h.r .

928 .

previously , both bills called on the cigie to "increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies , standards , and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well - trained and highly skilled workforce in the offices of the inspectors general. .

however , the version of h.r .

928 passed by the house eliminated this language .

s. 1723 includes the above language and would expand the council's mission to "address integrity , economy , and effectiveness issues that transcend individual government agencies. .

currently , the mission of the cigie as expressed in the version of h.r .

928 passed by the house is "to coordinate and enhance governmental efforts to promote integrity and efficiency and to detect and prevent fraud , waste , and abuse in federal programs. .

finally , the house - passed h.r .

928 addresses a concern raised in the bush administration's veto threat: "that disclosure protections regarding the witness security program apply to the department of justice's inspector general's internal investigative procedures and release of information. .

the administration argued that the release of specific program information could put the safety of witnesses at risk , in addition to endangering program personnel and the program itself .

the house - passed bill would eliminate a referral of "allegations of misconduct involving department attorneys , investigators , or law enforcement personnel , where the allegations relate to the exercise of the authority of an attorney to investigate , litigate , or provide legal advice" by the doj ig to the counsel , office of professional responsibility of doj .

s. 1723 does not include this provision .

these two billsâ h.r .

928 and s. 1723 âare designed to provide broad - based , across - the - board initiatives to enhance the independence and accountability of the inspectors general operating under the inspector general act of 1978 , as amended .

this would occur through changes in the removal of igs , notification of the oig budget requests to congress , fixing a term of office for the igs , and establishing a council on integrity and efficiency as well as an integrity committee , replacing counterparts created by executive order .

in the 110 th congress , the house has passed h.r .

928 , while the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs has held hearings on proposals along these same lines .
