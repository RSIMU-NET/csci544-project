epa was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities that had been divided among several federal agencies .

epa's responsibilities grew significantly as congress enacted an increasing number of environmental laws as well as major amendments to these statutes .

among the agency's primary responsibilities are the regulation of air quality , water quality , pesticides , and toxic substances ; regulation of the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes ; and the cleanup of environmental contamination .

epa also awards grants to assist states and local governments in ensuring compliance with federal requirements to control pollution .

since fy2006 , congress has funded epa programs and activities within the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill .

from fy1996 to fy2013 , epa's funding had been requested by the administration and appropriated by congress under eight statutory accounts .

a ninth account , hazardous waste electronic manifest system fund , was added during the fy2014 budget process .

p.l .

113-235 ( h.r .

83 ) , the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 , was signed into law on december 16 , 2014 .

the act included 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills .

p.l .

113-235 ( h.r .

83 ) provided a total of $8.14 billion for epa in title ii of division f — department of the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations act , 2015 .

the total epa appropriation for fy2015 is $249.9 million above the president's fy2015 request of $7.89 billion but $60.1 million less than the fy2014 enacted level of $8.20 billion .

no regular interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bills for fy2015 were passed by the house or senate appropriations committees prior to the end of the fiscal year .

however , the house committee on appropriations reported h.r .

5171 , and the senate subcommittee released a chairman's draft that formed the basis for negotiating the enacted levels in p.l .

113-235 .

this report briefly summarizes actions on the fy2015 appropriations for epa and presents a breakout of the fy2015 enacted appropriations for the agency by each of the nine appropriations accounts and by selected programs and activities within those accounts that received more prominent attention in the congressional debate .

the discussions and tables presented in this report compare the fy2015 enacted appropriations for epa to fy2015 levels proposed in the president's fy2015 budget request , the house committee reported bill and senate subcommittee draft , and the fy2014 enacted appropriations .

the joint explanatory statement accompanying the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( issued in the december 11 , 2014 , congressional record ) is the primary source of information presented in this report for the fy2015 enacted appropriations , the president's fy2015 budget request , and the fy2014 enacted appropriations unless otherwise specified .

information regarding the house committee reported bill is from the accompanying report h.rept .

113-551 ; information regarding the senate subcommittee chairman's draft is from the accompanying explanatory statement .

 table 1 presents the fy2015 amounts for epa enacted under title ii of division f of p.l .

113-235 compared to amounts approved by the house appropriations committee in h.r .

5171 , recommended in the senate subcommittee chairman's draft , requested in the president's fy2015 budget request , and enacted for fy2014 for the nine statutory accounts that fund the agency .

the fy2015 enacted appropriations included both decreases and increases compared to the amounts proposed for 2015 and the 2014 enacted levels for individual programs and activities funded within each of the epa appropriations accounts not specified in the bill itself but identified in the explanatory statement as reported in the congressional record .

the explanatory statement also provided direction to epa in implementing various aspects of individual programs and activities in its report .

the administrative provisions in title ii of division f of p.l .

113-325 included a rescission of $40.0 million from unobligated balances previously appropriated to carry out projects and activities funded through the state and tribal assistance grants ( stag ) account .

the provision further specified that no amounts are to be rescinded from amounts that congress stipulated as emergency requirements pursuant to a concurrent resolution on the budget or the balanced budget and emergency deficit act of 1985 .

the president's fy2015 request had proposed a $5.0 million rescission of unobligated balances of prior epa appropriations from the stag account with the same restrictions .

the fy2014 enacted appropriations did not include rescissions of unobligated balances of epa prior fiscal years' appropriations , whereas epa appropriations beginning in fy2006 through fy2013 did include them .

the following sections highlight funding issues associated with certain accounts and program activities that have been prominent in the debate on epa's fy2015 appropriations .

concerns regarding epa's fy2015 funding focused particularly on prioritization and adequacy of funding for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects ; categorical grants to assist states in implementing federal pollution control laws ; implementation of air quality and climate change regulations , research , and related activities ; and federal financial assistance for environmental cleanup of superfund and brownfields sites .

there was also interest in funding for geographic - specific water quality initiatives ( eg , the great lakes restoration initiative and efforts to restore the chesapeake bay ) .

in addition , several epa regulatory actions received considerable attention during house and senate oversight committee hearings , appropriations committee hearings , and house appropriations committee markup of the fy2015 appropriations .

 figure 1 below provides a trend in epa's authorized "full time equivalent" ( fte ) employment ceiling from fy2001 through fy2014 , and as requested for fy2015 as reported in the epa fy2015 congressional justification .

the fy2015 requested level of 15,325 is reportedly the lowest since fy1989 .

information prior to fy2001 is available on epa's budget and planning website at http: / / www2.epa.gov / planandbudget / budget .

also , in march 2000 , the government accountability office ( gao ) reported that epa ftes increased by about 18% from fy1990 through fy1999 , with the largest increase ( 13% , from 15,277 to 17,280 ftes ) occurring from fy1990 though fy1993 .

from fy1993 through fy1999 , gao indicated that epa's ftes grew at a more moderate rate: less than 1% per year .

as indicated in figure 1 , with the exception of increases in four fiscal years , the general trend has been downward since fy2001 .

appendix a .

funding prohibitions proposed in h.r .

5171 as reported but not retained in p.l .

113-235 a number of epa regulatory actions and related issues were the focus of considerable debate regarding epa's fy2015 appropriations .

more than a dozen provisions directed at epa were included in the general provisions in title iv of h.r .

5171 as reported by the house appropriations committee , including several that would have prohibited or restricted the use of appropriated funds .

as noted earlier in this report ( see " funding restrictions / prohibitions " ) relatively few of the prohibitive provisions proposed in the house committee reported bill were retained in the consolidated and further appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 ) .

the proposed provisions , if enacted , generally would have restricted or prohibited the use of funds as appropriated in the bill ( and in some cases "other acts" ) to carry out certain epa regulatory actions across the various environmental pollution control statutes .

the funding prohibitions proposed in h.r .

5171 but not retained in p.l .

113-235 would have impacted various ongoing and anticipated epa activities , including epa's proposed standards for reducing ghg emissions from existing and new ( or substantially modified ) stationary sources and a proposed rule intended to clarify jurisdictional issues and the definition of navigable waters under the clean water act .

other provisions proposed in the house committee reported bill would have limited any epa activities that would address lead - based paint removal , the definitions of the terms ''fill material'' or ''discharge of fill material" under the clean water act , and financial responsibility with respect to superfund cleanup .

an amendment adopted during the markup would have prohibited epa from using funds to finalize a rule entitled "administrative wage garnishment" ( 79 federal register 37704 et seq. , july 2 , 2014 ) .

descriptions of selected provisions included in h.r .

5171 but not retained in the consolidated and further appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

appendix b .

historical funding trends table b - 1 presents the level of fy2008-fy2014 enacted appropriations for epa by each of the agency's statutory accounts .

epa's funding over the long term has generally reflected an increase in overall appropriations to fulfill a rising number of statutory responsibilities .

epa's historical funding trends tend to parallel the evolution of the agency's responsibilities over time , as congress has enacted legislation to authorize the agency to develop and administer programs and activities in response to a range of environmental issues and concerns .

in terms of the overall federal budget , epa's annual appropriations have represented a relatively small portion of the total discretionary federal budget ( just under 1% in recent years ) .

without adjusting for inflation , epa's funding has grown from $1.0 billion when epa was established in fy1970 to a peak funding level of $14.86 billion in fy2009 .

this peak includes regular fiscal year appropriations of $7.64 billion provided for fy2009 in p.l .

111-8 and the supplemental appropriations of $7.22 billion provided for fy2009 in p.l .

111-5 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 .

however , in real dollar values ( adjusted for inflation ) , epa's funding in fy1978 was slightly more than the level in fy2009 .
