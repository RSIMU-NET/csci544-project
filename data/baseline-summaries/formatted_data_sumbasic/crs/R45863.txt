the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology presents both challenges and opportunities to the energy sector .

cryptocurrencies , such as bitcoin , are sometimes referred to as virtual currency , a term that can also refer to a broader class of electronic money .

a blockchain is a digital ledger that enables parties to agree on the current ownership and distribution of assets in order to conduct new business .

when applied to cryptocurrencies , the blockchain allows the validation of transactions to occur by a decentralized network of computers .

as cryptocurrencies ( such as bitcoin , the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization ) have increased in popularity , the energy demand to support cryptocurrency mining activities has also increased .

the state of washington , by some estimates , hosted 15% - 30% of all bitcoin mining operations globally in 2018 .

when such increases in energy demand for cryptocurrency mining occur at a local level , the resulting peak loads may increase customers' electricity rates depending on pricing structure .

however , not all cryptocurrencies require energy - intensive operations .

outside of cryptocurrencies , opportunities arising from blockchain technologies could include facilitating energy and financial transactions on a smart grid .

this report explains how cryptocurrency is "mined," where mining activity is concentrated , how some states and utilities are responding to localized increases in energy demand from bitcoin mining facilities , and potential considerations for congress .

considerations for congress include potential policy options to address energy conservation and energy efficiency standards as well as options for blockchain technology in the energy sector .

this report is part of a suite of crs products on cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology , distributed ledger technology , and blockchain ( see textbox below ) .

blockchain provides a means of transacting among parties who may not otherwise trust one another .

blockchain networks allow for individuals engaging in transactions to also be the ones to validate them .

cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin , ether , alpha coin , and papyrus provide a means of validating transactions in a decentralized network that is outside of an intermediary , such as a bank for financial transactions or a title company for a real estate transaction .

this validation can be done in bulk and at relatively high speeds , making cryptocurrency an attractive avenue for certain financial transactions .

cryptocurrencies are built to allow the exchange of some digital asset of value ( the cryptocurrency ) for a good or service .

bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency , garnering the largest market share , and bitcoin arguably initiated the interest in blockchain technology .

blockchain uses a combination of technologies to work .

these technologies include encryption and peer - to - peer ( p2p ) networks .

transactions are added to a blockchain in an addition - only manner .

once added , a transaction cannot be altered , providing a layer of security and transparency .

transactions are grouped together to form a tranche , or "block. .

blocks are added to a blockchain in a manner that links it to the previous block , so any change data in a previous block makes that change known to users immediately as they try to add a new block .

encryption is used to ensure that parties trading assets on a blockchain have rights to that asset , and that data held in the blockchain is tamper resistant .

p2p networks are used to distribute information across participating users without a central authority acting as an arbiter of that information .

cryptocurrency mining requires energy to ( 1 ) operate the devices computing the calculations required to maintain the integrity of the blockchain and ( 2 ) thermally regulate the devices for optimal operation .

a node , or computing system , on the blockchain may be composed of an individual user or a group of users that have pooled resources ; as such , the exact number of connected devices on the network is unknown .

devices have different hashratesâthe number of calculations ( or hash functions ) performed on the network per secondâand have different power requirements .

devices with greater hashrates can perform more calculations in the same amount of time than devices with lesser hashrates .

for example , "a hashrate of 14 terahashes [14 trillion attempted mining solutions] per second can either come from a single antminer s9 running on just 1,372 w [watts] , or more than half a million sony playstation - 3 devices running on 40 mw [megawattsâmillion watts]. .

there are four main factors that contribute to energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining: 1. hardware computing power ; 2. network hashrate ; 3. the difficulty ; and 4. the thermal regulation for the hardware .

these factors , some of which also interact with the price of bitcoin , can alter the energy intensity of mining .

for instance , in december 2017 , the price of bitcoin rose creating an influx of mining .

as the mining network grew , the difficulty and hashrate increased .

miners sought out more powerful equipment as the competition increased , which consumed more energy .

several studies have examined the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies .

while technology advancements in devices used for bitcoin mining have led to increases in the hashrates of mining devices ( i.e. , improved device efficiency ) , the network hashrate has also increased as the popularity of bitcoin increased .

according to one recent estimate , as of "mid - march 2018 , about 26 quintillion hashing operations are performed every second and non - stop by the bitcoin network. .

estimating the power consumption of the global bitcoin network depends upon the efficiency of different hardware , the number of machines in use , and the cooling requirements for large - scale mining facilities .

table 1 presents various estimates for the power required by the bitcoin network .

generally , these estimates use hashrates and miner hashing efficiencies to determine energy consumption .

one study relied upon hardware data derived from initial public offering ( ipo ) filings to estimate power consumption .

fewer studies have examined power requirements for other cryptocurrencies ( bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency platform in both currency in circulation and transactions processed ) , although those studies have found comparatively lower power requirements than for bitcoin .

global power requirement estimates for bitcoin have increased within the last five years .

for comparison , the largest estimate of 7,670 mw in table 1 is nearly 1% of u.s. electricity generating capacity ( or approximately 0.1% of global electricity generating capacity ) .

opinions differ on whether future growth in bitcoin will significantly impact energy consumption and subsequent carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) emissions .

some argue that sustainability concerns due to energy consumption are misplaced , and that the competitiveness of bitcoin mining means that only miners with the most competitive mining hardware and the lowest electricity costs will persist over time .

further , this could lead to fewer miners using energy inefficient hardware , as they may no longer be able to compete effectively .

some anticipate that energy demands will diminish as the reward incentive shifts from discovering new bitcoin to earning revenue through transaction fees .

as a result , some would argue that the energy consumption from mining bitcoin is a temporary issue .

others recognize the volatility of cryptocurrency markets but observe that network hashrates of several cryptocurrencies have trended upward suggesting that energy consumption ( and subsequent co 2 emissions ) will increase .

however , these estimates do not include energy required for cooling systems and other operations and maintenance activities associated with cryptocurrency mining .

one study on projections of bitcoin growth considered the potential effects on global co 2 emissions should bitcoin eventually replace other cashless transactions .

the study found that the associated energy consumption of bitcoin usage could potentially produce enough co 2 emissions to lead to a 2 o c increase in global mean average within 30 years .

these projections assume that the global portfolio of fuel types ( and subsequent co 2 emissions ) used to generate electricity remains fixed according to portfolio profiles from 2014 and does not consider that , in many cases , bitcoin is often mined in areas with plentiful and affordable renewable energy .

further , the projections do not consider any potential effects of a collapse of bitcoin prices on hashrates or energy consumption , and whether the capital invested in bitcoin mining could be used for other cryptocurrencies or for other purposes .

projections of continued growth in energy consumption led some to call for reform in the cryptocurrency industry .

others argue that continued reliance on fossil - fuel - based electricity is the important issue and not the energy intensity of bitcoin .

several factors contribute to ideal mining locations and include energy costs , regulations , and technology .

often the energy costs are affected by geographical characteristics like proximity to hydroelectric power or lower ambient temperature that reduces the need for cooling .

local and national governments around the world have responded differently to the growth of bitcoin: some are actively developing cryptocurrency industries , some are restricting cryptocurrencies , and some are regulating cryptocurrencies in an effort to balance financial innovation and risk management .

according to a study in 2017 , nearly three - quarters of all major mining pools are based in either china ( 58% ) or in the united states ( 16% ) .

some countries and regions where significant cryptocurrency mining activities have been identified include australia , canada , georgia , russia , and sweden , as shown in figure 1 .

china has taken steps to regulate and tax the trading of bitcoin , and has even proposed implementing a ban on mining .

as of april 2019 , it was reported that the national development and reform commission , deemed mining as a "wasteful and hazardous" activity .

china's share of major mining pools may change substantially in response to regulations and policy actions .

in 2013 , the chinese government reportedly restricted chinese banks from using cryptocurrencies as currency , citing concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability .

in september 2017 , beijing declared that initial coin offerings ( ico ) were illegal and that all mainland cryptocurrency exchanges be shut down .

in january 2018 , china's leading group of internet financial risks remediation submitted a request to local governments to regulate electricity , taxes , and land use for mining companies , and "guide the orderly exit of such companies from the bitcoin mining business. .

since the implementation of these regulatory measures , bitcoin trading with the chinese yuan has reportedly dropped from 90% of global bitcoin trading to under 1% .

however , as illustrated in figure 1 , china , despite changes in regulation , remained a popular location for mining in 2018 , partly due to the comparatively low cost of energy .

the generation sources that provide low cost electricity to cryptocurrency miners in china vary regionally .

in some regions , the electricity likely is provided from fossil fuel sources ; for example , in inner mongolia where cryptocurrency miners have been active , thermal power represents 63% of the electric capacity .

cryptocurrency mining includes costs associated with equipment , facilities , labor , and electricity .

mining pool companies around the world therefore seek cheap , reliable electricity .

while many mining pools are still in china , some have been able to utilize closed industrial facilities in the united states that can provide abundant electricity at affordable rates .

as miners are not typically bound by geographic location , locations with favorable electricity rates and policies may encourage operations .

conversely , locations with restrictive regulations or high electricity prices may discourage mining operations .

in the united states , the sale of electricity is governed by a patchwork of federal , state , and local regulations .

for the sale of electricity , the states generally have regulatory jurisdiction over retail electricity transactions , though federal and municipal authorities may also play a role .

state approaches to regulation vary considerably .

states and cities that are dealing with an influx of cryptocurrency mining because of affordable electricity rates are instituting local laws as issues arise .

examples of such approachesâboth domestic and internationalâalong with the more general benefits and challenges associated with developing a cryptocurrency mining industry are delineated through the selected examples below .

blockchain is a method of quickly validating transactions and of record keeping for large quantities of data .

some blockchains and cryptocurrencies do not operate through a decentralized , permission - less network like bitcoin .

within the energy sector , a number of opportunities for blockchain technology have been proposed .

these opportunities include smart contracts , distributed energy resource record keeping , and ownership records .

one of the more easily transferrable options for blockchain is trading renewable energy credits ( recs ) .

using blockchain to trade recs could provide customers the ability to purchase recs without the need for a centralized entity to verify transactions .

in october 2018 , a subsidiary of the pjm interconnection llcâa regional transmission organization that operates an electric transmission system serving part of the eastern interconnection electricity grid âannounced plans for testing blockchain technology to trade recs .

other more advanced utilizations for blockchain in the energy sector could be highly disruptive .

for example , there is increasing interest in net metering and a transactional grid ( i.e. , where producers of distributed energy resources , such as rooftop solar , can sell the electricity to nearby consumers ) .

prototype projects have relied upon blockchain technology among other peer - to - peer approaches to facilitate renewable energy transactions at the local level .

other peer - to - peer efforts include managing virtual power plant operations and enabling those who do not own renewable energy systems to pay for a portion of the energy generation of a host's system in exchange for a reduction on their utility bills ( eg , renters paying for a portion of an apartment building's rooftop solar system ) .

if such applications are found to be practical and economical , blockchain technology could alter the manner in which electricity customers and producers interact .

traditionally electric utilities are vertically integrated .

blockchain could disrupt this convention by unbundling energy services along a distributed energy system .

for instance , a customer could directly purchase excess electricity produced from their neighbor's solar panels instead of purchasing electricity from the utility .

on the one hand , this could result in a more transparent and efficient system .

blockchain could encourage more competition among generators and more flexibility and choice for consumers .

on the other hand , unbundling energy services could lead to concerns over distribution control to accommodate the decentralization .

furthermore , storing vast quantities of data about critical infrastructure on distributed ledgers may introduce additional cybersecurity concerns .

the sale of electricity via blockchains that are independent of a conventional utility framework may be subject to significant legal interpretation , and potentially represents the intersection of various federal and state statutes and regulations .

jurisdiction over the sale of electricity from a distributed energy resource or electric vehicle charging station hinges upon its definition as either a retail transaction or a sale for resale .

retail transactions are generally defined by the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) as "sales made directly to the customer that consumes the energy product," whereas sales for resale are defined as "a type of wholesale sales covering energy supplied to other electric utilities , cooperatives , municipalities , and federal and state electric agencies for resale to ultimate consumers. .

states typically regulate retail electricity transactions , while ferc has jurisdiction over the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce .

one survey by the electric power research institute , collected data on the potential barriers and advantages of blockchain in utilities .

of those surveyed , utilities in the united states were in early pilot stages or in the research phase , while some utilities in europe had been using blockchain for over a year .

respondents identified opportunities and challenges to investment in blockchain technology with 77% of respondents identifying concerns that the energy industry "lacks appropriate standards. .

in addition to state and local policy efforts that seek to mitigate the regional effects of growth in cryptocurrency mining , there are options that could be adopted by the federal government to improve the energy efficiency of mining operations .

further , as the financial and energy sectors , among others , explore adopting blockchain , congress may consider options to curb the energy intensity of the technology .

rules and regulations governing the retail sale of electricity generally originate with a state public utility commission .

an electric utility is defined in federal law as any person , state , or federal agency "which sells electric energy. .

definitions may be found in public utility regulatory policies , 16 u.s.c .

section 2602 .

this definition could potentially be interpreted that generators of electricity that make energy trades using blockchain technology are electric utilities by virtue of the fact that they sell electricity , and are therefore subject to all laws , requirements , and regulations pertaining to electric utilities .

congress may choose to consider extending or clarifying ferc's role regulating blockchain technology use in the energy sector .

while blockchain could be implemented as a means to validate peer - to - peer distributed electricity trading , these transactions could potentially still be subject to ferc oversight as engaging in a sale for resale .

applications of blockchain technology in the energy sector have been limited in scope to date ; wide - scale adoption of blockchain technologies could pose additional vulnerabilities to grid operations .

ferc may also have a role in considering whether the existing grid infrastructure is capable of handling more power movement at high speeds in response to blockchain users' transactions .

other potential issues could include data privacy , interoperability of technology solutions , and market structure .

ferc has not issued guidance or announced standards associated with blockchain technologies .

within this context , utilities and industry groups may interpret the lack of guidance as a signal to continue business as usual .

as the bitcoin network's energy consumption grows , some have questioned whether the proof - of - work ( pow ) algorithm that is used by bitcoin is sustainable .

many alternative algorithms exist .

pow and two approaches that are conceptually less energy intensiveâproof - of - stake and proof - of - authorityâare discussed below and illustrated in figure a - 1 .

proof - of - work under proof - of - work ( pow ) , miners are presented a difficult computational problem , or puzzle .

pow identifies a numeric value ( called a nonce ) , which is used to generate an authenticator ( hash value ) .

the hash value ensures a user that the block of data sent has not changed .

hashes are determined by submitting the data through an algorithm that will output a string of characters .

by inserting the nonce into the algorithm , miners seek to change the hash value .

identifying these valid nonces and hashes is computationally intensive , and the essence of mining .

the security properties of hash algorithms are such that a miner tests nonces until a valid hash is found for a block .

generally , by solving the problem or puzzle , miners win the opportunity to post the next block and possibly receive a reward for doing so .

in the case of bitcoin , miners who create and publish new blocks in the blockchain are rewarded with bitcoin .

once the problem is solved and a valid hash is identified , the miner announces it to the community .

other users can validate the solution immediatelyâwithout going through the resource - intensive computation processâby having transparent access to the entire history of the blockchain's transaction ledger .

once the majority of the community validates and confirms the block , the next block can be added to the chain .

proof - of - stake proof - of - stake ( pos ) depends on the community's actual stake in the currency instead of consuming energy in a race to be the first to solve computations .

the more currency a "forger" ( i.e. , the pos term in lieu of the pow term "miner" ) holds , the more transactions can be validated .

this method skips the energy - intense hashing race .

all of the currency is already created , and the amount is stagnant .

forgers earn currency through transaction fees for building a new block ( and thereby validating a transaction ) .

a new block is determined by the level of stake ( eg , wealth ) a forger has invested in the cryptocurrency .

thus , forgers put their own cryptocurrency investment at risk and therefore would likely only build a block for valid transactions .

if a forger added a block to the blockchain based on an invalid transaction , it would risk losing its stake .

potential energy reductions from use of pos are leading to changes in some major cryptocurrencies .

ethereumâa platform that uses a cryptocurrency called etherâplans to move to a pos system and is currently working on the remaining challenges , such as scaling a pos system and maintaining a decentralized system .

the ethereum network expects to go through several upgrade phases in order to fully transition to pos .

the timeline for this transition has not yet been revealed , but this new solution upgrade , known as serenity , was announced at devcon 4 .

the serenity upgrade would utilize a new pos algorithm called "casper" that is intended to overcome some of the drawbacks ( eg , centralizing a traditionally decentralized currency ) of a pos community .

proof - of - authority proof - of - authority ( poa ) is another method of validating transactions in a blockchain .

like much of the terminology associated with blockchain , there is not a formal definition of poa , and the definition may differ from one group to another , depending on the purpose of the blockchain platform .

one understanding of poaâas it relates to cryptocurrencyâhas validators curating their own reputation in order to achieve payout .

validators earn their reputation by running software to put transactions into blocks that require a link to properly identify that validator .

this method places every person in the network on equal footingâeveryone only has one identity .

an alternative understanding of poa , among the supply chain industry , uses a blockchain network to track logistics transparently .

poa provides a level of scalability and security within private networks that pos or pow cannot .

limitations of pos , poa , and pow pos , poa , and pow algorithms have limitations .

while pos and poa both reduce energy consumption levels and require far less sophisticated equipment , they both create a more controlling and limited environment .

pow requires community decisionmaking .

pos and poa are more individualistic .

this could undermine the concept of the decentralized nature of the distributed ledger system design , which is one of the fundamental principles in cryptocurrency .

cryptocurrency was developed to move away from the centralized power of the banking system and move toward a decentralized network .

the ethereum upgrade is intended to integrate several new aspects and is expected to achieve a more decentralized system even when compared with pos .

ethereum's "phase zero" of the pos specification was frozen on june 30 , 2019 , with the formal launch targeted for january 3 , 2020 .

pow is also vulnerable to attacks .

pow blockchains publish new blocks to the longest available chain .

although difficult to accomplish , a malicious actor could devote overwhelming computational resources to rewriting a blockchainâdeveloping different transactions with different nonce and hash values .

this is known as the "51% attack. .

at a point where their chain is the longest , the malicious actor could publish the blockchain , and the system would accept it as the valid one .

by rewriting the chain , the malicious actor would reestablish the distribution of resources ( i.e. , which accounts have bitcoin and how much the account holds ) .

this would require substantial energy consumption , space , equipment , and money , and would all have to be done covertly to avoid being caught .

while this may appear to be difficult to execute , pow algorithms are not invulnerable .
