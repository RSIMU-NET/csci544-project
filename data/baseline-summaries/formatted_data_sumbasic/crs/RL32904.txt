after the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act was signed into law ( below ) , congress enacted emergency supplemental appropriations for hurricane recovery and pandemic influenza ( division b of p.l .

109-148 , the fy2006 defense appropriations act ) .

accounts in the agriculture appropriations bill receive $1.08 billion for hurricane recovery , and $111 million for avian influenza .

the supplemental act also contains targeted rescissions totaling $66 million to agriculture accounts and a 1% across - the - board rescission to discretionary spending .

the regular fy2006 agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act ( p.l .

109-97 , h.r .

2744 ) was signed into law on november 10 , 2005 .

the act includes all of the u.s. department of agriculture ( except the forest service ) , plus the food and drug administration and the commodity futures trading commission .

the $100.1 billion law is $15.0 billion ( +18% ) above fy2005 levels overall , and contains $17.03 billion in discretionary spending ( +1.2% above fy2005 ) and $83.07 billion for mandatory programs ( +22% above fy2005 ) .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) carries out its widely varied responsibilities through approximately 30 separate internal agencies and offices staffed by some 100,000 employees .

usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget function .

hence , spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farm programs .

similarly , agriculture appropriations bills are not limited to usda and include related programs such as the food and drug administration and the commodity futures trading commission , but exclude the forest service within usda .

usda gross outlays for fy2005 were estimated to be $100.5 billion , including regular and supplemental spending .

the mission area with the largest gross outlays ( $52.2 billion , or 52% of spending ) was for food and nutrition programs â€” primarily the food stamp program ( the costliest single usda program ) , various child nutrition programs , and the supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) .

the second - largest mission area in terms of total spending is for farm and foreign agricultural services , which totaled $31.1 billion , or 31% of all usda spending in fy2003 .

within this area are the programs funded through the commodity credit corporation ( eg , the farm commodity price and income support programs and certain mandatory conservation and trade programs ) , crop insurance , farm loans , and foreign food aid programs ( see figure 1 ) .

other usda spending in fy2005 included $8.5 billion ( 9% ) for an array of natural resource and environment programs , approximately 65% of which was for the activities of the forest service , and the balance for a number of discretionary conservation programs for farm producers .

usda's forest service is funded through the interior appropriations bill ; it is the only usda agency not funded through the annual agriculture appropriations bill .

the balance of usda spending was for rural development ( $2.6 billion , 2.6% ) ; research and education ( $2.5 billion , 2.5% ) ; marketing and regulatory activities ( $2.2 billion , 2.2% ) ; meat and poultry inspection ( $822 million , 0.8% ) ; and departmental administration and miscellaneous activities ( $543 million , 0.5% ) .

the president signed the fy2006 agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act ( p.l .

109-97 , h.r .

2744 ) into law on november 10 , 2005 .

the act includes all of usda ( except the forest service ) , plus the food and drug administration and commodity futures trading commission .

the conference agreement ( h.rept .

109-255 ) was reported on october 26 , 2005 .

the house passed the conference agreement on october 28 , 2005 , by a vote of 318-63 , and the senate passed it on november 3 , 2005 , by a vote of 81-18 .

the house approved its version ( h.r .

2744 , h.rept .

109-102 ) on june 8 , 2005 , by a vote of 408-18 , after adopting 10 amendments and deleting three provisions on points of order .

the house appropriations committee reported the measure on june 2 , 2005 , following full committee approval on may 25 , 2005 , and subcommittee approval on may 16 , 2005 .

the senate approved its version ( h.r .

2744 , s.rept .

109-92 ) on september 22 , 2005 , by a vote of 97-2 , after adopting 38 amendments .

only one amendment reallocated funding ; most other amendments restricted use of funds for certain activities , or were sense of the senate amendments .

the senate appropriations committee reported the measure on june 27 , 2005 , following full committee approval on june 23 , 2005 , and subcommittee approval on june 21 , 2005 .

p.l .

109-97 provides for a total of $100.099 billion ( $15 billion , or 18% , above fy2005 ) , and includes $17.031 billion in discretionary spending and $83.068 billion for mandatory programs .

increases in mandatory programs affected by economic or weather conditions account for nearly 99% of the increase over fy2005 levels .

the discretionary amount , the category of spending over which appropriators have direct control , is 1.2% above fy2005 levels , and 1.2% above the house - passed bill , but 1.8% below the senate - passed bill ( table 3 ) .

the senate agriculture appropriations subcommittee had a slightly higher 302 ( b ) allocation for discretionary spending ( $17.348 billion ) , compared with the house ( $16.832 billion ) .

the conference agreement split the difference and allowed a discretionary cap of $17.090 billion .

see table 8 at the end of this report for a tabular summary of each agency at various stages during the appropriations process .

mandatory programs administered by usda ( primarily food and nutrition programs , farm commodity support , and crop insurance ) account for 83% of the total .

mandatory spending is highly variable and driven by program participation rates , economic conditions , and weather patterns .

greater farm commodity spending is anticipated due to lower commodity prices , which resulted in higher counter - cyclical and loan deficiency payments .

usda requested an increase of $9.2 billion ( +56% ) for the commodity credit corporation to reimburse it for past spending , and an increase of $6.2 billion ( +13% ) for mandatory domestic food assistance programs .

the appropriations bill for agriculture and related agencies covers all of usda except for the forest service , which is funded through the interior appropriations bill .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for regulating the safety of foods , and the safety and effectiveness of drugs , biologics ( eg , vaccines ) , and medical devices .

for fy2006 , p.l .

109-97 provides a program level of $1.871 billion , midway between the house and senate recommendations , half a percent below the president's request , and 3.9% above the level enacted for fy2005 .

these totals combine direct appropriations for salaries and expenses , direct appropriations for buildings and facilities , and authorized user fee collections ( prescription drug user fee act , medical device user fee act , animal drug user fee act , mammography clinics user fee , and fees from export and color certification ) .

in fda's annual appropriation , congress sets both the total amount of appropriated funds and the level of user fees to be collected that year .

for appropriated funds for salaries and expenses , p.l .

109-97 provides $1.482 billion , less than 1% above the house recommendation and less than 1% below the senate recommendation and the president's request .

for user fees , the conference agreement includes $381.8 million , the amount also proposed by the president , the house , and the senate .

user fees in three major programs that cover prescription drugs , medical devices , and animal drugs would account for $357 million of the fy2006 total , with the remaining $24.8 million coming from mammography clinics certification and export and color certification fees .

the conference agreement allows an $8 million appropriation for the maintenance of buildings and facilities in fy2006 , more than the president's request and the house and senate recommendations .

the fy2005 appropriation , differing from earlier years' appropriations , did not include maintenance funding .

fda , therefore , absorbed the fy2005 costs of maintaining its facilities within its program funds .

the conference agreement prohibits the use of funds to close or relocate outside of st. louis , missouri , fda's division of pharmaceutical analysis .

it also gives the secretary of health and human services authority to relinquish to the state of arkansas all or part of the lands and properties of the national center for toxicological research and the arkansas regional laboratory .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets .

the cftc's functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges , registration and supervision of futures industry personnel , prevention of fraud and price manipulation , and investor protection .

although most futures trading is now related to financial variables ( interest rates , currency prices , and stock indexes ) , congressional oversight is vested in the agricultural committees because of the market's historical origins as an adjunct to agricultural trade .

for fy2006 , p.l .

109-97 provides $98.4 million for the cftc , the same as in the house and senate bills .

this is an increase of $4.8 million , or 5.1% , over fy2005 .

the administration had requested $99.4 million , an increase of $5.8 million , or 6.2% , over fy2005 .
