congress has long been interested in the status of indigenous peoples abroad .

in 1992 , the 102 nd congress enacted h.r .

5368 ( p.l .

102-391 ) requiring the state department's annual human rights report to "describe the extent to which indigenous people are able to participate in decisions affecting their lands , cultures , traditions and the a llocation of natural resources , and assess the extent of protection of their civil and political rights. .

issues relating to indigenous peoples periodically have been considered in hearings focused on such issues as environmental protection , energy opportunities , and security cooperation .

this report provides statistical information on indigenous peoples in latin america , including populations and languages , socioeconomic data , land and natural resources , human rights , and international legal conventions .

resource lists for each section ( languages ; socioeconomics ; land and resources ; international organizations ; and human rights ) are available in the tables of appendix a .

table b - 1 lists national agencies that oversee indigenous affairs in each country .

latin america is home to 29-45 million indigenous people according to several studies that provided estimates for around 2010 .

the world bank stated in a report that "official data on indigenous people are not conclusive , as many technical and sociological difficulties persist in census data collection .

other sources based on estimates and unofficial data refer to 50 million indigenous inhabitants in latin america ( about 10 percent of the total population ) .

for this report , however , we will refer to the officialâalbeit imperfectânumbers provided by the national censuses [41.81 million]. .

figure 1 illustrates the total number of indigenous people and their share of the total population according to three sources: a 2009 unicef report , a 2015 report from the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean ( eclac ) , and a 2015 world bank report .

census projections forecast indigenous population increases in many countries in part due to populations that are younger on average than non - indigenous populations and in part due to an increase in self - identification .

table 1 shows a breakdown by country of indigenous populations and their share of the overall population .

crs created the following tables from several sources ; publication dates and methodologies differed .

the countries listed in each table may differ from others in this report based on the information available in the sources .

figure 2 illustrates the range of estimates regarding the indigenous population as a percentage of the general population in each country .

bolivia's steep decrease in the indigenous population reflects "reasons that probably have more to do with discrepancies in how the data were collected between the last two censuses than with a real trend to negative growth," according to the world bank .

more generally , differences in data collection between censuses and across countries make it difficult to estimate population increases .

in a 2015 publication , the world bank found that 43% of indigenous people in latin america are poor ( living on less than $5.50 a day in 2011 purchasing power parity prices or ppp ) , and 24% are extremely poor ( living on less than $1.90 a day in 2011 ppp prices ) , more than twice the rates for non - indigenous people .

the report also documented education gaps were across the region .

drawing from another world bank resource , figure 5 compares rates of indigenous peoples living on less than $5.50 a day compared to the general population in select countries of central and south america .

the world bank provides statistics on access to various services and opportunities for indigenous peoples in select countries of central and south america , last updated in october 2018 .

the following graphs compare indigenous rates of access to these amenities compared with the general population rates by country ( figure 6 , electricity ; figure 7 , internet ; figure 8 , home ownership ; figure 9 , sewage ; and figure 10 , water ) .

the world bank also provides labor and education statistics for indigenous peoples in select countries of central and south america , last updated in october 2018 .

the following graphs compare indigenous rates compared with general population rates by country ( figure 11 , literacy ; figure 12 , school attendance ; figure 13 , unemployment ; and figure 14 , low - skill and high - skill employment ) .

in the appendix , table a - 2 lists resources relating to the socioeconomic standing of indigenous peoples in latin america .

various international human rights mechanisms protect the rights of indigenous peoples of latin america and the caribbean .

table 3 identifies those countries that have ratified or voted in favor of the following three multilateral instruments on indigenous peoples' rights: international labor organization's indigenous and tribal peoples convention , 1989 ( no .

169 ) .

26 the convention includes sections on land ; recruitment and conditions of employment ; vocational training , handicrafts and rural industries ; and social security and health ; education and means of communication .

united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples ( undrip ) .

27 the 2007 declaration covers such topics as self - determination or autonomy ; land and environment ; employment ; religion ; language and media ; education ; discrimination and violence ; and health .

american declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples ( adrip ) .

28 the 2016 declaration approved by the organization of american states includes sections on human and collective rights ; cultural identity ; organizational and political rights ; and social , economic and property rights .

the united nations has a permanent forum on indigenous issues and in 2001 created the special rapporteurship on the rights of indigenous peoples , which promote the rights of indigenous peoples across the globe .

in 1990 , the organization of american states created the rapporteurship on the rights of indigenous peoples to promote the rights of indigenous peoples throughout the western hemisphere .

table a - 4 provides additional resources about the work of international organizations with indigenous peoples .

in a 2000 report , the inter - american commission on human rights ( iachr ) wrote "concern for the human rights of indigenous peoples and their members has been a constant feature in the work of the commission. .

the iachr has tracked its work involving indigenous peoples .

it hosts multiple sessions per year to hold hearings regarding human rights issues affecting a particular country or subregion of the western hemisphere .

one of the categories for hearings is the rights of indigenous peoples .

table 4 shows the number of iachr hearings by country involving indigenous peoples' rights .

it also shows the number of inter - american court of human rights cases brought by indigenous peoples against countries .

in the appendix , table a - 5 lists publications that document various human rights issues confronting indigenous peoples .

crs also publishes a number of reports with country - specific information on indigenous peoples' human rights issues .

appendix a .

data sources and resources lists the united nations children's fund ( unicef ) and fundaciã³n para la educaciã³n en contextos de multilingã¼ismo y pluriculturalidad ( the foundation for education in multilingual and multicultural contexts or funproeib ) gathered data in 21 latin american and caribbean countries in 2009 for its report in two volumes titled atlas sociolingã¼ã­stico de pueblos indã­genas en amã©rica latina .

the report notes the limitations of using national censuses .

in 2014 , the united nations' economic commission for latin america and the caribbean ( eclac ) gathered population data from 17 latin american countries using national censuses for guaranteeing indigenous people's rights in latin america: progress in the past decade and remaining challenges .

the report notes that most countries ask people to self - identify as indigenous with the exception of peru , which asks people if they speak an indigenous language .

in 2015 , the world bank gathered data in 16 countries using national censuses and household survey data in order to publish indigenous latin america in the twenty - first century: the first decade .

the report notes that the definition of who is indigenous has become increasingly controversial and "underscores the complexity of identifying indigenous people across the region and argues that the conditions of indigeneity vary over time and are , in some cases , context - and country - specific. .

the current edition of ethnologue documents language counts for each country and divides them into indigenous and non - indigenous categories .

indigenous languages figures were used in table 2 as non - indigenous is defined as "a language that did not originate in the country , but which is now established there either as a result of its longstanding presence or because of institutionally supported use and recognition. .

only living languages were included in the count , not languages classified as extinct .

ethnologue's "about" section provides details on the methodology , language names , and status of usage .

the world bank's latin america and caribbean equity lab provides data on poverty , access to services , education and labor ( last updated in october 2018 ) .

the world bank notes that ethnic identity is based on self - reported data .

statistics may vary from official statistics reported by governments as the world bank uses sedlac , "a regional data harmonization effort that increases cross - country comparability. .

the web page of the inter - american commission's human rights rapporteurship on the rights of indigenous peoples provides detailed information on hearings and court cases related to indigenous peoples' rights .
