the automatic annual adjustment for members of congress is determined by a formula using a component of the employment cost index ( eci ) , which measures rate of change in private sector pay .

the adjustment automatically takes effect unless ( 1 ) congress statutorily prohibits the adjustment ; ( 2 ) congress statutorily revises the adjustment ; or ( 3 ) the annual base pay adjustment of general schedule ( gs ) federal employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled increase for members , in which case the percentage adjustment for member pay is automatically lowered to match the percentage adjustment in gs base pay .

under the eci formula , members may not receive an annual pay adjustment greater than 5% .

in the past , member pay has been frozen statutorily in two ways: ( 1 ) directly , through legislation that freezes salaries for members but not other federal employees , and ( 2 ) indirectly , through broader pay freeze legislation that covers members and other specified categories of federal employees .

this adjustment formula was established by the ethics reform act of 1989 .

votes potentially related to the annual adjustments since the implementation of this act are contained in this report .

below is a chronology of member pay actions since the implementation of the ethics reform act of 1989 , which established the current pay adjustment system .

in general , the salary adjustment projected by the formula is followed by a discussion of any action or potentially related votes .

any other action related to pay for members of congress that occurred during that calendar year is also listed .

the maximum potential january 2017 member pay adjustment of 1.6% , or $2,800 , was known when the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) released data for the change in the employment cost index ( eci ) during the 12-month period from december 2014 to december 2015 on january 30 , 2016 .

both the house - passed ( h.r .

5325 ) and senate - reported ( s. 2955 ) versions of the fy2017 legislative branch appropriations bill — which would provide approximately $4.4 billion in funding for the activities of the house of representatives , senate , and legislative branch support agencies — contained a provision that would prohibit this adjustment .

the member pay provision was included in the bills as introduced and no separate votes were held on this provision .

no further action was taken on h.r .

5325 or s. 2955 , but the pay prohibition language was included in the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-254 ) .

absent the statutory prohibition on a member pay adjustment , members of congress would have automatically been limited to a 1.0% ( $1,700 ) salary increase to match the increase in base salaries for general schedule ( gs ) employees .

the maximum potential january 2016 member pay adjustment of 1.7% , or $3,000 , was known when the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) released data for the change in the employment cost index ( eci ) during the 12-month period from december 2013 to december 2014 on january 30 , 2015 .

the house - passed and senate - reported versions of the fy2016 legislative branch appropriations bill ( h.r .

2250 ) both contained a provision prohibiting this adjustment .

the pay adjustment prohibition was subsequently included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) .

absent the statutory prohibition on a member pay adjustment , members of congress would have automatically been limited to a 1.0% ( $1,700 ) salary increase to match the increase in base salaries for general schedule ( gs ) employees .

the house budget resolution , h.con.res .

27 ( section 819 ) , included a policy statement that congress should agree to a concurrent budget resolution each year by april 15 , and if not , congressional salaries should be held in escrow .

the statement proposes that salaries would be released from the escrow account either when a chamber agrees to a concurrent resolution on the budget or the last day of the congress , whichever is earlier .

the house agreed to this resolution on march 25 , 2015 .

the senate agreed to its resolution on the budget , s.con.res .

11 , on march 27 .

the maximum potential january 2015 pay adjustment of 1.6% , or $2,800 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2012 to december 2013 on january 31 , 2014 .

each year , the adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied statutorily by congress , or limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the house - passed and senate - reported versions of the fy2015 legislative branch appropriations act ( h.r .

4487 ) contained a provision prohibiting any member pay adjustment .

although no further action was taken on that bill , the provision was subsequently included in section 8 of division q of the fy2015 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , which was enacted on december 16 , 2014 ( p.l .

113-235 ) .

although discussion of member pay is often associated with appropriations bills , the legislative branch bill does not contain language funding or increasing member pay , and a prohibition on the automatic member pay adjustments could be included in any bill , or be introduced as a separate bill .

the president proposed a 1.0% increase in the base pay of gs employees for january 2015 , which would automatically have limited any member pay adjustment to 1.0% .

the maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2% , or $2,100 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2011 to december 2012 on january 31 , 2013 .

the adjustment takes effect automatically each year unless ( 1 ) denied statutorily by congress or ( 2 ) limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the continuing appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-46 , section 146 , enacted october 17 , 2013 ) , prohibited the scheduled 2014 pay adjustment for members of congress .

the scheduled january 2014 across - the - board increase in the base pay of gs employees under the annual adjustment formula was 1.3% .

a scheduled gs annual pay increase may be altered only if the president issues an alternative plan or if a different increase , or freeze , is enacted .

the president issued an alternate pay plan for civilian federal employees on august 30 , 2013 .

this plan called for a january 2014 across - the - board pay increase of 1.0% for federal civilian employees , the same percentage as proposed in the president's fy2014 budget .

legislation was not enacted to prohibit or alter the gs adjustment , and executive order 13655 , issued on december 23 , 2013 , implemented a 1.0% increase for gs employees .

had the member pay adjustment not been prohibited by law , the gs base pay adjustment would have automatically limited a salary adjus tment for members of congress to 1.0% ( $1,700 ) .

the maximum potential 2013 pay adjustment of 1.1% , or $1,900 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2010 to december 2011 on january 31 , 2012 .

the adjustment takes effect automatically unless ( 1 ) denied statutorily by congress or ( 2 ) limited by the general schedule ( gs ) base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the president's budget , submitted on february 13 , 2012 , proposed an average ( i.e. , base and locality ) 0.5% adjustment for gs employees .

president obama later stated in a letter to congressional leadership on august 21 , 2012 , that the federal pay freeze should extend until fy2013 budget negotiations are finalized .

section 114 of h.j.res .

117 , the continuing appropriations resolution , 2013 , which was introduced on september 10 , 2012 , extended the freeze enacted by p.l .

111-322 through the duration of this continuing resolution .

h.j.res .

117 was passed by the house on september 13 and the senate on september 22 .

it was signed by the president on september 28 , 2012 ( p.l .

112-175 ) .

a delay in the implementation of pay adjustments for gs employees automatically delays any scheduled member pay adjustment .

on december 27 , 2012 , president obama issued executive order 13635 , which listed the rates of pay for various categories of officers and employees that would be effective after the expiration of the freeze extended by p.l .

112-175 .

the executive order included a 0.5% increase for gs base pay , which automatically lowered the maximum potential member pay adjustment from 1.1% to 0.5% .

as in prior years , schedule 6 of the executive order showed the new rate for members .

the annual adjustments take effect automatically if legislation is not enacted preventing them .

subsequently , a provision in h.r .

8 , the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 , which was enacted on january 2 , 2013 ( p.l .

112-240 ) , froze member pay at the 2009 level for 2013 .

the language was included in s.amdt .

3448 , a substitute amendment agreed to by unanimous consent .

the bill , as amended , passed the senate ( 89-8 , vote #251 ) and the house ( 257-167 , roll call #659 ) on january 1 , 2013 .

h.r .

325 , which ( 1 ) included language holding congressional salaries in escrow if a concurrent resolution on the budget was not agreed to by april 15 , 2013 , and ( 2 ) provided for a temporary extension of the debt ceiling through may 18 , 2013 , was introduced on january 21 , 2013 .

salaries would have been held in escrow for members in a chamber if that chamber had not agreed to a concurrent resolution by that date .

salaries would have been released from the escrow account either when that chamber agreed to a concurrent resolution on the budget or the last day of the 113 th congress , whichever was earlier .

h.r .

325 was agreed to in the house on january 23 , 2013 , and the senate on january 31 , 2013 .

it was enacted on february 4 , 2013 ( p.l .

113-3 ) .

both the house and senate agreed to a budget resolution prior to that date , however , and salaries were not held in escrow .

h.r .

807 , the full faith and credit act , was introduced in the house on february 25 , 2013 .

the bill would prioritize certain payments in the event the debt reaches the statutory limit .

an amendment , h.amdt .

61 , was offered on may 9 , 2013 , that would clarify that these obligations would not include compensation for members of congress .

it was agreed to the same day ( 340-84 , roll call #140 ) .

the bill passed the house on may 13 , 2013 ( 221-207 , roll call #142 ) .

the projected 2011 adjustment of 0.9% was known when the bls released data for the eci change during the 12-month period from december 2008 to december 2009 on january 29 , 2010 .

this adjustment would have equaled a $1,600 increase , resulting in a salary of $175,600 .

under the eci formula , members could have received a salary adjustment of 1.3% in january 2012 .

the 2011 pay adjustment was prohibited by the enactment of h.r .

5146 ( p.l .

111-165 ) on may 14 , 2010 .

h.r .

5146 was introduced in the house on april 27 and was agreed to the same day ( roll no .

226 ) .

it was agreed to in the senate the following day by unanimous consent .

other bills that would prevent the scheduled 2011 pay adjustment were introduced in both the house and senate .

these include s. 3244 , which was introduced in the senate on april 22 , 2010 , and agreed to by unanimous consent the same day .

the bill was referred to the committee on house administration and the house committee on oversight and government reform .

additionally , p.l .

111-322 , which was enacted on december 22 , 2010 , prohibited any adjustment in gs base pay before december 31 , 2012 .

since the percent adjustment in member pay may not exceed the percent adjustment in the base pay of gs employees , member pay also was frozen during this period .

the senate passed s. 388 on march 1 , 2011 .

the bill would have prohibited members of the house and senate from receiving pay , including retroactive pay , for each day that there is a lapse in appropriations or the federal government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because of the public debt limit .

the house passed h.r .

1255 on april 1 , 2011 .

the bill would have prohibited the disbursement of pay to members of the house and senate during either of these situations .

no further action was taken on either bill .

on april 8 , 2011 , the speaker of the house issued a "dear colleague" letter indicating that in the event of a shutdown , members of congress would continue to be paid pursuant to the twenty - seventh amendment to the constitution , which as stated above , states: "no law , varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives , shall take effect , until an election of representatives shall have intervened" — although members could elect to return any compensation to the treasury .

section 5421 ( b ) ( 1 ) of h.r .

3630 , as introduced in the house , would have prohibited any adjustment for members of congress prior to december 31 , 2013 .

section 706 of the motion to recommit also contained language freezing member pay .

on december 13 , 2011 , the motion to recommit failed ( 183-244 , roll call #922 ) , and the bill passed the house ( 234-193 , roll call #923 ) .

the house - passed version of the bill was titled the "middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2011. .

the senate substitute amendment , which did not address pay adjustments , passed on december 17 .

it was titled the "temporary payroll tax cut continuation act of 2011. .

the bill was enacted on february 22 , 2012 ( p.l .

112-96 ) , without the pay freeze language .

h.r .

3835 , introduced on january 27 , 2012 , also would have extended the pay freeze for federal employees , including members of congress , to december 31 , 2013 .

this bill passed the house on february 1 , 2012 .

h.r .

6726 , introduced on january 1 , 2013 , would have extended the pay freeze for federal employees , including members of congress , to december 31 , 2013 .

this bill passed the house on january 2 , 2013 .

under the formula established in the ethics reform act , members were originally scheduled to receive a pay adjustment in january 2010 of 2.1% .

this adjustment was denied by congress through a provision included in the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act , which was enacted on march 11 , 2009 .

section 103 of division j of the act states , "notwithstanding any provision of section 601 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 ( 2 u.s.c .

31 ( 2 ) ) , the percentage adjustment scheduled to take effect under any such provision in calendar year 2010 shall not take effect. .

had congress not passed legislation prohibiting the member pay adjustment , the 2.1% projected adjustment would have been downwardly revised automatically to 1.5% to match the 2010 gs base pay adjustment .

the provision prohibiting the 2010 member pay adjustment was added to h.r .

1105 through the adoption of the rule providing for consideration of the bill ( h.res .

184 ) .

the rule provided that the provision , which was printed in the report accompanying the resolution , would be considered as adopted .

on february 25 , 2009 , the house voted to order the previous question ( 393-25 , roll call #84 ) and agreed to the resolution ( 398-24 , roll call #85 ) .

under the formula established in the ethics reform act , members received a pay adjustment in january 2009 of 2.8% , increasing salaries to $174,000 .

as noted above , member pay adjustments may not exceed the annual base pay adjustment of gs employees .

the two pay adjustments may differ because they are based on changes in different quarters of the eci or due to actions of congress and the president .

the 2.8% adjustment for members , however , was less than the projected 2009 base gs adjustment of 2.9% .

the gs rate became final on december 18 , 2008 , when president george w. bush issued an executive order adjusting rates of pay .

in march 2009 , the senate considered a number of attempts to alter the automatic annual adjustment procedure for members of congress .

senator david vitter proposed an amendment ( s.amdt .

621 ) to the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act .

the amendment would have repealed the provision of law that provides for the annual adjustments under the ethics reform act .

the senate agreed to a motion to table the amendment on march 10 , 2009 ( 52-45 , vote #95 ) .

prior to the vote , the senate failed to agree to a unanimous consent request to consider s. 542 , a bill introduced by senator harry reid which would have eliminated the automatic pay procedure effective february 1 , 2011 .

on march 17 , 2009 , the senate considered s. 620 , a bill also introduced by senator reid , which would have eliminated the procedure effective december 31 , 2010 .

the senate agreed to the bill by unanimous consent .

the bill was referred to the house administration committee and the house oversight and government reform committee .

the following day , an identical bill , h.r .

1597 , was introduced in the house by representative jim matheson .

additional bills that would have affected congressional pay were also introduced in both chambers .

member pay language was also included in senate amendments intended to be proposed to other bills .

no further action was taken .

under the annual pay adjustment procedure , members originally were scheduled to receive a 2.7% increase in january 2008 , based upon the formula set forth in the ethics reform act of 1989 .

this increase would have raised their salaries to $169,700 .

the scheduled member increase was revised to 2.5% , resulting in a salary in 2008 of $169,300 , due to factors related to the increase in the base pay of gs employees .

the scheduled january 2008 across - the - board increase in the base pay of gs employees under the annual adjustment formula was 2.5% .

a scheduled gs annual pay increase may be altered only if the president issues an alternative plan or if congress legislates a different increase .

president bush did not issue an alternative plan for the annual pay adjustment , although he issued an alternative plan for the locality pay adjustment on november 27 , 2007 , providing a 0.5% adjustment ( providing an average 3.0% overall adjustment ) .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , which was enacted on december 26 , 2007 , provided a 3.5% average pay adjustment for federal civilian employees .

the president issued an executive order allocating this overall percentage between base and locality pay on january 4 , 2008 .

since the annual base portion of the pay adjustment for gs employees was less than the scheduled member increase , member pay was adjusted by the lower rate .

on june 27 , 2007 , the house took action potentially relating to the january 2008 member pay increase .

the house agreed ( 244-181 , vote #580 ) to order the previous question on the rule ( h.res .

517 ) for consideration of h.r .

2829 , the fy2008 financial services and general government appropriations bill .

by ordering the previous question , the house voted to prevent an amendment to the rule from being offered and brought the rule to an immediate vote .

the house bill did not contain member pay language , and the house did not vote on an amendment to accept or reject a member pay increase .

under the terms of h.res .

517 , as adopted , an amendment seeking to halt the pay raise was not in order .

an amendment to the rule could have waived points of order so as to permit an amendment to the bill prohibiting a pay increase .

during floor debate , at least one member spoke against the previous question and indicated an intention to offer an amendment to the rule to prohibit the increase if it was defeated .

06 / 27 / 07 — the house agreed ( 244-181 , vote #580 ) to order the previous question on the rule ( h.res .

517 ) for consideration of h.r .

2829 , the fy2008 financial services and general government appropriations bill .

by ordering the previous question , the house voted to prevent an amendment to the rule from being offered , and to bring the rule to an immediate vote .

an amendment to the rule could have waived points of order so as to permit an amendment to the bill prohibiting a pay increase .

although h.res .

517 was an open rule that allowed any germane amendment , an amendment to prohibit the pay adjustment would not have been germane .

by agreeing to order the previous question , some members considered the vote to be against consideration of an amendment prohibiting a pay raise .

had the house not agreed to a motion to order the previous question , they argued , a member could have offered an amendment to the rule related to the pay adjustment .

under the terms of h.res .

517 , as adopted , an amendment seeking to halt the pay raise was not in order .

during floor debate , at least one member spoke against ordering the previous question and indicated that , if the motion was defeated , he intended to offer an amendment to the rule to prohibit the pay increase .

members did not receive the annual pay adjustment of 1.7% scheduled for january 1 , 2007 , as a consequence of the votes congress had taken in both 2006 and 2007 .

the salary of members remained at the 2006 level of $165,200 .

members initially had been scheduled to receive a 2.0% annual adjustment in january 2007 , increasing their salary to $168,500 .

this increase was automatically revised downward to 1.7% to match gs base pay .

based on a formula required under the annual comparability pay procedure , general schedule ( gs ) employees were authorized to receive a base pay increase of 1.7% in january 2007 .

the percentage was confirmed when the president issued an alternative plan for the locality pay adjustment , but not base pay , on november 30 , 2006 , and then an executive order issued on december 21 , 2006 , authorizing the average 2.2% pay adjustment for general schedule employees .

a series of votes in 2006 and 2007 prevented the scheduled adjustment .

the continuing resolution enacted on december 8 , 2006 ( p.l .

109-383 ) , postponed any increase until february 16 , 2007 .

the revised continuing appropriations resolution , 2007 , which became law on february 15 , 2007 ( p.l .

110-5 ) , further prevented the scheduled 2007 adjustment from taking effect .

on march 8 , 2006 , the senate voted to change the application of the annual comparability adjustment for members by denying an increase for those members who voted against receiving one .

on june 13 , 2006 , the house ordered the previous question on the rule for consideration of the fy2007 treasury appropriations bill .

this action prevented amendments to the rule , including those related to member pay , from being considered .

congress subsequently voted to delay the scheduled january 2007 pay increase until february 2007 .

congressional action , however , blocked any pay increase in 2007 .

after the relative increases in congressional pay as compared to the federal minimum wage became a campaign issue , congress delayed any increase until february 16 , 2007 .

06 / 13 / 06 — the house agreed ( 249-167 , vote #261 ) to order the previous question on the rule ( h.res .

865 ) for consideration of h.r .

5576 , the fy2007 transportation and treasury appropriation bill .

by ordering the previous question , the house voted to prevent an amendment to the rule from being offered , and to bring the rule to an immediate vote .

an amendment to the rule could have waived points of order so as to permit an amendment to the bill prohibiting a pay increase .

although h.res .

865 was an open rule that allowed any germane amendment , an amendment to prohibit the pay adjustment would not have been germane .

by agreeing to order the previous question , some members considered the vote to be against consideration of an amendment prohibiting a pay raise .

had the house not agreed to a motion to order the previous question , they argued , a member could have offered an amendment to the rule related to the pay adjustment .

under the terms of h.res .

865 , as adopted , an amendment seeking to halt the pay raise was not in order .

during floor debate , representative jim matheson made known his intention to offer an amendment to the rule to prohibit the increase , and spoke against the previous question so that his amendment could receive a waiver to be considered .

12 / 8 / 06 — section 137 of p.l .

109-383 ( 120 stat .

2679 ) , which amended the continuing appropriations resolution , delayed any increase in member pay until february 16 , 2007 .

02 / 15 / 07 — the revised continuing appropriations resolution , 2007 , became law ( p.l .

110-5 , 121 stat .

12 ) .

section 115 stated that the adjustment in member pay scheduled for 2007 shall not take effect .

in 2007 , both the house and senate took action on bills that would target the adjustments or benefits of members under certain circumstances .

neither of these provisions became law .

1 / 18 / 07 — the senate passed ( 96-2 , vote #19 ) s. 1 , the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 .

the bill contained a provision ( §116 ) that would deny an annual pay adjustment to members of congress who vote for an amendment to prohibit an annual adjustment for members , or who voted against the tabling of an amendment to prohibit the increase .

this language was not included in the house amendment or in the final version of the bill , which became p.l .

110-81 .

1 / 23 / 07 — the house passed ( 431-0 , vote #49 ) h.r .

476 .

the bill would have denied pension benefits to members of congress if an individual is convicted of committing certain offenses while a member of congress .

the bill was referred to the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and no further action was taken .

members received a pay adjustment of 1.9% in january 2006 , increasing their salary to $165,200 from $162,100 .

this increase became official when president bush issued an executive order on december 22 , 2005 , containing his allocation of a 3.1% pay increase for gs federal employees , 2.1% for base pay and an average of 1.0% for locality pay .

by setting the gs base pay component at a rate ( 2.1% ) greater than the scheduled 1.9% member pay increase , members were able to receive the full 1.9% adjustment .

in 2005 , during consideration of the january 2006 adjustment , the house held one vote potentially relating to the pending january 2006 increase , and the senate voted to deny the adjustment .

the house vote occurred june 28 , 2005 , when it agreed to a rule providing for consideration of h.r .

3058 , the fy2006 transportation , treasury , and housing and urban development , the judiciary , district of columbia , and independent agencies appropriations bill .

special waiver language was needed in the rule to permit house consideration of an amendment that would prohibit the scheduled january 2006 pay increase .

in the absence of such language , a pay amendment was out of order .

this action was considered by some to be approval of an increase since the vote had the effect of not allowing members to offer and consider nongermane amendments to the bill .

they argued that if nongermane amendments had been allowed , one could have been offered to modify or deny the scheduled 1.9% member pay increase .

others , however , expressed interest in introducing other nongermane amendments on unrelated issues .

as a consequence , it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity .

the senate agreed october 18 , 2005 , to an amendment , by a vote of 92 to 6 , to prohibit the scheduled january 2006 member pay adjustment .

the prohibition did not apply to the 1.9% increase scheduled for other top - level federal officials in the executive and judicial branches .

the amendment was struck in conference .

03 / 08 / 06 — the senate agreed ( voice vote ) to an amendment denying an annual pay adjustment to members of congress who vote for an amendment to prohibit an annual adjustment for members , or who voted against the tabling of an amendment to prohibit the increase .

the amendment ( s.amdt .

2934 ) was offered by senator james inhofe during consideration of s. 2349 , the 527 reform bill .

the bill was not enacted into law .

06 / 28 / 05 — the house agreed ( 263-152 , vote #327 ) to order the previous question on the rule ( h.res .

342 ) for consideration of h.r .

3058 , the fy2006 transportation and treasury appropriation bill .

by ordering the previous question , the house voted to prevent an amendment to the rule from being offered , and to bring the rule to an immediate vote .

an amendment to the rule could have waived points of order so as to permit an amendment to the bill prohibiting a pay increase .

although h.res .

342 was an open rule that allowed any germane amendment , an amendment to prohibit the pay adjustment would not have been germane .

by agreeing to order the previous question , some members considered the vote to be against consideration of an amendment to permit a pay raise prohibition to be offered .

had the house not agreed to a motion to order the previous question , they argued , a member could have offered an amendment to the rule related to the pay adjustment .

under the terms of h.res .

342 , as adopted , an amendment seeking to halt the pay raise was not in order .

during floor debate , representative jim matheson made known his intention to offer an amendment to the rule to prohibit the increase , and spoke against the previous question so that his amendment could receive a waiver to be considered .

10 / 18 / 05 — the senate agreed ( 92-6 , vote #256 ) to an amendment prohibiting the 2006 annual federal pay adjustment for members of congress only .

it did not apply to top - level executive and judicial branch officials .

the amendment ( s.amdt .

2062 ) , was offered by senator jon kyl during consideration of h.r .

3058 , fy2006 transportation and treasury appropriation bill .

the senate provision was dropped in conference .

members received a pay adjustment of 2.5% in january 2005 , increasing their salary to $162,100 from $158,100 .

one vote potentially relating to the member pay adjustment scheduled for january 2005 was held in 2004 .

on september 14 , the house agreed to a rule providing for consideration of h.r .

5025 , the fy2005 transportation and treasury appropriation bill .

special waiver language was needed in the rule to permit house consideration of an amendment that would prohibit the scheduled january 2005 pay increase .

in the absence of such language , a pay amendment was not in order .

this house action , however , was considered by some to be approval of an increase since the vote had the effect of not allowing members to offer and consider nongermane amendments to the bill .

they argued that if nongermane amendments had been allowed , one could have been offered to modify or deny the scheduled 2.2% member pay increase .

alternatively , however , a few members expressed interest in introducing other nongermane amendments on entirely different issues .

as a consequence , it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that members would have voted to deny a pay increase had they had been given an opportunity .

09 / 14 / 04 — the house agreed ( 235-170 , vote #451 ) to order the previous question on a rule ( h.res .

770 ) providing for consideration of h.r .

5025 , the fy2005 transportation and treasury appropriations bill .

by ordering the previous question , the house voted to prevent an amendment to the rule from being offered , and to bring the rule to an immediate vote .

an amendment to the rule could have waived points of order so as to permit an amendment to the bill prohibiting a pay increase .

although h.res .

770 was an open rule that allowed any germane amendment , an amendment to prohibit the pay adjustment would not have been germane .

by agreeing to order the previous question , some members considered the vote to be against consideration of an amendment to permit a pay raise prohibition to be offered .

had the house not agreed to a motion to order the previous question , they argued , a member could have offered an amendment to the rule related to the pay adjustment .

under the terms of h.res .

770 , as adopted , an amendment seeking to halt the pay raise was not in order .

members received a pay adjustment of 2.2% in 2004 , increasing their salary to $158,100 from $154,700 .

the adjustment was effective in two stages .

the first adjustment increased members' salary by 1.5% , to which they were initially limited because by law they may not receive an annual adjustment greater than the increase in the base pay of gs federal employees .

after the passage of the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act , which provided an average 4.1% gs pay increase , members received the full 2.2% pay increase , with 0.7% retroactive to the first pay period in january 2004 .

two potentially related votes related to the scheduled january 2004 adjustment .

action taken by the house on vote #463 ( 240-173 ) was considered by some to be approval of an annual increase since the vote had the effect of not allowing members to offer and consider nongermane amendments to the bill .

they argued that if nongermane amendments had been allowed , one could have been offered to modify or deny the scheduled 2.2% member pay increase .

while some members have characterized this as a vote for the raise , some members expressed interest in introducing other nongermane amendments on entirely different issues .

as a consequence , it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity .

members originally were scheduled to receive a 3.3% adjustment under the formula .

07 / 15 / 98 — the house agreed ( 218-201 , vote #284 ) to h.res .

498 , the rule providing for consideration of h.r .

4104 .

the rule waived points of order against language prohibiting a 1999 annual adjustment ( §628 of the bill ) for failure to comply with rule xxi , clause 2 .

the clause prohibits language in an appropriation bill that changes existing law .

the effect of the rule was to ensure that the pay prohibition would not be procedurally challenged on the floor during debate on h.r .

4104 .

this did not preclude an amendment from being offered on the floor to challenge the prohibition .

07 / 16 / 98 — the house rejected ( 79-342 , vote #289 ) an amendment that sought to strike section 628 of h.r .

the amendment was offered to s. 1023 , the fy1998 treasury and general government appropriations bill .

the amendment did not apply to other top - level federal officials .

the house version of the treasury bill was silent on the issue .

the house version , h.r .

2378 , was passed on september 17 , 1997 .

later that day , the senate amended h.r .

2378 to include the language of its version in the nature of a substitute and passed the bill .

the bill , with the pay prohibition , was then sent to the house .

on september 24 , 1997 , the house disagreed with the senate substitute amendment and agreed to a conference .

after lengthy discussion on the merits of a member pay adjustment , the house voted to order the previous question on a pending motion to instruct conferees on an issue unrelated to the pay issue .

because the house permits only one motion to instruct conferees , and ordering the previous question precludes amendment to the pending question , this vote in effect foreclosed the possibility of instructing conferees to omit the pay adjustment from the conference report .

as a result of this house vote , h.r .

2378 was sent to conference by the house without instructions to prohibit the pay adjustment .

subsequently , the senate language denying the increase was dropped in conference , and h.r .

2378 , after striking all after the enacting clause and substituting the language of s. 1023 as amended to include the pay prohibition .

09 / 24 / 97 — the house voted ( 229-199 , vote 435 ) to order the previous question on a pending motion to instruct conferees on an issue unrelated to the pay issue .

because the house permits only one motion to instruct conferees , and because ordering the previous question precludes amendment to the pending question , this vote in effect foreclosed the possibility of instructing conferees to omit the pay adjustment from the conference report .

as a result of this house vote , h.r .

2378 was sent to conference by the house without instructions to prohibit the pay adjustment .

conferees dropped the senate pay amendment and both houses agreed to the conference report on september 24 , 1997 .
