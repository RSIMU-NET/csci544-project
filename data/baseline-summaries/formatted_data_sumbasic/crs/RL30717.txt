as our understanding of human genetics has become more and more sophisticated , scientistshave developed increasingly powerful tools using genetic information to aid in identifying individualpeople .

dna can be helpful in many situations where identification is at question: for example,in criminal cases , forensic dna evidence can link a suspect , or a weapon such as a knife , to a crimescene .

it can also exclude a suspect .

the best known sources of dna evidence are blood andsemen , but increasingly it can be obtained from other items , such as a bottle cap , a toothbrush , a bitemark on a piece of cake , or a fragment of a contact lens .

another use is to identify human remains,such as of a soldier killed in battle .

or it might be used to determine biological relationship , suchas in paternity cases .

this report focuses on using human dna to determine individual identity , butanimal and plant dna can also be used , to identify species ( for example , did a sample of meat comefrom a protected whale species ? ) .

or even individuals ( did a seed pod found in a truck come from aparticular tree at a crime scene ? ) .

 ( 1 ) those and similar developments raise several policy issues , including the use of genetic information in the criminal justice system , the impacts of continuing technological improvements,and the effects of the technology on privacy and individual rights .

this report provides an overviewof how genetic information is used in identification and some of the issues associated with thoseuses .

it begins by discussing the unique properties of genetic information that make it a powerfultool for identification and what is involved in making identifications from physical evidence .

nextis a description of current federal programs and activities related to dna identification , followedby discussion of issues raised by the development of this new technology .

legislation activity in the106th congress focused on several criminal - justice issues ; for detailed discussion , see crs report rl30694 ( pdf ) , dna evidence: legislative initiatives in the 106th congress .

the use of dna in identification - - sometimes called dna typing or dna profiling ( 2 ) - - resultsfrom its unique characteristics .

those characteristics also affect how it can be used and the issuesthat arise from using it .

key features are described below .

it is a complex molecule , containing much information .

dna is a chemical , deoxyribonucleic acid , consisting of modular components , called nucleotides , that are connected in a linear sequence .

each nucleotide contains one of four bases - - called adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine , oftendesignated by their initials a , c , g , and t. each dna molecule consists of two complementarystrands , with each adenine on one strand paired with a thymine on the other , and each guanine witha cytosine .

the sequence of bases strung along a dna molecule contains the information that formsthe basis of the genetic code of humans and most other organisms .

 ( 3 ) much of the growing body ofknowledge about dna comes from efforts of the human genome project , a major goal of whichis to create a map of the code and identify the sequence of bases on the dna molecule .

 ( 4 ) dnaidentification technologies tap a small part of the large set of information that the molecule contains .

each person has billions of identical copies of dna in the cells of the body .

most of the billions of cells in a person's body contain identical sets of dna molecules ( 5 ) - - approximately 3 billionbase - pairs per cell altogether .

most of the dna is contained in 23 pairs of chromosomes in thenuclei of cells .

within each pair , one chromosome is inherited from the mother and the other fromthe father .

some dna , inherited only from the mother , is also contained outside the cell nucleus,in structures called mitochondria , which are small bodies with many copies in each cell .

becausethe human body contains so many copies of dna , even a very small amount of body fluids ortissues , such as blood or skin , can yield useful identifying information .

the structure of the molecule , and therefore the information it contains , varies from person to person .

dna sequences from any two people will be the same at many points along the dnamolecule , but the overall nuclear dna sequence of each person is unique , except for identical twins,who have identical dna .

 ( 6 ) on a single chromosome,individual alleles , which are discretecomponents of a dna sequence , are inherited intact .

each pair of chromosomes has many pairs ofalleles ( 7 ) ( the total number is as yet unknown ) , withone member of the pair inherited from the fatherand the other from the mother .

the region of a pair of chromosomes containing a pair of alleles iscalled a locus .

the dna of the two alleles inherited at any particular locus may have identical ordifferent base - pair sequences .

 ( 8 ) it is the substantialvariation in dna among people that ischaracterized with the technologies used in dna identification .

the structure is inherited , so the dna of close relatives is more similar than that of distant relatives or unrelated people .

since half of a person's dna comes from each parent , ( 9 ) full siblingsalso share half their alleles , on average , and grandparents and first cousins , one quarter .

however,since a son receives his y chromosome from his father , all the alleles on that chromosome areidentical to the father's and are inherited through the paternal line alone .

 ( 10 ) similarly , all alleles inmitochondria are identical to the mother's and are inherited through the maternal line alone .

 ( 11 ) therefore , the mitochondrial dna of a male , for example , will be identical to that of his maternalgrandmother , and his y - chromosome dna identical to that of his paternal grandfather .

theinheritance patterns of dna mean that analyzing a person's dna can also provide identifyinginformation about a relative .

most of a person's dna has no known biological function .

genes are segments of dna thatcontain the code for making specific chemicals ( mostly proteins ) .

humans have tens of thousandsof genes ( the exact number is not yet known ) , but they comprise only a small part of a person'sdna , most of which has no known function .

however , many nonfunctional segments of a person'sdna can be characterized with the techniques of molecular biology ; those segments are called markers .

the distinction between genes and markers has implications for use in identification thatwill be discussed later .

dna is easily preserved with the structure intact .

dna is a surprisingly stable chemical , and sequences can be easily preserved intact in dried or frozen samples .

however , dna can bedegraded , particularly in warm or moist environments or in the presence of many commonchemicals .

the ability to use dna in identification depends both on the size and the condition ofthe sample .

that has consequences for sample collection , handling , and storage in applications suchas law enforcement .

using dna in identification requires comparing dna whose source has not been determined ( such as from a crime scene or from a child in a paternity case ) with dna whose source is known ( such as from a suspect or from a putative father ) .

four basic steps are involved: characterization,comparison , calculation , and interpretation .

they are each discussed below , along with implicationsfor applications and issues .

databases or indexes used in dna identification are of three basic kinds .

one provides theallele frequencies that are used in calculations to estimate profile frequencies and matchprobabilities .

such population databases are drawn from anonymous samples and are separated orstratified according to the population group ( usually based on ethnicity or race ) of the donors , sinceallele frequencies , and therefore match probabilities for different profiles , may differ among suchgroups .

sources are various , such as blood donors or medical patients .

 ( 22 ) the second kind contains profiles of persons whose identity is known .

one example is databases with str or vntr profiles of convicted felons or of victims of unsolved crimes ( suchas the codis database system , discussed below ) .

another is databases with profiles of missingpersons or their biological relatives , such as mtdna profiles of maternal relatives of armed forcespersonnel lost in past military conflicts ( see below ) .

when a profile is obtained from a relevantsample whose source is not known , the database can be searched to determine if a match , called a cold hit , is found .

for example , in an increasing number of cases , a suspect is identified when adna profile from a crime - scene sample is searched against a database containing profiles of personsconvicted of violent crimes or other felonies .

the third kind of database contains profiles of persons whose identity is not known .

samples might come from crime scenes or unidentified remains .

when a profile is obtained from a relevantsample whose source is known , the database can be searched for cold hits , as above .

for example,a profile obtained from a suspect in another crime can be searched against a forensic database ofprofiles associated with crimes for which there are no suspects .

in 1999 , a dna profile of a malemurdered in florida was found to match dna evidence from nine rapes , three in florida and six inwashington , d.c. ( 23 ) .

federal agencies with significant involvement in dna identification activities include thefederal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , the national institute of justice ( nij ) , and the bureau ofjustice assistance ( bja ) in the department of justice ; the national institute of standards andtechnology ( nist ) in the department of commerce ; and the armed forces institute of pathology ( afip ) , the army central identification laboratory , hawaii ( cilhi ) , and the army criminalinvestigation laboratory ( usacil ) in the department of defense .

major activities are describedbelow .

when dna evidence first became available in the united states , questions often arose aboutthe quality of analyses and the absence of widely accepted standards .

 ( 45 ) also , the typing of specimenswas expensive , ( 46 ) and its availability to many stateand local law enforcement agencies was thereforeuneven .

the dna identification act of 1994 , a subtitle of the violent crime control and lawenforcement act of 1994 ( p.l .

103-322 ) , addressed quality control and privacy issues .

it authorizedthe dna identification grants program administered by nij ( see above ) .

the law authorizedappropriations for the program through fy2000 .

it also authorized use of drug control and systemimprovement grants for similar purposes ( 42 u.s.c .

3751 ; those grants are part of the edward byrnememorial state and local law enforcement assistance programs , or byrne grants ) .

the dnaidentification act required that forensic laboratories receiving the grants follow specified qualityassurance and privacy provisions .

recipients are to meet current quality - assurance standards , asspecified by the fbi director , and undergo regular proficiency testing in dna analysis .

the use ofdna samples analyzed by recipients are restricted to use in law enforcement , judicial proceedings,and criminal defense .

however , anonymized samples can also be used in population databases,research , and quality control activities .

the act also provided for the establishment of the fbi's dna advisory board , to recommend quality - assurance and proficiency - testing standards to the director ( sec .

210303 ) , and required thatfbi personnel engaging in dna analysis undergo regular proficiency testing ( sec .

210305 ) .

it alsoauthorized the establishment of codis indexes containing profiles of persons convicted of crimesand samples recovered from crime scenes or unidentified remains ( sec .

210304 ) .

the consolidatedappropriations act of 2000 ( p.l .

106-113 ) additionally provided for an index of profiles from"samples voluntarily contributed from relatives of missing persons" ( sec .

120 ) .

the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-132 ) authorized the application of codis to federal crimes and those committed in the district of columbia ( sec.811 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) .

it also authorized grants to state and local government for participation in codis .

tobe eligible , states must collect dna samples from persons convicted of felony sex crimes ( seeabove ) .

also , the national institutes of health revitalization act of 1993 ( p.l .

103-43 ) establishedas one of the purposes of the national human genome research institute "reviewing and fundingproposals to address the ethical and legal issues associated with the genome project. .

the crime identification technology act of 1998 ( p.l .

105-521 , 112 stat .

1871 ) established the state grant program for criminal justice identification , information , and communication .

grants can be awarded for a broad range of activities to , among other things , improve statecapabilities in crime identification and promote compatibility and integration among local , state , andfederal identification systems , and including accreditation and certification programs relating todna analysis .

funding is authorized through fy2003 .

some of the issues discussed below , particularly those related to law enforcement , were thesubject of legislation in the 106th congress .

see crs report rl30694 ( pdf ) for a discussion of thoselegislative initiatives .

sample backlogs .

dna samples are now collected in all 50 states from persons convicted of certain crimes .

also , dna evidence is routinelygathered from crime scenes and victims in cases of rape , murder , and other violent crimes .

as dnatechnology has improved and states have increased its scope in criminal justice activities ( see nextsection ) , the workload in forensic laboratories has increased .

for example , from 1996 to 1997,casework increased 40% , from a total of about 15,000 to 21,000 , and convicted - offender samplesincreased more than 60% , from 72,000 to 116,000 .

 ( 47 ) given limited resources , forensic laboratoriesmust prioritize the analysis of those and other samples they receive .

therefore , many samples , suchas from scenes of crimes for which there are no suspects , and from convicts who are not suspects foradditional crimes , are given lower priority .

currently , there is a backlog in the united states ofseveral hundred thousand such samples that have not been analyzed and entered into codisdatabases .

that means that profiles from those samples are not available for database searches .

given that "cold hits" have been identified through such searches , the dna commission and othershave proposed that funding be increased to process that backlog .

also , the $30 million appropriatedby congress in fy2000 for dna grants included funding for processing backlogged samples .

an additional factor is the conversion of existing profiles from vntrs to strs .

some states have not converted to using the core str markers , and profiles that use other markers cannot besearched against ndis or codis str records .

conversion requires that a dna sample be retyped - - reanalyzed with str technology .

more than 200,000 existing profiles may need such retyping .

also , there are many "owed" samples - - that is , samples that can be taken under existing law buthave not been .

those include many paroled or released convicts .

the number of such owed samplesnationwide may exceed the number currently backlogged .

 ( 48 ) failure to process backlogs may have several consequences .

crimes that might be solved with the help of a database match may remain unsolved .

that is of particular concern in cases where aperpetrator is likely to perform additional crimes , or where a database match would prevent aninnocent person from being wrongly suspected or perhaps even charged with the crime .

also,crime - scene samples from unsolved crimes may eventually be destroyed as statutes of limitationsexpire , permanently eliminating any possibility of typing any dna evidence .

the size of the backlog makes the question of prioritization particularly important , but it is not straightforward .

for example , typing a person's dna is usually much less expensive than typingdna from a crime scene , because in the latter case , several samples must usually be processed and,unlike with convicted - offender samples , processing cannot usually be automated with existingtechnology .

that might suggest that the highest priority should be given to typing convicted persons,since many more samples could be processed per dollar invested .

however , to make a successfulcold hit requires that crime - scene samples also be typed , so that they can be compared with theprofiles of convicted persons .

also , logistically , it is often easier to obtain a sample from someonenewly in custody than from someone who has been released .

however , a person while in prison isnot a threat to the community , whereas someone who has been released might be ; nevertheless , aprisoner might be discovered through dna analysis to have committed other crimes before havingbeen imprisoned .

finally , solving old crimes with the help of dna evidence serves justice andmight help prevent future crimes , but it might also have negative consequences .

for example,reopening a case that is several years old might retraumatize victims or their families who haveworked to recover from the effects of the crime .

additional federal funding to help reduce the backlog could substantially increase the speed with which backlogged samples are processed , easing uncertainties about how best to prioritize thesamples and increasing the rate at which crimes are solved .

also , the existence of the backlog couldbe attributed in part to the success of the dna identification act grant program , and thegrant - eligibility requirements in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 discussedabove .

in addition , the processing of backlogs would have benefits across states , especially withrespect to "travelling offenders" who commit crimes in more than one state .

databases .

a central issue relating to the kinds of crimes for which dna is collected from convicted persons for inclusion in a profile database orindex .

states vary in the crimes for which they collect dna samples .

qualifying offenses include,at a minimum , felony sex crimes , but several others are included by different states: offenses againstchildren ( 40 states ) , murder ( 36 ) , assault and battery ( 27 ) , kidnapping ( 22 ) , robbery ( 19 ) , burglary ( 14 ) , and all felonies ( 6 ) .

also , 24 states collect samples from juveniles convicted of qualifyingoffenses , most collect retroactively from incarcerated convicts , and some collect from thosepreviously paroled or on probation .

 ( 49 ) in theunited kingdom , the forensic science service , anexecutive agency of the home office , maintains a national database with dna profiles of "suspectscharged , reported , cautioned or convicted for a recordable offence," which is any crime punishableby imprisonment , plus certain other specified offenses .

 ( 50 ) profiles are removed if a suspect isexonerated or acquitted .

as of july 2000 , the u.k. database held approximately 700,000 profilesand had yielded more than 77,000 matches of suspects to crime scenes since its inception in 1995,with almost 130,000 profiles removed following acquittal .

 ( 51 ) in determining whether to broaden the range of qualifying crimes , questions might be raised such as the following: what is the cost - effectiveness of profiling those convicted of a particularclass of crime ? .

for example , are the resources needed to profile those convicted of nonviolentcrimes more effective if spent on profiles or on other aspects of crime solving and prevention ? .

 ( 52 ) what is the proper balance between using profiles to help protect citizens from crime , on the onehand , and the need to protect the civil liberties and privacy of those who might be subject toprofiling , on the other ? .

the power of dna evidence has led some to call for indexing profiles ofall arrestees , or even of all citizens at birth , while others have raised concerns about the effects ofsuch measures on civil liberties .

 ( 53 ) postconviction analysis .

a powerful use of dna evidence is in exonerating the innocent , including in some cases where people have been wrongfullyconvicted .

several issues are associated with postconviction dna analysis .

among them are whensuch procedures are appropriate , and what is the proper role of the federal government .

there are several potential reasons why dna analysis might not have been done when a case was first prosecuted .

one is that the identity of the suspect might not have been an issue at the trial - - for example , the involvement of a suspect in a sexual encounter might not have been in question,but rather whether the encounter was consensual .

in such a case , dna evidence would probably notbe relevant .

another possibility is that no dna evidence was found at the time , but turned up later .

a third is that there was dna evidence , but the technology to analyze it was not available when thecase was prosecuted .

the first use of dna typing in the united states was in the late 1980s , andit was not widely available until a few years ago .

in some cases , relevant dna evidence might have been found and analyzed at the time of the original prosecution but yielded inconclusive results because of the limitations of the technology atthe time .

the much more sensitive str technology did not become an established standard untilthe late 1990s , and many states still use the older , less sensitive vntr markers .

strs or thepotentially even more sensitive ( but less powerful ) mtdna can provide useful profiles from muchsmaller or more degraded samples than vntrs .

consequently , an analysis that was inconclusivewith vntr technology could lead to either a definitive exclusion or , alternatively , a strong matchif a more sensitive system is used .

improvements in dna technology are likely to continue into thefuture , potentially making even more samples amenable to typing .

most states currently do not permit new trials , based on newly discovered evidence , more thanthree years after conviction .

 ( 54 ) however , dnaevidence , properly handled , is very stable and canoften provide useful information even ten years or more after it was initially deposited .

 ( 55 ) thisconfluence of advances in the technology , the stability of dna evidence , and its strong and growingexclusionary power raise questions such as whether the time limit should be extended for caseswhere dna evidence newly discovered or analyzed can be probative , and whether postconvictionlegal procedures should be changed to accommodate the particular features presented by dnaevidence .

 ( 56 ) to date , a few states have passed laws that specifically permit postconviction dna analysis for convicted persons claiming actual innocence .

in considering proposed federal legislation , congressmay consider questions including the following: should such legislation apply only to crimes underfederal jurisdiction , or should it also apply to states ? .

what evidence standards should a petitionerbe required to meet for the procedure to be permitted ? .

should there be a requirement for evidenceto be preserved beyond exhaustion of appeals , and if so , for how long should it be preserved ? .

underwhat circumstances should elimination samples from victims or other third parties be required ? what , if any , accommodation should be made for retyping when new advances are made in dnatechnology ? .

should the government pay for analysis requested by an indigent inmate ? .

shouldwrongfully convicted persons receive compensation ? .

 ( 57 ) .

as more powerful dna - typing techniques have become more affordable , their use in paternity analysis has grown .

an emerging issue involves cases where men who have legally acknowledgedpaternity , sometimes for several years , are shown by dna typing not to be the father of the child .

a central question is whether the men in such cases , who may claim not to be responsible for childsupport since they are not the child's biological father , should nevertheless continue to be heldresponsible .

a concern of child advocates is the potentially negative impacts on children if suchchallenges are allowed .

states have varied in their treatment of this issue .

 ( 58 ) .

current research on improving dna identification is performed or supported mainly by nist , nij , the fbi laboratory , afdil , and private industry .

such research has several broad goals .

improvements in sensitivity of analyses would make useful typing possible from even smaller ormore highly degraded samples than at present .

that could permit more powerful identification ( orexclusion ) from dna in trace evidence from , for example , saliva , tears , and skin cells .

coupledwith further improvements in specificity , such as via use of a larger set of markers , it would alsoincrease the ability of dna evidence to make positive or unique identifications .

even identicaltwins possess minor genetic differences that could eventually be detected .

reducing the timerequired to complete typing could lead to more timely following of leads as well as more quicklyremoving from further consideration those persons excluded by the evidence .

as the costs ofperforming dna analysis has come down , its use has increased .

further reducing cost would makeuse of dna identification more widely available .

research on automation and miniaturization ofthe typing process may lead to cost reductions and further improvements in quality control .

conceivably , an automated , portable dna - typing system could eventually be developed that wouldpermit on - site analysis and identification through comparison against a database via wirelesscommunication .

such major improvements in the technology will take several years at least to perfect .

it is generally believed that str markers will remain the standard for dna identification over the nextdecade , with mtdna increasingly used to analyze highly degraded samples .

research to developways to amplify longer sequences may , however , lead to more use of vntr or other more variablesystems in the near future .

also , the human genome project and related efforts are increasinglyidentifying very small genetic differences , even at the level of a single base ( single nucleotidepolymorphisms , or snps ) .

such research may lead to eventual development of better markersystems .

in some cases , relevant physical characteristics , such as for eye color , might even bededucible from genetic sequences and could help , for example , in identifying suspects .

 ( 59 ) there are several challenges raised by the likely future improvements in dna typing .

improvements in forensic typing will need to be validated by the scientific and law enforcementcommunities and accepted by the courts before they become widely available for use in cases .

therefore , any given case is likely to involve technologies that are technically sound but not the mostrecently developed .

furthermore , significant pressures exist to maintain a substantial degree ofstability in the systems used .

not only is adopting a new technology costly , but frequent change canlead to longer and more costly proceedings and to uncertainty about the most appropriate approach .

 ( 60 ) one concern raised is that technological advances could lead to a lengthening of the appeals processin cases involving dna evidence , or a flood of postconviction petitions for typing or retyping insituations where it would not actually be helpful .

such concerns will need to be balanced againstwhatever added ability the advances provide in reversing or avoiding wrongful convictions .

as the power of dna profiling to identify a person continues to improve , the question arises , can a person be positively or uniquely identified from a dna profile ? .

fbi experts will currentlytestify that a person is the source of a dna sample , provided that the match probability is lowenough ( see the section on interpretation of dna evidence above ) .

however , it has not yet beensettled generally what probability , or alternatively how many loci , are needed to effectively eliminatethe possibility that a match could be coincidental .

one complication is that match probabilities donot take into account the possibility of misidentification resulting from errors at the laboratory or inthe evidence custody chain .

both experts and the courts have generally agreed that such possibilitiesare best addressed in other ways .

 ( 61 ) the stability of dna evidence makes it potentially useful not only in postconviction typing ; it also raises the question of whether statutes of limitations should be extended for crimes in whichsuch evidence is potentially important .

that question will likely increase in importance as thenumber of dna profiles from "cold cases" grows in databases and indexes such as codis .

thebenefits of using dna evidence to bring effective prosecutions after a longer period than currentlyfeasible will need to be balanced against factors such as the desire to avoid retraumatizing victimswho have recovered from the effects of crimes and the need to prioritize the use of limitedlaw - enforcement resources .

 ( 62 ) .

both similarities and differences exist between the use of dna for identification and for medical genetic tests - - with respect to techniques , applications , and the issues raised .

the mostfundamental similarity is that both rely on genetic differences among people .

the most fundamentaldifference is in the characteristics of the dna sequences that each currently uses - - in particular,variability , functionality , and independence .

variability .

a genetic marker used in identification should be highly variable - - that is , there should be many alleles , and none of them should be very common .

the more variable the markers,the fewer are needed for a positive identification .

in contrast , a gene examined in a genetic test isunlikely to be highly variable .

that is because genetic tests are most often used in medicine , todiagnose or predict the likelihood of a disease or condition caused by a genetic abnormality , whichmost people will not have .

 ( 63 ) independence refers to whether different loci tend to be inherited together .

two loci that occur close together on a chromosome will usually tend to be inherited together - - they will be linked , notindependent .

two loci that occur on different chromosomes will usually be inherited independently - - they will be unlinked .

in genetic testing , only one locus is usually of interest , so linkage is notusually important .

in contrast , use of dna to identify people requires examining several loci , andthe mathematics that is used works best if the loci are independent .

 ( 64 ) functionality .

a sequence is of interest in genetic testing specifically because it is a gene that codes for a particular chemical product .

however , in identification , a noncoding sequence or markeris of most interest .

 ( 65 ) that is because themathematics that is used in identification works best withnoncoding loci .

 ( 66 ) although most loci used inidentification are noncoding , it is possible thatfunctions for at least some will be discovered in the future .

furthermore , some , in particular strs,are thought to be linked to coding loci that may be implicated in genetic diseases or conditions .

 ( 67 ) regulation and accreditation of laboratories performing medical genetic tests and dna identification are accomplished through different mechanisms .

clinical laboratories , which mayperform medical genetic tests , are regulated and must be certified by the u.s. department of healthand human services through the provisions of the clinical laboratory improvement amendmentsof 1988 , as amended ( p.l .

100-578 ) .

standards are developed by the health care financeadministration and the centers for disease control and prevention .

medical research laboratories,if they are supported by federal funds or are otherwise subject to regulation , are subject to federalpolicies relating to the protection of human subjects ( 45 c.f.r .

46 , 21 c.f.r .

50 and 56 ) .

forensiclaboratories do not require federal certification , but to be eligible for dna identification grants orbyrne grants , they must adhere to standards set by the fbi and undergo regular proficiency testing ( p.l .

103-322 , sec .

210302 ) .

also , in criminal and civil cases , dna evidence must pass the scrutinyof the judicial process , where custody - chain and quality - control procedures , as well as other aspectsof typing , may be challenged .

 ( 68 ) consequently,new dna technologies are likely to be adopted moreslowly for forensic use than for medical testing .

there is currently no federal law governing genetic privacy and discrimination per se , although congress has considered several bills addressing such concerns from a medical perspective .

theexecutive branch has also taken some actions , as have several states .

 ( 69 ) the privacy act of 1974 ( 5u.s.c .

552a ) places restrictions on agencies with respect to the disclosure of personally identifiableinformation in their possession , including any "identifying particular assigned to the individual , suchas a finger or voice print or a photograph. .

however , it applies only to federal agencies .

executiveorder 13145 prohibits genetic discrimination against executive branch employees ; it applies tomedical genetic tests and does not cover the use of dna in identification per se .

other federal lawsand guidelines provide privacy protections for certain other kinds of personal information relatingto health and medical research .

 ( 70 ) current federal and state laws also provide safeguards against the misuse of dna profiles collected in law enforcement .

specifically , the dna identification act of 1994 ( p.l .

103-322 ) required grantees to certify that dna samples and analyses "be made available only - - ( a ) to criminal justice agencies for law enforcement identification purposes ; ( b ) in judicialproceedings , if otherwise admissible pursuant to applicable statutes orrules ; ( c ) for criminal defense purposes , to a defendant , whoshall have access to samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which thedefendant is charged ; or ( d ) if personally identifiable information is removed,for a population statistics database , for identification research and protocol development purposes,or for quality control purposesï¿½ .

the act also applies those privacy requirements to federal , state , and local participants in codis .

however , state laws vary with respect to how such samples can be used .

somedisagreement exists over whether state protections are adequate .

 ( 71 ) samples deposited in the armed forces repository of specimen samples for the identification of remains are limited to the following uses: "identification of human remains ; ï¿½[i]nternal qualityassurance activitiesï¿½ ; [a] purpose for which the donorï¿½ ( or surviving next - of - kin ) providesconsent ; " or , when specifically authorized , criminal procedures for which "[n]o reasonablealternative means for obtaining a specimen for dna profile analysis is availableï¿½. .

 ( dodd5154.24 , sec .

3.5 ) .

since most genetic markers currently used in dna identification are noncoding , the privacy and discrimination issues raised are somewhat different than with medical genetic testing .

forexample , knowing someone's dna profile for the 13 core str loci can provide information aboutpaternity but provides no information at this time about physical traits such as a propensity to aparticular genetic disease .

 ( 72 ) however , the issuesmay begin to converge as new advances ingenomics are developed and applied , or if current identification technologies are applied in thecontext of genetic testing .

for example , in some cases clinical research laboratories have reportedlyused str typing of samples as an added protection against the possibility of potential mislabeling .

more generally , as dna identification becomes more sophisticated , its potential applications are likely to broaden , potentially increasing privacy concerns .

for example , it is already possible forparents to purchase kits for obtaining dna samples from their children and to have profilesdeveloped from those samples and placed in a database to be used potentially if the children becomemissing .

such private - sector practices are not covered by federal laws and judicial rulings thatprovide privacy or other protections against misuse or abuse of the information .

government agencies in other countries have also become involved in dna - identification activities that would likely be limited to the private sector in the united states .

britain's forensicscience service ( fss ) is an executive agency of the british government but is permitted to operateas a nonprofit corporation that offers services not only to the government but also to the public .

among its services to corporations is the development of dna profiles of employees who might beat risk of being kidnapped .

the profiles could then be compared to any biological material providedby kidnappers .

fss also provides paternity - analysis services to the public .

 ( 73 ) the privacy of geneticinformation obtained or used in such services would presumably be protected by a european uniondirective on privacy of personal data .

 ( 74 ) such broadening applications may raise concerns about "function creep," ( 75 ) the gradual wideningof an application to uses not originally intended .

one example often given is the slowly broadeningrange of uses over the years of social security numbers .

the identifying power of dna , thedecreasing cost of typing , and the increasing ability to obtain a useful sample without drawing blood,make dna potentially attractive for a wide range of uses requiring verification of identity .

 ( 76 ) as long as dna typing uses noncoding loci , privacy issues arising from its use in identification should remain limited .

however , three potential issues might deserve particular attention as the useof the technology increases .

first , as genomic research leads to increasingly sophisticatedtechnologies for detecting genetic differences , it may become possible to use coding loci ( genes ) toprovide identification .

use of coding dna for identification could raise issues of privacy anddiscrimination similar to those that have raised concerns with respect to medical testing - - if , forexample , such information became publicly available during a judicial proceeding .

second , dna samples obtained from a person - - and in many cases from crime - scene evidence , remains , or other sources - - contain the person's entire genetic code , not just the profileinformation .

therefore , the disposition of the samples themselves , after profiling , is potentially anissue .

that is especially a potential concern with respect to private - sector activities wheredisposition of profiles or samples is not necessarily regulated by current law .

a case involvingelectronic commerce illustrates the concern .

toysmart.com collected information about customersunder a privacy policy that claimed the information would not be shared with third parties .

however , when the company filed for bankruptcy , it included the database of customer informationamong the assets it was selling .

the federal trade commission unsuccessfully opposed the sale ofthe database .

 ( 77 ) third , a dna sample and profile contain information not only about the subject , but also about that person's biological relatives .

therefore , consideration of privacy issues related to dnaidentification , as with genetic testing in medicine , must take into account potential impacts on familymembers .

that can raise potentially difficult issues , as illustrated by the following hypotheticalexample .

suppose that a dna profile from a convicted offender is similar but not identical to thatobtained from a crime scene .

is it appropriate based on that information for a sibling of theconvicted offender to be arrested as a suspect ? .

alternatively , suppose that a person is suspected ofcommitting a crime but there is insufficient evidence to make an arrest .

suppose further that theperson has a sibling who has a profile in codis .

is it appropriate to examine the profile of thesibling to determine how similar it is to the crime - scene evidence ? .

such examples are likely to arisein real cases as dna becomes more widely used in identification .

 ( 78 ) the growing use of dna as an effective identification tool , and its increasing overlap with aspects of medical genetic testing , are likely to create a range of policy challenges over the nextseveral years .

while this report has discussed several current and emerging issues , new ones maywell develop as the technology evolves .

the biological role of dna , the information it containsabout family members , and other features of the molecule and the technology may make some ofthose issues , and the appropriate legislative response , especially challenging .
