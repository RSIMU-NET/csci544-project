tax rates on dividends increased in 2013 for certain high - income taxpayers .

these increases are due to ( 1 ) increased rates on dividends for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket enacted as part of the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) ; and ( 2 ) a 3.8% tax on net investment income , including dividends , for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income above certain thresholds .

before atra , current law would have treated dividends as ordinary income for tax purposes after 2012 .

thus , the permanent tax rates on qualified dividends in atra were an increase in tax rates for certain high - income taxpayers relative to current policy and a decrease in tax rates relative to current law .

these provisions of atra , in part , reversed the effect of qualified dividends having been taxed at reduced tax rates since 2003 .

before 2003 , dividends were treated as ordinary income for tax purposes .

past tax reforms have often changed the tax treatment of dividends .

hence , as congress evaluates tax reform options , changes to the tax treatment of dividends may be considered .

in the context of a base - broadening , rate - reducing tax reform , increasing tax rates on qualified dividends is one option for raising revenue that could be used to reduce marginal tax rates .

taxing dividends as ordinary income could raise revenues sufficient to offset a 1.3% reduction in individual income tax rates , meaning the top tax rate could be reduced by roughly 0.5 percentage points , from 39.6% to approximately 39.1% .

since the dividend tax can be viewed as part of the system to tax income from corporate equity , another option would be to increase the tax on dividends to finance a corporate rate cut .

a rough static estimate suggests that taxing dividends at ordinary rates could allow corporate tax rates to be reduced by roughly 4.6% , allowing for a revenue - neutral reduction in statutory corporate rates from 35.0% to an estimated 33.2% .

house ways and means committee chairman dave camp proposed changing the tax treatment of dividends in his discussion draft , the tax reform act of 2014 .

specifically , in his proposal , dividends would be taxed as ordinary income , with 40% of capital gain and qualified dividend income excluded from taxable income .

this report provides background information useful to evaluating potential changes in the tax treatment of dividends .

the first section of this report summarizes the current law tax treatment of dividends .

this report also reviews economic issues related to efficiency , equity , and macroeconomic considerations .

the final sections discuss dividend tax policy options , including integration options , where the corporate and individual income tax systems would be designed so that dividend income is taxed once .

the tax treatment of dividends depends on the recipient .

under current law , dividends received by individuals are generally taxed at reduced capital gains tax rates .

for 2013 , the maximum tax rate that applied to qualified dividends received by individuals was 20% ( see table 1 ) .

the 20% top rate applies to taxpayers in the 39.6% income tax bracket ( single filers with taxable income above $400,000 ; married filers with taxable income above $450,000 ) .

taxpayers in the 25% to 35% tax brackets pay a rate of 15% on dividend income , while taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets have a 0% tax rate on dividend income .

dividend income may also be subject to a net investment income tax .

beginning in 2013 , a 3.8% tax is imposed on the lesser of ( 1 ) net investment income ; or ( 2 ) the excess of modified adjusted gross income ( magi ) above a threshold amount .

this threshold amount is $250,000 for taxpayers filing a joint return , $200,000 for single filers , and $125,000 for married filers filing separately .

corporations may claim a deduction for dividends received .

this deduction helps prevent multiple - level corporate taxation of dividend income .

ultimately , dividends are taxed when received by non - corporate shareholders .

corporate shareholders can deduct 100% of dividends received from corporations in the same affiliated group , 80% of dividends received from corporations where the recipient owns at least 20% of the payee's stock , and 70% of dividends received from other corporations .

additional limitations prevent full deductions for stock purchases that are debt - financed .

tax - exempt entities that receive dividends are not required to pay tax on most types of dividends received .

dividends are specifically exempt from the unrelated business income tax ( ubit ) .

taxing qualified dividends at reduced tax rates reduces tax revenues .

for 2012 , the tax expenditure estimate for the preferred tax treatment of qualified dividends was $29.8 billion .

the cost of this tax expenditure should decrease post - atra , as there may have been a surge of dividends in anticipation of the rate increases enacted in atra .

distributional analysis examines how dividend income is distributed across the income spectrum .

as is discussed below , dividend income tends to be concentrated at the top of the income distribution .

equity analysis examines the distribution of the burden of taxes on dividends , which may differ from the distribution of dividend income if taxpayers are able to shift tax burdens .

equity analysis is also concerned with issues related to "double taxation," and the ultimate effects of taxing corporate equity income at both the corporate and individual level .

income from corporate equity investments , including dividends , is often subject to higher taxation than other types of investments ; as such income is taxed in both the corporate and individual income tax systems .

for example , $1 of net corporate income would be subjected to the corporate tax rate of 35% , generating $0.35 of tax and leaving $0.65 of after - tax income .

if the $0.65 of after - tax income were paid out as a dividend , an individual receiving that dividend may be taxed at a maximum rate of 39.6% .

this individual would pay an additional $0.26 of tax if dividends are taxed as ordinary income ( 39.6% of $0.65 ) .

hence , in this example , the tax rate on $1 of net corporate income paid out as a dividend to an individual would be 61% ( $0.35 corporate in corporate tax plus $0.26 in tax at the individual level ) .

the taxation of dividends at both the corporate and individual level is the so - called "double taxation" of dividend income .

under current dividend rates for qualified dividends , the additional dividend tax would be $0.13 ( 20% of $0.65 ) and the total tax would be 48% .

not all dividends are subject to double taxation .

dividends paid to nonprofit institutions , pension funds , state and local governments , and certain retirement accounts are not subject to double taxation .

in 2009 , roughly 44% of dividends paid by corporations were reported as income on individual income tax returns .

thus , in 2009 , roughly 56% of dividends paid were not taxed at the individual level .

both vertical and horizontal equity issues are relevant when evaluating the tax treatment of dividends .

the distribution of the tax on dividends , whether the burden of the tax is more likely to be borne by higher income individuals , raises issues related to vertical equity .

as discussed below , a discussion of corporate tax incidence is useful to inform equity issues related to dividend taxation .

the "double taxation" of dividends also raises issues of horizontal equity .

are holders of corporate stock treated unfairly compared to holders of corporate bonds or other investments ? .

tax rates on dividends were reduced in 2003 with the goal of reducing economic distortions , which congress believed would promote economic growth .

there are two distortions of note .

equity - financed investments are generally taxed more heavily than debt - financed investments , since interest payments on debt are deductible .

equity - financed corporate investments are also generally taxed more heavily than non - corporate investments .

recall that non - corporate investments are subject to a single layer of taxation .

differentials in tax burdens create distortions that favor non - corporate investment over corporate investment and debt - financed investment over equity - financed investment .

the department of the treasury's 1992 study on tax integration found that full integration , and the associated reduction in economic distortions , could result in substantial efficiency gains .

at the time of the treasury study , however , dividends were taxed as ordinary income at the individual level .

given that dividends are currently taxed at a reduced rate , there is less potential for efficiency gains to be had through integration .

potential efficiency gains are also complicated by issues of how revenue is to be replaced if the tax is repealed .

assuming a fixed level of revenue , the overall efficiency effects depend on how the distortions arising from capital compare to other distortions that may be larger under different tax systems .

while eliminating "double taxation" of dividends may enhance economic efficiency , promoting economic efficiency does not necessarily lead to economic growth .

economic growth is the result of increased savings , investment , or labor supply .

while many economists believe that taxes on dividends discourage investment and distort the allocation of capital in the economy , there is an alternative view in which changes in dividend tax policy do not affect investment incentives .

dividend tax policy may be designed to balance various economic , equity , and revenue objectives .

various policy options , including dividend relief as provided in the current system , several forms of integration , and increasing taxes on dividends , are briefly discussed in the following sections .

under the current system , capital used in the corporate sector is taxed twice — once at the corporate level and again at the individual level .

debt - financing also tends to be tax - favored , as interest payments are deductible .

integrating the corporate and individual income tax systems would increase economic efficiency , removing existing distortions between debt versus equity financing and corporate versus non - corporate businesses .

there are various policy options for achieving integration , in some form .

full integration , for reasons discussed below , is practically infeasible .

the current system , where dividends are taxed at reduced rates at the individual level , is a simple policy option designed to achieve some of the efficiency benefits associated with integration .

reforms that lower or raise taxes only on dividends also affect the relative taxes on distributions versus retentions of earnings .

some proposals could reverse the current treatment to favor distributions rather than retentions , when the object most likely would be similar treatment , to avoid having tax policy influencing corporate payout decisions .

further reducing taxes on dividends or integrating the corporate and individual income tax systems could reduce federal revenues .

thus , considered in isolation , integration policies could increase the deficit and ultimately increase the national debt .

integration policies may also be used to address some of the concerns associated with taxing multinational corporations .

over time , international capital mobility has increased and evidence suggests that profit shifting has increased as well .

the current u.s. system , which taxes capital income fully at the corporate level , with reduced rates on capital gains and dividends and the individual level , encourages corporations to report income in low - tax jurisdictions , reducing taxes collected domestically .

taxing capital income at the shareholder level addresses issues related to the mobility of the corporate tax base .

as discussed above , taxes on capital income , including dividends , tend to be progressive .

thus , policy options that reduce taxes on dividends , considered in isolation , would tend to reduce the progressivity of the overall tax system .

a "classical" system taxes income at both the corporate and shareholder level .

starting in 2003 , the united states moved from a classical system to a "modified classical" system , taxing shareholder - level dividend income at preferred rates .

preferred shareholder - level tax rates on dividends reduced the difference in tax burden on different types of investments ( eg , debt financed versus equity financed ; corporate versus non - corporate ) .

reducing shareholder - level taxes on dividends lessened efficiency - reducing distortions , as the tax rates on different types of investments became more closely aligned .

reducing shareholder - level taxes on dividends is a relatively simple option for obtaining a portion of the efficiency gains that could result from some form of integration .

even with the reduced tax rates on dividends , there are a number of distortions in the current system .

generally , there is still a tax - induced bias for debt financing .

corporate income paid out as dividends to taxable investors is taxed twice , creating an incentive for corporations to retain earnings or engage in share repurchases ( as opposed to paying out dividends ) .

the current tax treatment of dividends also provides an incentive for businesses to operate in a non - corporate form .

there are several methods of integrating the corporate and individual income tax .

full integration covers both dividends and retained earnings .

full integration can be achieved through taxation on a partnership basis , through a shareholder ( or imputation ) credit system that uses the corporation as a withholding entity , or through elimination of taxes at the individual level .

a shareholder ( imputation ) credit system that applies only to dividends is another option , sometimes referred to as "partial integration" or dividend relief .

other options for partial integration or dividend relief include a deduction for dividends paid at the firm level or an exclusion for dividends received at the individual level .

a 1992 report by the u.s. department of the treasury studied options for integrating the corporate and individual income tax systems , highlighting economic and administrative considerations .

the 1992 treasury report recommended a dividend exclusion system ( discussed below ) , partially because this system would require the least change from current law .

most integration proposals face similar policy considerations .

key policy considerations include ( 1 ) the treatment of foreign shareholders ; ( 2 ) the treatment of domestic tax - exempt shareholders ; ( 3 ) whether corporate tax preferences should be passed through ; and ( 4 ) whether foreign corporate tax payments should be fully credited in systems providing shareholder relief .

the 1992 treasury report's recommendations were that the benefits of integration not be extended to foreign shareholders ( except by treaty ) ; capital income of tax - exempt investors should be taxed ; corporate - level tax preferences should not be extended to shareholders ; and foreign tax payments by u.s. corporations should not be treated the same as domestic tax payments ( although treaty agreements are possible ) , to avoid reducing the u.s. tax claim against foreign - source income .

the purest approach to full integration would be taxation on a partnership basis , so that each shareholder pays a tax on a pro - rata share of corporate income .

full integration would effectively eliminate the corporate tax and instead tax individuals on their share of corporate income .

full integration would remove economic distortions imposed by the double taxation of income in the corporate sector , which could increase consumer well - being and consumption .

there are , however , significant challenges to treating all businesses as pass - throughs .

first , there is the issue of how to allocate profits and losses amongst shareholders .

allocation is further complicated when there are multiple classes of stock and when ownership changes hands multiple times throughout the year .

second , there is the question of losses , and whether passive loss rules should apply .

finally , there is the issue of foreign and tax - exempt shareholders .

with more than half of dividends paid not being taxed at the individual level , a substantial portion of capital income is taxed only once , at the corporate level .

in 2013 , the corporate income was estimated to generate $287 billion in federal revenues .

thus , without enacting other policies , this option would result in substantial federal revenue losses .

because of the complications associated with a full integration via shareholder allocation option , this approach has generally not been pursued in the u.s. or employed in other countries .

integration of the corporate and individual tax systems can also be achieved by granting a credit at the individual level for taxes paid at the corporate level .

under this approach , the corporation serves as a withholding agent , paying taxes on dividend income on behalf of the shareholder .

distributed income is ultimately taxed at the shareholder's tax rate , with credits awarded for taxes paid at the corporate level .

until recently , a number of european countries used a dividend credit imputation system to achieve partial integration .

challenges to the imputation system related to the conditions of the european community ( ec ) treaty have led several european union member countries to abandon their imputation systems , with several countries adopting exclusion systems instead .

as of 2013 , the united kingdom , canada , and mexico were among the countries continuing to use imputation systems ( see appendix c ) .

there are a number of challenges associated with implementing an imputation credit system .

first , there is the question as to whether the credit should be refundable to non - taxable investors ( including foreign shareholders and tax - exempt entities ) .

making credits non - refundable would reduce the revenue loss associated with moving to an imputation system .

in a globalized economy , however , disallowing imputation credits to foreign investors can make it harder to attract foreign investment capital .

second , there is the issue of corporate tax preferences , and whether those preferences should be allocated to shareholders .

the 1992 treasury report on integration did not recommend enacting an imputation credit to achieve integration , citing administrative complexity .

an imputation credit system if restricted to dividends ( which would likely be necessary to make the system practical ) would favor distributions over retentions .

depending on design , an imputation credit system may not address open economy issues .

rational investors should be indifferent to corporate tax planning in a system with imputation credits .

australia's experience , however , suggests that imputation credits may have encouraged australian corporations to pay tax domestically , generating credits to pass on to shareholders .

taxing dividends as ordinary income , while allowing corporations a deduction for dividends paid , is another option to prevent double taxing income .

with this option , firms would be able to take a deduction for dividend payments , similar to the deduction that is allowed under current law for interest payments .

similar to other integration options , the treatment of non - taxable entities creates challenges in implementing a dividends paid deduction .

if a corporation is able to claim a deduction for dividends paid , and the dividends are received by a tax - exempt entity , the income goes untaxed .

there are also questions regarding how to treat tax preferences under a dividends paid deduction .

if dividends are deducted at the full statutory rate when the firm has taken advantage of other tax preferences , some portion of income may escape corporate - level taxation .

dividend deduction proposals could achieve some reduction in corporate tax rates , which is important for promoting efficient allocation of capital internationally .

however , a dividends paid deduction would create an incentive for paying dividends rather than retaining earnings , potentially distorting corporate payout decisions .

an alternative to a dividend deduction is an "allowance for corporate equity," or ace .

under this type of system , deductions would be based on the amount of corporate equity , not necessarily dividends paid .

the ace option would address concerns expressed by classes of firms that tend to pay less in dividends ( eg , the technology sector ; newer firms ) .

it would be beneficial for reducing international distortions .

the ace option suffers from some of the main drawbacks associated with the dividend deduction , namely that the corporate tax no longer functions as a backstop to the individual income tax .

a dividend exclusion provides relief at the individual level , by not taxing dividends received .

a dividend exclusion can be designed such that only dividends paid out of income that has been taxed at the corporate level be excluded from individuals' income .

dividend exclusions can also be limited ( eg , up to $400 of dividends received excluded from income ) , as was the case in the early 1980s .

limiting the dividend exclusion , or providing for a partial exclusion , are options for addressing concerns about potential revenue losses .

a dividend exclusion was the recommendation of the 1992 treasury report on integration .

a dividend exclusion was also considered in 2003 .

ultimately , the reduced rate on dividends was enacted as an alternative , avoiding the administrative complexity a dividend exclusion would have imposed on firms to determine which dividends would qualify to be excluded .

a dividend exclusion would mean that income paid out as dividends was taxed once , at the corporate level .

as noted above , if profit shifting or international issues are a concern , policymakers may want to consider taxing capital income , including dividends , at the individual rather than the corporate level .

house ways and means committee chairman dave camp has proposed a dividend exclusion as part of the tax reform act of 2014 .

in this proposal , 40% of net long - term capital gains and qualified dividend income would be excluded from taxable income .

in the camp proposal , the exclusion would be coupled with provisions that would tax long - term capital gains and qualified dividends as ordinary income .

the exclusion for capital gains and dividend income as proposed in the camp draft would keep effective tax rates on capital income close to current levels .

with a 40% exclusion , effective tax rates for taxpayers in the 10% , 25% , and 35% brackets would be 6% , 15% , and 21% , respectively .

the 1992 treasury report also discussed imposing a comprehensive business income tax ( cbit ) , which is an entity - level tax that would apply to interest and profits .

this proposal would allow no deduction for interest at the firm level ( for either corporations or unincorporated businesses ) , reducing the current system bias for debt - financing .

individuals would pay no tax on interest or dividends and capital gains on corporate stock would either be excluded or the basis adjusted to reflect retained earnings .

a cbit could be designed to be revenue - neutral , addressing revenue loss concerns raised by other integration proposals .

adopting cbit , however , could make it more difficult to attract foreign capital , as the tax burden on debt - financed investment would be increased .

cbit represents a substantial change from current policy , and a long phase - in would be required to avoid penalizing firms with large amounts of debt .

over the phase - in period , potential efficiency gains from cbit would be lessened and there would be reduced revenue potential .

taxing dividends at ordinary rates would generate additional tax revenues .

as noted in the " introduction ," additional revenues could be used to reduce individual income tax rates .

some have suggested taxing dividends at ordinary rate at the individual level , using the revenues to reduce corporate tax rates .

increasing taxes on dividends would increase the progressivity of the tax system overall .

even if the revenues were used to decrease corporate tax rates , progressivity would likely increase .

because individuals have a limited ability to shift income to avoid taxes in an open - economy , the incidence of capital taxes at the individual level tends to fall more heavily on capital , making the incidence of the tax more progressive .

a policy that increases taxes at the individual level , while reducing corporate tax rates , may raise concerns that corporations may be used to shelter income from the individual income tax .

house ways and means committee chairman dave camp has proposed taxing dividends as ordinary income as part of the tax reform act of 2014 .

under this proposal , 40% of long - term capital gains and qualified dividends would be excluded from income , which would reduce the effective tax rate on these forms of income below statutory rates .

overall , jct estimates that taxing dividends at ordinary rates while providing a 40% exclusion would generate additional revenues , $18.7 billion between 2014 and 2023 .

the camp proposal uses revenue generated from repealing and modifying various tax provisions to reduce corporate and individual tax rates .

appendix a .

history of dividend taxation when first established in 1909 as part of the payne - aldrich tariff act the modern corporate income tax included dividends paid to shareholders in the definition of net income .

hence , dividend payments to shareholders were not deductible .

the tax on corporations was set at 1% of net income over $5,000 .

the modern individual income tax came into being in 1913 as section ii of the underwood - simmons tariff act .

this act imposed a 1% tax on the net income of citizens and residents of the united states ( the 1% levy was referred to as the normal tax ) .

in addition , the 1913 act levied an additional tax ( or surtax ) on an individual's net income in excess of $20,000 .

the surtax rates ranged from 1% to 6% .

for purposes of the normal tax on individuals , net income did not include dividends paid from the net earnings of corporations subject to the corporate tax .

however , dividend income was included in an individual's net income for purposes of computing the surtax .

thus , from 1913 through 1935 , dividends received by individuals were not subject to the normal tax on individual income .

from 1913 through 1917 , the corporate income tax rate was set at the same rate as the normal tax on individual income .

under the revenue act of 1917 , the corporate rate was increased such that it exceeded the rate applied to normal income .

from 1917 through 1935 , dividends were exempt from the individual normal income tax .

however , since the rate on individual normal income was less than the rate on corporate earnings , the value of the exemption at the individual level did not fully offset corporate taxes paid on income that was ultimately paid out as dividends .

the revenue act of 1936 ( sometimes referred to as the undistributed profits tax act ) made significant changes in the tax treatment of dividend income .

first , corporate dividends paid to individuals were subject to both the normal individual income tax and the surtax .

second , the act imposed a new surtax on the undistributed net income of corporations .

the new corporate surtax consisted of five graduated rates ranging from 7% to 27% .

the 1936 act was designed to prevent what was considered a "leakage" in the individual income tax system .

the tax rate on corporate income was lower than the individual surtax rates .

corporations could reduce the net tax on corporate source income by retaining earnings rather than paying them out to stockholders as dividends ( where they would be subject to the surtax ) .

this was considered a tax avoidance scheme for upper income taxpayers and the 1936 act was imposed as a means of forcing corporations to pay out their earnings as dividends where they could be taxed to the individual stockholders .

the 1936 act was opposed by corporate interests as a detriment to investment and growth .

the revenue act of 1938 essentially repealed the tax on undistributed corporate profits .

it significantly reduced the surtax rate structure on undistributed profits and applied the surtax to corporations with net incomes over $25,000 .

moreover , the surtax was applicable only for calendar years 1938 and 1939 , after which it expired .

from 1939 until 1954 , there was no special corporate or individual income tax treatment of dividend income .

the 1954 act which recodified the income tax ( the internal revenue code of 1954 ) introduced a new dividend exclusion for individuals .

for married couples , each spouse could exclude the first $50 of dividend income received with respect to stock owned by that spouse .

hence married couples could have a maximum exclusion of $100 if both spouses received at least $50 of dividend income .

single individuals were allowed to exclude up to $50 of dividend income from taxation .

in addition , taxpayers were granted a tax credit equal to 4% of the dividends they received in excess of the exclusion .

the revenue act of 1964 increased the dividend exclusion for married couples to $100 for each spouse ( maximum of $200 per joint return ) .

it also increased the dividend exclusion to $100 for single individuals .

for tax year 1964 , it reduced the dividend tax credit to 2% of dividends received in excess of the exclusion .

for tax years after 1964 , the act repealed the dividend tax credit .

in 1980 , the crude oil windfall profits tax act increased the maximum dividend exclusion for joint returns from $200 to $400 and allowed the exclusion regardless of which spouse earned the income .

for single individuals , the dividend exclusion was increased from $100 to $200 .

the 1980 act also expanded the exclusion to cover interest income .

these changes were to be effective only for tax years 1981 and 1982 .

after 1982 , the exclusion was to revert to its previous law levels and coverage ( $100 exclusion of dividend income for each individual with respect to stock owned by that individual ) .

the economic recovery tax act of 1981 repealed the interest and dividend exclusion for tax years beginning after december 31 , 1981 .

however , the 1981 act reinstated the previous law exclusion of up to $100 of dividend income from taxation .

for joint returns , a $200 dividend exclusion was allowed without regard to which spouse actually received the dividend income .

this reinstated dividend exclusion became effective in tax year 1982 .

the dividend exclusion for individuals was ultimately repealed by the tax reform act of 1986 .

the exclusion was eliminated to broaden the tax base , with the revenues used to reduce tax rates .

through 2002 , dividends were fully taxed as ordinary income at the individual level .

under the jobs and growth tax reconciliation act of 2003 ( jgtrra ; p.l .

108-27 ) the top tax rate on qualified dividends was reduced to 15% through 2008 .

congress believed that reducing the tax rate on dividends would promote economic growth .

capital gains tax rates were also reduced to the same levels .

taxing dividends as ordinary income was believed to distort corporate financial decisions , leading firms to prefer debt over equity financing .

it was also believed that taxing dividends as ordinary income encouraged firms to retain earnings , also distorting economic decision - making .

the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 ( tipra ; p.l .

109-222 ) , adopted in 2006 , extended the 2003 reductions in dividend tax rates through 2010 .

additionally , under tipra , the tax rate on dividends for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets was reduced from 5% to 0% .

the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) extended the reduced tax rates on dividends for two years , through 2012 .

the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 ( hcera ; p.l .

111-152 ) contained a provision subjecting certain individuals to a 3.8% "unearned income medicare contribution" tax on net investment income , beginning in 2013 .

the tax applies to single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income ( magi ) in excess of $200,000 and married taxpayers with an magi in excess of $250,000 .

the $200,000 and $250,000 thresholds are not adjusted for inflation .

net investment income includes taxable net capital gains , as well as interest , dividends , non - qualified annuities , royalties , and rents under the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 ) , the top tax rate on dividends was allowed to rise to 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket .

for all other taxpayers , the 15% or 0% tax rate on dividends was made permanent .

appendix b .

the "old" and "new" views on dividends there are two different "views" regarding the effects of dividend taxation .

these alternative views were developed in part to explain why firms pay dividends when dividends are taxed more heavily than capital gains ( the so - called "dividend paradox" ) .

each view has different implications for the effects of dividend taxation on savings and investment .

the "traditional ( old ) view" under the "traditional view" or "old view" dividends provide non - tax or non - financial benefits to shareholders .

for example , paying dividends might serve as a signal to investors that the firm is doing well .

firms are believed to pay out some portion of current earnings as dividends .

new ( or marginal ) investment is financed by new share issues .

the old view finds that taxing dividends at the individual level increases the cost of capital .

thus , taxing dividends at the individual level is believed to discourage investment .

further , "double taxation" of dividends is associated with an inefficient allocation of capital , as taxes on dividends discourage corporate equity investment .

the "trapped equity ( new ) view" under the "trapped equity view" or "new view" dividends are the only way to distribute earnings to shareholders .

firms earning profits can either pay dividends and the associated taxes now , or reinvest earnings , paying taxes on the dividends paid out of the increased future earnings later .

since there is no other way to distribute earnings ( eg , it is assumed that share repurchases cannot be used to distribute earnings to shareholders ) the dividend tax cannot be avoided .

thus , taxes on dividends do not affect incentives for investment .

dividend taxes are , however , capitalized into stock prices .

therefore , under the new view , an increase ( decrease ) in dividend tax rates results in a windfall loss ( gain ) to shareholders .

a difficulty with the new view of dividends is that it appears to contradict observed facts .

the theory of the new view only holds if firms have no other way to distribute income and if they do not issue new shares while also paying dividends .

if firms can freely repurchase their own shares , the theory collapses .

the influence of the new view appears to have faded recently , perhaps in part to the widespread practice of u.s. firms repurchasing shares .

the new view theories can be traced originally to mervyn king , a british economist .

the united kingdom at that time prohibited firms from repurchasing their own shares .

there were restrictions in the united states if repurchase appeared to directly substitute for dividends ( by repurchasing a constant proportion of each stockholder's shares ) , and those restrictions as well as infrequent observations of share repurchases may have led economists to embrace the new view .

a u.s. firm , however , was always free to purchase its own shares on the open market , and as they increasingly did so the new view did not appear viable .

appendix c. taxation of dividends in oecd countries with the reduced tax rates on dividends enacted in 2003 , the u.s. moved from having a "classical" system , where dividends were taxed at the same rate as other types of capital income ( eg , interest ) , to a "modified classical" system , where dividends are taxed at the shareholder level , but at reduced rates .

as a result of this change , the total statutory rate on dividend income decreased .

on average , combined ( corporate and individual ) statutory tax rates on dividends have decreased in oecd countries over the past decade .

unlike the u.s. , however , most countries have achieved this decrease through reduced taxes on corporate profits ( see figure c - 1 ) .

by contrast , the united states decreased statutory tax rates on dividends after 2002 by reducing taxes at the shareholder level .

shareholder - level taxes on dividends increased in the united states after 2012 , due to the increased rates on dividends for taxpayers in the 39.6% bracket enacted as part of atra and the 3.8% unearned income medicare contribution tax .

with the recent increases , however , individual - level statutory tax rates on dividends remain below 2002 levels .

statutory corporate tax rates in the united states remained constant over the time period .

while statutory shareholder - level taxes on dividends decreased after 2002 , the trend in oecd countries has been for shareholder - level taxes on dividends to increase on average .

since 2000 , for example , finland , france , italy , and norway have abandoned full imputation and instead adopting policies that increased taxation of dividends at the shareholder level .

there has been a general trend in oecd countries away from full imputation systems that provide relief from double taxation .

as of 2013 , various systems for taxing dividends are used in major industrialized countries ( see figure c - 2 ) .

japan , denmark , and switzerland are examples of countries that are similar to the u.s. in that they use a modified classical system .

ireland , sweden , germany , and the netherlands are amongst those classified by the oecd as having a classical system , taxing dividends at the individual ( shareholder ) level , but not at reduced rates .
