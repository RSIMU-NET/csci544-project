p resident trump has long advocated for the construction of additional fencing , walls , and other barriers along the u.s. - mexico border to deter unlawful border crossings .

less than a week after taking office , the president issued an executive order directing the secretary of homeland security to "take all appropriate steps to immediately plan , design , and construct a physical wall along the southern border. .

this policy has engendered a robust debate in the public sphere , and a conflict has also made its way to federal court , with various plaintiffs challenging the lawfulness of the trump administration's initiatives to pay for the construction of border barriers by reprogramming funds from existing appropriations .

at their core , these lawsuits concern whether the administration's funding initiatives exceed existing statutory authorization and conflict with congress's constitutionally conferred power over federal funds .

article i of the constitution provides that "[n]o money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law. .

as justice joseph story noted in his commentaries on the constitution , the appropriations power was given to congress to guard against arbitrary and unchecked expenditures by the executive branch and to "secure regularity , punctuality , and fidelity , in the disbursement of the public money. .

"in arbitrary governments," he expounded , "the prince levies what money he pleases from his subjects , disposes of it , as he thinks proper , and is beyond responsibility or reproof. .

to avoid giving the president such "unbounded power over the public purse of the nation," the framers designated congress "the guardian of [the national] treasure"âgiving to it "the power to decide , how and when any money should be applied[.] .

this "power to control , and direct the appropriations," justice story explained , serves as "a most useful and salutary check upon profusion and extravagance , as well as upon corrupt influence and public speculation. .

justice story's sentiments echoed those of james madison , who in the federalist no .

58 described the legislature's "power over the purse" as "the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people , for obtaining a redress of every grievance , and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure. .

the trump administration's early efforts to secure funding for border barriers focused on negotiating with congress to secure appropriations specifically designated for that task .

in his fy2018 budget proposal , president trump requested that congress appropriate $1.57 billion for border barrier construction .

similarly , president trump's fy2019 budget request sought $1.6 billion "to construct approximately 65 miles of border wall in south texas. .

congress did not appropriate the amounts requested for either fiscal year .

for fy2018 , congress appropriated $1.375 billion for new or repaired fencing and other forms of barriers along the u.s. - mexico border , as well as $196 million for border monitoring technology .

as fy2019 began , congress and the president negotiated , inter alia , the amount of funding to provide the department of homeland security ( dhs ) for border barrier construction for fy2019 .

ultimately , congress and the president did not agree on funding levels , leading to a 35-day lapse of appropriations for dhs and other portions of the federal government .

during the partial government shutdown , president trump increased his request for border barrier funding from $1.6 billion to $5.7 billion .

congress did not grant this request .

instead , in the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( caa 2019 ) , congress appropriated $1.375 billionâ$4.325 billion less than was ultimately requestedâfor "the construction of primary pedestrian fencingâ  .

president trump signed the caa 2019 on february 15 , 2019 , that same day announcing that his administration would "take executive action" to "secure additional resources" to construct barriers along the southern border .

in particular , president trump announced that his administration had identified "up to $8.1 billion" from three additional funding sources "to build the border wall. .

it remains to be seen whether the administration will identify further funding sources from the fy2020 budget cycle .

several plaintiffs filed lawsuits in federal courts in california , the district of columbia , and texas to prevent the trump administration from taking this action .

these plaintiffs assert that the administration's funding initiatives are not authorized under existing law and thus violate the constitutional and statutory provisions requiring that federal money be spent only for the purposes , and in the amounts , specified by congress .

in may 2019 , a federal district court in california concluded that one of the administration's funding initiatives was unlawful and prohibited the administration from using that authority to repurpose funds for border barrier construction .

though the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit denied the administration's request to stay the injunction , the supreme court granted that request , thus allowing the administration to begin contracting for construction of border barriers while litigation in the case continues .

a second federal district court in texas has separately enjoined the use of military construction funds for border barrier construction .

meanwhile , the federal district court in the district of columbia ruled that the plaintiff in that caseâthe u.s. house of representativesâdid not have standing to sue and dismissed the suit .

the u.s. house of representatives has appealed the decision .

according to dhs's u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , there had been roughly 654 miles of primary barriers deployed along the u.s. - mexico border as of january 2017 .

in may 2019 , cbp declared that "approximately 205 miles of new and updated border barriers" had been funded ( though not necessarily constructed ) "through the traditional appropriations process and via treasury forfeiture funding" since january 2017 .

in addition to this mileage , cbp described dod as funding in fy2019 "up to approximately 131 miles of new border barriers in place of dilapidated or outdated designs , in addition to road construction and lighting installation. .

in total , cbp stated that some 336 total miles of barriers ( including both replacement barriers and barriers deployed in new locations ) would be deployed using funds from fy2017 through fy2019 .

this report addresses the litigation surrounding the trump administration's initiatives to repurpose existing appropriations for the construction of border barriers along the u.s. - mexico border .

it begins by providing an overview of the authorities cited by the trump administration to obtain border barrier funding and the steps the administration has taken to utilize those authorities .

it then discusses dhs's existing authority to construct border barriers and the various authorities on which the trump administration has relied to secure additional border barrier funding .

finally , this report discusses the ongoing litigation regarding the administration's funding initiatives , with a focus on the parties' arguments and judicial decisions .

the trump administration has cited several statutory authorities as giving it both the power and the necessary funds to construct additional border barriers .

some of these authorities belong to dhs , the agency with primary responsibility for securing the u.s. borders .

other authorities permit the department of defense ( dod ) or the department of the treasury to transfer funds for specified military , law enforcement , or other emergency purposes .

these authorities are described in more detail below .

first , section 102 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act ( iirira ) as amended generally authorizes dhs to construct barriers and roads along the international borders in order to deter illegal crossings at locations of high illegal entry , and further directs the agency to construct fencing along no less than 700 miles of the u.s. - mexico border .

this law also authorizes the secretary of homeland security to waive "all legal requirementsâ  .

 .

necessary to ensure expeditious construction of .

 .

[the] barriers. .

second , the secretary of defense is authorized by 10 u.s.c .

â§â 2808 to "undertake military construction projects .

 .

 .

not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces. .

president trump stated that he would invoke his authority under this provision to repurpose $3.6 billion allocated to "military construction projects" for border barrier construction .

this authority becomes available upon a "declaration by the president of a national emergency" as authorized by the national emergencies act ( nea ) .

third , dod has authority under 10 u.s.c .

â§â 284 ( "section 284" ) to support other departments' or agencies' counterdrug activities , including through the construction of fencing to block drug smuggling corridors .

president trump proposed to direct the dod to use its authority under section 284 to support dhs's "counterdrug activities" through the construction of fencing across drug trafficking corridors at the southern border .

these support activities would be funded by $2.5 billion in dod's drug interdiction and counter - drug activities account ( drug interdiction account ) , which would be transferred to that account using the transfer authority in sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 dod appropriations act .

these authorities authorize the transfer of up to $6 billion of dod funds for "unforeseen military requirements" but only "where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by congress. .

fourth , the treasury forfeiture fund contains funds that are confiscated by , or forfeited to , the federal government pursuant to laws enforced or administered by certain law enforcement agencies , and unobligated money in this fund may be used for obligation or expenditure in connection with "law enforcement activities of any federal agency. .

the president proposed to withdraw $601 million in unobligated funds from the treasury forfeiture fund ( tff ) to pay for border barrier construction .

the trump administration has taken steps to make these funds available to construct border barriers along the u.s. - mexico border .

on february 15 , the president declared a national emergency under the nea , and has subsequently vetoed two congressional resolutions disapproving that declaration ( which congress did not override ) .

on september 3 , 2019 , the secretary of defense directed the acting secretary of the army to "expeditiously undertake" 11 border barrier military construction projects pursuant to section 2808 .

in addition , on february 25 , dhs requested that dod use its authority under 10 u.s.c .

â§â 284 to assist in constructing border barriers .

dod granted this request on march 25 and invoked the transfer authority in section 8005 of the fy2019 dod appropriations act to move $1 billion of army personnel funds into dod's drug interdiction account for dod to help dhs construct border barriers .

a few months later , dod again invoked section 8005 ( along with the related transfer authority in section 9002 of the fy2019 dod appropriations act ) to transfer another $1.5 billion of personnel , procurement , and overseas contingency operation funds into the drug interdiction account for use in constructing border barriers .

the trump administration proposed to construct "approximately 131 miles of new border barriers .

 .

 .

in addition to road construction and lighting installation" with these funds .

for each of the proposed projects , the acting secretary of homeland security utilized iirira â§â 102's waiver authority to waive the application of several federal environmental , conservation , and historic preservation statutes , including the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) , the endangered species act , the safe drinking water act , and the antiquities act , to the "fence[s] , roads , and lighting" that dod will be "assist[ing]" in "constructing" under section 284 .

following the trump administration's announcement of its initiatives to fund border barrier construction , citizens groups , states , and the u.s. house of representatives filed lawsuits in federal district courts in california , the district of columbia , and texas .

the plaintiffs in these lawsuits have argued that the trump administration's funding initiatives are not authorized by ( or are inconsistent with ) the relevant statutory authorities .

as a result , they have also contended that the administration's funding initiatives violate constitutional separation of powers principles and the appropriations clause's directive that money may be withdrawn from the treasury only "in consequence of appropriations made by law. .

finally , some plaintiffs have asserted that iirira â§â 102 does not empower dhs to waive the requirements of nepa for the border barrier projects being constructed with dod's assistance because iirira â§â 102's waiver authority extends only to projects undertaken by dhs .

after bringing suit , certain plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction , asking the courts to prohibit dod from implementing its funding initiatives while the litigation was ongoing .

on may 24 , 2019 , a judge on the u.s. district court for the northern district of california issued decisions in the two cases pending in that courtâ sierra club v. trump and california v. trump âresolving one of the issues presented by the plaintiffs' motion: whether sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 dod appropriations act authorized the transfer of funds for border barrier construction .

the district court determined that it did not for two reasons .

it first concluded that this would violate section 8005's prohibition on transferring funds where "the item for which funds [were] requested ha[d] been denied by congress. .

the court also ruled that the administration's proposed use of section 8005 was unlawful because dod's purported need for additional border barrier funding was not an "unforeseen military requirement," as required by section 8005 .

based on this ruling , the court in sierra club issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from using section 8005 to transfer funds for border barrier construction while litigation proceeded .

the court declined to also issue a preliminary injunction in the california case because ( with the sierra club injunction in place ) the plaintiffs in california could not establish that they would be irreparably harmed by the denial of an injunction .

because the plaintiffs' lawsuit preceded dod's may 9 decision to transfer $1.5 billion to the drug interdiction account , the preliminary injunction applied only to the initial , february 25 transfer of $1 billion to fund projects in new mexico and arizona .

but in a later decision , the district court applied the reasoning from its initial ruling to conclude that the $1.5 billion transfer , like the first , was not authorized by section 8005 or section 9002 .

the court then issued an order permanently prohibiting the administration from using either of these provisions to transfer any of the $2.5 billion for border barrier construction .

the trump administration appealed the district court's permanent injunction to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit and asked that court to stay the injunction pending appeal .

the ninth circuit denied that request , agreeing with the district court that section 8005 does not authorize the transfer of funds for border barrier construction .

however , the supreme court subsequently issued an order staying the injunction during the pendency of the litigation .

as a result of the supreme court's order , the trump administration may use section 8005 to transfer funds for border barrier construction .

the district court subsequently issued a permanent injunction against the use of military construction funds as well , but stayed the injunction pending appeal .

the texas lawsuit , el paso county v. trump , also resulted in a permanent injunction against the trump administration's funding scheme for border barrier construction using section 2808 .

the district court determined that the use of those provisions to fund border barriers clashed with the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( caa 2019 ) , provision that prohibits the use of appropriated funds "to increase .

 .

 .

funding for a program , project , or activity as proposed in the president's budget request for a fiscal year" unless it is made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of an appropriations act .

this section discusses the various arguments raised in these lawsuits regarding the lawfulness of the trump administration's initiatives for funding border barrier construction .

it also discusses the judicial decisions that have resolved , or otherwise opined on , the lawfulness of the administration's funding initiatives .

the federal court in the district of columbia presiding over the u.s. house of representatives' case dismissed that suit for lack of standing , and that decision is currently being appealed .

the supreme court has said that the appropriation clause's "fundamental and comprehensive purpose .â .â  .

is to assure that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by congress as to the common good and not according to the individual favor of government agents or the individual pleas of litigants. .

consequently , congress has the power , subject to presidential veto , to enact legislation either appropriating more funds for border barrier construction , to limit the extent that the administration's proposed funding sources may be used for border barrier construction , or to prohibit the administration from obtaining additional funding through existing mechanisms .

as part of the fy2020 appropriations process , the 116th congress had considered provisions limiting the expenditure of annually appropriated funds for border barrier construction , though none have yet been enacted .

for example , section 8127 of division c of h.r .

2740 , the dod appropriations act for fy2020 , as passed by the house on june 19 , 2019 , would generally have provided that "none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act or any prior department of defense appropriations acts may be used to construct a wall , fence , border barriers , or border security infrastructure along the southern land border of the united states. .

if this provision had been enacted it would likely have rendered the litigation over the northern district of california's injunction moot , as the use of fy2019 funds for the purposes sought by the administration would be expressly prohibited .

separately , the house - passed h.r .

2740 would also have limited the general transfer authority under either sections 8005 or 9002 from being used to transfer funds into or out of the dod drug interdiction account , and the bill would reduce the overall amount of general transfer authority available under section 8005 from $4 billion to $1 billion .

the initial house - passed national defense authorization act for fy2020 included similar limitations .

none of these limitations were included as part of the enacted consolidated appropriations act , 2020 , or the enacted fy2020 national defense authorization act .

in february 2019 , the administration requested $5 billion in border barrier funding for fy2020 to support the construction of approximately 206 miles of border barrier system .

the house appropriations committee responded to this by recommending no funding for border barriers in h.r .

3931 âits fy2020 dhs appropriations bill .

in addition , the house appropriations committee - reported bill would have restricted the ability to transfer or reprogram funds for border barrier construction .

that bill stated in section 227 that , aside from appropriations provided for such purpose in the last three fiscal years , "no federal funds may be used for the construction of physical barriers along the southern land border of the united states during fiscal year 2020. .

furthermore , section 536 of that bill proposed to rescind $601 million from funding appropriated for border barriers in fy2019 âthus reducing the fy2019 funding available by the amount pledged from the treasury forfeiture fund .

on september 26 , 2019 , the senate appropriations committee reported its annual appropriations act for dhs for fy2020 , which would have provided $5 billion for additional new miles of pedestrian fencing .

as part of the consolidated appropriations act , 2020 , congress provided $1.375 billion for "construction of barrier system along the southwest border. .

committees and members of congress have also requested legal opinions from the comptroller general of the united states , head of the government accountability office ( gao ) , regarding questions of appropriations law and executive agencies' compliance with such laws .

though gao's decisions are not binding on federal courts , those decisions are sometimes given consideration by reviewing courts because of gao's expertise in appropriations law and its role as the "auditing agent of congress. .

on september 5 , 2019 , in response to such a request from senate appropriations committee vice chairman leahy , subcommittee on defense vice chairman durbin , and subcommittee on military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies ranking member schatz , the comptroller general issued a legal opinion concluding that the administration's use of section 8005 of the 2019 dod appropriations act and 10 u.s.c .

â§â 284 to fund border barrier construction is lawful .

like the northern district of california and the ninth circuit decisions , gao's analysis of the transfer authority focused primarily on ( 1 ) whether the use of the funds for border barrier construction was an unforeseen military requirement , and ( 2 ) whether congress had denied funds for the item to which funds were being transferred .

gao agreed with the administration's argument that the relevant "military requirement" for purposes of section 8005 was the construction of border barriers by dod pursuant to its section 284 authority , not the construction of border barriers generally .

according to gao , this military requirement was "unforeseen" because it was not until dhs requested assistance from dod to construct border barriersâwell after the president's budget requestsâthat the need for dod assistance became known .

consequently , gao concluded that dhs's request for assistance constituted an unforeseen military requirement that made available the transfer authority under section 8005 .

gao next addressed whether the construction of border fencing had been "denied by the congress. .

gao began by noting that this language was not defined by section 8005 or elsewhere in the fy2019 dod appropriations act .

relying on the "ordinary meaning" of the term "deny" as well as previous decisions by the comptroller general , gao concluded that a denial of funds for purposes of section 8005 required that congress "actively refuse" funds for an item , rather than merely fail to appropriate the full amount requested for that item .

applying this standard , gao asserted that it could not identify any statutory provision that prohibited dod from using funds to build border barriers pursuant to its section 284 authority .

accordingly , gao agreed with the administration that congress had not denied funds for that purpose , within the meaning of section 8005 .
