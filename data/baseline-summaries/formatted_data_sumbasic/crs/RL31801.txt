on january 22 , 2004 , the senate adopted a cloture motion and approved theconference agreement on the fy2004 consolidated appropriations bill ( h. rept.108-401 , h.r .

2673 ) .

the measure combined six annual appropriations measureswith the spending bill for the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and relatedagencies .

the president signed the measure into law ( p.l .

108-199 ) on january 23,2004 .

division a of p.l .

108-199 contains $80.6 billion in fy2004 funding forusda and related agencies , of which $16.9 billion is for discretionary programs and$63.7 billion is for mandatory programs .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) carries out its widely variedresponsibilities through approximately 30 separate internal agencies and officesstaffed by some 100,000 employees .

usda is responsible for many activitiesoutside of the agriculture budget function .

hence , spending for usda is notsynonymous with spending for farm programs .

usda gross outlays for fy2003 were $81.53 billion , including regular and supplemental spending .

the mission area with the largest gross outlays ( $41.3billion or 50% of spending ) was for food and nutrition programs - - primarily thefood stamp program ( the costliest single usda program ) , various child nutritionprograms , and the supplemental nutrition program for women , infants and children ( wic ) .

the second largest mission area in terms of total spending is for farm andforeign agricultural services , which totaled $24.3 billion , or 30% of all usdaspending in fy2003 .

within this area are the programs funded through thecommodity credit corporation ( eg , the farm commodity price and income supportprograms and certain mandatory conservation and trade programs ) , crop insurance,farm loans , and foreign food aid programs .

the agriculture subcommittee of the house appropriations committee and thefull house appropriations committee completed markup of the fy2004appropriations bill for usda and related agencies on june 17 , 2003 and june 25,2003 , respectively .

the fy2004 house measure ( h.r .

2673 , h.rept.108-193 ) was officially reported on july 9 , 2003 , and approved by the full house onjuly 14 , 2003 .

following the house action , the agriculture subcommittee of thesenate appropriations committee completed markup of its version of the fy2004agricultural appropriations bill on july 15 and july 17 , 2003 , respectively , andreported the measure ( s. 1427 , s.rept .

108-107 ) on july 17 .

senatefloor action was completed on november 6 , 2003 , following the adoption ofapproximately 49 amendments .

the senate substituted the text of h.r.2673 with the text of s. 1427 as amended , and then passedh.r .

2673 as amended .

on november 25 , 2003 , h.r .

2673 became a consolidated appropriations measure when the conference agreement ( h. rept .

108-401 ) on h.r .

2673 was filed , incorporating six other fy2004 appropriations measures with usdafunding .

the full house approved the conference agreement on december 8 , 2003 .

senate action was completed on january 22 , 2004 , when a cloture motion wasadopted followed by senate passage .

the president signed the measure into law ( p.l .

108-199 ) on january 23 , 2004 .

because final action on the fy2004 usda spending bill ( as well as several other annual appropriations measures ) was not completed in time for the beginningof the fiscal year ( october 1 , 2003 ) , spending for usda and related agencies was governed by several continuing resolutions ( most recently p.l .

108-135 , which wasin effect until enactment of the consolidated appropriations measure on january 23,2004. ) .

p.l .

108-135 allowed all departments and agencies for which fy2004spending bills had not been completed to be funded at the fy2003 level until theearlier of: enactment of a final spending measure or january 31 , 2004 .

the enacted consolidated appropriations measure contains $80.63 billion for usda and related agencies for fy2004 ( excluding the effects of a 0.59%across - the - board rescission in all discretionary , non - defense accounts , as required inthe final law ) .

as originally reported by their respective committees , h.r .

2673 and s. 1427 contained nearly identicalappropriations of $77.49 billion .

however , the senate added $2.2 billion to themandatory food stamp account to reflect more recent projections of programparticipation , and conferees added $1 billion to the food stamp reserve account .

justover three - fourths ( $63.7 billion ) of the spending in the agriculture portion ( divisiona ) of p.l .

108-199 is classified as mandatory spending , including food stamps , childnutrition programs , crop insurance , and the various farm support programs fundedthrough usda's commodity credit corporation .

the balance of spending ( $16.9 billion ) in division a is for discretionaryprograms , which is $198 million below the administration's request and $61 millionbelow both the house - and senate - passed levels .

discretionary spending in divisiona of the measure is $963 million below the fy2003 enacted level includingsupplementals .

agriculture appropriators were allocated nearly $1 billion less forfy2004 discretionary accounts than the fy2003 level including supplementals .

tohelp achieve this goal , the conference agreement includes an fy2004 appropriationfor foreign food aid that is $572 million below the fy2003 level ( which wasbolstered by supplemental spending ) .

also , the conference agreement containsprovisions that limit or prohibit spending on certain mandatory conservation , ruraldevelopment , and research programs , which in total reduced spending in theseaccounts by approximately $650 million from authorized levels .

the measure did not include a senate provision that would have relaxed the licensing requirement for travel to cuba for the sale of agricultural and medicalproducts .

conferees also rejected a house provision that would have blocked fdafrom preventing individuals from importing cheaper fda - approved prescriptiondrugs from foreign suppliers .

congressional action on fy2004 appropriations for the u.s. department of agriculture and relatedagencies ** = pending ( 1 ) before senate floor action on the fy2004 appropriations measure , the senatesubstituted the text of s. 1427 for the text of the house - passed bill ( h.r .

2673 ) , and then after considering further amendments , adopted h.r .

2673 , as amended .

 ( 2 ) six other appropriations bills were included in h.rept .

108-401 as part of anfy2004 consolidated appropriations bill .

the following sections compare the agriculture provisions of the fy2004consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

108-199 , h.rept .

108-401 ) with thehouse - passed version of the fy2004 agriculture appropriations bill ( h.r .

2673 ) , the senate - passed version of the measure ( originallyreported as s. 1427 , but subsequently amended and substituted as thetext for h.r .

2673 ) , the fy2004 administration request , and the enactedconference agreement on the fy2003 omnibus appropriations bill ( p.l .

108-7 ) forvarious mission areas and agencies within usda , and for the food and drugadministration and the commodity futures trading commission .

also see the tableat the end of the report for a tabular summary .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency of the department ofhealth and human services ( dhhs ) , is responsible for regulating the safety offoods , drugs , biologics ( eg , vaccines ) , and medical devices .

the agency is fundedby a combination of congressional appropriations and various user fee revenues,assessed primarily for the pre - market review of drug and medical device applications .

the total amount of user fees to be collected each year is set in fda's annualappropriations act .

the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

108-199 ) provides a total program level of $1.704 billion .

of this amount , $1.387 billion isappropriated for fda salaries and expenses , an increase of $6 million over the$1.381 billion appropriated for fy2003 , but $19 million less than the administrationrequest of $1.406 billion .

p.l .

108-199 also appropriated $7 million to pay forconstruction and maintenance of fda's buildings and facilities .

in addition , p.l.108-199 allows fda to collect a total of $309.7 million in user fees during fy2004,an amount 14.5% higher than the $270.5 million in user fees for fy2003 .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is the independentregulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets .

the cftc'sfunctions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges , registration andsupervision of futures industry personnel , prevention of fraud and price manipulation,and investor protection .

although most futures trading is now related to financialvariables ( interest rates , currency prices , and stock indexes ) , congressional oversightis vested in the agricultural committees because of the market's historical originsas an adjunct to agricultural trade .

for fy2004 , the consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

108-199 ) provides $90.4 million , which is $2 million more than the house - and senate - passed measures and the administration request , and $5 million abovethe fy2003 appropriation .

the senate - reported version of the bill had originallyprovided $90.4 million .

however , an adopted floor amendment in the senatereduced cftc funding by $2 million to offset the added cost of a rural developmentamendment .

the final enacted level in effect is the same as the senate - reported level .

in earlier senate floor action on the appropriations measure , the senate rejected by a vote of 41-56 an amendment offered by senator feinstein that would have giventhe commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and federal energy regulatorycommission ( ferc ) new powers to regulate energy trading and marketing .

theamendment would have required currently unregulated dealers in over - the - counterderivatives contracts based on energy products to report certain data to the cftc,and would have increased the anti - fraud authority available to both regulators .

proponents of such legislation have argued that the collapse of enron and thecalifornia electricity crisis were signs of a dangerous regulatory gap .

opponentsbelieve that regulators have adequate authority to pursue fraud and manipulationunder current law , and point to ongoing enforcement actions against enron and otherenergy traders as evidence of this .

an item with a single asterisk ( * ) represents the total amount of direct and guaranteed loans that can be made given the requested or appropriated loan subsidy level .

only the subsidy levelis included in the total appropriation .

 ( 1 ) fy2003 enacted levels include amounts appropriated for usda and related agencies in the consolidated appropriations act , 2003 ( p.l .

108-7 ) adjusted for the 0.65% across - the - boardrescission in all discretionary programs ( with the exception of the wic program which wasspecifically exempted from the rescission ) , and the $479 million in supplemental fy2003agriculture appropriations provided by the wartime supplemental appropriations act , 2003 .

 ( 2 ) the fy2004 omnibus conference agreement ( h.r .

2673 ) contains a 0.59% across - the - board rescission in all non - defense discretionary accounts .

figures in this table areas reported by the conferees and do not include the effect of the rescission .

 ( 3 ) under current law , the commodity credit corporation and the federal crop insurance fund each receive annually an indefinite appropriation ( "such sums , as may be necessary" ) .

theamounts shown for both fy2003 and fy2004 are usda estimates of the necessaryappropriations .

 ( 4 ) scorekeeping adjustments reflect the savings or cost of provisions that affect mandatory programs , plus the permanent annual appropriation made to usda's section 32 program .

 ( 5 ) p.l .

108-7 includes $3.1 billion in farm disaster assistance for 2000 and 2001 crop livestock losses .

the cost of this assistance in the final law was offset by a limitation placed onmandatory spending for the conservation security program over a ten - year period ( fy2004-fy2013 ) .

this additional spending does not appear in the grand total listed above .

 ( 6 ) division h of p.l.108-199 contains $225 million in supplemental funding for various usda assistance programs ( including $50 million for usda's forest service , which is fundedunder the interior appropriations bill ) .

spending for this assistance was offset in the conferenceagreement by a mandated rescission of $225 million from the federal emergency managementagency ( fema ) .
