the outbreak of coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) , first in the people's republic of china ( prc or china ) , and now globally , including in the united states , is drawing attention to the ways in which the united states and other ec onomies depend on critical manufacturing and global value chains that rely on production based in china .

congress is particularly concerned about these dependencies and has passed legislation to better understand and address them .

an area of particular concern to congress in the current environment is u.s. shortages of medical suppliesâincluding personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient u.s. industrial capacity .

because of china's role as a global supplier of ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( api ) , reduced exports from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states .

starting in early february 2020 , u.s. health care experts began warning of a likely global spread of covid - 19 , and early reports of u.s. medical supply shortages began to emerge .

at the same time , the chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in china , directing all production for domestic use .

the chinese government also directed the national bureaucracy , local governments , and chinese industry to secure supplies from the global market .

this effort likely exacerbated medical supply shortages in the united states and other countries , particularly in the absence of domestic emergency measures that might have locked in domestic contracts , facilitated an earlier start to alternative points of production , and restricted exports of key medical supplies .

as china's manufacturing sector recovers while the united states and other countries are grappling with covid - 19 , the chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery .

those decisions are likely to be driven , at least in part , by political calculations , as it has done recently with many countries around the world .

covid - 19 was identified in china in december 2019 and peaked in late january 2020 .

in response , china shut down a large part of its economy in an effort to contain the outbreak .

a key factor in the sharp economic slowdown in china was the dramatic downturn of both demand and supply after chinese officials imposed restrictions in the third week of january on movement of people and goods in and out of localities across china .

since the covid - 19 outbreak in china has eased , the chinese government's efforts to restart business activities has been slow and uneven across sectors and locations .

companies have sought to meet new government requirements for virus containment and faced worker and supply shortages as interregional logistics have remained constrained .

resumption of bilateral trade will likely be uneven due to bottlenecks in inputs , locations of containers , and logjams in current shipments .

u.s. companies typically maintain anywhere from two to ten weeks of inventory , and transportation time for trans - pacific container shipments is typically three weeks .

with this timeframe in mind , initial shortages that u.s. firms faced of deliveries of microelectronics , auto parts , and health and medical products could intensify over the next few months .

there could be additional shortages in a wide range of imports that transit via container ship ( eg , processed raw materials , intermediate industrial goods , and finished consumer products ) .

as china's economic activities resume , other countries around the world are taking an economic hit .

as in china , new restrictions around the world on the movement of people and business operations could trigger sharp new slowdowns in demand , transportation , and logistics worldwide , further dragging down prospects for global trade recovery .

suppressed global demand will likely further complicate efforts to orchestrate a rebound in china's ( or global ) economic activity .

in sectors where china has extensive capacity ( such as steel ) , some fear china could overwhelm overseas markets , as it ramps up export - led growth to compensate for the sharp economic downturn in the first quarter of 2020 .

congress faces current choices that will influence the longer - range u.s. trade trajectory vis - a - vis china .

since the imposition of section 301 tariffs on u.s. imports from china and china's retaliatory tariffs beginning in 2018 , some members have raised questions about the dependence of u.s. supply chains on china for critical products .

there are also concerns about the potential ramifications of these dependencies , particularly in times of crisis or prc nationalization of industry .

current demand pressures during the covid - 19 pandemic could increase u.s. reliance on medical supplies from china , at least in the short term ( provided that the chinese government is willing to export these supplies to the united states ) .

at the same time , these pressures are also incentivizing diversification efforts .

as the united states' third - largest trading partner in 2019 , bilateral trade with china is important to the u.s. economy , and the recent sharp downturn in activity affects a wide range of u.s. industries .

total u.s. trade with the world ( the sum of exports and imports of goods and services ) was $5.6 trillion in 2019 , equivalent to 26% of u.s. gross domestic product ( gdp ) ; china accounts for 11% of u.s. trade .

key facts about the relationship include the following: china's , total merchandise trade with the united states in 2019 amounted to $558.9 billion ; china is the united states' third largest export market for goods .

u.s. goods exports to china in 2019 were valued at $106.6 billion in 2019 ; china is the top source of u.s. imports .

u.s. goods imports from china reached $452.2 billion in 2019 ; u.s. services exports to china in 2019 were valued at $56.7 billion ( mostly travel and transport ) ; u.s. services imports from china in 2019 were valued at $18 billion ( about half of this amount was travel and transport ) ; and u.s. foreign direct investment ( fdi ) stock in china in 2018 reached $116.5 billion while china's fdi stock in the united states reached $60.2 billion in 2018 .

top u.s. exports to china include semiconductor chips , devices , parts and manufacturing machines ; agriculture ; aircraft , turbojets , turbo propellers , and gas turbines ; optical and medical equipment ; autos ; plastics ; and pharmaceutical products ( figure 1 ) .

top u.s. imports from china include microelectronics ( computers and cell phones ) and appliances , furniture , bedding and lighting ; toys , games and sports equipment ; plastics ; knitted and non - knitted apparel , textile fabric , linens , and footwear ; auto parts ; articles of iron and steel ; medical and surgical instruments ; and , organic chemicals ( including active pharmaceutical ingredients and antibiotics ) .

in the midst of the pandemic , congress is expressing a strong interest in responding to u.s. shortages of medical suppliesâincluding ppe and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain and counter covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and constraints on u.s. industrial capacity .

because of china's role as a major u.s. and global supplier of medical ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( appendix b ) , reduced exports from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states .

while some analysts and industry groups have pointed to tariffs as a disincentive to u.s. imports of health and medical products , supply shortages due to the sharp spike in demand , as well as the nationalization and diversion of supply to china , appear to be stronger drivers .

according to china customs data , in 2019 china exported $9.8 billion in medical supplies and $7.4 billion in organic chemicalsâa figure that includes active pharmaceutical ingredients and antibioticsâto the united states .

while there are no internationally - agreed guidelines and standards for classifying these products , u.s. imports of pharmaceuticals , medical equipment and products , and related supplies are estimated to have been approximately $20.7 billion ( or 9.2% of u.s. imports ) , according to crs calculations using official u.s. data ( figure 2 and table 1 ) .

china's leaders are focusing on resuming manufacturing production to jumpstart economic growth .

at an executive session of china's cabinet , the state council , on march 17 , chinese officials emphasized the importance of stabilizing employment and announced that the government would streamline business approvals and fast - track approvals for large infrastructure projects .

they also offered government support to alleviate shortages of labor , raw materials , funds , and protective gear .

to facilitate economic activity , the chinese government also appears to be liberalizing company health requirements and lifting intra - provincial and intra - city travel and transportation restrictions .

ndrc spokesperson meng wei said on march 17 , 2020 that transportation was operating normally .

zhejiang , jiangsu , and shanghai were operating at close to 100% of normal capacity ; and over 90% of large - scale industrial companies outside of hubei had resumed production .

company reports of opening and resumption of operations may not mean that these facilities are fully online or operating at pre - crisis levels , however .

several economic analysts and news outlets , including the financial times , have published alternative measures of business resumption rates using proxies for economic activityâsuch as data on traffic congestion , air pollution levels , and container freight movement .

overall , many of these measures suggest that businesses across china are not returning to full capacity at the rates being reported by local and provincial governments .

in wuhan , the center of the original outbreak , the hubei provincial government issued a notice in marchâthat applies to wuhan as hubei's capitalâallowing certain companies to resume work ahead of other production .

this included companies in the medical and health industry , as well as companies producing protective gear , disinfectant , daily necessities , agriculture , and products critical to national and global supply chains .

congress faces choices in the near - term that will affect not only the immediate situation , but also the longer - range u.s. trade and economic trajectory vis - a - vis china , with a potentially significant impact on the global economy as well .

the outbreak of covid - 19 has prompted a sharp collapse of transportation , services , and manufacturing productionâincluding supply shortages of essential medical and health care products needed to contain covid - 19 .

the covid - 19 pandemic has also precipitated a sharp downturn in consumer demand , first in china and now globally .

questions already brewing since the imposition of u.s .

section 301 tariffs are intensifying congressional concerns and debates about potential short - term and long - term steps to address u.s. supply chain dependence on china for critical products , and the potential ramifications of these dependencies .

these ramifications could be particularly marked in times of crisis or of prc nationalization of industry .

at the same time , some u.s. companies and members of congress are calling for lowering tariffs on goods from china .

the urgent need for pharmaceutical and medical supplies is fueling systemic market pressures to increase u.s. reliance on china trade because china is an important source of many of these critical inputs and products .

whether and on what terms the chinese government might be willing to export medical supplies to the united states remains uncertain .

the current shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states has exposed current u.s. health care dependencies on china .

as china positions its industries to realize its mic 2025 goals in biotechnology , pharmaceuticals , and medical equipment , the chinese government is pursuing industrial polices to advance into higher positions in the global industrial value chain , raising longer - range questions about what this might portend for u.s. reliance on china as an increasingly competitive supplier .

as china's manufacturing capacity comes back online while the united states and other major global markets continue to grapple with covid - 19 , the chinese government appears to be selectively releasing some medical supplies for overseas delivery .

china appears to be selecting designated countries , at least to some extent ( although the precise degree cannot be determined ) , according to political calculations and has been playing up its role in chinese state propaganda , as evidenced with china's deliveries to italy and serbia .

most foreign governments appear to be paying for these supplies although a small subset of packages may be aid .

there are also reports by other countries that some of china's medical supplies and testing kits are faulty .

in a sign that china might be using the crisis to push substandard products or gain market share in developed markets over traditional u.s. suppliers based in china that produce for export , prc state propaganda has blamed shortages on alleged fda failures to certify chinese products for import .

this raises the question of why products made by u.s. firms in china that are already fda certified are not first in line for export to the united states given that these firms also expanded capacity during the crisis in china .

several prominent u.s. companies , including 3m , have indicated they do not have prc government authorization to export .

in this environment , congress faces choices about how best to incentivize production of health supplies in the united states , potentially in collaboration with other countries , to counter covid - 19 and future pandemics , and / or whether to impose any conditions on this production .

with an eye to china's industrial policies , congress may also consider the potential longer - term advantages and disadvantages of diversifying u.s. supply and on - shoring of certain capabilities .

congress may also want to consider potential collaboration with like - minded countries , and ways to counter the effects on lesser - developed economies that could be hit particularly hard by covid - 19 .

china is likely to seek to retain the medical market share and edge it gains through covid - 19 , particularly as these gains help advance china's mic 2025 industrial policy goals in biotechnology , pharmaceuticals , and medical equipment .

at the same time , the united states and other countries may seek to diversify away from china because of vulnerabilities highlighted during the outbreak .

recent legislative action related to these issues includes: p.l .

116-136 , the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act includes several provisions that expand drug shortage reporting requirements to include apis and medical devices .

the bill also requires certain drug manufacturers to draw up risk management plans and requires the fda to maintain a public list of medical devices that are determined to be in shortage .

additionally , the bill directs the national academies of science , engineering , and medicine to conduct a study of pharmaceutical supply chain security .

the cares act also waives certain congressional oversight and reporting requirements under the defense production act of 1950's ( dpa ; 50 u.s.c .

â§â§4501 et seq. ) .

title iii expansion of productive capacity and supply , which governs purchases and loans made by the federal government to expand productive capacity in promotion of national defense , broadly defined .

s. 3538 would require companies to report on the sources of their apis and would tighten laws encouraging the u.s. department of veteran affairs to buy american pharmaceuticals .

the bill calls for federal financing guarantees to u.s. medical supply companies with production in the united states and would increase the tax deduction temporarily for businesses investing in medical equipment and facilities related to covid - 19 .

s. 3343 , the medical supply chain security act , calls for enhanced security of the medical supply chain and enhanced fda authority to request information about the sources of drugs and medical devices .

it would require medical device manufacturers to report expected shortages to the fda .

a companion bill , h.r .

6049 , was introduced in the house of representatives on march 2 , 2020 .

s. 3537 would require the fda to establish a registry to track apis and institute a country - of - origin label for imported drugs .

the bill would provide economic incentives for producing pharmaceuticals and medical equipment in the united states .

the bill also would prohibit federal agencies and health facilities from purchasing apis and other pharmaceutical products manufactured in china without an fda waiver certifying that china is the sole source .

h.r .

5982 , the safe medicine act , would direct hhs to assess vulnerabilities in the u.s. pharmaceutical supply chain by issuing a report that examines u.s. dependence on china for critical apis and gaps in domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities .

h.r .

6386 , the no chinese handouts in national assistance ( china ) act , would prohibit any funds made available in appropriations acts for fy2020 from being used to compensate any individual or business controlled by the chinese government .

the act adopts the definition of government control established in section 721 ( a ) of the defense production act of 1950 ( u.s.c .

4565 ( a ) ) .

h.r .

4710 , the pharmaceutical independence long - term readiness act , would direct the department of defense to include a section in each national defense strategy that outlines steps to address gaps in the u.s. pharmaceutical manufacturing base and strengthen pharmaceutical supply chains with single points of failure .

s. 3432 , the securing america's medicine cabinet act of 2020 , would take steps to strengthen u.s. competitiveness in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing by enhancing the advanced manufacturing programs of the fda .

it also would designate certain research universities as "national centers of excellence in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing. .

several members of congress have introduced bills to amend certain provisions under the defense production act of 1950 ( dpa ; 50 u.s.c .

â§â§4501 et seq. ) .

some members have also introduced several resolutions in the house and senate that call on the president to use dpa authorities to facilitate the production of medical supplies .

bills and resolutions related to dpa are compiled and summarized in appendix b .

in addition to recent legislation introduced by members of congress , the trump administration reportedly drafted an executive order in mid - march 2020 that seeks to increase u.s. production capacity while eliminating loopholes that have allowed the u.s. government to buy pharmaceuticals , ppe , and ventilators from overseas .

covid - 19 provides a direct learning experienceâpotentially more compelling than any war game or natural disaster simulationâabout the direct effects and costs of a serious disruption or cutoff of critical supplies from china to the united states .

key broader questions facing the united states that have serious implications for future economic and trade relations include: what are the consequences for u.s. interests when china nationalizes production and distribution and hardens its borders as it did during the covid - 19 crisis ? .

what happens if chinese government planners corner global supply alternatives ? .

what happens if the united states hardens its own borders ? .

what happens if u.s. allies and partners are in crisis and turn to national tools and approaches ? .

what supply lines are available to the united states ? .

what is current baseline u.s. production capacity and what is u.s. production capacity in the event an administration invokes the defense production act ( dpa ) ? .

what control do chief executive officers of u.s. companies or the u.s. government have over u.s. corporate facilities and operations that are nationalized in china ? .

what are u.s. dependencies on china in other critical areas such as microelectronics ? .

congress faces a series of interrelated questions about whether and how to calibrate trade policy to best position the united states in the current crisis and beyond .

in response to a u.s. investigation of china's unfair trading practices under section 301 , since 2018 , the united states has imposed a series of tariffs and china has responded with a series of counter tariffs that now affect a majority of trade between the two countries .

temporary tariff relief for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals could incentivize imports for the united states and other markets , but tariff policy cannot address the deeper issues of supply shortages , export constraints imposed by a number of countries including china , and product certification requirements in the united states and other markets .

tariff liberalization has been insufficient to address industrial policies within borders such as regulatory standards , procurement terms , and local content requirements that china and others impose in a range of sectors including pharmaceuticals and medical equipment .

recent actions by countries around the world to impose export barriers highlight potential gaps and limits to the power of wto rules prohibiting export bans during times of global crisis .

these actions also raise questions about what new rules or protocols might be needed in the future .

liberalization of u.s. import requirements also created some of the challenges the united states is facing now , such as loosening requirements for u.s. pharmaceutical firms to report on shortages and how they classify imported content for finished products that qualify as u.s. products .

new liberalization could reward chinese industrial policies in medical equipment and pharmaceuticals that seek to win new ground for chinese firms in overseas markets .

the potential for china to overwhelm global markets as it leans on exports for economic recovery raise questions about whether additional policy measures might be needed .

rather than waiting until market injury has already occurred to seek damages , for example , congress may want to be watching trade patterns for signs of import surges and oversee the administration's potential use of safeguard measures .

similar to the australian government's decision on march 29 , 2020 to impose new temporary restrictions on all foreign investment proposals out of concern that strategic investorsâparticularly those of chinese originâmight target distressed assets , congress may want to carefully monitor or consider whether to impose requirements about potential predatory commercial activity in the united states .

the outbreak of covid - 19 has exposed gaps in u.s. understanding of u.s. domestic competencies and dependencies on china and other sources of global supply .

vulnerabilities regarding raw materials , such as apis , are not well recorded in trade and industry data .

they are particularly complicated to track when materials are shipped from china and processed in a third market such as india .

in similar fashion , the united states has relaxed definitions of what qualifies as a u.s. product with imported content , masking the extent to which domestically - produced products may still rely on inputs from overseas .

pharmaceutical company stockpiles are proprietary , and companies do not have to report on reserves .

they are only required to report when they have a shortfall , which does not leave enough time , particularly in times of emergency , for national and contingency planning .

under the international investment survey act of 1976 ( 22 u.s.c .

â§3101 et .

seq .

 ) , the president has wide authority over the collection of corporate activity abroad for statistical and analytic purposes .

the act also confers on the president the authority to request mandatory surveys of companies under specific deadlines with the ability to invoke civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance .

the president has the authority to study the adequacy of current information and recommend improvements , and the act requires him to report to congress .

to address these issues , congress could consider whether to request the president to invoke his authority over the u.s. government's collection of data on corporate activity abroad .

these corporate surveys could obtain specific supply chain information about the status of ppe and medical supply production , distribution , and export policy situation facing u.s. companies overseas , including in china .

the surveys also could cover other sectors of potential congressional concern .

this information could inform legislation that congress has already passed or is considering with regard to overseas supply chains , including sourcing from china .

at a time when u.s. health care systems , states , and countries overseas are seeking to secure limited medical supplies , the u.s. federal government has a unique role to play in ensuring adequate domestic and global production , contracting of supply ( both domestically and globally ) , and distribution of these resources .

even as new capacity might be available in china , for example , who are the u.s. actors positioned to try to secure this supply and through what pathways ? .

lack of coordination at the federal level has led states to scramble and compete against each other for critical medical supplies in the current crisis .

among the key questions related to these issues , congress may explore answers to such questions as: how does the u.s. federal government position itself vis - a - vis u.s. state and private actors ? .

how does the u.s. federal government position itself vis - a - vis other foreign governments trying to secure similar supplies ? .

what is the u.s. government's posture toward supplies needed in the developing world ? .

how might expanded production capacity created in the united states not only help the u.s. market but also those of other countries , in the near term and over the longer term ? .

the current covid - 19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to reaffirm u.s. global leadership on trade and health issues and to counter china's nationalization and likely politicization of its domestic medical supply production capacity .

china's export restraints and cornering of the global supply of medical products ahead of others in february 2020 have created serious strains on the open trade system , further incentivizing other countries to close borders and restrict any access to supplies they may have .

these moves also have given china market power over other countries' procurement decisions as governments around the world grapple with how best to secure critical supplies .

early signs show that china is closely controlling and releasing supplies to other governments through contracts and some aid in ways that seek to improve china's global image and may come with other quid pro quo terms that are not yet visible .

china's economic recovery ahead of others could further challenge and undermine key tenets of the open trade system , particularly if china exports pent up domestic capacity with a disregard for what the current state of the global economy is prepared to absorb on market terms .

while some european countries have imposed export restraints on their health supplies , some politicians in europe are concerned about how the chinese government is manipulating the crisis and china's position in global supply chains for political gain .

some analysts have expressed concern that china is trying to position itself as a responsible global leader in health , while violating the core tenets of who membership in failing to share critical information and access in the critical first few weeks as the crisis emerged in wuhan .

members concerned about maintaining u.s. global economic leadership during the covid - 19 pandemic may consider using hearings , legislation , and statements to communicate key issues to be addressed .

possible questions for congress in the context of covid - 19 include: whether to prioritize economic openness and free flows of information ; whether to prioritize diversifying sources of medical supplies , and if so , how ; how best to overcome current and future bottlenecks in health care supply chains in the united states and partner nations ; whether to respond to china's attempts to control the global narrative about key covid - 19 events , and if so , how ; and whether to look to reform global health and trade governance in light of covid - 19 developments , and if so , how .

some members are calling for hearings to address the role of the who during the covid - 19 outbreak and are raising questions about the need to reform global health governance .

other members are looking at the chronology of events in the covid - 19 outbreak to maintain an accurate record that is not distorted by chinese state propaganda .

some members are also looking at the social media platforms that the chinese government is using to convey state propagandaâsuch as twitterâand raising questions about whether this access should be allowed .

several members have expressed an interest in potential measures to hold china accountable for its slowness to acknowledge , address , and share information regarding the outbreak of covid - 19 as h.r .
