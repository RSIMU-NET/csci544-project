deficit reduction influenced the agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-79 ; 2014 farm bill ) throughout its legislative development .

questions about the availability of mandatory funding , trends over time , and sequestration affected the suite of policies that were enacted .

congress returns to the "farm bill" about every five years to establish an omnibus policy for food and agriculture .

the farm bill authorizes programs in two spending categories: mandatory and discretionary .

mandatory programs generally operate as entitlements ; the farm bill pays for them using multi - year budget estimates when the law is enacted .

discretionary programs are authorized for their scope , but are not funded in the farm bill ; they are subject to appropriations .

while both types of programs are important , mandatory programs often dominate the farm bill debate .

the 2014 farm bill was enacted on february 7 , 2014 .

the previous farm bill , the 2008 farm bill , expired in 2012 and was extended through 2013 .

the 2014 farm bill had been in development for over two years , with committee bills originating in 2012 and passing the senate ( s. 3240 ) , but not reaching the house floor ( h.r .

6083 ) , in part because of budget concerns .

in 2013 , new bills were introduced in the house ( h.r .

1947 ) and passed in the senate ( s. 954 ) .

but the house rejected the committee bill and — for the first time in 40 years — separated food stamps from the farm bill .

two separate bills were passed — one for farm programs ( h.r .

2642 ) and the other for the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap , formerly food stamps ; h.r .

3102 ) .

the house bills were recombined for conference with the senate ( h.r .

2642 , h.rept .

113-333 ) .

the range of deficit reduction proposals indicates the importance of the budget .

some broad deficit reduction plans proposed reducing the farm bill by $10 billion to $179 billion .

the agriculture committees' reductions ranged from $17.8 billion over 10 years in the senate bill , to $51.9 billion in the recombined house bill .

the enacted reduction was $16.6 billion over 10 years , but even this has been referred to , unofficially , as a $23 billion because of sequestration .

at enactment of the 2014 farm bill , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimated the total cost of mandatory programs at $489 billion over the next five years ( fy2014-fy2018 ) .

four farm bill titles account for most of the mandatory spending .

of the projected net outlays , about 80% ( $391 billion over five years ) is for snap .

farm commodity support and crop insurance are expected to account for a combined 13% of mandatory program costs ( $65 billion ) , with another 6% of costs in usda conservation programs ( $28 billion ) .

programs in all other farm bill titles are expected to account for about 1% of all mandatory expenditures ( figure 1 ) .

if the 2008 farm bill had continued , cbo estimated that mandatory outlays would have been $494 billion for the five - year period .

compared to this baseline , the 2014 farm bill reduces projected spending and the deficit by $5.3 billion ( - 1.1% ) over five years .

the net reduction is composed of some titles receiving more funding , while other titles provide offsets ( table 1 ) .

the 2014 farm bill was in development for over two years and was debated in both the 112 th and 113 th congresses .

in 2012 , the senate and house agriculture committees each reported a bill .

the senate passed s. 3240 and the house agriculture committee reported h.r .

6083 , but house floor action never occurred , resulting in a one - year extension of the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

112-240 ) .

in 2013 , new agriculture committee bills were introduced in the house ( h.r .

1947 ) and passed in the senate ( s. 954 ) .

but the house rejected the initial committee bill and — for the first time in 40 years — separated food stamps from the farm bill .

two separate bills were passed in the house: one for farm programs ( h.r .

2642 ) and the other for the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap , formerly food stamps ; h.r .

3102 ) .

the two house bills were recombined for conference with the senate and final enactment ( h.r .

2642 , h.rept .

113-333 ) .

because of the focus on deficit reduction and the connection to budget enforcement , the most commonly cited budgetary amounts during the farm bill debate were the 10-year totals for the baseline and scores .

these 10-year amounts are highlighted throughout this section , but 5-year amounts for the fy2014-fy2018 authorization period are discussed in figure 1 and table 1 .

the allocation of baseline among titles , and the size of each amount , is not a zero - sum game when cbo updates the baseline projection over time .

every year , cbo re - estimates the baseline — separately and independently for each program — to determine expected costs .

it uses the formulas that exist in law at that time .

baseline projections rise and fall based on changes in economic conditions , even without any action by congress .

each farm bill title with mandatory spending represents a share or proportion of the farm bill budget .

one share of the farm bill that has attracted attention is the nutrition baseline , but other shares of the baseline have similar stories .

the proportion and size of the farm bill budget contained in the nutrition title has increased over time .

when the 2008 farm bill was enacted , the nutrition title was 67% of the 10-year total ( $406 billion out of a $604 billion 10-year projected total ) .

when the 2014 farm bill was enacted six years later , the share in the nutrition title was 79% of the total ( $756 billion out of a $956 billion 10-year projected total ) .

this growth in size and proportion does not mean , however , that the nutrition has grown at the expense of agricultural programs .

during this period , legislative changes in the farm bill account for only a fraction of the change .

for example , the 2014 farm bill scored $16 billion in 10-year savings from the most recent baseline , while 10-year expected costs increased $352 billion from one farm bill to the next .

by title , the farm bill scored $8 billion in 10-year savings from nutrition , while 10-year nutrition outlays increased by $350 million .

similarly , legislative changes to crop insurance and the farm commodity program do not equal the changes in outlays for those titles .

table 6 highlights changes in budgetary expectations for snap and farm safety net supports from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill .

this is a separate way of analyzing costs than the official scoring analysis discussed earlier in this report .

in recent years , due to the recession , projected nutrition program outlays rose because food assistance needs increased as the automatic safety net triggered greater payments to more beneficiaries according to formulas in the law .

the projected 10-year snap outlay rose by 10.9% per year from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill .

this $350 billion increase in expected 10-year outlays is entirely from changing economic expectations that require more outlays , since the legislative changes in the farm bill scored an $8 billion reduction .

over the same period , expected crop insurance outlays increased as agricultural market prices rose and caused the insured value of crops ( and thus premium subsidies ) to grow .

the expectation of 10-year crop insurance outlays rose by 11.3% per year from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill — a higher annualized rate of increase than for snap , though the dollar magnitude is less .

the $43 billion increase in expected 10-year outlays for crop insurance is mostly from changing economic expectations rather than the $5.7 billion increase that was legislated in title xi by the 2014 farm bill .

conversely , expected farm commodity program outlays fell as market prices rose and less counter - cyclical price support was expected under the law .

in addition , the 2014 farm bill eliminated direct payments , the largest relevant component of 2008 farm bill spending .

the expectation of 10-year farm commodity program outlays fell by 10.3% per year from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill .

in total , the $41 billion reduction in expected 10-year outlays from enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill is from both changing economic conditions and the $14 billion net reduction legislated in title i .

the "farm safety net" subtotal of crop insurance and the farm commodity programs is nearly constant from the 2008 farm bill to the 2014 farm bill .

expected 10-year outlays were $133 billion in 2008 and are $134 billion in the 2014 farm bill .

despite the $14.3 billion reduction in title i scored in the 2014 farm bill and the offsetting $5.7 billion increase in crop insurance — which scored as net reduction in the safety net — expected 10-year outlays for the farm safety net increased slightly ( by +0.2% per year ) from the enactment of the 2008 farm bill to enactment of the 2014 farm bill .

other titles are expected to spend more in the 2014 farm bill than in the 2008 farm bill , primarily because of policy changes .

the amount for the research title , in particular , has grown at the greatest pace despite its comparatively small magnitude .

while some programs ( like most farm commodity programs and nutrition assistance ) have assumed future funding , other programs ( mostly newer ones ) do not .

thirty - seven programs that received mandatory funding throughout nearly all titles of the 2008 farm bill did not continue to have assured funding for the 2014 farm bill .

continuing all of these programs would have required an estimated $9 billion to $14 billion of offsets from other programs .

the one - year extension of the 2008 farm bill in p.l .

112-240 did not provide any additional mandatory funding for any of the 37 programs without baseline .

in lieu of mandatory funding , the extension of the farm bill made numerous "authorizations of appropriations" to allow discretionary funding for fy2013 , but this did not provide funding .

discretionary funding , subject to availability in a tight budget environment , conceptually could have been provided ( but was not ) by the appropriations committees in the fy2013 agriculture appropriation ( p.l .

113-6 ) .

the enacted 2014 farm bill provides 29 of these 37 programs with new mandatory funding that totals $6.2 billion over the five - year period fy2014-fy2018 .

a few of these programs even received permanent baseline for the second five years , including the specialty crop research initiative and the rural energy for america program , or were incorporated into other programs .

the enacted law provides more mandatory funding to more of these 37 programs than either proposal .

the combination of house - passed farm bills would have provided about $4.9 billion of mandatory funding ( over five years ) to 14 of the programs .

the senate - passed farm bill would have provided more than $4.5 billion of mandatory funding for 25 of the programs .

table 5 indicates which programs in the 2014 farm bill might become future concerns because of this issue .

the scores for the second five - year period of the budget horizon ( fy2019-fy2023 ) reveal which programs would receive baseline funding beyond the expiration of the 2014 farm bill in fy2018 , and which would receive baseline only for the initial five - year window of the bill .

for example , three other research programs would receive baseline only through fy2018 .

similarly , all of the mandatory - funded program in the rural development title , the farmers market promotion program , and outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers , among other programs , also do not have a baseline beyond fy2018 .

this also is an issue for all of the energy title programs , except for the rural energy for america program , which received a permanent baseline .

the farm commodity programs could have become more expensive if left to expire and outdated "permanent law" provisions were resurrected .

a set of non - expiring provisions from the 1938 and 1949 farm bills , as amended , remain in statute , but have been suspended by modern farm bills .

no official estimates exist for the budgetary effect of reverting to permanent law .

but the support levels under permanent law were above even some of the high market prices for commodities in 2013 .

this could have resulted in greater subsidy outlays than under the may 2013 baseline .

several government - wide deficit reduction proposals from 2010 to 2013 included agricultural programs ( see appendix c ) .

these proposals sometimes may have been seen to have affect — or correspond to — the level of savings in the farm bill proposals , in either amount or components .

the $24 billion in savings in s. 954 — if sequestration reductions were restored — is consistent with the score of the 2012 senate farm bill proposal ( $23.1 billion ) and the savings proposed by the house and senate agriculture committees for the joint select committee on deficit reduction ( a.k.a .

the super committee ) in the fall of 2011 .

the reduction in s. 954 from the nutrition title ( which is not affected by sequestration ) is nearly the same as in the super committee proposal .

and the $13 billion reduction from commodity programs in the super committee proposal was roughly the same as the $12.4 billion of net savings in s. 954 from the farm commodity program and crop insurance .

for the house bill , the evolution of scores begins with the july 2012 score of $35.1 billion of savings for h.r .

6083 being consistent with the $33.2 billion of reconciliation instructions in the fy2013 house budget resolution ( h.con.res .

112 ) and the $35.8 billion of savings identified by the agriculture committee for budget reconciliation .

a primary difference , though , was that all of the reconciliation savings were from nutrition programs , while more than half of the savings in the subsequent farm bill proposals have been from nutrition programs .

in 2013 , h.r .

1947 proposed to make $33.4 billion of reductions , about the same as the 2012 proposals on first blush .

but the bill's effective reduction before the adjustment for sequestration implied a greater reduction than 2012 , sometimes stated as high as $39 billion .

compared to the 2012 house proposal , h.r .

1947 raised the proposed nutrition reduction from $16.1 billion to $20.5 billion .

when h.r .

1947 failed to pass the house , h.r .

3102 increased the proposed nutrition reduction to $39 billion , and the combined reduction in h.r .

3102 and h.r .

2642 to $52 billion .

thus , each iteration of the house proposal took the house bill further away from the senate proposal's budget effect .

separate from the mandatory spending figures above , the cbo cost estimates of the farm bill proposals include a projection of discretionary appropriations that would be needed to carry out the authorized farm bill programs .

for s. 954 and h.r .

1947 , cbo estimated that $37.6 billion and $32.9 billion of discretionary appropriations ( budget authority ) , respectively , would be needed over the five - year period fy2014-fy2018 .

 ( a corresponding estimate was not made for h.r .

2642 , but it would be similar to that for h.r .

1947 given the similarity in provisions between h.r .

1947 and h.r .

2642 . ) .

no estimate was provided for the conference agreement .

however , not all of these amounts represent new programs or spending , since much of the totals are for reauthorizing programs that already are appropriated in the annual agriculture appropriations bill ( eg , agricultural research ) .

moreover , these amounts would be subject to annual decisions by the budget committees and the appropriations committees .

appendix a .

3102 ) table a - 1 presents the detailed year - by - year scores of each provision in the house - passed farm bill ( h.r .

2642 , as combined with h.r .

3102 ) .

the score at the title level is slightly different as presented in the summary in the conference report score , but section - by - section details were not available .

therefore , the more detailed section - by - section score from the earlier but consistent cbo score of the bill , as reported , is provided here .

figure a - 1 shows the title - by - title totals of the house - passed farm bill for each individual year in the budget window .

the format and scale are consistent with figure 7 that shows the amounts for the enacted 2014 farm bill .

in addition to the larger scale of reductions apparent in the house bill , a cumulative limit on new farm program payments in the house bill was scored so that it reduced outlays in fy2020 ( revealing more of the repeal of direct payments ) and deferred those payments until fy2021 ( balancing the program over those two years ) .

this provision was not in the enacted farm bill , which consequently does not have the range of scores in the commodity title for fy2020-fy2021 .

figure b - 1 shows the title - by - title scores of the senate - passed farm bill for each individual year in the budget window .

the format and scale are consistent with figure 7 that shows the amounts for the enacted 2014 farm bill .

appendix c. broad deficit reduction proposals in february 2010 , president obama created the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform to identify changes to balance the budget .

from 2010-2013 , several other government - wide proposals were made and most included reductions to agriculture or farm bill spending ( table c - 1 ) .

in these government - wide deficit reduction proposals , cuts from the agriculture committees' baseline ranged from $10 billion in the president's fiscal commission , $30 billion in the bipartisan policy center plan , and $179 billion in the house - passed fy2013 budget resolution .

these proposals often are compared to the $23 billion reduction offered by the leadership of the house and senate agriculture committees to the joint select committee of deficit reduction .

each of these proposals specifically recommended some reduction to the farm commodity programs or crop insurance , and sometimes to export promotion and conservation .

only a subset recommended reductions to nutrition programs .

together , they represent a range of common ideas and the visibility of the agriculture and nutrition spending for deficit reduction .
