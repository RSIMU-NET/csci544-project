114-144 , the older americans act reauthorization act of 2016 .

first enacted in 1965 , the older americans act ( oaa ) was created in response to concern by policymakers about a lack of community social services for older individuals .

the original legislation established authority for grants to states for community planning and social services , research and development projects , and personnel training in the field of aging .

the law also established the administration on aging ( aoa ) within the then - department of health , education , and welfare ( dhew ) to administer the newly created grant programs and to serve as the federal focal point on matters concerning older persons .

although older persons may receive services under many other federal programs , today the act is considered to be the major vehicle for the organization and delivery of social and nutrition services to this population .

it authorizes a wide array of service programs through a nationwide network of state units on aging ( suas ) , area agencies on aging ( aaas ) , and tribal organizations , as well as thousands of aging and social service providers in local communities .

the act also supports the sole federal job program targeting low - income older workers and funds training , research , and demonstration activities in the field of aging .

prior to the creation of the act in 1965 , older persons were eligible for limited social services through some federal programs .

however , with the recognition that older individuals were becoming an increasing proportion of the population and that their needs were not being formally addressed through existing programs , many groups began advocating on their behalf .

their actions led president truman to initiate the first national conference on aging in 1950 .

conferees called for government and voluntary agencies to accept greater responsibility for the problems and welfare of older persons .

further interest in the field of aging led president eisenhower to create the federal council on aging in 1956 to coordinate the activities of the various units of the federal government related to aging .

the beginning of a major thrust toward legislation along the lines of the later - enacted oaa was made at the 1961 white house conference on aging .

the conferees called for a federal coordinating agency in the field of aging to be set up on a statutory basis , with adequate funding for coordinating federal efforts in aging , as well as a federal program of grants for community services specifically for the elderly .

in response to the white house conference on aging recommendations , legislation was introduced in 1962 to establish an independent u.s. committee on aging to cut across the responsibilities of many departments and agencies , and create a program of grants for social services , research , and training that would benefit older persons .

legislation introduced in 1963 modified the 1962 proposal by creating within dhew the aoa , which was to be under the direction of a commissioner for aging , appointed by the president with the approval of the senate .

the oaa as introduced in 1965 paralleled the 1963 proposal .

sponsors emphasized how it would provide resources necessary for public and private social service providers to meet the social service needs of the elderly .

the act received bipartisan support and was signed into law by president lyndon johnson on july 14 , 1965 ( p.l .

89-73 ) .

in addition to creating aoa , the act authorized grants to states for community planning and services programs , as well as for research , demonstration , and training projects in the field of aging .

in his remarks upon signing the bill , the president indicated that the legislation would provide "an orderly , intelligent , and constructive program to help us meet the new dimensions of responsibilities which lie ahead in the remaining years of this century .

under this program every state and every community can now move toward a coordinated program of services and opportunities for our older citizens. .

thus , it eliminates explicit reference to "older" individuals , which allows residents of any age who reside in ltc facilities to receive ombudsman program services , including investigating and resolving complaints .

the law requires the state long - term care ( ltc ) ombudsman to be responsible for the management , including the fiscal management , of the office of the state ltc ombudsman ( hereinafter referred to as the "office" ) .

it amends the functions of the ombudsman to add language stating that the ombudsman's functions include identifying , investigating , and resolving complaints that are made by , or on behalf of , residents with limited or no decision making capacity and who have no known legal representative .

it further specifies that if such a resident is unable to communicate consent for an ombudsman to work on a complaint involving the resident , the ombudsman is required to seek evidence to indicate what outcome the resident would have communicated and work to accomplish that outcome .

it also amends the duties of designated local ombudsman entities and representatives to identify , investigate , and resolve complaints made by or on behalf of residents with limited decision making capacity in similar circumstances .

in addition to residents having regular and timely access to the ombudsman's services , the law requires that the ombudsman ensure that residents have private and unimpeded access to such services .

in providing technical support for the development of resident and family councils , the law requires the ombudsman to actively encourage and assist in the development of such councils .

it further adds that the ombudsman , when feasible , continue to carry out specified functions on behalf of residents transitioning from a ltc facility to a home care setting .

the law amends the requirement that states ensure representatives of the office have "access" to ltc facilities and residents to specify that representatives have "private and unimpeded access. .

it also amends a provision that requires representatives to have appropriate access to the medical and social records of a resident , subject to certain conditions , to provide that representatives have appropriate access to "all files , records , and other information" concerning a resident rather than ( as previously ) "files. .

it amends current law to clarify that representatives must have appropriate access to review such information when a resident is "unable to communicate consent" to the review and has no legal representative , rather than ( as previously ) "unable to consent. .

similarly , it expands the requirement that representatives have access to the "records" as is necessary to investigate a complaint , to specify that representatives have access to the "files , records , and information" necessary .

it adds that the ombudsman and representatives of the office would be considered a "health oversight agency" for purposes of section 246 ( c ) of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa , p.l .

104-191 ) , including regulations issued under that section .

thus , the release of residents' individually identifiable health information to the ombudsman could not be prevented from occurring under certain specified circumstances .

under current law , the state agency is required to establish procedures for the disclosure of files maintained by the program by the ombudsman or other ombudsman entities .

p.l .

114-144 strikes the language "files and records" and replaces it with "files , records , and other information" in each place the term appears under disclosure requirements .

it amends disclosure requirements pertaining to the identity of the complainant or resident to ensure that the ombudsman may disclose information as needed in order to best serve residents with limited or no decision making capacity who have no known legal representative and are unable to communicate consent , in order for the ombudsman to carry out functions and duties as described .

the law replaces the subsection on conflict of interest with a new subsection that separately describes individual and organizational conflict of interest .

the law also requires the state agency to ensure that no individual , or member of an immediate family of an individual , involved in the designation of the ombudsman , or the designation of a local ombudsman entity or representative , is subject to a conflict of interest .
