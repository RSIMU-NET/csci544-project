2 ( omnibus appropriation , introduced at the opening of the 108th congress ) .

conferees began meetingon february 10 , 2003 ( see below ) .

table 1 shows the key legislative steps necessary for the enactment of the fy2003 militaryconstruction appropriations .

it will be updated as the appropriation process moves forward .

table 1 .

status of military construction appropriations , fy2003 dashes indicate no action yet taken .

several issues regarding military construction have gained visibility during thelegislative deliberations of the current session of congress .

among these are: overalland specific account funding levels requested by the administration ; congressionaladditions to the military construction budget request ; military housing ( including theencouragement of private sector financing of housing construction and maintenance ) ; and funding requested through the defense emergency response fund .

overall and specific account funding levels .

the fy2003 budget submitted by the president on february4 , 2002 , requested $8.987 billion in new budget authority , an amount $1.62 billionbelow the 2002 enactment .

subsequent additional requests included in the defenseemergency response fund ( derf ) raised the total request to $9.578 billion in timefor house consideration of its bill .

an additional $122.5 million in army derfrequests was later received by congress and will be considered by the senate .

thisraises the total presidential budget request for fy2003 to $9.66 billion .

the senateis also expected to consider a $200 million army and air force transformationinitiative intended to appropriate a funding pool to accelerate the creation ofinfrastructure to support the army's interim brigade combat team and air forcec - 17 aircraft mobility programs .

this and the upward adjustment of bracenvironmental cleanup funding was not reckoned with by the house .

the senateappropriations committee has recommended a total of $10.62 billion in new militaryconstruction budget authority for fy2003 .

within the overall military construction appropriation , there was a substantial change in how budget authority was allocated between the fy2002 enactment , thefy2003 request , and the bills as passed by the house and the senate as reflected in table 2 .

increases in budget authority are evident in the construction and renovation of military family housing both within the united states and at overseas installations,offset somewhat by a reduction in the unspecified location accounts devoted tomaintenance , management , provision of utilities , etc .

there is also an increase infunding requested for general military construction overseas , reflecting a dod effortto increase the quality of life in the workplace for military personnel stationed there .

these figures include the additional requests of the fy2003 derf as considered by the house and senate , respectively .

b .

examples of location unspecified projects are energy conservation funding , somemajor and minor construction projects , and classified projects for militaryconstruction ; and maintenance , furnishings and utilities accounts for familyhousing , among others .

c. special accounts include brac , the nato security investment fund , thehomeowners assistance fund ( zeroed out this year ) , and the dod familyhousing improvement fund .

the most noticeable reduction in budget authority is seen in domestic military construction .

table 3 compares military construction budget authority betweenfy2002 and fy2003 for military construction projects located within the unitedstates , divided between the active duty and reserve ( national guard and federalreserves ) components .

table 3 .

domestic military construction , active duty and reserves ( $000 ) source: dod comptroller , construction programs ( c - 1 ) , department of defense budget , fiscal year 2003 , february 2002. a .

these figures do not include the additional funds requested for the fy2003 derf .

these figures represent decreases of 38.8% in active duty and 71.9% in reserve construction funding between fy2002 and fy2003 .

secretary of defense donaldrumsfeld and dod comptroller dov zakheim stated in a press briefing on february4 , 2002 , that they expected a 20 to 25% reduction in military bases during thefy2005 brac round and anticipated this with a reduced construction request .

 ( 23 ) thisdecrease in construction was to be offset by an increase in sustainment funds .

 ( 24 ) table4 compares the dod sustainment funds requested for fy2003 with those actuallyexpended in fy2001 and appropriated for fy2002 .

 ( 25 ) table 4 .

sustainment funding trend , fy2001-fy2003 ( current $000 ) source: dod comptroller , operation and maintenance programs ( o - 1 ) : department of defense budget for fiscal year 2003 , february 2002 .

note: total obligational authority ( toa ) .

sustainment includes all dodfacilities sustainment , restoration , and modernization ( fsrm ) accounts .

* these figures do not include additional funds requested for the fy2003derf .

the table shows that sustainment funding rose $267 million between fy2001 and fy2002 .

if the same rate of increase ( 4.8% ) occurred between fy2002 andfy2003 , dod would have been expected to request $6.089 billion .

instead , dodrequested $6.488 billion , or approximately $398 million beyond the normalexpectation .

this increase may be considered to constitute the substantive additionalfunds devoted to maintaining existing property .

in addition , some members have deemed dod funding requests for the army national guard , the air national guard , and the federal reserves particularlyinadequate .

 ( 26 ) until the late 1980s , the amount ofmilitary construction fundingappropriated by congress for the guard and reserve rose steadily , closely matchingthe amounts requested by dod .

for fy1989 , though , the administration began todecrease its requests for guard and reserve construction .

congress responded byappropriating funds in excess of the request ( see figure 1 ) .

senator christopherbond commented during floor debate on fy1996 military constructionappropriations that "national guard forces traditionally have been underfunded" inconstruction requests submitted by the pentagon .

 ( 27 ) since fy1989 , congress hasconsistently appropriated more than the administration request , and the gap betweenrequest and enactment has grown considerably .

the house , after including the derfrequest , passed an appropriation for guard and reserve construction $210 millionabove that asked for by the administration .

the senate appropriations committeerecommended adding $290 million to the administration's guard and reserveconstruction request .

military housing .

military housing for both families and unaccompanied has been a highly visible militaryconstruction issue for several years .

in the mid 1990s , then - secretary of defensewilliam cohen announced a goal of the elimination of substandard military housingby 2010 .

he proposed to do this using an increase in traditional dod - fundedconstruction and renovation , plus less orthodox methods such as partnering withprivate enterprise to build and maintain housing and increasing the military basicallowance for housing ( bah ) to cover the cost of off - base housing .

 ( 28 ) at the presenttime , approximately one - third of military families live in government - ownedhousing .

at the outset of the effort , dod estimated that more than half of existing military family housing did not meet its own minimum housing standards withrespect to living space , amenities , etc .

in addition , bah compensation covered only85% of the cost ( accommodation and utilities ) of living off - base .

dod and congressthen initiated several programs to encourage private investment and to increasefunding of traditional housing construction for both families and unaccompaniedmembers , and to increase the percentage of off - base housing costs covered bymilitary allowances .

dod now estimates that substandard housing will disappear forall military members and their families by 2007 and that out - of - pocket expensesassociated with living on the local economy will be eliminated by 2005 .

 ( 29 ) because improvement and expansion of adequate housing on military installations may encourage the movement of significant numbers of military familiesonto bases , some members have expressed concern that local school districts servinglarge military communities may find their facility and personnel plans unexpectedlydisrupted .

language included in the house report for the bob stump nationaldefense authorization act ( h.rept .

107-436 accompanying h.r .

4546 ) directs dod to report by march 1 , 2003 , on the situations at three army and airforce installations ( ft. bragg , north carolina , ft .

hood , texas , and lackland airforce base , texas ) where large housing privatization projects are underway .

 ( 30 ) defense emergency response fund .

the administration defense budget request for operations andmaintenance ( considered part of the defense appropriation , not the militaryconstruction appropriation ) contained a single new entry for $20.1 billion entitled thedefense emergency response fund ( derf ) .

 ( 31 ) this is intended for use by dod torespond to or protect against acts of terrorism .

the request contained detailedjustification for $10.1 billion , or about half of the total request , of which dodidentified approximately $594 million as appropriate for consideration as militaryconstruction to enhance physical security at military installations .

 ( 32 ) the derf is atransfer fund , which is used to shift appropriations between accounts withoutadherence to normal congressional reprogramming or notification requirements .

thehouse appropriations committee considered $594 million of the derf to be partof the administration's military construction appropriation request and added it tothe suitable appropriations accounts .

the administration forwarded an additionalderf request too late for house consideration but in time for senate and conferenceaction .

derf funding , as requested by the president and recommended by theconference committee , is shown in table 5 .

additional omnibus appropriations .

additional defense and military constructionappropriations language was included in division m ( other matters ) , title i ( defenserelated technical corrections ) of the senate amendment to h.j.res .

2 of the 108th congress ( the omnibus appropriations act ) ( january 15 , crs988-s909 ) .

several provisions of the bill amend p.l .

107-249 ( the militaryconstruction act for fy2003 ) .

section 103 of the bill amends section 124 of the original legislation , which had stated that "none of the funds appropriated or made available by this act may beobligated for partnership for peace programs in the new independent states of theformer soviet union," to read "not more than $2,000,000 of the funds appropriatedor made available by this act may be obligated for partnership for peace programs. .

section 104 reduces the overall appropriation for air force military construction by $18,600,000 and transfers it to air force reserve military construction , a 28%increase in the latter account ( see table 7 ) .

section 105 permits the $15,000,000 appropriated for land acquisition at nellis air force base to be transferred to the u.s .

fish and wildlife service to fulfillobligations under the military lands withdrawal act of 1999 .

 ( 33 ) the usfws is thenpermitted to grant these funds to the national fish and wildlife foundation toreplace public lands withdrawn from public use under the 1999 act .

the bill also amended p.l .

107-248 , the national defense appropriations act for fiscal year 2003 .

included under those provisions were changes in variousreprogramming thresholds , a raise in the limit placed on expense / investment valuefor items purchased with operation and maintenance funds from $100,000 to$250,000 , various transfers of defense appropriations between accounts , and anadditional appropriation of $3.89 billion .

between fy1985 and fy1998 , funding devoted to military constructiondeclined steadily as dod and congress struggled with a changing strategicenvironment , a shrinking military force , and the uncertainties associated with severalrounds of base realignments and closures .

appropriations began to rise with fy1998as congress sought to replace outdated facilities and improve the quality of life formilitary personnel at home and in the workplace .

administration requests for militaryconstruction funding ( not including brac and family housing ) continued to declineuntil fy2000 , but have risen forfy2001 and 2002 .

the request for fy2003 dips , butdod projects that its annual construction requests will approximately triple betweenfy2003 and fy2007 ( see figure 2 ) .

prior to fy1994 , congress considered administration requests to exceed realconstruction requirements , typically appropriating less new budget authority thanrequested .

this pattern reversed with the fy1995 budget .

every year since then,congress has added to administration requests , countering what members havetermed "inadequate" funding for military construction .

the dod request forconstruction funds for fy2003 fell relative to both its fy2002 request and thesubsequent enactment , anticipating the fy2005 round of base realignments andclosures , according to statements made by secretary of defense donald rumsfeldand dod comptroller dov zakheim .

dod projects that future requests for militaryconstruction will rise steadily and rapidly .

table 7 breaks down the fy2003 requestby appropriations account and compares it to fy2002 levels .

table 8 showscongressional action on current military construction appropriations by account .

table 9 compares administration military construction requests and enactments forguard and reserve projects from fy1993-2003 .

these tables include only those projects and other line items that were eitherrequested by the president or appropriated or authorized by congress .

table 10 shows changes to military construction projects and line items , while table 11 doesthe same for family housing .

many derf items show presidential requests and nohouse - recommended appropriations .

this was caused by the late submission by thepresident of much of the derf request .
