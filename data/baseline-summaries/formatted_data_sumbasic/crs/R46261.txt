o n december 31 , 2019 , the world health organization ( who ) was informed of a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan city , hubei province of china .

illnesses have since been linked to a disease caused by a previously unidentified strain of coronavirus , designated coronavirus disease 2019 , or covid - 19 .

despite containment efforts in china , the united states , and elsewhere , by late february there were indications that the covid - 19 outbreak may have entered a new phase , with community spread occurring or suspected in several countries other than china , including in the united states .

diagnostic testing is a critical part of the public health response to and clinical management of the covid - 19 caused by the sars - cov - 2 virus .

efforts in the united states to develop and disseminate a test for covid - 19 have faced challenges .

manufacturing and quality issues with the nation's testâdeveloped by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) âresulted in essentially all testing going through cdc's laboratory facility in atlanta through early march , despite distribution of test kits to state and local public health labs beginning in early february .

cdc's initial test kits had to be remanufactured and redistributed , which , along with other factors , has significantly delayed access to testing throughout the country .

it has been reported that the cdc's atlanta laboratory is currently under investigation by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) for possible quality issues related to its manufacture of the test kits , which may have led to the contamination of one reagent and thus to the quality issues with the test .

in this context , on february 29 , 2020 , in an effort to facilitate the expansion of testing capacity as the first cases of community spread were confirmed in the united states , the food and drug administration ( fda ) announced a significant new policy .

this policy , issued via agency guidance and effective immediately , allows certain laboratoriesâprincipally clinical and commercial laboratoriesâthat have developed and validated their own covid - 19 diagnostics to begin to use the tests prior to the test receiving an emergency use authorization ( eua ) from the agency .

diagnostic testing for covid - 19 , in part because it is caused by a novel pathogen , has been led and carried out to date through the country's public health infrastructure .

this includes primarily the cdc and the country's network of state and local public health laboratories .

in contrast , in most situations , diagnostic testing is carried out by a number of facilities , including private commercial laboratories ( eg , quest , labcorp ) , hospital and other clinical laboratories , and laboratories in academic medical centers , among others .

fda's february 29 guidance aims to facilitate the expansion of diagnostic testing from the public health setting into the clinical health care and commercial settings , leveraging significant standing resources throughout the country , including facilities , trained personnel , expertise , materials , and equipment .

it is fda's intention that this expansion will help the country meet the increasing and substantial demand for testing generated by community spread of the disease and expanded clinical testing guidelines issued by the cdc .

in addition , because many cases of covid - 19 are reportedly mild or asymptomatic , widespread access to testingâwhich informs development of important metrics such as the case fatality rateâis critical to understanding the scope and extent of the disease in the united states , and to efficiently directing resources to mitigate its impact in the broader community .

diagnostic testsâformally called in vitro diagnostic ( ivd ) devicesâmay be commercially developed and distributed as "kits" or developed , validated , and carried out by a single laboratory .

this second type of testâknown as a laboratory - developed test , or an ldtâis the more commonly used type of test because of its flexibility and differing federal regulatory requirements , among other reasons .

although the cdc's test is being manufactured as a test kit and initially has been distributed to specific cdc - qualified labs , the fda guidance targets ldts that are generally carried out in clinical and academic settings or private commercial laboratories .

all clinical laboratories in the united states , regardless of whether they are part of the country's public health infrastructure or part of the health care delivery system , are regulated by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 ( clia ) program , administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) .

federal agencies involved in the regulation of ivds include fda and cms .

fda derives its authority to regulate the sale and distribution of medical devices , such as ivds , from the federal food , drug , and cosmetics act ( ffdca ) and the public health service act ( phsa ) .

cms's authority to regulate ivds is through clia ( p.l .

100-578 ) .

fda regulates the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests , as well as the quality of the design and manufacture of the diagnostic test .

cms regulates the quality of clinical laboratories and the clinical testing process .

the diagnostic test developed by the cdc , called the 2019-novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) real - time reverse transcriptase ( rt ) - pcr diagnostic panel , is a complex molecular diagnostic test that relies on generally standard molecular biology laboratory techniques .

specifically , the test uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , a standard in vitro technique for amplification of dna .

because the sars - cov - 2 virusâthe virus that causes covid - 19âis an rna virus , the rna must be first reverse transcribed to generate copy dna , or cdna , which is then amplified ( multiple copies are generated ) using pcr .

pcr relies on primersâvery short single stranded pieces of dna that are complementary to and bind with specific regions of the viral genome and thus define the specific genomic region to be amplified .

the test then relies on a probe , or a single - stranded piece of dna that is chemically or radioactively labelled , that can bind to and thus detect the amplified target portion of the viral genetic material .

cdc's original test used three sets of primers and probes: two to target specific regions of a designated gene within the sars - cov - 2 viral genome , and a third that was specific to all sars - like coronaviruses ( see " what quality problems did the cdc's test experience on rollout to the state and local public health laboratories ? .

" ) .

the test also includes a number of authorized control samples , including a positive control for sars - cov - 2 and a "no template control" to test for system contamination .

together , these controls help ensure that the test is functioning properly .

the cdc's test is being developed by the agency as a test kit and is generally authorized to be distributed to state and local public health laboratories to augment public health testing capacity .

the test received an eua from the fda on february 4 , 2020 , under which "authorized laboratories" may receive and carry out the test despite the fact that it is not fda - approved or fda - cleared , and that it does not meet all related regulatory requirements for marketing .

the eua notes that "[t]esting is limited to qualified laboratories designated by cdc and , in the united states , certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 ( clia ) , ( 42 u.s.c .

â§263a ) , to perform high complexity tests. .

cdc - qualified laboratories with a clia certification for high - complexity testing able to receive the test kits include u.s. state and local public health laboratories , department of defense ( dod ) laboratories , and select international laboratories .

the public health laboratories must verify the test themselves prior to using it , and are currently required to send presumptive positive cases back to the cdc in atlanta for confirmatory testing by the agency .

the trump administration had estimated that approximately 1 million tests would be broadly available imminently , facilitated by leveraging manufacturing of the cdc test kit by a private company , integrated dna technologies ( idt ) , a manufacturer that has been working with cdc .

according to hhs secretary azar on march 5 , 2020 , idt will send the cdc test kit to "hospitals , other labs around the country , commercial , public health â¦ labs" by the end of the week of march 2 .

the test kit being manufactured by idt , identical to the cdc test kit and referred to as "idt 2019-novel coronavirus kit," is being qualified by cdc in lots , and fda reports that these cdc - qualified , idt - manufactured test kits are covered by the cdc's eua authorization of february 4 , 2020 .

fda notes that if a lab purchases a test kit from idt , the laboratory does not need its own eua to carry it out , but that "[t]esting using cdc's eua - authorized protocol and cdc qualified lots of reagents is considered to be testing done under the cdc's eua .

labs performing such testing should follow any applicable conditions set forth in the eua. .

labcorp , a large commercial laboratory , is already reporting that it can perform the cdc test "if needed to meet testing demand" and that the test is only for use with "authorized specimens collected from individuals who meet cdc criteria for covid - 19 testing. .

idt is manufacturing test kits in two sizes , with the largest having a capacity of 500 reactions ( approximately 250 individual patients ) .

as noted above , the cdc's test kit used three sets of probes and primersâor reagentsâto detect and identify viral dna beyond that specific to covid - 19 .

one of these reagents , the one meant to detect any sars - like coronavirus including sars - cov - 2 , was returning inconclusive results .

in response , the cdc validated a new protocol for their test that allows it to be run excluding the faulty reagent , running the test with only the other two diagnostic components .

cdc has the authority to modify the test through enforcement discretion granted by fda .

the agency determined that the exclusion of this reagent does not affect the accuracy or the sensitivity and specificity of the test .

certain laboratories have continued to experience problems running the test , even when using the modified protocol , with at least one laboratory reporting that the first reagent was also returning inconclusive results .

this problem severely limited the state and local public health laboratories' ability to carry out the cdc's test .

in response to these issues , the new york state department of health requested and was granted the fda's second eua for its own laboratory - developed test , the new york sars - cov - 2 real - time rt - pcr diagnostic panel .

testing is limited under the eua to two laboratories in new yorkâthe wadsworth center , new york state department of public health , and the new york city department of health and mental hygiene , public health laboratories .

new york was one of the states that had continued difficulty implementing cdc's original test kit , even with the modified protocol .

in response , cdc is also manufacturing new test kits after reportedly resolving the manufacturing issue that affected the original test kit .

this time , however , cdc is manufacturing test kits with only the two reagents that were unaffected by the quality issueâthat are specific to sars - cov - 2âand those kits are being made available to qualified cdc labs through the international reagent resource .

 , these test kits are expected to result in the public health laboratories having capacity to test up to 75,000 patients .

some believe that the cdc's choice to develop and mitigate quality problems with its own covid - 19 diagnostic when an accepted diagnostic was available through the world health organization ( who ) , which was efficiently distributing a german - developed test globally early in the outbreak , was a decision that cost the united states time in its response to the virus's introduction and spread in the country .

some speculated about the use of the third reagentâthat was to detect sars - like coronavirusesâand whether it had been strictly necessary if the test was still accurate at diagnosing covid - 19 without that reagent included in the test at all , or if it had instead overcomplicated the test .

in general , there have been questions raised about the cdc's handling of the development and distribution of its test , and its response to the quality problems that occurred , and the impact this may have had on the country's ability to detect community spread of the disease before it occurred more widely .

on february 29 , 2020 , as problems with the rollout of the cdc - developed diagnostic test continued , fda announced a new policy to immediately leverage ldts developed in high - complexity commercial , reference , and clinical laboratories nationwide to expand testing capacity .

specifically , the new agency guidance allows clia - certified high - complexity laboratories that have developed and validated their own covid - 19 diagnostics to use the tests while the laboratory is preparing , and fda is reviewing , their eua submission .

 , the fda guidance states that laboratories have 15 days after validating their test to submit an eua application to fda , and the guidance recommends confirming the test's first five negative and positive results against an eua - authorized diagnostic .

according to fda , it "does not intend to object to the use of these tests for clinical testing while the laboratories are pursuing an eua with the fda .

importantly , this policy only applies to laboratories that are certified to perform high - complexity testing consistent with requirements under clinical laboratory improvement amendments. .

the guidance includes detailed information about fda's expected methods for test validation .

pursuant to this fda guidance , on march 5 , 2020 , labcorp announced that it had begun offering its ldt , the labcorp 2019 novel coronavirus ( covid - 19 ) , naa test "for ordering by physicians or other authorized healthcare providers anywhere in the u.s.," and that it is currently pursuing an eua with the agency for the test .

this test is to take between three to four days to return results , and a health care provider must order and authorize it , and obtain the required specimen from the patient .

under the fda's new guidance , quest has also announced that it will begin testing for coronavirus with its own ldt , beginning march 9 , 2020 , and that it plans to pursue an eua with the agency within 15 days , as required by the guidance .
