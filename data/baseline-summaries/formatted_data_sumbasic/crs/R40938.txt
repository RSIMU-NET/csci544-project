on january 8 , 2013 , vice president nicolás maduro announced that president chávez would not be sworn into office on january 10 as planned because he was still recovering from cancer surgery in cuba , but that he would be sworn into office at a later date , as provided for in article 231 of the constitution .

a day later , on january 9 , 2013 , venezuela's supreme court upheld this interpretation of the constitution , maintaining that chávez could take the oath of office before the supreme court at a later date when his health improves .

some opposition leaders and some venezuelan legal scholars had argued that the january 10 inauguration date was fixed by article 231 , and that since chávez could not be sworn in on that date , then the president of the national assembly should have been sworn in as interim or caretaker president until either a new election was held or chávez recovered .

opposition leader henrique capriles appeared to accept the supreme court's interpretation of the constitution , but maintained that it did not end the uncertainties facing the country .

 ( see " chávez's health status and political implications " below. ) .

on december 16 , 2012 , venezuela held state elections in which 23 governorships were at stake .

voters delivered a resounding victory to president chávez and his united socialist party of venezuela ( psuv ) , which won 20 out of 23 states .

opposition candidates won just three states , including the state of miranda , where recently defeated opposition presidential candidate henrique capriles radonski was reelected .

 ( see " december 2012 state elections " ) on december 8 , 2012 , president chávez announced that his cancer had returned and that he would soon undergo a fourth cancer surgery in cuba .

he also announced his support for vice president nicolás maduro if anything were to happen to him , including support for maduro in a new election that would be required by the constitution .

 ( maduro had been sworn into office on october 13 , 2012 , and retained his position as foreign minister , which he has held since 2006. ) .

chávez reportedly faced complications during and after his december 11 surgery , and faced new respiratory complications at year's end .

 ( see " chávez's health status and political implications " below. ) .

on october 7 , 2012 , president chávez won reelection to another six - year term by a margin of 11% , capturing about 55% of the vote compared to 44% for opposition candidate henrique capriles .

most reports indicate that election day was peaceful with only minor irregularities .

a white house spokesman , while acknowledging differences with president chávez , congratulated "the venezuelan people on the high level of participation , as well as on what was a relatively peaceful process. .

 ( for more details , see " election results and implications " below. ) .

on september 18 , 2012 , venezuelan security forces captured a major colombian drug trafficker , daniel barrera , who reportedly was based in venezuela since 2008 .

 ( see " counternarcotics issues " below. ) .

for developments earlier in 2009-2012 , see appendix b at the end of this report .

for more than a decade , venezuela has experienced significant political changes under the rule of populist president hugo chávez , and for a number of years there has been concern about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of expression in the country .

with an estimated 211 billion barrels of proven oil reserves ( the largest in the hemisphere , up from previously reported 99 billion in proven reserves ) , venezuela's major economic sector is petroleum , which accounts for 90% of exports , more than 30% of its gross domestic product , and half of the government's fiscal income .

the country is classified by the world bank as an upper middle income developing country because of its relatively high per capita income of $11,820 ( 2011 ) .

despite venezuela's oil wealth , economic conditions in the country deteriorated in the 1990s .

the percentage of venezuelans living in poverty ( income of less than $2 a day ) increased from 32.2% to 48.5% of the population between 1991 and 2000 , while the percentage of the population in extreme poverty ( income of less than $1 a day ) increased from 11.8% in 1990 to 23.5% in 2000 .

in 2002-2003 , the country's political instability and polarization between the government of populist president hugo chávez and the political opposition contributed to a poor investment climate , capital flight , and declines in gross domestic product ( gdp ) .

a national strike orchestrated by the political opposition from late 2002 to early 2003 contributed to a contraction of the national economy by almost 9% in 2002 and 7.8% in 2003 .

from 2004-2008 , however , venezuela benefitted from the rise in world oil prices that began in 2004 .

fueled by the windfall from oil price increases , the venezuelan economy grew by over 18% in 2004 and averaged 8.6% growth annually from 2005 through 2008 ( see figure 2 ) .

the economic boom allowed president chávez to move ahead with economic goals that fit into his "bolivarian revolution. .

these included the expansion of a state - led development model , renegotiation of contracts with large foreign investors ( especially in the petroleum sector ) for majority government control , and the restructuring of operations at the state oil company , petroleos de venezuela s.a .

 ( pdvsa ) .

the government also nationalized numerous enterprises , including telecommunications , electricity , and steel companies , as well as cement , coffee , sugar , flour , and milk production facilities .

the economic boom also allowed president chávez to increase expenditures on social programs associated with his populist agenda .

the government began implementing an array of social programs and services known as misiones or missions .

there have been some 25 missions offering a wide array of services in the fields of education , health , nutrition , the environment , sports , culture , and housing , as well as targeted programs for indigenous rights and services for street children and adolescents .

as a result of the booming economy and increased social spending , poverty rates in venezuela declined from 48.6% in 2002 to 27.6% in 2008 , with extreme poverty or indigence falling from 22.2% to 9.9% over the same period .

the global financial crisis and associated drop in the price of oil had significant negative effects on the venezuelan economy , which contracted 3.2% in 2009 and 1.5% in 2010 .

this made venezuela the only country in south america , and one of the few in the region , to continue to decline economically in 2010 , and poverty rates increased slightly in that year .

economic growth returned in 2011 , however , with a growth rate of 4.2% because of the rise in oil prices and because of increased central government expenditure .

the government increased its fiscal spending in order to help chávez in the october 2012 presidential election .

with this spending and high oil prices , estimated growth for 2012 is 5% .

 ( see figure 2 . ) .

the venezuelan government continues to face significant economic challenges .

over the past four years , high levels of inflation , averaging almost 28% annually from 2008 to 2011 , have eroded purchasing power .

the estimate for 2012 is almost 21% .

 ( see figure 3 . ) .

in addition to inflation , there have been periodic shortages of basic food staples and other products because of price controls that have stifled local production .

the government's response to shortages has been to nationalize some domestic agricultural producers or distributors .

venezuela's private sector describes the business community as being under siege from the government because some companies have been nationalized without compensation and without appropriate legal procedures being followed .

in june 2010 , venezuelan authorities discovered 30,000 tons of rotten food at a government warehouse that was supposed to be delivered to state - run supermarkets known as mercal .

the scandal prompted widespread criticism of the government , and raised questions about its strategy of taking over more economic activities .

since 2002 , hundreds of companies , both domestic and foreign , have been nationalized .

companies that have been nationalized under the chávez government are in a variety of economic sectors , including energy , food and agriculture , finance , heavy industry , gold , steel , telecommunications , electricity , transportation , and tourism .

while the government maintains that it will provide compensation for the nationalizations , foreign companies are often forced to seek settlement through international arbitration .

there are currently 28 pending cases against venezuela at the international centre for settlement of investment disputes ( icsid ) affiliated with the world bank .

in january 2012 , exxonmobil won a settlement valued at some $900 million at the international court of arbitration ( of the international chamber of commerce ) .

the chávez government reportedly welcomed the settlement because exxonmobil had sought much more , but the company has another outstanding case against venezuela at the icsid that could provide it with a potentially much more significant settlement .

president chávez announced in early january 2012 that he would not recognize any decision made by the icsid , and later in the month his government began procedures to withdraw from the organization .

some analysts , however , maintain that that the withdrawal process will be complex and could take as long as 15 years and involve venezuela's renegotiation of bilateral investment treaties with over 20 countries .

in january 2010 , the venezuelan government took action to shore up its fiscal situation by devaluing venezuela's currency , the bolivar fuerte , which increased the value of its oil earnings and boosted government revenues .

the government shifted the official exchange rate from bolivares fuertes ( bsf ) 2.15 / u.s .

$1 to bsf2.6 / u.s.$1 for essential imports such as food , medicine , and for public - sector projects and strategic sectors , and established a second fixed exchange rate of bsf4.3 / u.s.$1 for other imports .

the increased revenue enabled the government to continue spending ahead of the september 2010 legislative elections , but also increased inflationary pressure .

in january 2011 , the government unified the two fixed foreign exchange rates by eliminating the bsf2.6 / u.s.$1 rate for essential imports in favor of a rate of bsf4.3 / u.s.$1 for all imports .

according to some analysts , the government's move appears to be an effort to reduce the complexity of the multiple exchange - rate system , but the action has raised concerns about an increase in inflation .

the government still retains an exchange rate of bsf5.4 / u.s.$1 for bond swaps operated by the central bank , while the illegal black market rate is estimated at bsf9.3 / u.s.$1 , a reflection of the continued overvaluation of venezuela's currency .

given the overvaluation , economic analysts expect venezuela to devalue its currency again in 2013 .

as noted above , venezuela still remains highly dependent on oil , which accounts for some 90% of its exports .

because of its substantial oil exports , the country generally runs a positive trade balance .

the country's trade surplus began to grow significantly as oil prices began to increase in 2004 .

venezuela's trade surplus grew from $16.7 billion in 2003 to a high of $44 billion in 2008 .

the decline in the price of oil beginning in 2009 reduced the country's exports by about 40% , from $95 billion in 2008 to $57 billion in 2009 .

during the same period , imports declined at a slower rate so that the trade surplus declined to almost $18 billion in 2009 .

since then , with the recovery and increase of oil prices , the trade surplus grew to $27 billion in 2010 and $46 billion in 2011 .

 ( see table 2 . ) .

in terms of export markets , venezuela's oil - based economy is highly dependent on the united states and has been for many years , even though the u.s. share of venezuela's oil exports has been declining in recent years .

the country is a major supplier of foreign oil to the united states , providing almost 10% of u.s. crude oil imports in 2011 .

in 2010 , the united states was the destination of about 40% of venezuela's total exports .

ten years earlier — in 2000 — about 55% of venezuela's exports were destined for the united states .

the percentage of venezuela's imports that come from the united states has also declined somewhat over time , although the united states still remains the single largest country of origin for venezuelan imports .

in 2010 , about 29% of venezuela's imports were from the united states , while 10 years earlier , the united states was the origin of about 38% of venezuela's imports .

the united states traditionally has had close relations with venezuela , a major supplier of foreign oil to the united states , but there has been significant friction with the chávez government .

for several years , u.s. officials have expressed concerns about human rights , venezuela's military arms purchases ( largely from russia ) , its relations with cuba and iran , its efforts to export its brand of populism to other latin american countries , and the use of venezuelan territory by colombian guerrilla and paramilitary forces .

declining venezuelan cooperation on antidrug and antiterrorism efforts also has been a u.s. concern .

since 2005 , venezuela has been designated annually ( by president bush and president obama ) as a country that has failed to adhere to its international anti - drug obligations .

since 2006 , the department of state has prohibited the sale of defense articles and services to venezuela because of lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts .
