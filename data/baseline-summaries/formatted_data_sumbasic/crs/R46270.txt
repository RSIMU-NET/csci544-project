the world health organization ( who ) first declared covid - 19 a world health emergency in january 2020 .

since the virus was first diagnosed in wuhan , china , it has been detected in over 190 countries and all u.s. states .

in early march , the focal point of infections shifted from china to europe , especially italy , but by april 2020 , the focus shifted to the united states , where the number of infections was accelerating .

the infection has sickened more than 4.5 million people , about one - third in the united states , with thousands of fatalities .

more than 80 countries have closed their borders to arrivals from countries with infections , ordered businesses to close , instructed their populations to self - quarantine , and closed schools to an estimated 1.5 billion children .

over the eight - week period from mid - march to mid - may 2020 , more than 36.5 million americans filed for unemployment insurance .

on may 8 , 2020 , the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) reported that 20 million americans lost their jobs in april 2020 , pushing the total number of unemployed americans to 23 million , out of a total civilian labor force of 156 million .

the increase pushed the national unemployment rate to 14.7% , the highest since the great depression of the 1930s .

preliminary data also indicate that u.s. gdp fell by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020 , the largest quarterly decline in gdp since the fourth quarter of 2008 during the global financial crisis .

in europe , over 30 million people in germany , france , the uk , spain , and italy have applied for state support of their wages , while first quarter 2020 data indicate that the eurozone economy contracted by 3.8% at an annual rate , the largest quarterly decline since the series started in 1995 .

the european commission released its economic forecast on may 6 , 2020 , which projects that eu economic growth in 2020 will contract by 7.4% and only partially recover in 2021 .

foreign investors have pulled an estimated $26 billion out of developing asian economies and more than $16 billion out of india , increasing concerns of a major economic recession in asia .

some estimates indicate that 29 million people in latin america could fall into poverty , reversing a decade of efforts to narrow income inequality .

the pandemic crisis is challenging governments to implement monetary and fiscal policies that support credit markets and sustain economic activity , while they are implementing policies to develop vaccines and safeguard their citizens .

in doing so , however , differences in policy approaches are straining relations between countries that promote nationalism and those that argue for a coordinated international response .

differences in policies are also straining relations between developed and developing economies and between northern and southern members of the eurozone , challenging alliances , and raising questions about the future of global leadership .

after a delayed response , central banks and monetary authorities are engaging in an ongoing series of interventions in financial markets and national governments are announcing fiscal policy initiatives to stimulate their economies .

international organizations are also taking steps to provide loans and other financial assistance to countries in need .

these and other actions have been labeled "unprecedented," a term that has been used frequently to describe the pandemic and the policy responses .

as one measure of the global fiscal and monetary responses , the international monetary fund ( imf ) estimated that government spending and revenue measures to sustain economic activity adopted through mid - april 2020 amounted to $3.3 trillion and that loans , equity injections and guarantees totaled an additional $4.5 trillion .

the imf also estimates that the increase in borrowing by governments globally will rise from 3.7% of global gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2019 to 9.9% in 2020 , as indicated in figure 1 .

among developed economies , the fiscal balance to gdp ratio is projected to rise from 3.0% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 ; the ratio for the united states is projected to rise from 5.8% to 15.7% .

according to the imf , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united kingdom have each announced public sector support measures totaling more than 10% of their annual gdp .

for developing economies , the fiscal balance to gdp ratio is projected to rise from 4.8% to 9.1% , significantly increasing their debt burden and raising prospects of defaults or debt rescheduling .

according to some estimates , the most fiscally vulnerable countries are: argentina , venezuela , lebanon , jordan , iran , zambia , zimbabwe , and south africa .

among central banks , the federal reserve has taken extraordinary steps not experienced since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis to address the growing economic effects of covid - 19 .

the u.s. congress also has approved historic fiscal spending packages .

in other countries , central banks have lowered interest rates and reserve requirements , announced new financing facilities , relaxed capital buffers and , in some cases , countercyclical capital buffers , adopted after the 2008-2009 financial crisis , potentially freeing up an estimated $5 trillion in funds .

capital buffers were raised after the financial crisis to assist banks in absorbing losses and staying solvent during financial crises .

in some cases , governments have directed banks to freeze dividend payments and halt pay bonuses .

on march 11 , the who announced that the outbreak was officially a pandemic , the highest level of health emergency .

a growing list of economic indicators makes it clear that the outbreak is negatively affecting global economic growth on a scale that has not been experienced since at least the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 .

global trade and gdp are forecast to decline sharply at least through the first half of 2020 .

the global pandemic is affecting a broad swath of international economic and trade activities , from services generally to tourism and hospitality , medical supplies and other global value chains , consumer electronics , and financial markets to energy , transportation , food , and a range of social activities , to name a few .

the health and economic crises could have a particularly negative impact on the economies of developing countries that are constrained by limited financial resources and where health systems could quickly become overloaded .

without a clear understanding of when the global health and economic effects may peak and a greater understanding of the impact on economies , forecasts must necessarily be considered preliminary .

similarly , estimates of when any recovery might begin and the speed of the recovery are speculative .

efforts to reduce social interaction to contain the spread of the virus are disrupting the daily lives of most americans and adding to the economic costs .

increasing rates of unemployment are raising the prospects of wide - spread social unrest and demonstrations in developed economies where lost incomes and health insurance are threatening living standards and in developing economies where populations reportedly are growing concerned over access to basic necessities and the prospects of rising levels of poverty .

u.n. secretary general antonio guterres argued in a video conference before the u.n. security council on april 10 , 2020 , that the pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and securityâpotentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease .

the challenge for policymakers has been one of implementing targeted policies that address what had been expected to be short - term problems without creating distortions in economies that can outlast the impact of the virus itself .

policymakers , however , are being overwhelmed by the quickly changing nature of the global health crisis that appears to be turning into a global trade and economic crisis whose effects on the global economy are escalating .

as the economic effects of the pandemic grow , policymakers are giving more weight to policies that address the immediate economic effects at the expense of longer - term considerations such as debt accumulation .

initially , many policymakers had felt constrained in their ability to respond to the crisis as a result of limited flexibility for monetary and fiscal support within conventional standards , given the broad - based synchronized slowdown in global economic growth , especially in manufacturing and trade that had developed prior to the viral outbreak .

the pandemic is also affecting global politics as world leaders are cancelling international meetings , competing for medical supplies , and some nations reportedly are stoking conspiracy theories that shift blame to other countries .

initially , the economic effects of the virus were expected to be short - term supply issues as factory output fell because workers were quarantined to reduce the spread of the virus through social interaction .

the drop in economic activity , initially in china , has had international repercussions as firms experienced delays in supplies of intermediate and finished goods through supply chains .

concerns are growing , however , that virus - related supply shocks are creating more prolonged and wide - ranging demand shocks as reduced activity by consumers and businesses leads to a lower rate of economic growth .

as demand shocks unfold , businesses experience reduced activity and profits and potentially escalating and binding credit and liquidity constraints .

while manufacturing firms are experiencing supply chain shocks , reduced consumer activity through social distancing is affecting the services sector of the economy , which accounts for two - thirds of annual u.s. economic output .

in this environment , manufacturing and service firms have tended to hoard cash , which affects market liquidity .

in response , central banks have lowered interest rates where possible and expanded lending facilities to provide liquidity to financial markets and to firms potentially facing insolvency .

the longer the economic effects persist , the greater the economic impacts are likely to be as the effects are spread through trade and financial linkages to an ever - broadening group of countries , firms and households .

these growing economic effects potentially increase liquidity constraints and credit market tightening in global financial markets as firms hoard cash , with negative fallout effects on economic growth .

at the same time , financial markets are factoring in an increase in government bond issuance in the united states , europe , and elsewhere as government debt levels are set to rise to meet spending obligations during an expected economic recession and increased fiscal spending to fight the effects of covid - 19 .

unlike the 2008-2009 financial crisis , reduced demand by consumers , labor market issues , and a reduced level of activity among businesses , rather than risky trading by global banks , has led to corporate credit issues and potential insolvency .

these market dynamics have led some observers to question if these events mark the beginning of a full - scale global financial crisis .

liquidity and credit market issues present policymakers with a different set of challenges than addressing supply - side constraints .

as a result , the focus of government policy has expanded from a health crisis to macroeconomic and financial market issues that are being addressed through a combination of monetary , fiscal , and other policies , including border closures , quarantines , and restrictions on social interactions .

essentially , while businesses are attempting to address worker and output issues at the firm level , national leaders are attempting to implement fiscal policies to prevent economic growth from falling sharply by assisting workers and businesses that are facing financial strains , and central bankers are adjusting monetary policies to address mounting credit market issues .

in the initial stages of the health crisis , households did not experience the same kind of wealth losses they saw during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the value of their primary residence dropped sharply .

however , with unemployment numbers rising rapidly , job losses could result in defaults on mortgages and delinquencies on rent payments , unless financial institutions provide loan forbearance or there is a mechanism to provide financial assistance .

in turn , mortgage defaults could negatively affect the market for mortgage - backed securities , the availability of funds for mortgages , and negatively affect the overall rate of economic growth .

losses in the value of most equity markets in the u.s. , asia , and europe could also affect household wealth , especially that of retirees living on a fixed income and others who own equities .

investors that trade in mortgage - backed securities reportedly have been reducing their holdings while the federal reserve has been attempting to support the market .

in the current environment , even traditional policy tools , such as monetary accommodation , apparently have not been processed by markets in a traditional manner , with equity market indices displaying heightened , rather than lower , levels of uncertainty following the federal reserve's cut in interest rates .

such volatility is adding to uncertainties about what governments can do to address weaknesses in the global economy .

between late february and early may , 2020 , financial markets from the united states to asia and europe have been whipsawed as investors have grown concerned that covid - 19 would create a global economic and financial crisis with few metrics to indicate how prolonged and extensive the economic effects may be .

investors have searched for safe - haven investments , such as the benchmark u.s. treasury 10-year security , which experienced a historic drop in yield to below 1% on march 3 , 2020 .

in response to concerns that the global economy was in a freefall , the federal reserve lowered key interest rates on march 3 , 2020 , to shore up economic activity , while the bank of japan engaged in asset purchases to provide short - term liquidity to japanese banks ; japan's government indicated it would also assist workers with wage subsidies .

the bank of canada also lowered its key interest rate .

the international monetary fund ( imf ) announced that it was making about $50 billion available through emergency financing facilities for low - income and emerging market countries and through funds available in its catastrophe containment and relief trust ( ccrt ) .

reflecting investors' uncertainties , the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) lost about one - third of its value between february 14 , 2020 , and march 23 , 2020 , as indicated in figure 3 .

expectations that the u.s. congress would adopt a $2.0 trillion spending package moved the djia up by more than 11% on march 24 , 2020 .

from march 23 to april 15 , the djia moved higher by18% , paring its initial losses by half .

since then , the djia has moved erratically as investors have weighed news about the human cost and economic impact of the pandemic and the prospects of various medical treatments .

for some policymakers , the drop in equity prices has raised concerns that foreign investors might attempt to exploit the situation by increasing their purchases of firms in sectors considered important to national security .

for instance , ursula von der leyen , president of the european commission , urged eu members to better screen foreign investments , especially in areas such as health , medical research , and critical infrastructure .

similar to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis , central banks have implemented a series of monetary operations to provide liquidity to their economies .

these actions , however , initially were not viewed entirely positively by all financial market participants who questioned the use of policy tools by central banks that are similar to those employed during the 2008-2009 financial crisis , despite the fact that the current and previous crisis are fundamentally different in origin .

during the previous financial crisis , central banks intervened to restart credit and spending by banks that had engaged in risky assets .

in the current environment , central banks are attempting to address financial market volatility and prevent large - scale corporate insolvencies that reflect the underlying economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic .

similar to conditions during the 2008-2009 financial crisis , the dollar has emerged as the preferred currency by investors , reinforcing its role as the dominant global reserve currency .

as indicated in figure 4 , the dollar appreciated more than 3.0% during the period between march 3 and march 13 , 2020 , reflecting increased international demand for the dollar and dollar - denominated assets .

since the highs reached on march 23 , the dollar has given up some of its value against other currencies , but has remained about 10% higher than it was at the beginning of the year .

according to a recent survey by the bank for international settlements ( bis ) , the dollar accounts for 88% of global foreign exchange market turnover and is key in funding an array of financial transactions , including serving as an invoicing currency to facilitate international trade .

it also accounts for two - thirds of central bank foreign exchange holdings , half of non - u.s. banks foreign currency deposits , and two - thirds of non - u.s. corporate borrowings from banks and the corporate bond market .

as a result , disruptions in the smooth functioning of the global dollar market can have wide - ranging repercussions on international trade and financial transactions .

the international role of the dollar also increases pressure on the federal reserve essentially to assume the lead role as the global lender of last resort .

reminiscent of the financial crisis , the global economy has experienced a period of dollar shortage , requiring the federal reserve to take numerous steps to ensure the supply of dollars to the u.s. and global economies , including activating existing currency swap arrangements , establishing such arrangements with additional central banks , and creating new financial facilities to provide liquidity to central banks and monetary authorities .

typically , banks lend long - term and borrow short - term and can only borrow from their home central bank .

in turn , central banks can only provide liquidity in their own currency .

consequently , a bank can become illiquid in a panic , meaning it cannot borrow in private markets to meet short - term cash flow needs .

swap lines are designed to allow foreign central banks the funds necessary to provide needed liquidity to their country's banks in dollars .

in response to growing concerns over the global economic impact of the pandemic , g - 7 finance ministers and central bankers released a statement on march 3 , 2020 , indicating they will "use all appropriate policy tools" to sustain economic growth .

the finance ministers also pledged fiscal support to ensure health systems can sustain efforts to fight the outbreak .

in most cases , however , countries have pursued their own divergent strategies , in some cases including banning exports of medical equipment .

following the g - 7 statement , the u.s. federal reserve ( fed ) lowered its federal funds rate by 50 basis points , or 0.5% , to a range of 1.0% to 1.25% due to concerns about the "evolving risks to economic activity of the covid - 19. .

at the time , the cut was the largest one - time reduction in the interest rate by the fed since the global financial crisis .

after a delayed response , other central banks have begun to follow the actions of the g - 7 countries .

most central banks have lowered interest rates and acted to increase liquidity in their financial systems through a combination of measures , including lowering capital buffers and reserve requirements , creating temporary lending facilities for banks and businesses , and easing loan terms .

in addition , national governments have adopted various fiscal measures to sustain economic activity .

in general , these measures include making payments directly to households , temporarily deferring tax payments , extending unemployment insurance , and increasing guarantees and loans to businesses .

see the appendix to this report for detailed information about the policy actions by individual governments .

among most developed and major developing economies , economic growth at the beginning of 2020 was tepid , but still was estimated to be positive .

countries highly dependent on tradeâcanada , germany , italy , japan , mexico , and south koreaâand commodity exporters are now projected to be the most negatively affected by the slowdown in economic activity associated with the virus .

in addition , travel bans and quarantines are taking a heavy economic toll on a broad range of countries .

the oecd notes that production declines in china have spillover effects around the world given china's role in producing computers , electronics , pharmaceuticals and transport equipment , and as a primary source of demand for many commodities .

across asia , some forecasters argue that recent data indicate that japan , south korea , thailand , the philippines , indonesia , malaysia , and vietnam could experience an economic recession in 2020 .

in early january 2020 , before the covid - 19 outbreak , economic growth in developing economies as a whole was projected by the international monetary fund ( imf ) to be slightly more positive than in 2019 .

this outlook was based on progress being made in u.s. - china trade talks that were expected to roll back some tariffs and an increase in india's rate of growth .

growth rates in latin america and the middle east were also projected to be positive in 2020 .

these projections likely will be revised downward due to the slowdown in global trade associated with covid - 19 , lower energy and commodity prices , an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar , and other secondary effects that could curtail growth .

commodity exporting countries , in particular , likely will experience a greater slowdown in growth than forecasted in earlier projections as a result of a slowdown on trade with china and lower commodity prices .

the combined impact of covid - 19 , an increase in the value of the dollar , and an oil price war between saudi arabia and russia are hitting developing and emerging economies hard .

not all of these countries have the resources or policy flexibility to respond effectively .

according to figures compiled by the institute for international finance ( iif ) , cumulative capital outflows from developing countries since january 2020 are double the level experienced during the 2008 / 2009 crisis and substantially higher than recent market events ( figure 8 ) .

the impact of the price war and lower energy demand associated with a covid - 19-related economic slowdown is especially hard on oil and gas exporters , some of whose currencies are at record lows ( figure 9 ) .

oil importers , such as south africa and turkey , have also been hit hard ; south africa's rand has fallen 18% against the dollar since the beginning of 2020 and the turkish lira has lost 8.5% .

some economists are concerned that the depreciation in currencies could lead to rising rates of inflation by pushing up the prices of imports and negatively economic growth rates in 2020 .

depending on individual levels of foreign exchange reserves and the duration of the capital flow slowdown , some countries may have sufficient buffers to weather the slowdown , while others will likely need to make some form of current account adjustment ( reduce spending , raise taxes , etc. ) .

several countries , such as iran and venezuela , have already asked the imf for financial assistance and others are likely to follow .

 ( venezuela's request was quickly rebuffed due to disagreement among the imf membership over who is recognized as venezuela's legitimate leader: nicolã¡s maduro or juan guaidã³. ) .

initial efforts at coordinating the economic response to the covid - 19 pandemic across countries have been uneven .

governments are divided over the appropriate response and in some cases have acted unilaterally , particularly when closing borders and imposing export restrictions on medical equipment and medicine .

an emergency meeting of g - 7 ( canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united kingdom , and the united states ) finance ministers on march 3 , 2020 , fell short of the aggressive and concrete coordinated action that investors and economists had been hoping for , and u.s. and european stock markets fell sharply after the meeting .

however , on march 16 , 2020 , the leaders of the g - 7 countries held an emergency summit by teleconference to discuss and coordinate their policy responses to the economic fallout from the global spread of covid - 19 .

in the joint statement released by the g - 7 leaders after the emergency teleconference summit , the leaders stressed they are committed to doing "whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response through closer cooperation and enhanced cooperation of efforts. .

the countries pledged to coordinate research efforts , increase the availability of medical equipment ; mobilize "the full range" of policy instruments , including monetary and fiscal measures , as well as targeted actions to support workers , companies , and sectors most affected by the spread of covid - 19 ; task the finance ministers to coordinate on a weekly basis , and direct the imf and the world bank group , as well as other international organizations , to support countries worldwide as part of a coordinated global response .

g - 7 coordination has not been without problems , however , including disagreement among g - 7 foreign affairs ministers about how to refer to the virus ( coronavirus or the "wuhan virus" ) and concerns about collaboration on vaccine research .

the g - 20 , which has a broader membership of major advanced and emerging - market economies representing 85% of world gdp , was slower to respond to the pandemic .

even though g - 20 coordination is widely viewed as critical in the response to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 , several factors may have complicated g - 20 coordination in the current context: the trump administration's prioritization of an "america first" foreign policy over one committed to multilateralism ; the 2020 chair of the g - 20 , saudi arabia , is embroiled in its own domestic political issues and oil price war ; and u.s. - china tensions make g - 20 consensus more difficult .

the g - 20 held a summit by teleconference on march 26 , 2020 , but the resulting communique was criticized for failing to include concrete action items beyond what national governments were already doing .

however , g - 20 coordination appears to be gaining momentum , most notably with the g - 20 agreement on debt relief for low - income countries ( see " looming debt crises and debt relief efforts " ) .

meanwhile , international organizations including the imf and multilateral development banks , have tried to forge ahead with economic support given their current resources .

additionally , the financial stability board ( fsb ) , an international body including the united states that monitors the global financial system and makes regulations to ensure stability , released a statement on march 20 , 2020 , that its members are actively cooperating to maintain financial stability during market stress related to covid - 19 .

the fsb is encouraging governments to use flexibility within existing international standards to provide continued access to funding for market participants and for businesses and households facing temporary difficulties from covid - 19 , while noting that many fsb members have already taken action to release available capital and liquidity buffers .

covid - 19 could trigger a wave of defaults around the world .

in q3 2019âbefore the outbreak of covid - 19âglobal debt levels reached an all - time high of nearly $253 trillion , about 320% of global gdp .

about 70% of global debt is held by advanced economies and about 30% is held by emerging markets .

globally , most debt is held by nonfinancial corporations ( 29% ) , governments ( 27% ) and financial corporations ( 24% ) , followed by households ( 19% ) .

debt in emerging markets has nearly doubled since 2010 , primarily driven by borrowing from state - owned enterprises .

high debt levels make borrowers vulnerable to shocks that disrupt revenue and inflows of new financing .

the disruption in economic activity associated with covid - 19 is a wide - scale exogenous shock that will make it significantly more difficult for many private borrowers ( corporations and households ) and public borrowers ( governments ) around the world to repay their debts .

covid - 19 has hit the revenue of corporations in a range of industries: factories are ceasing production , brick - and - mortar retail stores and restaurants are closing , commodity prices have plunged ( bloomberg commodity price indexâa basket of oil , metals , and food pricesâhas dropped 27% since the start of the year and is now at its lowest level since 1986 ) , and overseas and in some cases domestic travel is being curtailed .

households are facing a rapid increase in unemployment and , in many developing countries , a decline in remittances .

with fewer resources , corporations and households may default on their debts , absent government intervention .

these defaults will result in a decline in bank assets , making it difficult for banks to extend new loans during the crisis or , more severely , creating solvency problems for banks .

meanwhile , many governments are dramatically increasing spending to combat the pandemic , and are likely to face sharp reductions in revenue , putting pressure on public finances and raising the likelihood of sovereign ( government ) defaults .

debt dynamics are particularly problematic in emerging economies , where debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies ( usually u.s. dollars ) .

many emerging market currencies have depreciated since the outbreak of the pandemic , raising the value of their debts in terms of local currency .

governments will face difficult choices if there is a widespread wave of defaults .

most governments have signaled a commitment to or already implemented policies to support those economically impacted by the pandemic .

these governments face decisions about the type of assistance to provide ( loans versus direct payments ) , the amount of assistance to provide , how to allocate rescue funds , and what conditions if any to attach to funds .

governments have undertaken extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures to combat the crisis .

however , developing countries that are constrained by limited financial resources and where health systems could quickly become overloaded are particularly vulnerable .

in terms of defaults by governments ( sovereign defaults ) , emergency assistance is generally provided by the imf , and sometimes paired with additional rescue funds from other governments on a bilateral basis .

the imf and other potential donor countries will need to consider whether the imf has adequate resources to respond to the crisis , how to allocate funding if the demand for funding exceeds the amount available , what conditions should be attached to rescue funding , and whether imf programs should be paired with a restructuring of the government's debt ( "burden sharing" with private investors ) .

international efforts are underway to help the most vulnerable developing countries grapple with debt pressures .

in mid - april 2020 , the imf tapped its catastrophe containment and relief trust ( crrt ) , funded by donor countries , to provide grants to cover the debt payments of 25 poor and vulnerable countries to the imf for six months .

the imf hopes that additional donor contributions will allow this debt service relief to be extended for two years .

additionally , the g - 20 finance ministers agreed to suspend debt service payments for the world's poorest countries through the end of 2020 .

the institute for international economics , which represents 450 banks , hedge funds , and other global financial funds , also announced that private creditors will join the debt relief effort on a voluntary basis .

this debt standstill will free up more than $20 billion for these countries to spend on improving their health systems and fighting the pandemic .

private sector commitments were critical for official creditors , so that developing countries could redirect funds to improving health systems rather than repaying private creditors .

public concerns over the spread of the virus have led to self - quarantines , reductions in airline and cruise liner travel , the closing of such institutions as the louvre , and the rescheduling of theatrical releases of movies , including the sequel in the iconic james bond series ( titled , "no time to die" ) .

school closures are affecting 1.5 billion children worldwide , challenging parental leave policies .

other countries are limiting the size of public gatherings .

some businesses are considering new approaches to managing their workforces and work methods .

these techniques build on , or in some places replace , such standard techniques as self - quarantines and travel bans .

some firms are adopting an open - leave policy to ensure employees receive sick pay if they are , or suspect they are , infected .

other firms are adopting paid sick leave policies to encourage sick employees to stay home and are adopting remote working policies .

microsoft and amazon have instructed all of their seattle - based employees to work from home until the end of march 2020 .

the drop in business and tourist travel is causing a sharp drop in scheduled airline flights by as much as 10% ; airlines are estimating they could lose $113 billion in 2020 ( an estimate that could prove optimistic given the trump administration's announced restrictions on flights from europe to the united states and the growing list of countries that are similarly restricting flights ) , while airports in europe estimate they could lose $4.3 billion in revenue due to fewer flights .

industry experts estimate that many airlines will be in bankruptcy by may 2020 under current conditions as a result of travel restrictions imposed by a growing number of countries .

the loss of chinese tourists is another economic blow to countries in asia and elsewhere that have benefitted from the growing market for chinese tourists and the stimulus such tourism has provided .

the decline in industrial activity has reduced demand for energy products such as crude oil , causing prices to drop sharply , which negatively affects energy producers , renewable energy producers , and electric vehicle manufacturers , but generally is positive for consumers and businesses .

saudi arabia is pushing other opec ( organization of the petroleum exporting countries ) members collectively to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels a day to raise market prices .

u.s. shale oil producers , who are not represented by opec , support the move to raise prices .

an unwillingness by russia to agree to output reductions added to other downward pressures on oil prices and caused saudi arabia to engage in a price war with russia that has driven oil prices below $25 per barrel at times , half the estimated $50 per barrel break - even point for most oil producing countries .

rising oil supplies and falling demand are combining to create an estimated surplus of 25 million barrels a day and could soon overwhelm storage capacity and challenge the viability of u.s. shale oil production .

in 2019 , low energy prices combined with high debt levels reportedly caused u.s. energy producers to reduce their spending on capital equipment , reduced their profits and , in some cases , led to bankruptcies .

reportedly , in late 2019 and early 2020 , bond and equity investors , as well as banks , reduced their lending to shale oil producers and other energy producers that typically use oil and gas reserves as collateral .

disruptions to industrial activity in china reportedly are causing delays in shipments of computers , cell phones , toys , and medical equipment .

factory output in china , the united states , japan , and south korea all declined in the first months of 2020 .

reduced chinese agricultural exports , including to japan , are leading to shortages in some commodities .

in addition , numerous auto producers are facing shortages in parts and other supplies that have been sourced in china .

reductions in international trade have also affected ocean freight prices .

some freight companies argue that they could be forced to shutter if prices do not rebound quickly .

disruptions in the movements of goods and people reportedly are causing some companies to reassess how international they want their supply chains to be .

according to some estimates , nearly every member of the fortune 1000 is being affected by disruptions in production in china .

the quickly evolving nature of the covid - 19 crisis creates a number of issues that make it difficult to estimate the full cost to global economic activity .

these issues include , but are not limited to how long will the crisis last ? .

how many workers will be affected both temporarily and permanently ? .

how many countries will be infected and how much economic activity will be reduced ? .

when will the economic effects peak ? .

how much economic activity will be lost as a result of the viral outbreak ? .

what are the most effective monetary and fiscal policies at the national and global level to address the crisis ? .

what temporary and permanent effects will the crisis have on how businesses organize their work forces ? .

many of the public health measures taken by countries such as italy , taiwan , south korea , hong kong , and china have sharply impacted their economies ( with plant closures , travel restrictions , and so forth ) .

how are the tradeoffs between public health and the economic impact of policies to contain the spread of the virus being weighed ? .

initial efforts at coordinating the economic response to the covid - 19 pandemic across countries have been uneven .

governments are divided over the appropriate response and in some cases have acted unilaterally , particularly when closing borders and imposing export restrictions on medical equipment and medicine .

an emergency meeting of g - 7 ( canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united kingdom , and the united states ) finance ministers on march 3 , 2020 , fell short of the aggressive and concrete coordinated action that investors and economists had been hoping for , and u.s. and european stock markets fell sharply after the meeting .

however , on march 16 , 2020 , the leaders of the g - 7 countries held an emergency summit by teleconference to discuss and coordinate their policy responses to the economic fallout from the global spread of covid - 19 .

in the joint statement released by the g - 7 leaders after the emergency teleconference summit , the leaders stressed they are committed to doing "whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response through closer cooperation and enhanced cooperation of efforts. .

g - 7 coordination has not been without problems , however , including disagreement among g - 7 foreign affairs ministers about how to refer to the virus ( coronavirus or the "wuhan virus" ) and concerns about collaboration on vaccine research .

the g - 20 , which has a broader membership of major advanced and emerging - market economies representing 85% of world gdp , was slower to respond to the pandemic .

even though g - 20 coordination is widely viewed as critical in the response to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 , several factors may have complicated g - 20 coordination in the current context: the trump administration's prioritization of an "america first" foreign policy over one committed to multilateralism ; the 2020 chair of the g - 20 , saudi arabia , is embroiled in its own domestic political issues and oil price war ; and u.s. - china tensions make g - 20 consensus more difficult .

the g - 20 held a summit by teleconference on march 26 , 2020 , but the resulting communique was criticized for failing to include concrete action items beyond what national governments were already doing .

however , g - 20 coordination appears to be gaining momentum , most notably with the g - 20 agreement on debt relief for low - income countries ( see " looming debt crises and debt relief efforts " ) .

meanwhile , international organizations including the imf and multilateral development banks , have tried to forge ahead with economic support given their current resources .

additionally , the financial stability board ( fsb ) , an international body including the united states that monitors the global financial system and makes regulations to ensure stability , released a statement on march 20 , 2020 , that its members are actively cooperating to maintain financial stability during market stress related to covid - 19 .

the fsb is encouraging governments to use flexibility within existing international standards to provide continued access to funding for market participants and for businesses and households facing temporary difficulties from covid - 19 , while noting that many fsb members have already taken action to release available capital and liquidity buffers .

covid - 19 could trigger a wave of defaults around the world .

in q3 2019âbefore the outbreak of covid - 19âglobal debt levels reached an all - time high of nearly $253 trillion , about 320% of global gdp .

about 70% of global debt is held by advanced economies and about 30% is held by emerging markets .

globally , most debt is held by nonfinancial corporations ( 29% ) , governments ( 27% ) and financial corporations ( 24% ) , followed by households ( 19% ) .

debt in emerging markets has nearly doubled since 2010 , primarily driven by borrowing from state - owned enterprises .

high debt levels make borrowers vulnerable to shocks that disrupt revenue and inflows of new financing .

the disruption in economic activity associated with covid - 19 is a wide - scale exogenous shock that will make it significantly more difficult for many private borrowers ( corporations and households ) and public borrowers ( governments ) around the world to repay their debts .

covid - 19 has hit the revenue of corporations in a range of industries: factories are ceasing production , brick - and - mortar retail stores and restaurants are closing , commodity prices have plunged ( bloomberg commodity price indexâa basket of oil , metals , and food pricesâhas dropped 27% since the start of the year and is now at its lowest level since 1986 ) , and overseas and in some cases domestic travel is being curtailed .

households are facing a rapid increase in unemployment and , in many developing countries , a decline in remittances .

with fewer resources , corporations and households may default on their debts , absent government intervention .

these defaults will result in a decline in bank assets , making it difficult for banks to extend new loans during the crisis or , more severely , creating solvency problems for banks .

meanwhile , many governments are dramatically increasing spending to combat the pandemic , and are likely to face sharp reductions in revenue , putting pressure on public finances and raising the likelihood of sovereign ( government ) defaults .

debt dynamics are particularly problematic in emerging economies , where debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies ( usually u.s. dollars ) .

many emerging market currencies have depreciated since the outbreak of the pandemic , raising the value of their debts in terms of local currency .

governments will face difficult choices if there is a widespread wave of defaults .

most governments have signaled a commitment to or already implemented policies to support those economically impacted by the pandemic .

these governments face decisions about the type of assistance to provide ( loans versus direct payments ) , the amount of assistance to provide , how to allocate rescue funds , and what conditions if any to attach to funds .

governments have undertaken extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures to combat the crisis .

however , developing countries that are constrained by limited financial resources and where health systems could quickly become overloaded are particularly vulnerable .

in terms of defaults by governments ( sovereign defaults ) , emergency assistance is generally provided by the imf , and sometimes paired with additional rescue funds from other governments on a bilateral basis .

the imf and other potential donor countries will need to consider whether the imf has adequate resources to respond to the crisis , how to allocate funding if the demand for funding exceeds the amount available , what conditions should be attached to rescue funding , and whether imf programs should be paired with a restructuring of the government's debt ( "burden sharing" with private investors ) .

international efforts are underway to help the most vulnerable developing countries grapple with debt pressures .

in mid - april 2020 , the imf tapped its catastrophe containment and relief trust ( crrt ) , funded by donor countries , to provide grants to cover the debt payments of 25 poor and vulnerable countries to the imf for six months .

the imf hopes that additional donor contributions will allow this debt service relief to be extended for two years .

additionally , the g - 20 finance ministers agreed to suspend debt service payments for the world's poorest countries through the end of 2020 .

the institute for international economics , which represents 450 banks , hedge funds , and other global financial funds , also announced that private creditors will join the debt relief effort on a voluntary basis .

this debt standstill will free up more than $20 billion for these countries to spend on improving their health systems and fighting the pandemic .

private sector commitments were critical for official creditors , so that developing countries could redirect funds to improving health systems rather than repaying private creditors .
