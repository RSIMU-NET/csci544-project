fiscal year 2015 ( fy2015 ) is the fourth consecutive year for which discretionary appropriations for the department of defense ( dod ) are subject to a legally binding cap on national defense - related spending , initially codified by p.l .

112-25 , the budget control act of 2011 ( or bca ) and subsequently modified , most recently by p.l .

113-67 , the bipartisan budget act ( bba ) of 2013 .

president obama's fy2015 dod budget request complied with the applicable cap as did the versions of the fy2015 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) that were passed by the house ( h.r .

4435 ) , reported by the senate armed services committee ( s. 2410 ) , and enacted into law ( h.r .

3979 ) .

similarly , the versions of the fy2015 defense appropriations act passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee ( h.r .

4870 ) and the version enacted as part of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 ( h.r .

83 , division c ) all were consistent with the defense spending cap then in force ( i.e. , bba's cap for fy2015 ) .

by contrast , congressional action on the fy2014 dod budget had been prolonged by the fact that the administration's dod budget request for that year exceeded the spending cap then in force , as did the fy2014 defense funding bills reported by the armed services and appropriations committees of both the house and senate .

for dod's fy2015 "base budget" — that is , the annual budget exclusive of war - related costs — the administration requested $495.6 billion in discretionary budget authority .

combined with the amounts requested for national defense - related activities carried out by other agencies , including the fbi and the department of energy , the administration requested a total of $522.6 billion for national defense related spending — a total that complies with the fy2015 cap on national defense discretionary budget authority set by the bba .

although the president's fy2015 budget request for dod complied with the fy2015 cap , he also requested an additional $27.7 billion in defense - related spending ( including $26.4 billion for dod ) as part of package called the opportunity , growth , and security initiative ( ogsi ) .

if those additional funds were appropriated , the current fy2015 defense cap would be exceeded .

in that case , unless current law was amended , appropriations would be reduced to the level of the cap by a process of across - the - board reductions called "sequestration. .

moreover , for each year from fy2016 through fy2019 , the administration's projected dod budget requests would exceed the statutory defense spending cap for that year by an average of nearly $31 billion annually ( see table 7 ) .

excluding war - related costs , president obama's fy2015 budget request for national defense - related activities ( comprising budget function 050 ) amounts to $522.6 billion in discretionary budget authority .

this so - called "base budget" ( i.e. , non - war cost ) amount is consistent with the defense spending cap established by p.l .

113-67 , the bipartisan budget act ( bba ) of 2013 , which raised the bca spending caps for fy2014 and fy2015 ( see table 3 ) .

within the overall fy2015 national defense budget request for discretionary spending , the base budget for dod military activities is $495.6 billion .

 ( table 4 ) consistent with national defense budgets in recent years , the dod request thus amounts to roughly 95% of the discretionary national defense - related base budget for fy2015 .

in addition to funding for dod , the fy2015 discretionary base budget request for function 050 also includes $18.0 billion for defense - related nuclear energy activities conducted by the department of energy , the largest share of which is $8.3 billion for activities related to nuclear weapons .

other major components of the defense - related nuclear energy budget include $4.9 billion for environmental cleanup at defense nuclear sites , $1.6 billion for nuclear non - proliferation work , and $1.4 billion for work on nuclear reactors that power navy ships .

the remaining $8.0 billion of the fy2015 base budget request for function 050 is for defense - related activities conducted by other agencies .

of this amount , the largest single component — $4.9 billion — would go to the fbi for counterintelligence operations .

the president's fy2015 request of $495.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for dod's base budget is lower than the corresponding fy2014 appropriation by less than $400 million .

if congress were to approve funding at that level , fy2015 would be the third consecutive year in which dod's base budget hovered at between $495 billion and $496 billion after having dropped between fy2012 and fy2013 by $35 billion , in nominal terms ( that is , without taking account of inflation ) .

the 7% reduction in dod's base budget in fy2013 was part of the government - wide spending reduction program initiated by the 2011 bca .

 ( see figure 3 . ) .

based on dod's method of adjusting for the cost of inflation , the fy2015 base budget request is 1.8% below the fy2014 appropriation in real terms .

it is about 19% lower , adjusting for inflation , than dod's budget in 1985 , which marked the peak year ( in real terms ) of the reagan - era cold war buildup .

but it is slightly more than 1% higher in real terms than the average ( mean ) dod budget since the end of the vietnam war ( 1975-2015 ) and 23% higher than the fy2000 budget , the last one enacted before the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .

according to administration officials , the $495.6 billion request for discretionary budget authority in dod's base budget was intended support the national strategy outlined in dod's 2014 quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) published concurrently with the funding request .

in general terms , the request was presented as an effort to accommodate both changing security requirements and more constrained budgets by reducing the size of the force — particularly the army and marine corps — while modernizing the force and keeping it trained for a broader range of missions .

following are some major themes of the administration's fy2015 base budget request .

the versions of the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fy2015 that were passed by the house on may 25 , 2014 ( h.r .

4435 ) and reported on june 2 , 2014 , by the senate armed services committee ( s. 2410 ) each would have authorized total dod base budget appropriations that would have exceeded the administration's base budget request by less than $500 million .

the base budget authorized by h.r .

3979 — the version of the ndaa that was cleared for the president on december 8 , 2014 — fell between the house and senate versions of the bill , authorizing $495.9 billion , which is $347 million more than the administration requested .

 ( see table 11 . ) .

authorized funding levels for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) in the house - passed , senate committee reported , and final versions of the fy2015 ndaa are not comparable .

the administration's original fy2015 budget request included $79.4 billion for oco , but that amount — which was identical with dod's enacted fy2014 oco appropriation — was specifically described as a placeholder that would be replaced with an updated request once decisions were made about the number of u.s. troops slated to remain in afghanistan through fy2015 .

before the administration submitted its revised oco request , the house passed h.r .

4435 , which would have authorized the placeholder oco amount , and the senate armed services committee reported s. 2410 , which would have provided a blanket authorization for oco appropriations without specifying the amount .

house and senate negotiators drafting h.r .

3979 took account of total fy2015 oco funding requests totaling $63.7 billion , which the administration submitted in three parts: on june 26 , 2014 , it requested $53.7 billion for operations associated with afghanistan and iraq plus $4.0 billion for a counterterrorism partnerships fund and $925 million for a european reassurance initiative to signal u.s. support for countries unsettled by russia's occupation of ukrainian territory .

on november 5 , 2014 , it requested $112 million for the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) to develop vaccines and other technologies relevant to the effort to combat the ebola virus .

and on november 10 , 2014 , it requested $5.0 billion for operations against the islamic state .

the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act for fy2015 ( h.r .

83 , codified as p.l .

113-235 ) incorporates as division c the fy2015 defense appropriations act which appropriates $483.7 billion for dod's fy2015 base budget .

compared with the administration's $484.3 billion request for base budget programs funded in that bill , this amounts to a reduction of $548 million — slightly more than 1 / 1000th of 1% .

 ( see table 19 . ) .

within those similar gross totals , however , the budget request and the enacted bill have some significant differences .

the bill — like the companion fy2015 ndaa — either rejects outright or defers a decision on several cost reduction initiatives proposed by the administration .

at the same time , it appropriates billions of dollars for weapons programs and "readiness" improvements that were not included in the budget request .

those added costs , in turn , are offset — in part — by reductions which , according to the bill's authors , reflect fact - of - life developments and will have no adverse impact on dod programs .

the cost of the congressional additions ( in the base budget ) is further offset by the fact that some other costs are shifted into the part of the bill that funds war costs ( or overseas contingency operations — oco ) , and thus are exempt from the statutory cap on discretionary spending .

 ( see " dod appropriations overview " , below. ) .

as is the case with the companion ndaa , the versions of h.r .

4870 passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee , as well as the enacted version of the bill ( ( h.r .

83 , division c ) rejects or deferrs several of the cost - reduction initiatives contained in the administration's budget request .

they all bar proposals for another round of military base closures , the retirement of various types of air force planes , the retirement of an aircraft carrier , and changes in the military commissary system .

on the other hand ( as with the authorization measure ) , the enacted version of the appropriations bill — like the senate version — allows some of the administration's other controversial proposals which the house bill would block: reductions in the rate of increase of military basic pay and of housing allowances .

 ( see table 20 . ) .

like both the house and senate versions of h.r .

4870 , the enacted version of h.r .

83 , division c would appropriate billions of dollars more than the budget requests for various purposes , with those gross increases offset by proposed cuts to the request .

 ( see table 21 . ) .

to compensate for the added cost of rejecting some administration - proposed savings and making some sizeable additions to the budget request , the house and senate versions of h.r .

4870 and the enacted version of h.r .

83 , division c incorporate several reductions , some of which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars .

while some of the proposed reductions are taken from the amounts requested for specific acquisition programs , others are justified on grounds that they reflected fact - of - life developments ( such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates ) and would have no adverse impact on dod's fy2015 activities .

in addition , some funds that were requested in the base budget are provided , in the final bill , as part of the oco budget , which is exempt from the statutory cap on discretionary defense appropriations .

 ( see table 22 . ) .

following are selected highlights of base budget issues in h.r .

83 , division c , the enacted version of the fy2015 defense appropriations bill .

to restrain the rate of increase in military compensation costs , the administration proposed: a 1% raise in military basic pay for all but the most senior personnel , rather than the 1.8% raise ( based on a labor department survey of wage increases in the private sector ) which would take effect under existing law unless some other rate of increase were mandated ; a gradual reduction in the rate at which housing allowances increase ; and the phasing - out over three years of the subsidy for military commissaries .

the house - passed bill rejected all three proposals , adding to the amount requested $533.3 million to pay for the larger pay increase , $244.7 million to restore the amount cut from the housing allowance , and $100.0 million for the commissary subsidy .

the senate bill concurred with the proposals for basic pay and housing while adding $200.0 million to sustain the commissary subsidy and requiring from dod additional information about commissary usage and the details of implementing the proposed change .

the final bill accepts the 1% raise in basic pay but adds to the request $88.0 million to partially restore the reduction in the housing allowance and $190 million for the commissary subsidy .

the senate version of h.r .

4870 would have added $507.0 million to $18.9 billion requested for the fy2015 accrual payment to the military retired pay fund , a payment that is calculated by pentagon actuaries to cover the anticipated future retired pay of currently active personnel .

the additional funds were to compensate for the fact that legislation enacted in february ( p.l .

113-82 ) nullified a provision of the 2013 balanced budget act ( p.l .

113-67 ) that reduced by one percentage point future annual cost of living increases in military retired pay .

the retired pay accrual payment in the budget request assumed the lower future retired pay increases that would have resulted if the bba provision had remained in force .

the enacted version of the appropriations bill adds $215.3 million to cover the retired pay accrual shortfall .

joint explanatory statement accompanying the final version of the appropriations bill cites revised personnel budget estimates as the basis for adding that amount .

in their reports on h.r .

4870 , the house and senate appropriations committees each expressed concern over the reported incidence of sexual assault in the military services .

each committee noted with approval the fact that the fy2014 omnibus appropriations act ( p.l .

113-76 ) added $25.0 million to the $25.1 million requested for dod's sexual assault prevention and response office ( sapro ) .

the additional funds were intended to expand the special victims counsel program , which provides legal representatives to provide advice and representation to sexual assault victims .

in order to further expand the special victims counsel program , the final version of the bill — like the senate version of h.r .

4870 — adds $25.0 million to the $25.1 million requested for sapro in the fy2015 budget ( section 8053 ) .

like the house version of h.r .

4870 , the final defense appropriations bill includes a provision ( section 8133 ) that would prohibit the proposed shift of apache attack helicopters from national guard units to active - duty army units .

but the ban was effective only until enactment of the fy2015 ndaa , which occurred within days of the enactment of the appropriations bill .

while the fy2015 ndaa bars transfer of any national guard apaches in fy2015 , it allows the transfer of up to 48 of the aircraft in fy2016 .

the senate version of h.r .

4870 included no ban on transferring the apaches to active component army units .

however , the senate bill would have added to the section of the bill providing oco funding $144.0 million for additional apaches to equip national guard units .

the final bill retains the $144.0 million for six apaches in the oco portion of the bill , but does not stipulate that the aircraft were intended to equip national guard units .

the enacted version of the bill — like the senate version of h.r .

4870 — adds to the request a total of $849.0 million to begin refueling and modernizing the carrier u.s.s .

george washington , as had long been scheduled to occur midway through the ship's planned 50-year operating life .

the house version of h.r .

4870 would have added $789.3 million for this purpose .

the administration's budget request would have deferred a choice between refueling the ship and retiring it .

however , on july 10 , 2014 , a senior navy official said that , in light of broad congressional support for keeping the ship in service , the navy would fund its refueling and modernization in the budget for fy2016 and future years .

the enacted appropriations bill would imposes conditions on the navy's plan to tie - up 11 aegis cruisers and three amphibious landing transports with the promise that the ships would be gradually updated and then put back into service to replace their sister ships that had remained in active service .

section 8105 of h.r .

83 , division c requires that no more than six of the ships be out of services at any one time , as did provisions of the house and senate versions of h.r .

4870 .

like the house version of the appropriations bill , the final bill requires that modernization of two cruisers begin in fy2015 and adds $540.0 million to a "ship modernization , operations , and sustainment fund," created by congress to modernize these ships and keep them in service .

according to the joint explanatory statement to accompany h.r .

83 , that fund has a balance of $1.4 billion ( not counting the added $540.0 million ) .

as reported by the house appropriations committee , h.r .

4870 would have raised no bar to air force plans to begin retiring the service's fleet of a - 10 ground attack aircraft .

but on june 19 , 2014 , the house adopted by a vote of 300-114 an amendment to the bill prohibiting the use of funds to retire any a - 10s in fy2015 .

the version of h.r .

4870 reported by the senate appropriations committee included no prohibition on a - 10 retirements .

however , it would have added to the budget a total of $325.7 million in the military personnel and o&m accounts of the air force , air force reserve and air national guard to continue operating the full complement of a - 10s through fy2015 .

the enacted bill includes a prohibition against retiring any a - 10s ( section 8141 ) and adds $337.1 million to continue operating the fleet in fy2015 .

congressional action on appropriations for selected ground combat vehicles is summarized in table a - 5 while action on selected communications systems is summarized in table a - 9 .

the enacted version of the bill — like both the house and senate versions of h.r .

4870 — adds funds to the amounts requested for the purchase of armored combat vehicles and for the upgrade of such vehicles already in the army's inventory .

the congressional defense committees have contended for years that the amounts budgeted for those programs are too small to sustain the network of specialized contractors and suppliers needed to develop and build tanks and other heavy combat vehicles .

h.r .

83 , division c adds: $28.5 million ( added to the $107.5 million requested ) to upgrade bradley armored troop carriers ; $72.0 million ( added to the $50.5 million requested ) to purchase additional armored "recovery vehicles" designed to tow disabled tanks off the battlefield ; and $120.0 million to continue a program to upgrade the communications , night vision equipment , and powerplants of m - 1 tanks — a program which congress has sustained for several years in the absence of administration funding requests .

congressional action on appropriations for selected shipbuilding programs is summarized in table a - 7 .

the enacted bill approves the budgets requested for most major shipbuilding programs with relatively minor reductions .

for example , of the $1.30 billion requested for the fy2015 increment of funding for an aircraft carrier ( expected to cost $11.5 billion by the time it enters service in 2023 ) , the bill provides all but $81.0 million , which it cut on grounds of unjustified "cost growth" in several components of the ship and in anticipation of unspecified "contracting efficiencies" .

by the same token , the final bill cuts $58.5 million from the $5.9 billion requested for nuclear - powered attack submarines , a reduction of about 1% that was attributed to "cost growth. .

of the amount approved , $3.53 billion would go to fund two of the ships and $2.30 billion would purchase long lead - time components to be used in future construction .

similarly , for ddg - 51-class destroyers equipped with the aegis anti - missile system , the final bill provides $2.66 billion for two ships , a reduction of $$9.5 million attributed to "cost growth. .

the house bill would have eliminated one of the three littoral combat ships ( lcss ) requested , cutting $475.7 million from the $1.43 billion requested .

but the enacted bill — like the senate version of h.r .

4870 — provides the amount requested and adds $80 million for long lead - time components to be used in lcss funded in future budgets .

the enacted bill also adds to the budget funds for two ships designed to carry combat troops and heavy equipment: $1.0 billion to cover roughly half the cost of an lpd 17-class amphibious landing transport , which would be the twelfth ship of that class ; and $200 million for a high - speed catamaran transport ( designated a jhsv ) which would be the eleventh of that class .

congressional action on appropriations for selected aircraft programs is summarized in table a - 11 .

following are other highlights .

the enacted bill appropriates the amounts requested to continue developing a new long - range bomber ( $913.7 million ) and to continue procurement of the kc - 46a refueling tanker ( $2.36 billion ) .

the tanker funds include $776.9 million to continue developing the plane — a modified version of the boeing 757 jetliner — and $1.58 billion to buy seven aircraft .

the budget request included a total of $7.96 billion for the f - 35 joint strike fighter program: $3.55 billion to buy 26 "a" model f - 35s for the air force ; $1.20 billion to buy six "c" model aircraft for the marine corps adapted for short takeoff / vertical landing ( stovl ) operations ; $610.7 million to buy two "b" model planes adapted to operate from aircraft carriers ; $465.2 million for long lead - time components for use in planes slated for purchase in future budgets ; $494.1 million for modifications to f - 35s purchased in earlier budgets ; and $1.64 billion to continue development of the three models of the aircraft .

the enacted bill provides a total of $8.24 billion for the f - 35 program , including additions of $255.0 million to buy two additional navy aircraft and $224.0 million for two additional planes of the air force version .

those additions , which mirror the house version of h.r .

4870 , are partly offset by several relatively minor reductions .

this increases the number of f - 35s funded in fy2015 to 40 aircraft .

the budget request did not include funds to continue production of the navy's ef - 18g growler , a version of the f / a - 18e / f fighter that is modified to jam enemy radars .

according to the house appropriations committee , recent navy studies conclude that it would be advantageous to increase from five to seven the number of growlers typically aboard a carrier .

in addition , sustaining the growler production line at the boeing plant in st. louis , mo , would facilitate the navy's purchase of additional f / a - 18e / f fighters , if the navy reduced its purchase of f - 35s because of the cost or technical problems .

the enacted bill adds to the budget $1.46 billion to buy 12 additional growlers and to keep the production line warm .

the house version of h.r .

4870 would have added $975.0 million and the senate version $1.30 billion for the same purpose .

the enacted fy2015 defense appropriations bill provides $65.17 billion for oco funding , $1.54 billion more than the amended oco request .

it includes three congressional additions costing more than $1.0 billion apiece: $2.9 billion for operations and maintenance ( o&m ) activities that dod included in its base budget request , but which the bill funds in oco accounts exempt from the statutory budget caps ; $1.0 billion ( section 9018 ) "for the purposes of improving military readiness," and $1.2 billion for equipment for the national guard and reserve components .

these additions are partly offset by several relative modest reductions and two relatively large ones: a reduction of $2.7 billion from the $4.0 billion requested for dod funding of the counterterrorism partnerships fund ( ctpf ) intended to build up the counterterrorism capacity of other governments ; and a reduction of $533.0 million justified on the basis that the army's request for oco military personnel funding was larger than required .

in addition to appropriating $1.3 billion of the $4.0 billion requested for the ctpf , the bill includes a provision ( section 8059 ) prohibiting the provision of training , equipment , or other assistance "to any unit of a foreign security service if the secretary of defense has credible information that the unit has committed a gross violation of human rights. .

the prohibition can be waived if the secretary of defense , after consultation with the secretary of state , concludes that a waiver is required because of "extraordinary circumstances. .

section 9016 of the enacted bill authorizes dod to use up to $500.0 million of the defense - wide o & m funds to train and equip syrian opposition groups that had been vetted for human right compliance .

both that section of the bill and section 9013 stipulate that nothing in the bill should be construed to authorize action relating to syria that would violate the war powers resolution .

in all , congress has appropriated for fy2015 a total of $985.0 million — $60.0 million more than the administration requested — for the european reassurance initiative , intended to fund countries that might be threatened by russian actions regarding the ukraine .

while the administration requested the funds as a single amount in the fy2015 defense appropriations bill ( which is division c of h.r .

83 ) , house and senate negotiators provided $175.0 million of the amount requested in the fy2015 appropriations bill that funds military construction , the department of veterans affairs and related agencies ( which is division i of h.r .

83 ) .

within the defense appropriations bill ( that is , division c of h.r .

83 ) , the enacted legislation provides: $635.0 million parceled out among oco funds for military personnel and o&m costs ; and $175.0 million in a fund to be used only for military assistance to estonia , latvia , lithuania , and ukraine .

the house passed h.r .

4870 , fy2015 dod appropriations bill , on june 20 , 2014 , by a vote of 340-73 .

following is a summary of house action on selected amendments considered during floor debate on the bill .
