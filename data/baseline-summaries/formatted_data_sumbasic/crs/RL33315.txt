money laundering is commonly understood as the process of cleansing the taint from the proceeds of crime .

in federal criminal law , however , it is more .

in the principal federal criminal money laundering statutes , 18 u.s.c .

§§ 1956 and 1957 , and to varying degrees in several other federal criminal statutes , money laundering involves the flow of resources to and from several hundred other federal , state , and foreign crimes .

it consists of: engaging in a financial transaction involving the proceeds of certain crimes in order to conceal the nature , source , or ownership of proceeds they produced ; engaging in a financial transaction involving the proceeds of certain crimes in order to promote further offenses ; transporting funds generated by certain criminal activities into , out of , or through the united states in order to promote further criminal activities , or to conceal the nature , source , or ownership of the criminal proceeds , or to evade reporting requirements ; engaging in a financial transaction involving criminal proceeds in order to evade taxes on the income produced by the illicit activity ; structuring financial transactions in order to evade reporting requirements ; spending more than $10,000 of the proceeds of certain criminal activities ; traveling in , or use of the facilities of , interstate or foreign commerce in order to distribute the proceeds of certain criminal activities ; traveling in , or use of the facilities of , interstate or foreign commerce in order to promote certain criminal activities ; transmitting the proceeds of , or funds to promote , criminal activity in the course of a money transmitting business ; transmitting funds in the course of an unlawful money transmitting business ; smuggling unreported cash across a u.s. border ; or failing to comply with the department of the treasury's anti - money laundering provisions .

money laundering in some forms is severely punished , sometimes more severely than the underlying crime with which it is associated .

the penalties frequently include not only long prison terms , but the confiscation of the property laundered , involved in the laundering , or traceable to the laundering .

the following is an overview of the elements and other legal attributes and consequences of a violation of sections 1956 and 1957 , as well as selected related federal criminal statutes .

section 1956 outlaws four kinds of laundering — promotional , concealment , structuring , and tax evasion — committed or attempted under one or more of three jurisdictional conditions ( i.e. , laundering involving certain financial transactions , laundering involving international transfers , and stings ) .

more precisely , section 1956 ( a ) ( 1 ) outlaws financial transactions involving the proceeds of other certain crimes — predicate offenses referred to as "specified unlawful activities" ( sometimes known as sua ) — committed or attempted ( 1 ) with the intent to promote further predicate offenses ; ( 2 ) with the intent to evade taxation ; ( 3 ) knowing the transaction is designed to conceal laundering of the proceeds ; or ( 4 ) knowing the transaction is designed to avoid anti - laundering reporting requirements .

section 1956 ( a ) ( 2 ) outlaws the international transportation or transmission ( or attempted transportation or transmission ) of funds ( 1 ) with the intent to promote a predicate offense ; ( 2 ) knowing that the purpose is to conceal laundering of the funds and knowing that the funds are the proceeds of a predicate offense ; or ( 3 ) knowing that the purpose is to avoid reporting requirements and knowing that the funds are the proceeds of a predicate offense .

section 1956 ( a ) ( 3 ) covers undercover investigations ( "stings" ) .

it outlaws financial transactions ( or attempted transactions ) that the defendant believes involve the proceeds of a predicate offense and that are intended to ( 1 ) promote a predicate offense , ( 2 ) conceal the source or ownership of the proceeds , or ( 3 ) avoid reporting requirements .

the travel act , 18 u.s.c .

§ 1952 , is one of the older members of the family of money laundering related criminal statutes .

while sections 1956 and 1957 punish transactions involving promoting , concealing , spending , and depositing tainted funds , the travel act punishes interstate or foreign travel ( or use of the facilities of interstate or foreign commerce ) conducted with the intent to ( 1 ) distribute the proceeds of a more modest list of predicate offenses ( "unlawful activity" ) , ( 2 ) promote or carry on such offenses when there is an overt act in furtherance of that intent , or ( 3 ) commit some violent act in their furtherance .

the first two variants bear some resemblance to the concealment and promotion offenses of section 1956 and somewhat more remotely to the deposit / spending proscriptions of section 1957 .

the violent crime component of the travel act is only coincidentally related to money laundering and consequently will be mentioned only in passing .

the travel act's elements cover anyone who: 1 .

a. travels in interstate or foreign commerce , or b. uses any facility in interstate or foreign commerce , or c. uses the mail 2. with intent a. to distribute the proceeds of an unlawful activity , i.e. , i. any business enterprise involving unlawful activities gambling , moonshining , drug dealing , or prostitution ; or ii .

extortion , bribery , or arson ; or iii .

any act which is indictable as money laundering ; or b. commit an act of violence to further an unlawful activity ; or c. to otherwise i. promote , ii .

manage , iii .

establish , iv .

carry on , or v. facilitate the promotion , management , establishment , or carrying on any unlawful activity ; and 3. thereafter a. distributes or attempts to distribute such proceeds , or b. commits or attempts to commit such act of violence , or c. promotes , manages , establishes , carries on , or facilitates the promotion , management , establishment , or carrying on such unlawful activities or attempts to do so .

section 5322 penalizes willful violation of several monetary transaction reporting requirements found primarily in title 31 of the united states code .

the section's coverage extends to violations of the following sections and their attendant regulations: - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5313 – financial institution reports of cash transactions involving $10,000 or more ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5314 – reports by persons in the u.s. of foreign financial agency transactions ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5316 – reports by any person taking $10,000 in cash out of the u.s. or bringing it in ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5318 – suspicious transaction reports by financial institutions ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5318a – special measures record keeping and reports by financial institutions relating to foreign counter - money laundering concerns ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5325 – reports by financial institutions issuing cashier's checks in amounts of $3000 or more ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5326 – cash transaction reports by financial institutions and / or various trades or businesses pursuant to treasury department geographical orders ; - 31 u.s.c .

§ 5331 – reports of trades and businesses other than financial institutions of cash transactions involving $10,000 or more ; - 12 u.s.c .

§ 1829b – record keeping requirements of federally insured depository institutions ; and - 12 u.s.c .

§ 1953 – record keeping by uninsured banks or similar institutions .

section 5322 does not cover violations of section 5315 ( relating to foreign currency transaction reports ) which are subject to the civil penalty provisions of 31 u.s.c .

§ 5321 or of section 5324 ( relating to structuring financial transactions ) which carries its own criminal penalties .

in order to establish "willful" violation of section 5322 , the government must prove that the accused knew that his breach of the statute was unlawful .

simple violations of section 5322 are punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years , a fine of not more than $250,000 , or both .

violations committed during the commission of another federal crime or as part of a pattern of illegal activity involving more than $100,000 over the course of a year are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years ; a fine of not more than $500,000 ( not more than $1 million for a special measures violation ( 31 u.s.c .

5318a ) ) or a violation involving a breach of due diligence with respect to private banking for foreign customers or foreign shell banks ( 31 u.s.c .

5318 ( i ) , ( j ) ) ; or both .

section 5322 is a travel act predicate offense .

it is also a rico predicate offense , but unlike most rico predicates is not a section 1956 or 1957 money laundering predicate offense .

property associated with violations of two of the sections within its coverage is subject to confiscation .

under section 5317 ( c ) , property becomes forfeitable when it is involved in , or traceable to , a violation of 31 u.s.c .

§ 5313 ( reports relating to cash transactions involving $10,000 or more ) or of 31 u.s.c .

§ 5316 ( reports relating to taking $10,000 or more out of the u.s. or to bring it into the u.s. ) .

the confiscation , however , may be subject to a constitutional limitation on excessive fine limitation .

in united states v. bajakajian , the supreme court held that the confiscation of $357,144 for a violation of 31 u.s.c .

5322 occasioned by a failure to comply with the reporting requirements of 31 u.s.c .

§ 5316 would constitute an unconstitutionally excessive fine — in the absence of evidence that the money was derived from , or destined to facilitate , some other criminal activity .

in later cases involving the failure to report transported cash , the courts have occasionally ordered confiscation of less than all of the unreported cash if the total was substantial and the cash was otherwise untainted .

in most instances , however , bajakajian appears to pose little obstacle to total or near total forfeiture .

structuring is organizing financial transactions or reports relating to financial transactions so as to evade reporting requirements , for example , by dividing a $12,000 bank deposit into three separate $4,000 deposits in order to evade the $10,000 reporting requirement .

section 5324 condemns three categories of structuring: one is devoted to transactions involving banks , credit unions , car dealerships , jewelers , casinos , and the other similar entities classified as financial institutions ; another to cash transactions of $10,000 or more involving nonfinancial institutions ; and a third to bringing $10,000 or more in cash into the country or taking it out of the country .

there is no requirement that the funds in question were derived from criminal activity , or that the defendant knew that the structuring was illegal .

moreover , section 5324 "focuses on an individual's intent to evade the reporting requirements , not on whether he succeeds in doing so," and thus success is not an element of the offense .

violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years ( not more than 10 years if committed in conjunction with another federal offense or if committed as part of a pattern of activity involving $100,000 or more ) and a fine of not more than $250,000 ( not more than $500,000 for organizations ) , with the fine maximum doubled if the offense is committed in conjunction with another federal crime or as part of a pattern of activity involving $100,000 .

any property involved in a structuring violation of the section is subject to confiscation .

such forfeitures do not offend the eighth amendment's excessive fines clause unless they are grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense .

after the supreme court held in bajakajian that the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment precluded confiscation of $300,000 of unreported , but otherwise untainted , cash , congress enacted the bulk cash smuggling provisions of 31 u.s.c .

§ 5332 .

the section outlaws carrying or attempting to transport more than $10,000 in unreported , "concealed" cash across a u.s. border with the intent to evade 31 u.s.c .

§ 5316 reporting requirements .

the section has been used to prosecute those who attempted to bring unreported cash into the united states , as well as those who attempted to smuggle cash out of the country .

the fact that the money was neither derived from criminal activity nor intended for criminal purposes may be relevant for eighth amendment purposes , but it is no defense to the underlying offense .

the proscribed methods of concealment seem to envelop any method short of public display .

the offense carries a prison term of not more than five years , but also calls for confiscation of the cash and related property in lieu of a fine .

the section was apparently enacted to overcome the consequences of bajakajian .

initially , there may have been some question whether the effort had succeeded .

section 1960 outlaws conducting or owning an unlicensed money transmitting business .

"money transmitting" is defined broadly by way of a nonexclusive list of examples , such as checks and wire transfers , and includes virtual currency such as bitcoin .

the term "business" restricts the offense to an enterprise conducted for profit and one engaged in more than a single qualifying transmission .

the section recognizes three categories of transmitting businesses .

one consists of any transmission business operating in a state that requires it to be licensed and criminalizes the failure to do so .

here , the government must prove that the defendant knew that he was conducting a money transmitting business and that it was unlicensed .

it need not prove the defendant knew that the state in which the defendant operated the business required him to seek a license or that the state outlawed transmission without a license .

the second category of unlicensed money transmitting businesses consists of any transmitting business operating in a manner that fails to comply with department of the treasury regulations governing such enterprises .

here , the government need not show that the defendant knew of federal regulatory requirements , but it must show that the defendant knew that he was operating a transmitting business .

the third category consists of any licensed business that transmits money known to be derived from or intended to finance criminal activity even if the transmitter is duly licensed .

section 1960 offenses are punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and / or a fine of not more than $250,000 ( not more than $500,000 for organizations ) .

property "involved in" violation of the section is subject to civil and criminal forfeiture .

the section has withstood challenges arguing that it is unconstitutionally vague .

as noted earlier , all rico predicate offenses are by definition money laundering predicate offenses under sections 1956 and 1957 .

the crimes that suggest the possibility of a rico offense also suggest the possibility of money laundering .

in some money laundering cases , although there is no separate rico violation , prosecution is possible by virtue of the rico shared predicate offense list .

in a number of other cases , either money laundering is one of several predicate offenses of a larger rico enterprise or the rico enterprise is devoted primarily to money laundering .

rico makes it a federal crime for any person to: 1. conduct or participate , directly or indirectly , in the conduct of 2. the affairs of an enterprise 3. engaged in or the activities of which affect , interstate or foreign commerce 4 .

a. through the collection of an unlawful debt , or b. through a pattern of racketeering activity ( predicate offenses ) .

in other words , "[f]or a defendant to convicted of a substantive rico offense [under section 1962 ( c ) ] , the government must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: ( 1 ) the existence of an enterprise ; ( 2 ) that affected interstate commerce ; and ( 3 ) that the defendant associated with the enterprise ; ( 4 ) and conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise ; ( 5 ) through a pattern of racketeering activity. .

the "person" who commits a rico offense need not be a human being , but may be "any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property. .

the "enterprise" element is defined with comparable breadth , embracing "any individual , partnership , corporation , association , or other legal entity , and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity. .

in spite of their sweeping scope , the elements are distinct , and a single defendant may not be simultaneously charged as both the "person" and the "enterprise" under 18 u.s.c .

§ 1962 ( c ) .

subject to this limitation , however , a rico enterprise may be formal or informal , legal or illegal .

in order for a group associated in fact to constitute a rico enterprise , the group need not have obvious hierarchical or business - like structure ; it need only be characterized by "at least three structural features: a purpose , relationships among those associated with the enterprise , and longevity sufficient to permit those associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. .

the interstate commerce element of the rico offense may be established by evidence that the enterprise either has conducted its affairs in interstate commerce or foreign commerce or has engaged in activities that affect interstate commerce or foreign commerce .

the "pattern of racketeering activity" element demands the commission of at least two predicate offenses , which must be of sufficient relationship and continuity to be described as a "pattern. .

related crimes , for pattern purposes , are marked by "the same or similar purposes , results , participants , victims , or methods of commission , or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events. .

the "continuity" of predicate offenses may be shown in two ways , either by proof of the regular occurrence of related misconduct over an extended period of time in the past ( closed ended ) or by evidence of circumstances suggesting that if not stopped by authorities , they would have continued in the future ( open ended ) .

the courts have been reluctant to find the continuity required for a rico pattern for past , closed ended enterprises ( those with no threat of future predicate offenses ) unless the enterprise's activities spanned a fairly long period of time .

open ended continuity ( found where there is a threat of future predicate offenses ) is nowhere near as time sensitive and is often found where the predicates consist of murder , drug dealing or the like , or are part of the enterprise's regular way of doing business .

section 1962 ( d ) outlaws conspiracy to violate any of section 1962's substantive prohibitions ; in the case of conspiracy to violate section 1962 ( c ) , it outlaws any agreement of two or more to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of rico predicate offenses .

the rico conspiracy offense has no overt act requirement ; the crime is complete upon the agreement to commit a rico violation .

rico violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years ( not more than life imprisonment if any of the applicable predicate offenses carries a life sentence ) .

offenders also face fines of up to $250,000 ( up to $500,000 for organizations ) as well as the confiscation of any property associated with the offense .
