on september 28 , 2012 , president barack obama signed h.j.res .

117 , "making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2013" ( p.l .

112-175 ) , which extended through march 27 , 2013 , spending levels "at a rate for operations as provided in the applicable appropriations acts for fiscal year 2012 and under the authority and conditions provided in such acts. .

on february 13 , 2012 , the president had transmitted the fy2013 budget to congress .

the request included $1,570,005,000 for the contributions to international organizations ( cio ) account , department of state , including $1,151,478,000 for u.s. assessed contributions to united nations ( u.n. ) system budgets ; $2,098,500,000 for the contributions to international peacekeeping activities ( cipa ) account , department of state ; and $327,300,000 for the international organizations and programs ( io&p ) account , foreign operations , which includes voluntary contributions to several u.n. system programs .

the president requested , through the nonproliferation , anti - terrorism , demining , and related programs ( nadr ) account , foreign operations , $90,900,000 for u.s. voluntary contributions to the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) .

this account also includes a request for $1,350,000 in u.s. voluntary contributions to the u.n. security council resolution 1540 [ ( 2004 ) ] trust fund .

congress has , over the years , sought to influence the direction of the united nations and u.s. policy at the united nations and in its agencies .

a variety of tools have been used , from "sense of congress" resolutions to restrictions placed in authorization and appropriations legislation .

congressional committees have held hearings to educate and to carry out their oversight functions .

u.s. nominees to be ambassadors at the united nations or its agencies have been queried on various aspects of u.s. policy and u.n. activity .

congress has reduced or increased executive branch funding requests , has withheld funding of the u.s. proportionate share that would finance particular programs or tied release of u.s. contributions to executive branch certifications once certain policy goals had been met .

beginning in 1980 , congress prohibited contribution of the u.s. proportionate share for a number of u.n. programs and activities of which congress did not approve , including the special unit on palestinian rights , for projects benefitting the palestine liberation organization ( plo ) , the south west africa people's organization ( swapo ) , construction of a conference center in addis ababa , ethiopia , the second decade to combat racism and racial discrimination , and for implementation of general assembly resolution 3379 ( xxx ) ( zionism equals racism ) .

in addition , the administration withheld the u.s. proportionate share of funds for the preparatory commission for the law of the sea and funds relating to taxes paid by u.s. citizens employed by the united nations .

the only current u.s. legislative - based withholding for the u.n. regular budget is for programs relating to the palestinians .

in addition , beginning in 1993 , the united states recognized a lower peacekeeping assessment level than that applied by the united nations , and since october 1 , 1995 , was limited by u.s. law ( §404 of p.l .

103-236 ) to a 25% peacekeeping assessment level .

section 402 of p.l .

107-228 , signed into law on september 30 , 2002 , raised the 25% cap on u.s. peacekeeping assessments allowing payment of u.s. current peacekeeping assessments in full .

in addition , since no waiver of the 25% cap on u.s. contributions for u.n. peacekeeping was enacted for cy2006 , the united states was withholding from its contributions for u.n. peacekeeping the difference between the u.n. assessment of about 26.7% and the u.s. statutory limit of 25% .

section 7051 of the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations act , 2009 ( in the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 , p.l .

111-8 ) amended section 404 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( b ) of the foreign relations authorization act , fiscal years 1994 and 1995 ( 22 u.s.c .

287e note ) , by deleting subsection ( v ) and replacing it with " ( v ) for assessments made during each of the calendar years 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 , 27.1 percent. .

this had the effect of enabling the united states to pay any peacekeeping account arrears attributed to the cap for assessments made during five calendar years .

congress amended this section in the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations act , 2010 , to 27.3% for assessments made during calendar year 2010 .

on june 22 , 2006 , the senate passed s. 2766 , the national defense authorization act for fy2007 .

section 1213 would require the president to submit to congress an annual report on all u.s. government contributions , both assessed and voluntary , made during each fiscal year ( fy ) to the entire u.n. system .

the report would include ( 1 ) the total amount of all u.s. assessed and voluntary contributions to the united nations and u.n. affiliated agencies and related bodies ; ( 2 ) the approximate percentage of u.s. contributions to each u.n. affiliated agency or body in such fy when compared with all contributions to such agency or body from any source ; and ( 3 ) for each contribution , the amount , a description of the contribution ( including whether assessed or voluntary ) , the department or agency responsible for each contribution , the purpose of each contribution , and the u.n. or u.n. affiliated agency or related body receiving such contribution .

this provision was an amendment proposed by senator warner for senate inhofe , was agreed to by unanimous consent , and received little , if any , debate .

this provision became law as section 1225 of p.l .

109-364 ( h.r .

5122 ) , john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 , signed by the president on october 17 , 2006 .

on june 28 , 2006 , during house consideration of h.r .

5672 , the state department appropriations act , representative scott garrett offered an identical amendment .

representative garrett pointed out that congress cannot make decisions on funding the united nations without knowing the "total amount of money that we are spending for the u.n. and its programs and its services. .

after a point of order was raised , that the amendment "constituted legislation in an appropriation bill," representative garrett withdrew his amendment .

over the years , two or three reporting requirements have provided data on annual u.s. contributions to international organizations ; some of them still exist while one has been terminated .

an annual report on u.s. contributions to international organizations for a fiscal year has been issued by the state department since the first one , which covered fy1952 , was transmitted to congress in january 1953 .

this report is required by p.l .

81-806 , september 21 , 1950 ( 64 stat .

902 ) , section 2 which requires the secretary of state to report annually on the extent and disposition of all u.s. contributions ( assessed and voluntary ) to all international organizations in which the united states participates .

the report does not include the international financial institutions , organizations with fewer than three members , the cost to the u.s. government of salaries and expenses of u.s. employees detailed to such organizations , loans which are to be repaid , and two - party contractual or other arrangements between an u.s. agency and the organization .

the report was last published , as a house document or state department publication , in july 1993 , for fy1991 .

the final published report was 170 pages and included three tables of special interest: u.s .

contributions to international organizations , fy1946-1991 ; u.s .

contributions to the united nations , specialized agencies , international atomic energy agency , calendar years 1946-1991 ; and united nations , specialized agencies , special programs , and the international atomic energy agency: total program ( expenditures or authorizations ) , calendar years 1946-1991 .

as issued for fy2004 , this 10-page report might be viewed as a minimum response to the reporting requirement and the absence of the last three charts means that information on u.s. contributions to the u.n. system in an organized fashion no longer exists .

another reporting requirement , adopted in 1980 ( p.l .

96-533 , title vii , §703 ) and terminated in 1998 ( p.l .

105-362 , §1301 ( b ) ( 2 ) ) , required a semiannual report on all u.s. government voluntary contributions to international organizations .

one weakness of the resulting reports was that they were just sheets of paper from any u.s. government agency involved in the exercise , provided without organization or analysis .

a third report required annually on u.s. participation in united nations peacekeeping operations ( 22 u.s.c .

287b ( c ) ) was added to the united nations participation act .

it includes data on u.s. assessed and voluntary contributions to u.n. peacekeeping operations on a calendar year basis and was originally required from the president ( now the state department ) .

this report is not published but is transmitted to the appropriate committees .

the 2008 annual report to the congress on united nations peacekeeping , totaling 51 pages , was transmitted .

the 2009 report , transmitted in september 2010 , was seven pages .

reform of the united nations has been a persistent issue over the history of the organization .

the drafters of the charter anticipated that changes might be required and provided , in article 109 of the charter , for the convening of a conference of u.n. member states to review the charter at least at the 10-year mark of its entry into force .

that conference was never convened .

article 108 of the charter provided for formal amendment of the charter which has occurred on three occasions .

one involved enlargement of the security council and two involved enlargement of the economic and social council .

congress has also sought change at the united nations .

recent congressional efforts , especially in the post - cold war era , have been directed toward a more effective and efficient organization that works within budgetary constraints .

between 1985 and 1988 , a number of factors combined to create concern among some in congress over the use of regular budget funds and the direction of voting in the u.n. general assembly .

some in congress viewed many u.n. member states as voting "against" the united states in the assembly .

in 1985 , congress adopted the kassebaum - solomon amendment ( section 143 , foreign relations authorization act , fy1986-1987 , h.r .

2068 , p.l .

99-93 , august 17 , 1985 ) that reduced u.s. assessed contributions by 20% unless steps were taken by the united nations to give the major contributors to the u.n. regular budget an influence on budget questions proportionate to their rates of assessment .

in december 1985 , in response to the issues raised by the kassebaum - solomon amendment and accompanying congressional debate , the u.n. general assembly established a group of high - level intergovernmental experts to "review the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning" of the united nations and to offer recommendations for streamlining the organization .

this group of 18 proposed 71 recommendations , most of which were approved by the 1986 assembly session .

in addition , the 1986 assembly adopted a revised "planning , programming and budgeting process" that sought to ensure an influential role for major contributing countries by , among other changes , using consensus as a basic decision - making mechanism .

on december 22 , 1987 , congress recognized that both the u.n. membership and the u.n. secretary - general had started to respond to its concerns .

title vii of the state department authorization act , fy1988-1989 , h.r .

1777 , p.l .

100-204 , created a new payment schedule that tied full funding of u.s. contributions to the u.n. regular budget to further progress toward reform by providing that 40% of the contribution could be paid on october 1 , of each year ; a second 40% could be paid when the president certified that progress was being made in implementing u.n. reform in three areas: ( 1 ) consensus decision - making on budget questions , ( 2 ) reductions in u.n. secretariat staffing , and ( 3 ) reductions in the number of soviet u.n. employees on fixed - term contracts .

the remaining 20% could be paid 30 days after congress had received the certification , unless congress passed a joint resolution prohibiting the payment .

although no deadline was given for submission of the president's certification report , release of up to 60% of the funds appropriated for the u.n. regular budget was dependent on submission of the report and its acceptance by congress .

on september 13 , 1988 , president reagan certified that progress had been made , and announced release of an initial $44 million in calendar year 1987 regular budget contributions to the united nations ; a later certification resulted in release of $144 million in calendar year 1988 regular budget funds .

reagan also called on the state department to develop a plan to pay over $500 million in arrears to the entire u.n. system over the next three to five years .

it would take several years , however , for the u.s. arrears built up over time to be paid to the united nations .

in 1993 , congress provided that 10% of the u.s. assessed contribution to the u.n. regular budget be available only when the secretary of state had certified to congress that "the united nations has established an independent office with responsibilities and powers substantially similar to offices of inspectors general authorized by the inspector general act of 1978. .

many in congress believed that an independent mechanism was needed to reduce and eliminate instances of "waste , fraud , and abuse" at the united nations .

on november 16 , 1993 , u.s .

ambassador madeleine albright proposed that the united nations establish such a post .

on july 29 , 1994 , the general assembly established an office of internal oversight services ( oios ) headed by an under - secretary general appointed by the u.n. secretary - general with the approval of the general assembly .

eleven annual reports on the activities of the office through june 30 , 2005 , have been submitted to the general assembly , and the office has undertaken an increasing number of monitoring , auditing , and investigative activities .

the u.s. government pressed for u.n. reform in the 1990s , linking payment of past arrears to reforms .

these arrears , to both the united nations , u.n. specialized agencies , and a few non - u.n. organizations originated from the non - payments of the mid - 1980s ; others derived from the placement of a cap on u.s. contributions to u.n. peacekeeping account contributions .

high - level negotiations between the clinton administration and congressional leaders led to agreement on an arrearage payment plan linked to reform "benchmarks," popularly known as the helms - biden agreement .

the 106 th congress enacted p.l .

106-113 including the helms - biden agreement conditioning arrears payments on u.n. reforms .

p.l .

106-113 incorporated the helms - biden agreement and authorized appropriations for payment of some u.s. arrears to international organizations provided certain conditions were met and certified by the secretary of state .

the agreement authorized payment of $819 million ( $100 million of fy1998 funds , $475 million of fy1999 funds , and $244 million of fy2000 funds ) , and authorized $107 million owed by the united nations to the united states for peacekeeping to be forgiven provided the united nations applied the $107 million to reduce u.s. peacekeeping account arrears .

among the u.s. conditions was reduction of u.s. regular budget assessments to 22% ( from 25% ) and reduction of u.s. peacekeeping assessments to 25% ( from about 30% ) .

in december 2000 , the u.n. general assembly agreed on a financial restructuring of both the regular and peacekeeping assessment structures .

as a result the u.s. share of the regular budget was reduced from 25% to 22% and for peacekeeping from about 30.4% to 28.14% , initially , and falling in subsequent years to about 26.5% currently .

appropriations legislation ( p.l .

108-447 ) for fy2005 included a provision directing that $1.5 million of the money appropriated for the u.s. institute for peace be used for the expenses of a task force on the united nations .

the institute was directed to create a task force consisting of no more than a total of 12 experts to study u.n. efforts to meet the goals of its charter and recommend an actionable agenda for the united states on the united nations .

the task force was co - chaired by former speaker of the house of representatives newt gingrich and former senate majority leader george mitchell .

the task force report was released on june 15 , 2005 .

among its recommendations , the task force suggested creation of an independent oversight board and a chief operating officer ; authorizing the u.n. secretary - general to replace top officials without assembly approval ; sunset provisions for all programs and activities ; disclosure standards for top officials ; greater independence for the department of peacekeeping ; and improvement of the u.n. capacity to stop genocide and mass killing .

on june 17 , 2005 , the house , by a vote of 221 to 184 , passed h.r .

2745 , the henry j. hyde united nations reform act of 2005 .

the wide - ranging and complex measure would require numerous state department certifications and reports .

the measure would withhold 50% of u.s. assessed dues to the u.n. regular budget beginning with calendar year 2007 ( financed from u.s. fy2008 funds ) , if 32 of 40 changes were not in place , including 15 mandatory reforms .

among the changes sought by the legislation were changing funding for 18 u.n. programs to be totally voluntary ; creation of an independent oversight board ; establishment of a u.n. office of ethics ; barring membership on human rights bodies to countries under u.n. investigation for human rights abuses ; reduction in funding for u.n. general assembly affairs and conference services as well as for public information ; and reform in u.n. peacekeeping and establishment of a peacebuilding commission .

no new or expanded peacekeeping operations would be allowed until the secretary of state had certified that u.n. peacekeeping reforms had been achieved .

during floor debate on h.r .

2745 in 2005 , a number of additional provisions were adopted including limiting u.s. contributions to the u.n .

relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east ( unrwa ) ; calling for zero nominal growth in the assessed budgets of the united nations and its specialized agencies ; requiring the independent oversight board to evaluate the final report of the independent inquiry committee on the oil for food program ; requiring the u.s. office of management and budget to provide congress with a report on all u.s. contributions to the united nations ; and calling for lifting the prohibition on use of gratis military personnel .

the bush administration expressed reservations about the house legislation because of its withholding provisions and because it would infringe on the president's authority to carry out foreign affairs .

h.r .

2745 , as passed by the house , was included in h.r .

2601 , foreign relations authorization for fy2006 and 2007 as passed by the house on july 20 , 2005 .

a u.n. reform measure was also introduced in the senate , s. 1383 .

the senate measure would allow the president to withhold 50% of u.s. contributions to the united nations if the president determined that the united nations was not making sufficient progress on reforms .

no foreign relations authorization act was passed in 2005 .

in 1997 , kofi annan , after being elected u.n. secretary - general on a reform platform , announced a two - track reform program .

the first track included immediate managerial changes within the secretary - general's authority to execute , while the second track included reform measures requiring consultation and / or approval by u.n. member governments .

among the first track initiatives were reducing the budget , staffing levels , and documentation ; creating a code of conduct for u.n. staff ; reorienting the department of public information ; consolidating administrative , financial , personnel , procurement and other services ; consolidating economic and social departments ; streamlining technical support ; and improving integration of development activities at the country level .

second track proposals focused on u.n. core missions and on improving management and efficiency .

they included creating a new management and leadership structure by establishing a deputy secretary - general , a senior management group , and a strategic planning unit ; overhauling human resources policies and practices including changing the management culture , eliminating 1,000 jobs and reducing administrative costs ; and promoting sustainable development as a central u.n. priority .

the proposals also called for improving peacekeeping and strengthening post - conflict peace - building capacity ; bolstering international efforts to combat crime , drugs , and terrorism by consolidating activities in vienna ; establishing a department for disarmament and arms regulation ; enhancing humanitarian activities by replacing the department of humanitarian affairs ; and revamping public information functions .

the proposals also called for the following: refocusing the work of the general assembly on priority issues and reducing the length of sessions ; establishing a ministerial - level commission to review the u.n. charter and specialized agency constitutions ; and designating the general assembly session in the year 2000 as "a millennium assembly" to focus on preparing the united nations for the 21 st century .

the u.n. general assembly in 1997 affirmed many policy formulations and management changes proposed by secretary - general annan including establishing a deputy secretary - general post .

in december 2000 , the u.n. general assembly authorized implementation of results based budgeting for the 2003-2003 biennium budget .

on june 29 , 2001 , secretary - general annan was elected to a second five - year term , to start january 1 , 2002 .

urging the united nations to align its activities to doing what matters in the 21 st century , in september 2002 , secretary - general annan submitted a report , strengthening of the united nations: an agenda for further change , calling for additional reforms .

on december 2 , 2004 , a group appointed by the secretary - general , called the high - level panel on threats , challenges , and change , issued its report , a more secure world: our shared responsibility .

the report acknowledged failures and shortcomings in the organization and offered many recommendations for significant changes including enlarging the security council , creating a peacebuilding commission , and strengthening the role of the secretary - general .

many of these recommendations required implementation by u.n. member states .

drawing on some of the proposals in the high - level panel's report , the secretary - general on march 21 , 2005 , issued his own report , in larger freedom: towards development , security and human rights for all .

the secretary - general hoped that these reform proposals would form the basis for discussion and final decision at a u.n. summit , scheduled for september 2005 .

this meeting , at the start of the 60 th session of the general assembly , also commemorated the organization's 60 th anniversary .

the 2005 u.n .

summit , meeting september 14-16 , 2005 , agreed , without a vote , to the 2005 world summit outcome resolution , which included some reform measures , but the details of such measures were mainly left for continued discussions during the 60 th and into the 61 st ( starting in september 2006 ) session of the u.n. general assembly .

the bush administration also expressed support for u.n. reforms .

it called for measures to improve internal oversight and accountability , to identify cost savings , and to allocate resources to high priority programs and offices .

it expressed support for creation of a peacebuilding commission , for replacement of the commission on human rights with a smaller action - oriented human rights council , and support for a democracy fund ( originally proposed by president bush in september 2004 ) .

the u.s. government expressed its openness to security council reform and expansion , but not at the expense of effectiveness .

as of august 9 , 2006 , several reform measures have been put into place .

these include creation of the peacebuilding commission , establishment and operation of a new u.n. human rights council to replace the u.n. commission on human rights , u.n. democracy fund , u.n. ethics office , strengthened financial disclosure requirements and whistleblower protections , and central emergency response fund .

in addition , the general assembly has held at least 20 meetings of an informal plenary on mandate review .

this review involves 9,000 mandates that are five years or older , with the goal of eliminating or reducing those tasks no longer relevant .

no decisions have been taken as a result of this review .

on september 5 , 2003 , the senate appropriations committee , reporting in s.rept .

108-144 on s. 1585 , making appropriations for the departments of commerce , justice , and state , recommended $921,888,000 for the cio account and $482,649,000 for the cipa account .

the committee deleted $71,429,000 requested funding for a u.s. return to membership in the u.n. educational , scientific , and cultural organization ( unesco ) , noting that the committee did not consider unesco reformed .

the committee directed that the inspector general of the department of state conduct an annual audit of unesco to determine the status of reform , the qualifications of unesco's staff , its procedures for hiring and promoting personnel , a detailed breakdown of expenditures , and how u.s. membership would advance the goals of the unesco and u.s. priorities .

the senate appropriations committee also deleted $11,779,000 from requested funding for the u.n. regular budget because the committee did not want to provide funding for the u.n. commission on human rights which , in its view , had too long been dominated by known human rights violators .

in addition , of the funds made available for the u.s. contribution to the u.n. regular budget , $10 million was to be used to reimburse new york city for unanticipated costs in providing protection to foreign officials associated with the united nations in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 .

the committee also expressed its views on war crimes tribunals , directing the international criminal tribunal for rwanda ( ictr ) to complete its work by 2004 and the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) to complete its work by 2006 .

in its report ( h.rept .

108-221 ) on this measure , the house committee on appropriations had included the full amount requested by the president for a u.s. return to membership in unesco .

the committee noted that it expected the department of state to work aggressively to ensure that unesco employs more americans , especially at senior levels .

the committee also noted that if the 2004-2005 unesco budget is increased , that increase should focus on management and administrative reforms identified by the general accounting office .

the committee urged the department of state to consider the appointment of a single representative with the rank of ambassador to represent the united states at unesco and at the organization for economic cooperation and development , both at paris , france .

during floor debate on h.r .

2799 , an amendment offered by representative ron paul to strike funding for unesco was defeated by a vote of 145 in favor of the amendment to 279 against the amendment .

4754 as an original measure .

the committee recommended full funding of the request for cio and cipa .

the committee expressed its support for the u.s. policy of zero nominal growth budgets for international organizations and noted that if the united nations proposed exceeding its $3.16 billion biennial budget , the committee should be notified before consideration and adoption of such a proposal .

while recommending full payment of u.s. assessed u.n. budget dues , the committee expressed concern about allegations of corruption in the u.n. oil - for - food program .

it noted that the united nations needed to do more about the crises in sudan .

it also expressed concern over charges of sexual abuse of minors by some associated with u.n. peacekeeping operations .

the committee included $6 million for costs of a direct loan of up to $1.2 billion to the united nations for renovating u.n. headquarters in new york .

on july 8 , 2004 , the house , by a vote of 397 to 18 , passed h.r .
