congress maintains an ongoing interest in the pace of u.s. innovation and technological advancement due to its influence on the economy , national security , public health , and other national goals .

historically , the federal government has played a significant role in supporting research and development ( r&d ) âespecially basic researchâthat has led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies .

the global landscape for innovation is rapidly evolvingâthe pace of innovation has increased and the composition of r&d funding has changed ( i.e. , private r&d investments are larger than public r&d investments and the u.s. share of global r&d has declined ) .

these changes have led some to call for new approaches and the expansion of existing mechanisms to help the united states maintain its leadership role in innovation and technology .

one mechanism that has received some attention is the possibility of establishing additional agency - related entities that would facilitate the use of private donations in federally generated research projects .

in addition , such entities might play a role in the commercialization of new technologies .

the potential establishment of such entities in statute raises several questions: what kinds of organizations has congress established in the past to address similar needs in the federal government ? .

what are the strengths and weaknesses of these potential models ? .

what are the opportunities and risks of developing a new entity for federal r&d using one of these models ? .

the varied organizational arrangements of the executive branch have resulted from more than two centuries of legislative and administrative actions .

these arrangements reflect a diversity of viewpoints , policy preferences , and political goals among the thousands of elected and appointed officials who have played a role in creating and shaping them .

during the middle of the 20 th century , hybrid organizational formsâincorporating both public and private characteristicsâbegan to grow in number .

these organizational forms , sometimes collectively referred to as "quasi - governmental entities," differ from one another in their specific features , relationship to the federal government , funding mechanisms , purposes , levels of accountability to elected officials , and use of private sector incentives and efficiencies , among other characteristics .

agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations fall into this category of organizations .

congress has created a number of agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations to advance the r&d needs of the federal government and to overcome perceived barriers associated with federal agencies' ability to partner or otherwise engage with industry , academia , and other entities .

the stated goals and potential benefits of these quasi - governmental r&d support organizations are that they may: provide a flexible and efficient mechanism for establishing public - private r&d partnerships ( see the box , "what are public - private partnerships ? .

for more information ) ; enable the solicitation , acceptance , and use of private donations to supplement the work performed with federal r&d funds ; increase technology transfer and the commercialization of federally funded r&d ; improve the ability of federal agencies to attract and retain scientific talent , including through the use of fellowships , personnel exchanges , and endowed positions ; and enhance public education and awareness regarding the role and value of federal r&d .

the following sections provide a brief overview of the purpose and intent , governance structure , and federal funding of selected congressionally mandated , federal agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations .

the foundations discussed include those connected with the work of the national institutes of health ( nih ) , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , and the uniformed services university of the health sciences ( usu ) .

nonprofit research and education corporations associated with the work of the department of veterans affairs ( va ) are also discussed .

all the foundations discussed have been funded through a combination of public and private monies and foster public - private r&d partnerships .

however , the level of public support received by the foundations differs , as do the composition and appointment of their governing boards .

federal agencies and congress have also initiated the creation of other organizations and entities to advance the r&d needs of federal agencies .

federally initiated venture capital firms and strategic investment initiatives , including in - q - tel , are often mentioned as an effective model .

see the appendix , "federally initiated and funded venture capital firms," for more information and illustrative examples of such organizations .

in an april 2019 report , the national institute of standards and technology described benefits that might be realized if congress provided all federal r&d agencies with the authority to establish agency - related nonprofit research foundations .

for example , they can actively seek "gifts and other monetary donations from private donors and organizations," and they "have facilitated technology commercialization and generated revenue to reinvest in r&d. .

in addition , while government agencies are , with certain exceptions , subject to management laws designed to ensure accountability , transparency , and fairness , agency - related foundations may be exempt from them .

such exemptions may facilitate flexibility , but they may also make it difficult for stakeholders to verify on an ongoing basis that the foundation's activities are directed to the public good rather than private gain .

prior to extending the authority to establish agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations to additional federal agencies and laboratories there are a number of issues that congress might consider .

the following sections examine some of these issues , including transparency , independence , and effectiveness .

congress established each of the agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations described in this report with the aim of advancing the r&d mission of the associated federal agency .

while the way each organization pursues its mandate varies , three broad categories of activity emerge: ( 1 ) soliciting private funds to support r&d performed by federal scientists ; ( 2 ) soliciting private funds ( leveraged against federal funds in the case of ffar ) to support r&d performed by non - federal researchers ; and ( 3 ) administering and managing research funds from federal and non - federal sources .

these activities are often carried out as part of public - private r&d partnerships formed and managed by an agency - related nonprofit research foundation or corporation .

while public - private partnerships are generally viewed as an effective mechanism for advancing the state of science and facilitating the transfer and commercialization of technologies to the marketplace , some say it is less clear whether agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations represent an effective model for the formation and management of such partnerships .

federal science agencies already have the authority to create partnerships , and many have the authority to accept gifts from individuals , nonprofits , and private sector firms in support of federal r&d and other agency activities .

federal agencies , however , are not permitted to solicit private funds , and many argue that the "red tape" associated with the establishment of public - private partnerships by federal agencies is a deterrent .

this situation may cause some observers to raise the questionâwould a federal agency have achieved similar results in the absence of its agency - related nonprofit research foundation or corporation ? .

while this question cannot be answered with any certainty , it does offer an opportunity for consideration of potential policy options .

among the options that congress might consider are: crafting a broad , general nonprofit research foundation authority that federal science agencies could draw on to create an entity that meets their specific needs ; examining the existing authorities of individual federal science agencies and , as appropriate , supplementing those authorities to increase the flexibility of an agency to enter into public - private partnerships ; creating additional agency - related nonprofit research foundations on a case - by - case basis , tailored to the specific needs of particular federal science agencies ; and maintaining the status quo , i.e. , allowing agency - related nonprofit research foundations and corporations that currently exist to continue , and requiring other federal agencies to use their existing authorities to enter into public - private r&d partnerships and transfer federal technologies to the marketplace .

if congress decides to create additional agency - related nonprofit research foundations , clear articulation of purpose , role , and governance structure may be needed to maintain an appropriate balance between the flexibility associated with being a nongovernmental entity and the need for accountability , transparency , and public confidence in the results of r&d partnerships and other supported activities .

over the last two decades , federal agencies and congress have established several venture capital ( vc ) firms .

the intent of these firms , including in - q - tel ( iqt ) , the army venture capital initiative ( avci ) , and red planet capital ( rpc ) , has been to help ensure agency access to leading - edge technologies and input into technology development to address mission needs .

several factors have contributed to the initiation of these organizations: a long - term shift in the composition of u.s. research and development funding from the federal government to the private sector ; the substantial role of small start - ups in driving innovation , especially in information technology ; and expanded u.s. and global commercial market opportunities that have diminished the relative attractiveness of serving the federal government market .

in - q - tel .

the central intelligence agency ( cia ) , with congressional approval , established the first federal government - sponsored vc firm , in - q - tel , in 1999 .

iqt is an independent , not - for - profit , non - stock company .

it is a strategic investor that works closely with intelligence community ( ic ) entities and the department of defense ( dod ) .

iqt's portfolio includes data analytics , cybersecurity , artificial intelligence , machine learning , ubiquitous computing , information technology solutions , communications , novel materials , electronics , commercial space , remote sensing , power and energy , and biotechnology .

while the cia has broad statutory authority in how it may expend its funds , according to a rand corporation report , the agency reportedly used an approach based on dod's "other transaction" authority ( 10 u.s.c .

2371 ) for developing its contract with iqt .

iqt has a management team and a board of trustees .

the cia is the executive agent for iqt .

federal agencies , primarily the cia , provide funding to iqt , which in turn provides investments to selected firms based on needs articulated by the cia .

the in - q - tel interface center ( qic ) , a small group of cia employees , serves as a liaison between the cia and iqt .

iqt investments generally range from $500,000 to $3 million .

iqt asserts that for each dollar it has invested , private investors have provided $16 .

iqt pairs its investment with a development agreement in which iqt and the company work together to adapt the technology to meet ic needs .

if successful , ic customers can buy the product directly from the company .

iqt asserts that its model delivers rapid , cost - effective solutions: iqt identifies and adapts "ready - soon" technologiesâoff - the - shelf products that can be modified , tested , and delivered for use within 6 to 36 months depending on the difficulty of the problem .

approximately 75% of our deals involve multiple agencies from the [ic] and defense communities , which means a more cost efficient use of taxpayers' dollars .

profits from the liquidation of an iqt investment are allocated between additional iqt investing activity and other strategic information technology initiatives defined by the cia , in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the cia and iqt .

army venture capital initiative .

in january 2002 , congress directed the secretary of the army to establish a venture capital investment corporation using $25 million previously appropriated to the army for basic and applied research .

the army and arsenal venture capital ( formerly military commercial technologies , inc. ( milcom ) ) jointly manage the avci through onpoint technologies , llc ( opt ) , a not - for - profit corporation .

in this relationship , the army serves as strategic investor ; provides guidance on technology priorities to opt through its communications electronics command ( cecom ) ; and , through cecom , provides administrative and contractual support to opt .

army funds provided to opt support investments and opt expenses .

proceeds from the liquidation of investments are used in part to pay compensation to arsenal venture capital with the balance used for new investments .

in addition to providing $25 million in fy2002 , congress appropriated $12.6 million in fy2003 and $14.3 million in fy2005 for the avci .

in addition , in fy2004 , the army reprogrammed $10 million for the avci .

since fy2005 , congress has not appropriated funds to the avci .

avci invests alongside other vc firms at all stages of development , making investments of $500,000 to $2 million .

avci asserts that for each dollar it has invested , private investors have provided $22 .

focused initially on innovative power and energy technologies , avci's technology focus areas have expanded to include emerging technologies such as autonomy , cyber , health information systems , and advanced materials .

avci seeks to foster the development of these technologies and their transfer to the soldier while attaining net returns for the investing organizations from commercial and defense markets .

avci asserts that it is able to engage technology firms outside the traditional reach of dod .

red planet capital .

in september 2006 , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) announced a partnership with red planet capital , inc. , a non - profit organization , to establish a venture capital fund , red planet capital ( rpc ) .

the fund was "to support innovative , dual - use technologies [to] help nasa achieve its mission , [and] better position these technologies for future commercial use. .

nasa was to provide strategic direction and technical input to rpc , while the organization's principals were to identify investment opportunities , perform due diligence , and manage its equity investments .

nasa intended to invest approximately $75 million over five years .

congress provided $6 million for rpc in fy2007 .

in fy2008 , president george w. bush proposed termination of the program: government - sponsored venture capital funds provide a mechanism for government agencies to indirectly take equity stakes in private firms , which potentially creates significant conflicts of interest and market distortions .

the administration believes that this mechanism poses difficult challenges to government oversight and should only be used in exceptional situationsâ¦ .

the administration further evaluated the fund and determined that , for nasa , these funds are better directed towards current priorities that will produce cost - effective , ascertainable outcomes .

congress provided no further appropriations for rpc .

according to nasa , the fund was eliminated before it took an equity stake in any company .

a rand corporation study states that rpc made a single investment prior to its termination , though it did not specify the amount .
