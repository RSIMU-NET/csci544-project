the prospect and potential for severe weather or other natural disasters on or immediately before election day , in addition to lingering hypotheticals about terrorist attacks in the united states , have brought attention to the possibility of postponing as well as the authority to postpone , cancel , or reschedule an election for federal office .

there is no provision in the united states constitution which currently authorizes in express language any federal official or institution to "postpone" an election for federal office .

the constitution expressly delegates to the states the primary authority to administer within their respective jurisdictions elections for federal office , with a residual and superseding authority within the united states congress over most aspects of congressional elections ( other than the place of choosing senators ) .

additionally , the constitution provides an express authority in congress over at least the timing of the selections of presidential electors in the states .

as to the time established for holding federal elections under these express constitutional authorities , congress has legislated , originally in 1845 , a uniform date for presidential electors to be chosen in the states , and in 1872 , a uniform date for congressional elections across the country .

in addition to the absence of specific constitutional direction , there is also no federal law which currently provides express authority to "postpone" an election , although the potential operation of federal statutes regarding vacancies and the consequences of a state's failure to select on the prescribed election day may allow the states to hold subsequent elections in "exigent" circumstances .

a handful of states have provided in s tate law express authority to postpone or reschedule elections within their jurisdictions based on certain emergency contingencies , and others have provided general emergency provisions which might be applicable to election situations .

as to potential disruptions on or immediately before election day , particularly in regard to the presidential election , some of the confused scenarios and proposed solutions appear to stem from a misconception of the presidential election as being in the nature of a national referendum .

the presidential election is , however , in essence a series of state ( and district of columbia ) elections for presidential electors from that state ( or jurisdiction ) that the congress has mandated , since 1845 , to be held on the same day throughout the country .

an event which may disrupt an election for presidential electors in one state , or in a part of one state , may not affect or impact at all the election for presidential electors in other states , or in other portions of the affected state .

consistent with the states' authority over the administration and procedural aspects of elections to federal office within their jurisdictions is their initial responsibility for resolving issues of challenges and recounts in those elections .

this authority and these procedures may be relevant in the case of disruptions , disasters , or violence at the polling places on election day which could conceivably cast into question the efficacy and legitimacy of a particular election result in that jurisdiction .

the relevant state procedures could be applied after the fact of an election to resolve initial questions concerning the results of such elections .

it should be emphasized that while the states have the initial authority , or the "first cut" at resolving disputes and recounts in their respective jurisdictions regarding elections to federal office , the constitution expressly provides that the final authority over the elections and returns of its own members lies exclusively in each house of congress .

as to the elections for presidential electors , the constitution expressly gives to the congress the task of counting the electoral votes for president .

implicit within this explicit authority to count the electoral votes has been the practical necessity to determine which electoral votes to count .

while congress has established procedures and rules for counting the electoral votes and resolving disputed lists of electors , congress has , by statute , specifically given the states a "safe harbor" time within which to formally resolve presidential electoral disputes , prior to the meeting of the electoral college in december , which then would be considered "conclusive" upon the congress in counting those electoral votes for president .

the united states constitution does not require a uniform election date in the states for elections to the house or senate , or for the selection of presidential electors .

rather , this has been done by congress by the enactment of federal law .

the constitution , while declaring in the "times , places and manner" clause ( art .

i , ยง4 , cl .

1 ) that the states have the general authority over the administration of even federal elections within their respective jurisdictions , expressly provides that the congress may supersede a state provision regarding , among other things , the timing of congressional elections , and further provides that congress may establish the time for the election of presidential electors in the states ( art .

ii , ยง1 , cl .

4 ) .

under these express constitutional authorities , congress has established uniform dates for the general elections to federal office within the states , which now are mandated to be held on the first tuesday next following the first monday in november in the appropriate even - numbered years .

it was not until 1845 that a uniform date for electing presidential electors in the states was mandated by congress .

previous to that congressional enactment , the timing for selecting presidential electors could , and did , vary from state to state .

congress in 1844 and 1845 was , however , concerned about the allegations of fraud and corruption in the previous election ( 1840 ) for electors for president and vice president in several states .

it was asserted that some of the particular misconduct in that election appeared to have been encouraged , in part , because the states had differing dates for the presidential election , which allowed the alleged movement of populations and voters to key states having later elections ( described as "pipelaying" ) .

congress sought to eliminate such opportunities for fraud and corruption by establishing a uniform day throughout the country for selecting the electors for president and vice president , while assuring that those states that required an absolute majority to elect could continue to hold a run - off for presidential electors if needed in an election on a subsequent date .

the uniform date for congressional elections in the states was not established by the congress until 1872 .

in first enacting this legislation , the congress appeared to be concerned primarily with two factors , that is , the potential undue and unfair influence on elections in some states that earlier results and elections in other states may routinely have ; and the burden on voters who in some states would have to go to the polls twice for two different general elections to choose federal officers in presidential election years .

as noted , the united states constitution does not provide express authority for any federal official or institution to postpone an election for federal office in a particular state , in any part of one state , or in all of the states .

specifically , there is no current constitutional authority residing in the president of the united states , nor the executive branch of government , to postpone , cancel , or reschedule elections for federal office in the various states .

there might certainly be some potential emergency powers inherent in the president of the united states , as well as those delegated by statute , but there is no precedent for such powers being applied with respect to elections held in the various states for presidential electors , authority over which , as to the procedures and methods , has been expressly delegated in the constitution to the states .

it is possible that some scenarios could be imagined , however , where attacks , disruptions , and destruction are so severe and so dangerous in certain localities , particularly in crowded urban areas , that the president under a rule of necessity may look to protect the public safety by federalizing the state national guard and restricting movement and activities in such areas which would obviously affect the ability to conduct an election at those sites .

unlike the president , congress does have explicit constitutional authority over elections to federal office which is of an express , residual nature concerning congressional elections , and a broad implicit authority recognized by the supreme court to legislate to protect the integrity and proceedings of presidential elections ( as well as express authority over the date of the selection of presidential electors ) .

congress could , therefore , pass legislation regarding dates , and emergency postponements and / or rescheduling times for elections to federal offices .

the courts have recognized an expansive authority in the congress to "provide a complete code" for federal elections within the states , including presidential elections and , within the parameters of the specific dates for the length and terms of federal offices established within the constitution , congress would appear to have the authority to exercise its legislative discretion with regard to emergency scheduling and rescheduling .

as noted by the supreme court in the 19 th century with regard to congress's authority over the conduct of elections for federal office in the states: that a government whose essential character is republican , whose executive head and legislative body are both elective ... , has no power by appropriate laws to secure this election from the influence of violence ... is a proposition so startling as to arrest attention and demand the gravest consideration .

if this government is anything more than a mere aggregation of delegated agents of other states and governments , each of which is superior to the general government , it must have the power to protect the elections on which its existence depends from violence and corruption .

furthermore , in theory , congress could also enact a law delegating to the executive certain authority in this area regarding emergency rescheduling .

however , as a policy matter , and under the constitutional authority delegated to it , congress has traditionally allowed the states , within the framework of the federal constitutional and statutory mandates , to exercise the substantive control over the procedures and administrative details of elections within their own respective jurisdictions .

it should be noted , and as discussed in more detail in the following sections , that there are existing provisions under current federal law regarding a failure of a state to make a selection on the prescribed election day with respect to both congressional elections ( 2 u.s.c .

ยง8 ) and presidential elections ( 3 u.s.c .

ยง2 ) , which have traditionally left the details of such decisions up to the states .
