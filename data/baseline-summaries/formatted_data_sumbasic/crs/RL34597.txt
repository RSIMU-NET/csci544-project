t he activities of most federal agencies are funded by means of annual appropriations provided in one or more of the regular appropriations acts that are enacted each fiscal year .

although some ( and occasionally all ) of the regular appropriations bills may be enacted before the fiscal year begins , in recent decades it has been common for most — if not all — of the regular appropriations bills to be enacted after the start of the fiscal year .

in some recent instances — including fy2007 , fy2009 , fy2011 , fy2013 , fy2015 , and fy2017 — the consideration of regular appropriations bills has carried over to the following session of congress .

when action on the regular appropriations acts is delayed beyond the start of the fiscal year , congress may use one or more continuing appropriations acts ( commonly known as continuing resolutions or crs ) to provide stop - gap funding .

eleven of the past 12 congresses , covering the 103 rd congress through the 114 th congress , have concluded with a lame duck session .

the enactment of appropriations measures has been an important element of most of these sessions .

although no regular or continuing appropriation measures were enacted during lame duck sessions held in 1994 , 1998 , 2008 , and 2012 , a total of 25 regular and 18 continuing appropriations measures were enacted during the 7 other lame duck sessions held in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2010 , 2014 , and 2016 .

this report provides information on the enactment of regular and continuing appropriations measures in connection with lame duck sessions occurring between 1994 and 2016 .

a lame duck session occurs during the period following election day , which is the tuesday after the first monday in november of each even - numbered year , and before the convening of a new congress about two months later in early january .

under the 20 th amendment to the constitution , congress is required to convene at noon on january 3 following the election , unless by statute it designates a different day .

in recent years , new congresses have convened during the first week of january in each odd - numbered year but not necessarily on january 3 .

as pointed out in a crs report a "lame duck" session of congress is one that takes place after the election for the next congress has been held , but before the current congress has reached the end of its constitutional term .

under contemporary conditions , any meeting of congress that occurs between a congressional election in november and the following january 3 is a lame duck session .

the significant characteristic of a lame duck session is that its participants are the sitting members of the existing congress , not those who will be entitled to sit in the new congress .

several factors may contribute to the occurrence of lame duck sessions , including the need to deal with unfinished business or urgent matters that have arisen suddenly .

the consideration and enactment of legislative proposals , particularly those with significant budgetary implications , is sometimes postponed until a lame duck session .

for example , the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 ) , which addressed a number of fiscal policies , was enacted at the end of the 2012 lame duck session on january 2 , 2013 .

lame duck sessions have been used in recent years for various purposes , including efforts to bring action on regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year to a close .

in addition to action on appropriations measures , lame duck sessions have been used for such matters as the consideration of authorization measures for the department of defense and intelligence activities , the finalization of a measure establishing the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the house impeachment proceedings against president bill clinton .

twenty - one lame duck sessions occurred between 1935 and 2016 .

ten of the 21 lame duck sessions occurred between 1935 and 1990 , an average of 1 every 5 years .

the use of such sessions , however , has become more common in recent years , occurring about twice as frequently .

the remaining 11 lame duck sessions — which occurred after the 1994 , 1998 , 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , 2012 , 2014 , and 2016 elections — covered a span of 12 congresses .

as table 1 shows , lame duck sessions occurred during this period whether party control of the federal government was unified ( i.e. , the same party controlled the presidency and both chambers of congress , as in 1994 , 2004 , 2006 , and 2010 ) or divided .

further , lame duck sessions occurred in presidential election years ( 2000 , 2004 , 2008 , 2012 , and 2016 ) as well as non - presidential election years .

between calendar years 1994 and 2016 , lame duck sessions have in some instances afforded congress an opportunity to complete action on regular appropriations for a fiscal year .

in other instances , lame duck sessions played little or no role in this regard , as action on regular appropriations was completed well before or after a lame duck session .

a total of 136 regular appropriations acts were enacted ( or covered by full - year crs ) for the fiscal years that coincided with lame duck sessions .

in addition , a total of 61 continuing appropriations measures were enacted for the fiscal years that coincided with lame duck sessions during this same period .

as was the case for the regular appropriations bills , the continuing appropriations measures were an important element in some of the lame duck sessions .

further information with regard to the annual appropriations acts and crs that were enacted before , during , and after each lame duck session is displayed in table 1 and table 2 and discussed in the report section " summary of action on appropriations measures in lame duck sessions held in 1994-2016 " .
