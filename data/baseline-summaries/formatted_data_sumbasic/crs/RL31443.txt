"deeming resolution" is a term that refers to legislation that is deemed to serve as an annual budget resolution for purposes of establishing enforceable budget levels for a budget cycle .

a deeming resolution is used when the house and senate are late in reaching final agreement on a budget resolution or fail to reach agreement altogether .

either chamber may initiate its own budget enforcement procedures by adopting a "deeming resolution" in the form of a simple resolution .

this report describes substantive enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution , explains the concept of a "deeming resolution," discusses house and senate action on deeming resolutions , and provides information on a related topic , waiving a bar against the consideration of budgetary legislation for a fiscal year before a budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted .

the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 ( p.l .

93-344 , as amended ) requires the adoption by april 15 of each year of a concurrent resolution on the budget .

the annual budget resolution sets forth aggregate levels of revenues , spending , the debt limit , and the surplus or deficit , as well as allocations of spending ( both budget authority and outlays ) by each of major functional categories of the budget .

the congressional budget process was first implemented in 1975 for fy1976 , with full implementation of the process occurring the following year .

over the years , the time frame of the budget resolution has lengthened from one fiscal year to at least five fiscal years ( and sometimes as many as 10 fiscal years , plus revisions to the current fiscal year ) .

enforcement of the budget resolution relies primarily upon points of order and reconciliation procedures .

point - of - order provisions contained in the 1974 congressional budget act , which sometimes are supplemented by point - of - order provisions carried in annual budget resolutions , allow any member in either chamber to prevent the consideration of legislation that would violate budget resolution policies .

of course , points of order are not self - enforcing and may be waived with a sufficient majority , thereby allowing legislation in violation of budget resolution policies to be considered .

in the senate , most of the points or order pertaining to budget enforcement require the affirmative vote of three - fifths of the membership ( 60 votes , if no seats are vacant ) in order to be waived .

with regard to the substantive enforcement of the budget resolution ( i.e. , enforcement of budgetary levels ) , the major points of order under the 1974 congressional budget act are found in sections 311 and 302 , which deal with the enforcement of budget aggregates and committee spending allocations , respectively .

house and senate rules and practices differ somewhat with regard to these two points of order .

section 311 ( a ) generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the aggregate budget authority and outlays levels for the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution , and any revenue measure that would violate the aggregate revenue level for the first fiscal year or the sum of all fiscal years covered by the budget resolution .

section 302 ( a ) generally requires that the aggregate amounts of spending recommended in the annual budget resolution be allocated by committee ; the house and senate appropriations committees receive an allocation for only one fiscal year , but the remaining house and senate committees receive allocations for all of the years covered by the budget resolution .

section 302 ( b ) requires the house and senate appropriations committees to subdivide their allocations by subcommittee .

section 302 ( f ) generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the committee spending allocations made under section 302 ( a ) or the appropriations committees' suballocations of spending made under section 302 ( b ) .

in view of the different time frames for making committee spending allocations , the spending levels are enforceable for one year in the case of the appropriations committees but are enforceable for a multi - year period in the case of the other house and senate committees .

reconciliation is a two - step process .

under the first step , reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution , directing one or more committees in each house to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues ( or both ) by the amounts specified in the budget resolution .

if more than one committee in each house is given instructions , each instructed committee submits reconciliation legislation to its respective budget committee , which incorporates all submissions , without any substantive revision , into a single , omnibus budget reconciliation measure .

under the second step , the omnibus budget reconciliation measure is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures ( for example , debate time in the senate on a reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane ) .

the process culminates with enactment of the measure , thus putting the policies of the budget resolution into effect .

when the house and senate do not reach final agreement on a budget resolution in a timely manner ( or fail to reach final agreement altogether ) during a session , they are faced with a mixed situation regarding budget enforcement for upcoming fiscal years .

the multi - year budget levels in the prior year's budget resolution remain in effect and provide some basis for enforcing points of order with respect to revenue and mandatory spending legislation .

changing economic and technical factors over the past year , however , may have rendered the prior budget levels out of date , thereby undermining their value as a realistic basis for enforcement of present policies .

further , the house and senate must adopt a new budget resolution each year in order for the enforcement of annually appropriated spending levels to be continuous .

if a budget resolution is not adopted for a fiscal year , there is no allocation of spending made to the appropriations committees under section 302 ( a ) and no basis for them to make the required spending suballocations under section 302 ( b ) .

consequently , when the house and senate have been presented with such situations , they have resorted to the use of deeming resolutions to provide a basis for updated enforcement .

the term "deeming resolution" is not officially defined , nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation .

instead , the use of a deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis .

inasmuch as the form and content of a deeming resolution is not prescribed , its form and content may be shaped to meet the particular needs at hand .

for example , the house and senate have used simple resolutions as the legislative vehicle in the past , but a deeming resolution may be incorporated into a bill , such as an annual appropriations act , as a single provision .

at a minimum , deeming resolutions provide new spending allocations to the appropriations committees , but they also may set new aggregate budget levels , provide revised spending allocations to other house and senate committees , or provide for other related purposes .

a deeming resolution may even declare that a budget resolution ( in its entirety ) , passed earlier in the session by one chamber , is deemed to have the force and effect as if adopted by both chambers .

both the house and senate have acted on several deeming resolutions in the past .

for purposes of this review , a distinction is drawn between instances in which the budget resolution was adopted in a tardy manner and instances in which no budget resolution was adopted at all .

the tardy adoption of a budget resolution , or the lack of any adoption at all , leads to another enforcement problem , but one that involves timing issues rather than substantive enforcement .

under section 303 ( a ) of the 1974 congressional budget act , the house and senate generally may not consider spending or revenue legislation for a fiscal year until the budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted .

the section poses less of a problem for the house than it does for the senate .

first , section 303 ( b ) provides an exception in the house for general appropriations bills considered after may 15 , but this exception does not apply in the senate .

second , the house may include waivers of the section 303 ( a ) point of order in special rules governing the consideration of individual measures .

section 303 ( c ) also bars the consideration of appropriations measures in the senate until the spending allocation to the senate appropriations committee required by section 302 ( a ) has been made .

unlike many other points of order under the 1974 act , waivers of section 303 ( a ) only require a simple majority vote in the senate .

over the years , the senate has waived section 303 ( a ) dozens of times for various types of budgetary legislation .

in many years , however , the senate has chosen not to waive section 303 ( a ) with respect to the consideration of regular appropriations bills .

instead , the senate appropriations committee in these instances generally delayed action on its bills until after the budget resolution had been adopted .

data collected from the 94 th - 100 th congresses show that , with respect to regular appropriations bills , section 303 ( a ) waivers were granted in only 13 cases , as follows: fy1984 , for three bills considered in june 1983 ( the fy1984 budget resolution was adopted on june 23 ) ; fy1985 , for eight bills considered june - september 1984 ( the fy1985 budget resolution was adopted on october 1 ) ; and fy1986 , for two bills considered in july - august 1985 ( the fy1986 budget resolution was adopted on august 1 ) .

in most of these 13 cases , the waiver was obtained under a successful motion directed specifically to waiving section 303 ( a ) .

in several other instances , the waiver was obtained under a unanimous consent request .

the use of the waiver motions or unanimous consent requests in these cases attested to the consensus regarding the need to consider the regular appropriations bills .

after all , such motions are subject to extended debate , and any senator can raise an objection to a unanimous consent request .

an extended debate on a motion , and an objection to a unanimous consent request , occurred only once ( both occurred in august 1984 in connection with the agriculture appropriations bill for fy1985 ) .

the extended debate on the waiver motion began on august 1 and was brought to a close on august 8 , when the senate voted 68 – 34 to invoke cloture .

the subsequent vote to approve the waiver motion ( 63 – 34 ) was the only rollcall vote taken on such motions ; the others were approved by voice vote .

in more recent years , the budget resolution has been adopted in a fairly timely manner .

during the period covering the 102 nd congress through the 111 th congress , of the 15 budget resolutions that were adopted , 11 were adopted in april or may ; the remaining 4 were adopted in june .

in addition , in recent years the senate sometimes has deferred the initial consideration of some of the regular appropriations bills until late in the session due to political difficulties , or even abandoned the consideration of individual appropriations bills in favor of consolidated appropriations measures .

accordingly , in the 15 years during this period that budget resolutions were adopted , the senate appropriations committee was able to avoid the need for waivers of section 303 ( a ) .

during the years in which the house and senate failed to agree on a budget resolution , regular appropriations bills generally were taken up by unanimous consent , without efforts to raise points of order under section 303 ( a ) .
