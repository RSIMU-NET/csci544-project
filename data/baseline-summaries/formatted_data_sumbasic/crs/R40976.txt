during 2007 , both the house and the senate established new earmark transparency procedures for their respective chambers .

they provide for public disclosure of approved earmarks and the identification of their congressional sponsors , among other requirements .

these procedures currently are contained in house rule xxi , clause 9 , and senate rule xliv .

while the house rule requires disclosure of "congressional earmarks" and the senate rule requires disclosure of "congressionally directed spending items," the terms are defined in the same way .

thus , this report uses the term "earmark" to encompass both a "congressional earmark" as used in the house rule and a "congressionally directed spending item" as used in the senate rule .

under both chambers' rules , an earmark is a provision in legislation or report language that meets certain criteria .

first , it is included primarily at the request of a member .

second , it provides , authorizes , or recommends a specific amount of discretionary budget authority , credit authority , or other spending authority ( 1 ) to an entity , or ( 2 ) to a specific state , locality , or congressional district .

however , the rules exclude funding set - asides that are selected through a statutory or administrative formula - driven or competitive award process .

this report provides information on the earmarks disclosed by the house and senate for the 12 regular , annual appropriations bills for each of fy2008 , fy2009 , and fy2010 .

for these bills , a list of earmarks was typically included in the explanatory statement accompanying the final version of the bill , under the heading "disclosure of earmarks and congressionally directed spending items. .

the abbreviations in table 1 are used to reference the bills .

the appropriations committees began publishing these disclosure lists in fy2008 , the first year under the new rules .

this report analyzes the data in the lists directly , without additions or deletions , as explained below .

the disclosures typically identify the federal agency , project name , amount , and requester .

in some cases , other information also has been included , such as an account within an agency , or the recipient , purpose , or location of the earmark .

for fy2008-fy2010 , the explanatory statement for the state - foreign operations appropriations bill states that neither the bill text nor the accompanying explanatory statement contain earmarks as defined in house and senate rules .

consequently , most of the discussion in this report focuses on the other 11 appropriations bills , for which congress disclosed earmarks for each fiscal year .

this report does not address earmarks disclosed for bills other than the 12 regular , annual appropriations bills for fy2008-fy2010 .

for example , it does not pertain to any earmarks disclosed for supplemental appropriations bills or for authorizing legislation .

tabulations in this report reflect all earmarks in the fy2008-fy2010 disclosure lists for the 11 appropriations bills , regardless of what information is provided for each entry .

for instance , no distinctions are drawn based on the indicated requester .

some of the items identify the requester as one or more members , others note only the president , while still others indicate the president and members .

similarly , the counts of earmarks include those items in the disclosure lists for which no funding level was indicated .

observers of the budget process frequently focus on earmarks that were originated by congress .

however , earmarking is not solely a congressional activity .

observers also have identified earmarking conducted by the president and others in the executive branch during budget formulation and execution , both at their discretion and through interactions with congress .

there is no source that defines and comprehensively identifies executive branch earmarks .

nevertheless , some of the fy2008-fy2010 congressional disclosure lists identify earmarks as requested solely by the president , or by the president and one or more members .

a discussion of these earmarks disclosed for fy2010 is presented below in the section on " congressionally disclosed earmarks requested by the president ," and for fy2008-fy2010 in the section on " recent earmark trends: fy2008 to fy2010 . .

the tabulations in this report reflect the value of the earmarks in the disclosure lists , although subsequent actions could have altered them .

for instance , rescissions of funds might have reduced the amounts identified as earmarked .

additionally , some of the earmarks may not have been provided to recipients who did not comply with conditions or requirements .

the balance of this report provides data on the earmarks disclosed by congress for the fy2008-fy2010 regular annual appropriations bills .

first , a series of tables and graphs depicts data for fy2010 , the most recent fiscal year for which data are available for all enacted appropriations bills .

second , another series of tables and graphs compares earmarks for fy2010 with earmarks for prior years back to fy2008 , the first year for which congress published earmark disclosure lists under chamber rules .

the tables and graphs contain data on the number and dollar value of the earmarks disclosed for each appropriations bill .

they also identify the portion of each bill's total appropriation and non - mandatory funding that was earmarked .

in fy2010 , congress identified 11,320 earmarks worth $32.0 billion .

about 1.5% of the total regular fy2010 appropriation was earmarked , 2.4% if mandatory appropriations are excluded ( table 2 ) .

some appropriations bills account for more earmarks than others .

about four - fifths ( 79% ) of the 11,320 earmarks in fy2010 are in five of the 12 appropriations bills ( 8,896 earmarks in energy - water , labor - hhs - education , defense , transportation - hud , and commerce - justice - science ) .

the energy - water bill contains the greatest number of fy2010 earmarks ( 2,293 , about 20% of all earmarks ; figure 1 ) .

the distribution of the value of earmarks is more concentrated , with about $27.5 billion , or 86% , of the value of earmarks in four of the appropriations bills ( military construction - va , energy - water , defense , and transportation - hud ) .

the military construction - va bill contains the greatest value of fy2010 earmarks ( $14.5 billion , about 45% of the combined value of earmarks ; figure 2 ) .

some appropriations bills account for fewer earmarks but have a greater share of the value , or vice versa .

for example , military construction - va is ranked sixth in the number of earmarks ( with 7% ) , but is ranked first by the value of earmarks ( with 45% ) .

in contrast , five bills are ranked lower by the value of earmarks than their rank by number .

energy - water is ranked first by number but second by value ; labor - hhs - education is ranked second by number but sixth by value ; commerce - justice - science is ranked fifth by number but seventh by value ; interior is seventh by number but eighth by value , and agriculture is eighth by number but tenth by value ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .

another measure of the magnitude of earmarks is the percentage of the appropriation that is earmarked .

there are various types of appropriations totals , but perhaps the two most relevant for this comparison are the grand total and the total of non - mandatory appropriations ( table 2 ) .

earmarks are predominantly , if not exclusively , found in discretionary accounts .

all appropriations bills include discretionary spending , and some include mandatory spending .

discretionary spending supports a wide variety of activities .

it is controlled by the appropriations acts , which are under the jurisdiction of the house and senate committees on appropriations .

mandatory spending primarily funds entitlement programs .

it is controlled by the authorization ( or legislative ) acts , which are under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees .

in addition , the transportation - hud bill separately identifies contract authority , which is included in these tables as non - mandatory appropriations .

the difference between the total and non - mandatory appropriations can be large for some bills , such as labor - hhs - education ( which has mandatory funds for medicare and medicaid , among other programs ) and agriculture ( which has mandatory funds for food stamps and the farm commodity programs ) .

for all 12 fy2010 appropriations bills combined , 1.5% of the total value of regular appropriation is earmarked , and 2.4% of the non - mandatory appropriation is earmarked .

the percentages of regular fy2010 total appropriations that were earmarked ranged from 0% for the state - foreign operations appropriations bill to 16.9% for the energy - water appropriations bill ( table 2 , figure 3 ) .

however , for all of the bills except two ( energy - water , and military construction - va ) , the percentages of total appropriations that were earmarked are less than 3% .

when mandatory funds are excluded , the percentages earmarked can change significantly .

for example , the percentage of the fy2010 total appropriation earmarked for military construction - va is 7.9% , but it increases to 11.5% of the non - mandatory appropriation ( table 2 , figure 3 ) .

for financial services , the respective percentages are 2.4% and 4.3% ; for agriculture , 0.3% and 1.5% ; and for labor - hhs - education , 0.1% and 0.6% .

house and senate rules do not require congressional disclosure of presidentially requested earmarks .

the disclosure lists for some bills , however , include the "president" as a requester .

table 3 presents the number and value of fy2010 earmarks in the disclosure lists that were requested by the president .

it is not clear that administration earmarks are defined or disclosed consistently across all appropriations bills .

thus , it is possible that there may be more presidentially requested earmarks than are reflected in table 3 .

the disclosure list for the fy2010 financial services bill also identified the judiciary as a requester for five earmarks .

nine of the 11 fy2010 appropriations bills with congressionally disclosed earmarks list the "president" ( or the "judiciary" ) as a requester of some earmarks , alone or with members of congress .

the total across all appropriations bills in fy2010 is 2,039 earmarks worth $21.8 billion ( 18% of the total number and 68% of the total value ) .

only the defense and legislative branch appropriations bills did not identify earmarks as requested by the president in fy2010 .

the president is disclosed as the only requester ( no members of congress are listed ) for a subset of earmarks .

the 12-bill total is 1,265 earmarks worth $9.5 billion ( 11% of the 11,320 total number and 30% of the $32.0 billion total value ) .

the energy - water bill had 768 of these earmarks worth $2.0 billion ; military construction - va is next with 320 earmarks for $6.4 billion ( figure 4 , figure 5 ) .

the president ( or the judiciary ) and members of congress jointly requested another subset of earmarks .

the 12-bill total is 774 earmarks worth $12.4 billion ( 7% of the 11,320 total number and 39% of the $32.0 billion total value ) .

the energy - water bill has 409 of these earmarks worth $2.7 billion , and the military construction - va bill had 243 earmarks worth $7.0 billion ( figure 4 , figure 5 ) .

the final subset of earmarks are those requested solely by members of congress .

the total across all appropriations bills in fy2010 is 9,281 earmarks worth $10.2 billion ( 82% of the 11,320 total number and 32% of the $32.0 billion total value ; table 3 ) .

the labor - hhs - education , defense , transportation - hud , and commerce - justice - science appropriations bills each had between 1,500 and 1,800 member - only earmarks ( figure 4 ) .

among these , defense accounted for $4.2 billion of the earmarks , followed next by transportation - hud with $1.2 billion of member - only earmarks ( figure 5 ) .

as implied above , the vast majority of earmarks ( 82% ) are member - only earmarks , while the value of earmarks is more evenly split among the three categories of requesters .

specifically , the earmarks requested jointly by the president and members accounted for 39% of the total earmark value , followed by member - only requests with 32% of the value and president - only requests at 30% of the value .

the relatively large number and dollar value of presidentially requested earmarks for military construction - va and energy - water reflect the practices of some agencies within these bills of requesting and managing funds at the project level .

specifically , the department of defense typically requests funds for individual military construction projects , and such requests are among those disclosed for the military construction - va bill .

similarly , the corps of engineers and the bureau of reclamation typically request funds for specific agency projects , and these requests are among the earmarks disclosed for the energy - water bill .

from fy2008 to fy2010 , the three years with disclosure lists , the number of appropriations earmarks decreased 12% to 11,320 ( 1,490 fewer earmarks ) .

however , the value increased 11% to $32.0 billion ( +$3.1 billion , table 4 ) .

over the same period , total appropriations increased by 31% .

thus , the percentage of the appropriations that was earmarked decreased in fy2010: 1.5% of the total appropriation ( down from 1.8% in both fy2008 and fy2009 ) and 2.4% of the non - mandatory appropriation ( down from 2.9% in both fy2008 and fy2009 , table 5 ) .

seven of the 11 bills with earmarks had a decrease in number , including the five bills accounting for 79% of the earmarks ( energy - water , labor - hhs - education , defense , transportation - hud , and commerce - justice - science ; figure 6 ) .

two of these bills ( transportation - hud and labor - hhs - education ) accounted for 68% of the decline in number ( 1,019 fewer earmarks ) .

four bills ( military construction - va , interior - environment , homeland security , and financial services ) had an increase in the number ( 372 more earmarks ) .

six of 11 bills had a decrease in the value of earmarks , subtotaling a $1.7 billion decline .

five bills ( military construction - va , transportation - hud , financial services , interior - environment , and labor - hhs - education ) had an increase in the value of earmarks .

the military construction - va bill accounts for the magnitude of the increase in the value of earmarks , with a $4.5 billion ( +45% ) increase over two years ( figure 7 ) .

excluding military construction - va , the value of earmarks for the remaining bills is down 7% ( - $1.4 billion ) in the two years since fy2008 .

 table 5 is a multi - year version of table 2 that contains data on the earmarked percentage of appropriations from fy2008 to fy2010 , as well as the number and value of earmarks .

for each appropriations bill , the percentage of non - mandatory appropriations that was earmarked fell from fy2008 to fy2010 ( figure 8 ) .

this result occurred despite growth in the value of earmarks in some bills , as discussed earlier , because total appropriations increased by over 30% .

for most bills the decline in the percentage earmarked was consistent over the three years , but for three bills the highest percentage was in the middle year .

over all 12 appropriations bills , the percentage of non - mandatory appropriations that was earmarked fell from 2.9% in fy2008 to 2.4% in fy2010 ( table 5 ) .

 table 6 is a multi - year version of table 3 that contains data on the number , value , and percentage of presidential earmarks in appropriations bills from fy2008 to fy2010 .

figure 9 and figure 10 are multi - year versions of the earlier figures ( figure 4 and figure 5 ) on presidential earmarks .

both the number and value of earmarks requested solely by the president increased since fy2008 .

the number of such earmarks increased 54% , from 819 to 1,265 , while the value increased 126% , from $4.2 billion to $9.5 billion .

the increase in the number of president - only earmarks is counter to the decrease in the total number of earmarks over the fy2008-fy2010 period ( discussed in table 4 ) .

the 126% increase in the value of president - only earmarks notably exceeds the 11% increase in the total value of earmarks since fy2008 .

conversely , the number and value of earmarks requested solely by members have decreased , by 17% and 19% respectively , from 11,117 earmarks worth $12.5 billion in fy2008 to 9,281 earmarks worth $10.2 billion in fy2010 .

this 17% decrease in the number of member - only earmarks is a larger decrease than the 12% overall decrease in the number of earmarks from fy2008 to fy2010 ( table 4 ) .

the 19% decrease in the value of member - only earmarks is counter to the 11% increase in the total value of earmarks since fy2008 .

the number and value of earmarks requested jointly by the president and members of congress were relatively more steady .

the number of such earmarks fell 11% from 874 in fy2008 to 774 in fy2010 , while the value of those earmarks rose 1% from $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion .

even if military construction - va earmarks are excluded , the trends are still similar .

for the rest of the appropriations bills excluding military construction , the total number of earmarks requested solely by the president increased 36% , while the number of member - only earmarks decreased 17% .

in terms of the value of earmarks , the total value of earmarks requested solely by the president increased 70% , while the value of member - only earmarks decreased 20% .
