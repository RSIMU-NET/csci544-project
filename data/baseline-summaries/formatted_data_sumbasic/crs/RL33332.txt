by operation of section 224 of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act ( usa patriot act ) of 2001 , several of the usa patriot act's amendments to the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) and the electronic communications privacy act ( ecpa ) concerning law enforcement and intelligence investigative tools , were originally scheduled to expire on december 31 , 2005 .

section 6001 ( a ) of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( irtpa ) of 2004 ( concerning "lone wolf" terrorists ) was also scheduled to sunset on that date .

without any legislative action , these provisions as well as amendments to them would have ceased to exist after the sunset date , and most of the pre - existing provisions of law would have been revived automatically .

during the 109 th congress , the house and senate each passed usa patriot reauthorization acts , h.r .

3199 and s. 1389 respectively , which made permanent 14 of the 16 expiring usa patriot act sections and extended the sunset on section 206 ( regarding fisa court orders for multipoint , or "roving," wiretaps ) and section 215 ( access to business records requested under fisa ) , as well as the sunset on section 6001 ( a ) of irtpa .

the two bills differed in several respects , including the new sunset date ( under s. 1389 , december 31 , 2009 , while h.r .

3199 offered a ten - year extension to december 31 , 2015 ) .

on december 8 , 2005 , house and senate conference committee members filed a report representing a compromise between the senate version and the version passed by the house , h.rept .

109-333 ( 2005 ) .

the house agreed to the conference report accompanying h.r .

3199 on december 14 , 2005 .

however , with several members of the senate raising concerns about the sufficiency of the conference report's safeguards for civil liberties , the senate voted to reject a motion to invoke cloture on the conference report , thus taking no action before the end of 2005 .

to provide the senate with additional time to consider the conference report , congress enacted legislation to postpone the expiration of the usa patriot act provisions and of irtpa's "lone wolf" amendment , until february 3 , 2006 , and thereafter further extended the sunset until march 10 , 2006 .

on march 1 , 2006 , the senate passed a separate bill , the usa patriot act additional reauthorizing amendments act of 2006 ( s. 2271 ) , that provides three civil liberties safeguards not included in the conference report .

passage of s. 2271 helped to pave the way for the senate to invoke cloture on the conference report upon reconsideration , and the senate agreed to the conference report on march 2 .

under suspension of the rules , the house passed s. 2271 on march 7 , and both h.r .

3199 and s. 2271 were signed into law by the president on march 9 .

this report provides a summary and legal analysis of the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 ( the "act" or the "reauthorization act" ) , p.l .

109-177 , 120 stat .

109-178 , 120 stat .

278 ( 2006 ) .

for organizational purposes , the report is divided according to the seven titles of the act and , within those titles , arranged by topic headings .

title i is in many ways the heart of the act .

it makes permanent most of the usa patriot act sections that were scheduled to expire .

to several , like section 215 , it adds substantive changes such as civil liberties safeguards .

it addresses issues raised by usa patriot act sections other than those for which the sun was setting .

it more clearly states the "national security letter" provisions of law , in ways perhaps necessary to make them constitutionally viable .

elsewhere , it looks at the issues faced in the usa patriot act four years after the fact .

in some instances it adds to the tools available ; in others it adds further checks against abuse .

title ii of the act makes several adjustments in federal death penalty law , which concern air piracy cases arising before 1994 , a redundant procedural mechanism in federal capital drug cases , supervised release for terrorism offenses , and a transfer of the law governing the appointment of counsel in capital cases .

title iii of the act , among other things , creates more severe criminal penalties concerning criminal and terrorist activities committed at u.s. seaports or aboard vessels .

title iv of the act strengthens penalties for money laundering , particularly related to financing terrorism , and makes changes to forfeiture authority .

there is also a provision that might be construed to permit pre - trial asset freezes in certain civil forfeiture cases made part of the property owner's criminal trial .

title v of the act contains miscellaneous provisions added in conference and not previously included in either the house or senate version of h.r .

3199 , some of whichâlike the habeas amendments in the case of state death row inmates , or the adjustments in the role of the office of intelligence policy and review in the fisa processâmay be of special interest .

the secret service provisions of the act were added to h.r .

3199 during conference .

they have several intriguing aspects although the constitutional reach of two provisions may be somewhat limited .

title vii of the act contains subtitles concerning regulation of domestic and international commerce in three methamphetamine ( meth ) precursor chemicals: ephedrine , pseudoephedrine , and phenylpropanolamine ( epp ) ; increased penalties for methamphetamine offenses ; expanded environmentally - related regulations ; and adjusted grant programs .

in many of its particulars , title vii resembles h.r .

3889 , the methamphetamine epidemic elimination act , as amended by the house committees on energy and commerce and on the judiciary , h.rept .

109-299 ( pts .

1 & 2 ) ( 2005 ) .

the first part of title vii addresses the fact that certain cold and allergy medicinesâwidely and lawfully used for medicinal purposes and readily available in news stands , convenience stores , grocery stores , and drugstoresâwhen collected in bulk can be used to manufacture methamphetamine .

at the federal level , the food and drug administration ( fda ) regulates the commercial drug market to ensure the public of safe and effective medicinal products pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act , 21 u.s.c .

301-397 .

the attorney general through the drug enforcement administration regulates the commercial drug market with respect to drugs with a potential for addiction and abuse , pursuant to the controlled substances act , 21 u.s.c .

801-904 , and the controlled substances import and export act , 21 u.s.c .

951-971 .

the degree of regulatory scrutiny afforded a particular drug classified as a controlled substance and sometimes certain of the chemicals essential for its production ( precursor chemicals , also known as "list chemicals" ) depends upon the drug's potential for abuse weighed against its possible beneficial uses .

those who lawfully import , export , produce , prescribe , sell or otherwise dispense drugs classified as controlled substances must be registered , 21 u.s.c .

958 , 822 .

in the case of controlled substances susceptible to abuse and therefore criminal diversion and for certain of their precursor chemicals , the attorney general may impose production and import / export quotas , security demands , inventory control measures , and extensive registration , record keeping and inspection requirements , 21 u.s.c .

821-830 , 954-71 .

a wide range of civil and criminal sanctions , some of them quite severe , may be imposed for violation of the controlled substances act , the controlled substances import and export act , or of the regulations promulgated for their implementation , 21 u.s.c .

841-863 , 959-967 .

prior to the act , the controlled substances act , in a dizzying array of criss - crossing exceptions and definitions , permitted the over - the - counter sale , without regulatory complications , of cold remedies containing ephedrine , pseudoephedrine or phenlypropanolamine ( epp ) âmethamphetamine precursorsâin packages containing less than 3 grams of epp base ( and in amounts not in excess of 9 grams of pseudoephedrine or phenlypropanolamine base per transaction ) .

title vii eliminates the criss - crossing and replaces it with a new regulatory scheme for "scheduled listed chemical products," i.e. , epp products , which: limits drugstore , convenience store , grocery store , news stand , lunch wagon ( mobile retailer ) , and other retail sales of epp products to 3.6 grams of eep base per customer per day ( down from 9 grams per transaction ) , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( d ) , 802 ( 46 ) , 802 ( 47 ) ; limits mobile retail sales to 7.5 grams of epp base per customer per month , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( a ) ; ( other than for sales involving 60 milligrams or less of pseudoephedrine ) demands that purchasers present a government - issued photo identification , sign the logbook for the sale noting their name and address , and the date and time of the sale , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( a ) ; provides that the logbook must include a warning that false statements are punishable under 18 u.s.c .

1001 with a term of imprisonment of not more than five years and / or a fine of not more than $250,000 ( not more than $500,000 for organizations ) , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( a ) , 830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( d ) ; states that sellers must provide , document , and certify training of their employees on the epp product statutory and regulatory requirements , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( a ) , ( b ) ; directs the attorney general to promulgate regulations to protect the privacy of the logbook entries ( except for access for federal , state and local law enforcement officials ) , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( c ) ; affords sellers civil immunity for good faith disclosure of logbook information to law enforcement officials ( unless the disclosure constitutes gross negligence or intentional , wanton , or willful misconduct ) , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( e ) ; requires sellers take measures against possible employee theft or diversion and preempts any state law which precludes them asking prospective employees about past epp or controlled substance convictions , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( g ) ; sets september 30 , 2006 as the effective date for the regulatory scheme ( but the 3.6 gram limit on sales would become effective 30 days after enactment ) .

federal law imposes monthly reporting requirements on mail order sales of epp products , 21 u.s.c .

830 ( b ) ( 3 ) .

under the act , those subject to the reporting requirement must confirm the identity of their customers under procedures established by the attorney general , and sales are limited to 7.5 grams of epp base per customer per month .

if the attorney general determines that an epp product cannot be used to produce methamphetamine , he may waive the 3.6 gram limit on retail sales and 7.5 gram limits on mail order and mobile retail sales .

sellers who knowingly violate the mail order regulations , or knowingly or recklessly violate the sales regulations , or unlawfully disclose or refuse to disclose epp logbook sales information , or continue to sell after being prohibited from doing so as a result of past violations , are subject to imprisonment for not more than one year , and / or a fine of not more than $100,000 ( not more than $200,000 for organizations ) , and to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 , 21 u.s.c .

842 as amended by section 711 ( f ) of the act .

during the 30 days after enactment but before the new purchase limits become effective , knowing or intentional retail purchases more than 9 grams of epp base ( 7.5 grams in the case of mail order purchases ) are punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year and / or a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $100,000 ( not more than $200,000 for an organization ) , 21 u.s.c .

844 ( a ) as amended by section 711 ( e ) ( 1 ) of the act .

the controlled substances act allows the attorney general to assess the total annual requirements for various controlled substances and to impose manufacturing quotas accordingly , 21 u.s.c .

for violations , manufacturers face imprisonment for not more than one year , and / or a fine of not more than $100,000 ( not more than $200,000 for organizations ) , and to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 .

the attorney general enjoys broad general authority to regulate controlled substances imported and exported for legitimate purposes , 21 u.s.c .

952 , 953 ( neither section mentions listed chemicals ) .

importers and exporters of list i chemicals ( which includes epp ) , however , must register with the attorney general , 21 u.s.c .

958 .

and they must notify the attorney general 15 days in advance of any anticipated shipment of listed chemicals to or from the u.s. involving anyone other than a regular source or customer , 21 u.s.c .

971 .

section 715 of the act expands the statutory statement of the attorney general's authority to regulate controlled substance imports to include epp , amending 21 u.s.c .

952 .

moreover , it provides implicit statutory confirmation of the attorney general's authority to set import quotas for epp by authorizing him to increase the quantity of chemicals importer's registration permits him to bring into the country , new subsection 21 u.s.c .

952 ( d ) as added by the act .

here and its other adjustments concerning imports and exports , the act instructs the attorney general to confer with the u.s. trade representative in order to ensure continued compliance with our international trade obligations .
