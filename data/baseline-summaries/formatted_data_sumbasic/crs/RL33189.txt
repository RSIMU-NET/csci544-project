in 1891 , congress established the u.s. courts of appealsâoften called "circuit courts"âto hear appeals from federal district courts and , later , many agency regulations .

the circuit courts remain the last avenue of judicial review for all but the relatively few cases the supreme court considers .

establishing the appeals courts organized federal judicial business into geographic divisions ( circuits ) .

today , there are 11 numbered circuit courts , covering federal judicial districts housed in the 50 states and u.s. territories .

in addition , the court of appeals for the d.c .

circuit has jurisdiction over appeals for the district of columbia , including many agency appeals .

finally , the court of appeals for the federal circuit has national jurisdiction over specialized issues such as patents and trademarks .

the ninth circuit , located in the western united states , is the nation's largest circuit court in geography , population , and appeals filings .

 ( figure 1 shows the boundaries of the current ninth circuit. ) .

on occasion , the ninth circuit has been noted for its controversial rulings .

these factors , and others discussed below , surround recent proposals to split the ninth circuit into one or more new circuits .

opponents counter that the ninth circuit should remain intact , and that proposals to split the circuit threaten judicial independence .

this report provides information and analysis on the debate concerning splitting the ninth circuit and compares provisions of house and senate bills introduced during the 109 th congress that propose to split the circuit .

the report also analyzes potential impacts of these proposed reorganizations .

the current debate over the ninth circuit echoes themes present in the past and generally focuses on six areas: ( 1 ) geography and population , ( 2 ) judgeships and caseloads , ( 3 ) how quickly the circuit disposes of cases , ( 4 ) cost of splitting the circuit , ( 5 ) en banc procedures , and ( 6 ) the circuit's rulings .

analysis suggests that splitting the ninth circuit would have different effects on each of these six areas , as is summarized at the end of this report .

the debate over whether to split the current ninth circuit into two or more circuits has been before congress for decades .

two major commissions on circuit reorganization have reached different conclusions concerning the ninth circuit .

in 1973 , the "hruska commission"âcharged by congress with evaluating the federal circuit courtsârecommended that the ninth circuit be divided in two .

in 1998 , the "white commission"âwhich congress tasked with examining the ninth circuit in particularârecommended against dividing the ninth circuit ( stating that doing so would be "impractical and is unnecessary" ) , but also proposed creating three somewhat autonomous divisions within the circuit to improve court management .

congress chose not to adopt the hruska or white commissions' recommendations to reorganize the ninth circuit .

since the mid - 1990s , several bills have been introduced that would split the ninth circuit .

during the 108 th congress , representative michael simpson sponsored house amendment 780 to s. 878 , which would have split the ninth circuit into three circuits .

the house passed s. 878 with the amendment ( by a vote of 205-194 ) in october 2004 , but the measure did not win senate approval .

in the 109 th congress , seven bills have been introduced in the house and senate that , in whole or in part , propose to split the ninth circuit into two or more circuits .

the appendix ( at the end of this report ) provides an overview of each bill's major provisions relating to a ninth circuit split .

late in 2005 , the federal judgeship and administrative efficiency act of 2005 ( h.r .

4093 , sponsored by representative james sensenbrenner , who chairs the house judiciary committee ) became the focus of legislative and media attention when language from the bill was inserted into the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( h.r .

4241 ) , which the house passed on november 18 , 2005 .

during conference negotiations , language splitting the ninth circuit into proposed new ninth and twelfth circuits was dropped from the budget reconciliation bill .

in the senate , three bills ( s. 1296 , s. 1301 , and s. 1845 ) proposing to split the ninth circuit were the subject of an october 2005 subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts hearing .

h.r .

4093 in the house and s. 1845 in the senate appeared to be the bills receiving the most legislative and media attention during the first session .

most recently in the house , on february 8 , 2006 , h.r .

4093 was reported by the judiciary committee and placed on the union calendar .

on the senate side , s. 1845 was originally scheduled for a june 29 judiciary committee markup .

that markup was postponed after chairman arlen specter , in response to a request from senator dianne feinstein , agreed to schedule a future hearing on s. 1845 .

the full senate judiciary committee held a september 20 , 2006 , hearing on s. 1845 .

the witnesses and contents of that hearing were largely reminiscent of other recent hearings on the topic .

the status of that debate is discussed throughout this report .

the debate over splitting the ninth circuit generally focuses on six areas: ( 1 ) geography and population , ( 2 ) judgeships and caseloads , ( 3 ) how quickly the circuit disposes of cases , ( 4 ) cost of splitting the circuit , ( 5 ) en banc procedures , and ( 6 ) the circuit's rulings .

proponents of splitting the ninth circuit argue that the court is too big and covers too many people to operate effectively .

opponents of a split generally respond that although the ninth circuit is big , it still delivers effective justice and provides legal continuity for the western united states .

opponents of a split also often assert that dividing the court is a backdoor method of eliminating the current ninth circuit due to its reputation as the nation's most liberal appellate court .

proponents of a split deny that the ninth circuit is targeted for division based on its sometimes controversial rulings , saying instead that effective judicial administration is the prime concern .

opponents of a split also say that the ninth circuit handles its large number of appeals well , and that professional case management helps facilitate circuit operations .

for example , former ninth circuit chief judge james r. browning has argued that the ninth circuit's innovations , such as computerized docketing and long - range planning , serve as models for other courts .

those against a split also contend that duplicating staff and administrative functions in a reorganized circuit would be costly and unnecessary .

opponents warn that existing ninth circuit staff expertiseâwhich they contend enhances the current circuit's functioningâcould not necessarily be replicated in proposed twelfth or thirteenth circuits .

those supporting a split counter that the ninth circuit is overworked .

they contend that reducing the circuit's caseload by dividing the circuit falls within congress's responsibility to manage the federal courts , and that failing to do so jeopardizes timely access to justice .

proponents fear that judges are too busy to effectively manage the court and say that dividing the circuit and adding new judgeships would allow judges to follow cases more closely .

finally , those who support a split maintain that the ninth circuit's administrative innovations are ultimately a short - term solution to a long - term problem .

the ninth circuit's efficiency is often discussed in the debate over whether congress should split the circuit .

although "efficiency" is commonly cited on both sides of the debate , measurements for the term are rarely defined .

efficiency could be measured in a variety of ways , with varying results .

because there is no universally accepted definition of "efficiency" in the current debate over splitting the ninth circuit , this report discusses various ninth circuit outputs , such as caseloads and how quickly the circuit disposes of cases , but does not address the ninth circuit's efficiency per se .

congress has , thus far , chosen to leave the ninth circuit intact .

the impact of splitting the ninth circuit would likely vary depending on the final boundaries of a split and related provisions , such as changes in the number of authorized judges , or other day - to - day realities encountered by judges , staff , and litigants operating in a reorganized ninth circuit , that cannot be anticipated .

as noted previously , the debate over splitting the ninth circuit generally focuses on six areas: ( 1 ) geography and population , ( 2 ) judgeships and caseloads , ( 3 ) how quickly the circuit disposes of cases , ( 4 ) cost of splitting the circuit , ( 5 ) en banc procedures , and ( 6 ) the circuit's rulings .

analysis suggests that splitting the ninth circuit would have different effects on each of these sixâ areas .

proposals to split the ninth circuit introduced during the 109 th congress are the latest in a decades - long debate over the circuit's future .

recent events suggest that the debate continues today , making the future of current legislative proposals uncertain .

during the first session of the 109 th congress , language splitting the circuit ( incorporated into h.r .

4241 from h.r .

4093 ) passed the house as part of the budget reconciliation process , but was dropped in the senate .

senate judiciary committee chairman arlen specter and ranking member patrick leahy objected to first - session attempts to split the circuit as part of the budget reconciliation process .

senator dianne feinstein also stated prior to december 2005 conference negotiations on the deficit reduction actâwhich , as passed by the house , would have split the ninth circuitâthat she would object to the language by invoking the senate's "byrd rule," which can be used to strike "extraneous matter in reconciliation matters. .

during the second session , there has been no official legislative action on h.r .

4093 in the house beyond reporting the bill from committee , and placing it on the union calendar .

the fy2007 budget resolution agreed to by the house ( h.con.res .

376 ) reportedly "assumes the 9 th u.s .

circuit court of appeals will be reorganized and additional judgeships createdâreviving a battle from last year's budget. .

the senate judiciary committee held a hearing on s. 1845 on september 20 , 2006 .

that hearing echoed many of the same themes , and featured some of the same witnesses , as other recent hearings on splitting the ninth circuit .

as of this writing , there has been no additional legislative action on proposals to split the ninth circuit .

in the 109 th congress , these two billsâ h.r .

4093 in the house , and s. 1845 in the senateâhave received the most legislative and media attention .

h.r .

4093 was the focus of first - session attention , while senate action on s. 1845 has commanded more attention during the second session .

as table 1 shows , both bills offer substantially similar revisions of the ninth circuit .

the major difference between the bills is that h.r .

4093 does more than simply reorganize the ninth circuit .

the bill also authorizes more than 60 additional judgeships throughout the nation , and creates an article iii court in the u.s. virgin islands ( a topic not addressed in this report ) .

by contrast , s. 1845 concentrates solely on splitting the ninth circuit , adding judgeships only in a new ninth circuit .

history suggests that if congress maintains the status quo for the ninth circuit , the issue will likely remain active .

several members of congress reportedly remain interested in splitting the circuit , and proponents of a split argue that rapid population growth in the current ninth circuit will only exacerbate the court's alleged management challenges .

many proponents of a split view dividing the circuit as "inevitable," with only the timing of a division and some details remaining uncertain .

others are equally determined to oppose dividing the circuit , asserting that a split is not a solution to perceived problems , and that the ninth circuit continues to function effectively .

the data and analysis presented throughout this report suggest that splitting the ninth circuit would have different impacts in different areas common to the debate over the circuit's future , such as caseload , cost , and en banc procedures .

in some cases , the impact of splitting the circuit is unclear .

in every case , the impact of splitting the ninth circuit would vary with context .

each dimension of the debate over splitting the ninth circuit offers congress potential benchmarks to consider in deciding whether to split the ninth circuit or maintain the status quo .

different measures of the concepts discussed here , or different variables altogether , might produce alternative findings to the analysis presented in this report .
