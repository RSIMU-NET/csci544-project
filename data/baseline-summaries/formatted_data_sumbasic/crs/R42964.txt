ninety - eight percent of the members of the 113 th congress cite a specific religious affiliation .

of the 98% , the vast majority are christian .

statistics gathered by the pew forum on religion and public life , which studies the religious affiliation of members , and cq roll call at the beginning of the 113 th congress showed the following: 56% of the members ( 247 in the house , 52 in the senate ) are protestant , with baptist as the most represented denomination ; 31% of the members ( 136 in the house , 27 in the senate ) are catholic ; 6.2% of the members ( 22 in the house , 11 in the senate ) are jewish ; 2.8% of the members ( 8 in the house , 7 in the senate ) are mormon ( church of jesus christ of latter - day saints ) ; 3 members ( 2 in the house , 1 in the senate ) are buddhist , 2 house members are muslim , and 1 house member is hindu ; and other religious affiliations represented include greek orthodox , quaker , unitarian universalist , and christian science .

the pew forum on religion and public life states , the changes in the religious makeup of congress during the last half - century mirror broader changes in american society .

congress , like the nation as a whole , has become much less protestant and more religiously diverse .

the number of protestants in congress has dropped from three - quarters ( 75% ) in 1961 to 56% today... .

meanwhile , other religious groups have seen their share of congressional seats grow , in some cases dramatically .

ten representatives and three senators ( 2.4% of the entire 113 th congress ) were born outside the united states .

their places of birth include canada , cuba , great britain , japan , peru , and thailand .

many of these members were born to american citizens working or serving abroad .

the u.s. constitution requires that representatives be citizens for seven years , and senators be citizens for nine years , before they take office .

at the beginning of the 113 th congress , there were 108 members ( 20% of the total membership ) who had served or were serving in the military , 10 fewer than at the beginning of the 112 th congress ( 118 members ) and 12 fewer than in the 111 th congress ( 120 members ) .

according to lists compiled by cq roll call , the house currently has 88 veterans ( including 2 female members , as well as 2 delegates ) ; the senate has 18 .

these members served in world war ii , the korean war , the vietnam war , the persian gulf war , afghanistan , iraq , and kosovo , as well as during times of peace .

many have served in the reserves and the national guard .

eight house members and one senator are still serving in the reserves , and six house members are still serving in the national guard .

both of the female veterans are combat veterans .

the number of veterans in the 113 th congress reflects the trend of steady decline in recent decades in the number of members who have served in the military .

for example , 64% of the members of the 97 th congress ( 1981-1982 ) were veterans ; and in the 92 nd congress ( 1971-1972 ) , 73% of the members were veterans .
