the digital divide âa gap between those who use or have access to telecommunications and information technologies and those who do notâaffects every region of the united states .

since the internet became publicly available in the 1990s , an increasing amount of information that individuals access for work , school , and entertainment is digital and hosted online .

members of congress have expressed continuing interest in ensuring that their constituents have access to broadband internet , and in the 116 th congress , they have introduced legislation ( see the appendix to this report ) and held hearings on opportunities to expand broadband deployment and close the digital divide .

although congress has provided federal funding for multiple broadband infrastructure initiatives , the gap between those who can access broadband and those who do not still persists .

ensuring access to broadband is not the only barrier to closing the digital divide .

other challenges include increasing the adoption of broadband ( where it is available ) and training for digital literacy .

according to the national digital inclusion alliance: we do need to address the lack of broadband infrastructure in rural areas .

it is a serious problem .

but , it is just one barrier to individuals and communities being able to fully participate in society today .

the other common barriers , no matter where one lives , are the costs of internet service and devices , plus digital literacy skills .

simplistically equating "the digital divide" with just one of these barriers increases the division in our country .

broadband infrastructure initiatives funded under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) have concluded , but the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and rural utilities service ( rus , within the u.s. department of agriculture ) continue to have active programs that provide federal funding for broadband .

there are few current federal funding initiatives to address other aspects of the digital divide , however , such as digital literacy and digital inclusion and the homework gap .

states are playing a crucial role in efforts to expand broadband access , encouraging broadband investment , and helping to bring more of their residents online .

each state approaches broadband access and deployment differently , and state efforts may provide models for any future federal initiatives .

this report analyzes selected state - level and local initiatives that have used different approaches .

it does not attempt to include broadband initiatives from all 50 states .

rather , it highlights selected examples to illustrate programs that could serve as templates for potential federal initiatives .

the term broadband commonly refers to high - speed internet access that is faster than dial - up access and is immediately accessible .

in 2015 , the fcc defined broadband as 25 / 3 megabits per second ( mbps ) , i.e. , 25 mbps ( download rate ) and 3 mbps ( upload rate ) .

about 21.3 million americans currently lack access to broadband at those speeds .

broadband includes several high - speed transmission technologies , such as: digital subscriber line ( dsl ) ; cable modem ; fiber ; wireless ; satellite ; and broadband over powerlines ( bpl ) .

the term digital divide refers to a gap between those who use or have access to telecommunications and information technologies and those who do not .

many areas of the united statesâparticularly rural areasâhave either limited or no access to broadband infrastructure .

several factors contribute to the digital divide , including terrain , population density , demography , and market factors .

additionally , there are citizens in areas with high broadband penetration who are unable to access it due to socioeconomic factors .

ensuring access to broadband is not the only barrier to closing the digital divide .

other challenges include increasing the adoption of broadband ( where it is available ) and training for digital literacy .

although strides have been made in the deployment of broadband , the digital divide persistsâprompting a variety of federal broadband initiatives to address barriers and push communities across the digital divide .

increasingly , state governments have taken action to ensure that all residents , regardless of where they live or socioeconomic factors that may inhibit adoption , have access to broadband .

while many state broadband initiatives focus on broadband infrastructure deployment , some address other aspects , such as adoption , mapping , feasibility , digital equity and digital inclusion , gigabit broadband initiatives , and the homework gap .

this section describes selected state and local broadband initiatives , using the selected programs as examples to illustrate common approaches .

the states and programs described are not intended to be a comprehensive list .

should congress choose to consider state broadband initiatives , a variety of potential options would be available .

states have been attempting to bridge the digital divide through their own broadband initiatives .

while the majority of federal funding addresses network deployment , state broadband initiatives may demonstrate that other approaches can be complementary .

whether congress decides to enact new broadband funding or initiatives remains to be seen ; however , there appears to be an opportunity for states to share lessons learned from their approaches with congress and / or federal agencies .

leveraging the wide variety of state policies and initiatives as potential models for federal broadband initiatives could have the potential to help close the digital divide .

aside from annual appropriations legislation , the following are selected bills introduced in the 116 th congress relating to the state broadband issues discussed in this report .
