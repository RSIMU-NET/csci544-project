this report describes the highlights of president obama's proposals for fy2011 appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs , as submitted to congress on february 1 , 2010 , and the congressional response to those proposals .

discussions focus primarily on discretionary programs .

the report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory l - hhs - ed programs — such as medicare or social security — nor does it follow any authorizing legislation related to the president's budget initiatives .

for a glossary of budget terms and relevant websites , see the appendix , "terminology and web resources. .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , as well as various related issues , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion and for research on human embryos and stem cells .

this bill provides discretionary and mandatory funds to three federal departments and 14 related agencies , including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

discretionary funding represents less than one - quarter of the total in the bill .

among the various appropriations bills , l - hhs - ed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic ( non - defense ) federal programs ( the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs ) .

this section presents several overview tables on funding in the bill , particularly discretionary funding , and discusses related issues such as 302 ( b ) allocations and advance appropriations .

later sections provide details on individual l - hhs - ed departments and agencies .
