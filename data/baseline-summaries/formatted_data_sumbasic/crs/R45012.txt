this report summarizes the provisions in division a of the championing healthy kids act that would extend funding for certain public health programs and provide offsets for these funding extensions .

division b — the extension of chip funding — is discussed in crs report r44989 , comparison of the bills to extend state children's health insurance program ( chip ) funding .

according to congressional budget office ( cbo ) and the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) cost estimates for the championing healthy kids act language posted on the house rules committee website on october 30 , 2017 , division a is estimated to decrease federal spending by $4.1 billion and increase revenues by $0.7 billion , for a net savings of $4.8 billion over the period of fy2018 through fy2027 .

division a of the championing healthy kids act would extend funding for a number of public health programs , which are discussed briefly below .

because the bill would also make a number of changes to these programs , information for certain public health programs is provided for context .

information about the public health programs included in division a and their funding histories is available in the following crs reports: crs report r43937 , federal health centers: an overview ; crs report r44970 , the national health service corps ; crs report rs20301 , teenage pregnancy prevention: statistics and programs ; crs report r44662 , health care - related expiring provisions of the 115th congress , first session ; and the "teaching health gme" section in crs report r44376 , federal support for graduate medical education: an overview .

for the majority of the public health programs included in this bill , fy2017 was the last year of appropriated funding .

there are two exceptions: the teaching health center graduate medical education payment program and the special diabetes program for indians .

funding for these two programs was provided for the first quarter of fy2018 ( i.e. , through december 31 , 2017 ) in the disaster tax relief and airport and airway extension act of 2017 ( p.l .

115-63 ) .

division a of the championing healthy kids act also includes the following provisions as offsets: ( 1 ) a change to the qualified health plan grace period requirement for individuals who receive advanced premium tax credits for health insurance purchased on the exchanges and ( 2 ) reductions to the prevention and public health fund .

although other pending legislation proposes extending some of the same public health programs included in division a of the championing healthy kids act champion act , a comparison of those bills is beyond the scope of this report .

unless otherwise specified , all references to the "secretary" refer to the secretary of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .

aca section 1412 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( b ) ( iv ) ( ii ) provides a three - month grace period before a qualified health plan issuer can discontinue an individual's health insurance coverage for failure to pay the monthly premium .

this grace period applies only to individuals who receive an advance premium tax credit through an exchange and have previously paid at least one month's full premium during the benefit year .

this provision would eliminate the reference to a three - month grace period in aca section 1412 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( b ) ( iv ) ( ii ) and insert a new subparagraph specifying a grace period before coverage is cancelled due to nonpayment of premiums .

for plan years beginning before january 1 , 2018 , the grace period would be three months .

for plan years beginning on or after january 1 , 2018 , the grace period would be established by state law , or if there is none , a one - month grace period .

the comptroller general would be required to submit a report to congress on the effects of aligning grace periods under medicaid , medicare , and the exchanges , and the extent to which such alignment may reduce fraud , waste , and abuse in the medicaid program .

aca section 4002 established the prevention and public health fund ( pphf ) , to be administered by the hhs secretary , and provided it with a permanent annual appropriation .

the pphf is intended to support an "expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs. .

in general , pphf funds have been distributed to hhs agencies in the public health service , in particular the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .

amounts for each fiscal year are available to the hhs secretary beginning october 1 , the start of the respective fiscal year .

congress may explicitly direct the distribution of pphf funds and did so for fy2014 through fy2018 .

under the aca , the pphf's annual appropriation would increase from $500 million for fy2010 to $2 billion for fy2015 and each subsequent fiscal year .

congress has amended the provision two times , using a portion of pphf funds as an offset for the costs of other activities .

annual appropriations to the pphf in current law are as follows: $500 million for fy2010 ; $1.0 billion for each of fy2012 through fy2017 ; $900 million for each of fy2018 and fy2019 ; $1.0 billion for each of fy2020 and fy2021 ; $1.5 billion for fy2022 ; $1.0 billion for fy2023 ; $1.7 billion for fy2024 ; and $2.0 billion for fy2025 and each fiscal year thereafter .

section 202 would amend aca section 4002 ( b ) , repealing $7.4 billion in appropriations from fy2019 through fy2027 , by decreasing , but not eliminating , amounts appropriated to the fund for each of those fiscal years .

the provision would not affect fy2018 appropriations to the fund , which have already been distributed .
