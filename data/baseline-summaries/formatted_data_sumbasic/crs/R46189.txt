cannabidiol ( cbd ) , a compound in the cannabis sativa plant , has been promoted as a treatment for a range of conditions , including epileptic seizures , post - traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , inflammation , and sleeplessness .

however , limited scientific evidence exists to substantiate or disprove the efficacy of cbd in treating these conditions .

in the united states , cbd is being marketed in food and beverages , dietary supplements , cosmetics , and tobacco products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ends , the overarching term encompassing electronic cigarettes ) âproducts that are primarily regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) .

cbd is also the active ingredient in epidiolex , an fda - approved pharmaceutical drug used to treat seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy .

cbd is derived from the cannabis sativa plant ( commonly referred to as cannabis ) , which includes both hemp and marijuana ( defined further below ) .

cbd and tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) are thought to be the most abundant cannabinoids in the cannabis plant and are among the most researched cannabinoids for their potential medical value .

thcâa psychoactive compoundâis found at high levels in m arijuana and low levels in hemp ( see figure 1 ) .

cbd , on the other hand , is generally considered to be nonpsychoactive and may be derived from either hemp or marijuana .

as described below , this distinction is relevant for purposes of oversight by the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , but generally not for fda oversight .

fda has stated that it "treats products containing cannabis or cannabis - derived compounds as it does any other fda - regulated productsâmeaning they're subject to the same authorities and requirements as fda - regulated products containing any other [non - cannabis] substance .

this is true regardless of whether the cannabis or cannabis - derived compounds are classified as hemp under [7 u.s.c .

section 1639o] as amended by the 2018 [f]arm [b]ill." in contrast , the dea does not regulate cannabis or cannabis - derived compounds that meet the statutory definition of hemp .

botanically , marijuana and hemp are from the same species of plant , cannabis sativa , but from different varieties or cultivars .

marijuana and hemp have separate definitions in u.s. law and are subject to different statutory and regulatory requirements .

m arijuana ( as defined in statute ) generally refers to the cultivated plant used as a psychotropic drug , either for medicinal or recreational purposes .

marijuana is a schedule i controlled substance under the controlled substances act ( csa ) and is regulated by dea .

schedule i substances are subject to the most severe csa restrictions and penalties ; with exceptions for federally approved research , it is a federal crime to grow , sell , or possess the drug .

thus , under the csa , the unauthorized manufacture , distribution , dispensation , and possession of marijuana and its derivatives ( including marijuana - derived cbd ) are prohibited .

hemp ( as defined in statute separately from marijuana ) , on the other hand , may be legally cultivated under federal law , subject to oversight by the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .

hemp is generally grown for use in the production of a wide range of products , including foods and beverages , personal care products , dietary supplements , fabrics and textiles , paper , construction materials , and other manufactured and industrial goods ( see figure 2 ) .

until december 2018 , hemp was included in the csa definition of marijuana and was thus subject to the same restrictions as marijuana .

the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( 2018 farm bill ; p.l .

115-334 ) removed hemp and its derivatives ( including hemp - derived cbd ) from the csa definition of marijuana .

as a result , hemp is no longer subject to regulation and oversight as a controlled substance by dea .

instead , hemp production is now subject to regulation and oversight as an agricultural commodity by usda .

cbd and cbd - related products that do not meet the statutory definition of hemp ( in 7 u.s.c .

â§1639o ) continue to be prohibited ( aside from lawful use for research purposes ) under the csa and remain regulated by dea .

changes enacted in the 2018 farm bill related to hemp were expected by many to generate additional market opportunities for hemp - derived consumer products such as hemp - derived cbd .

however , the farm bill also explicitly preserved fda's authorities under the ffdca and section 351 of the public health service act , including for hemp - derived products .

as mentioned above , cannabis and cannabis - derived fda - regulated products are subject to the same authorities and requirements as fda - regulated productsâincluding pharmaceutical drugs , food , dietary supplements , and cosmeticsâcontaining any other substance ( whether cannabis - derived or otherwise ) .

as described below , fda has determined that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added cbd into interstate commerce , or to market cbd as or in dietary supplements .

fda has not made similar determinations for other fda - regulated product categories ( pharmaceutical drugs , cosmetics , and tobacco products ) .

in the united states , cbd is the active ingredient in the prescription drug epidiolex .

cbd is also being marketed in food and beverages , dietary supplements , cosmetics , and tobacco products such as ends .

each of these product types is governed by different statutory and regulatory requirements , primarily administered by fda .

the agency also shares regulatory authority with other entities ; for example , the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau ( ttb ) , with regard to alcoholic beverages , and the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , with regard to the advertising and promotion of certain cbd products .

this section provides an overview of how fda regulates drugs , food , dietary supplements , cosmetics , and tobacco products , and the applicability of those requirements to products that contain cbd .

table 1 summarizes selected regulatory requirements by cbd product type .

cannabinoids such thc and cbd interact with specific cell receptors in the brain and throughout the body to produce their intended effects .

although thc activates certain receptors that then produce euphoric or intoxicating effects , cbd has low affinity for those same receptors and therefore does not produce intoxicating effects .

this property may make cbd an attractive compound for drug developers .

in addition , preclinical ( eg , animal model ) research suggests that cbd may interact with other brain - signaling systems that can produce therapeutic effects , such as the reduction of seizures , pain , and anxiety .

the therapeutic benefits , or underlying mechanism of action for therapeutic benefits , of cbd remain uncertain , even in cbd - containing drugs that have been approved by regulatory agencies .

for example , in the united states , gw pharmaceuticals' epidiolex ( cbd ) is approved for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy .

however , according to the drug's labeling , the mechanism by which the drug exerts its anticonvulsant effects is not known .

in addition , while not yet approved in the united states , gw pharmaceuticals' drug sativex ( nabiximols ) âa cannabis extract spray containing a 1:1 ratio of cbd and delta - 9 thcâhas regulatory approval in more than 25 countries for the treatment of spasticity ( muscle stiffness / spasm ) due to multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .

in canada , sativex has conditional marketing authorization as an adjunctive treatment for neuropathic pain in adult patients with ms and "as adjunctive analgesic [pain relieving] treatment in adult patients with advanced cancer who experience moderate to severe pain during the highest tolerated dose of strong opioid therapy for persistent background pain. .

however , phase iii clinical trials previously conducted by gw pharmaceuticals found that sativex failed to show superiority over placebo in treating the pain of patients with advanced cancer who experience inadequate analgesia during optimized chronic opioid therapy .

furthermore , while cbd is predicted to have anti - inflammatory properties , which may play a role in its analgesic effects , preliminary evidence suggests that the analgesia is mediated by thc , and the extent to which cbd contributes to those therapeutic effects is unclear .

cbd is the subject of numerous ongoing randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) .

as of december 2019 , a database maintained by the national library of medicine ( nlm ) at the national institutes of health ( nih ) lists numerous domestic and international ongoing rcts involving cannabinoidsâincluding cbdâas a treatment for a variety of conditions , including chronic pain , tremors associated with parkinson's disease , and anxiety .

gw pharmaceuticals is also studying cbd and cbd variants in clinical trials for autism and schizophrenia .

other pharmaceutical manufacturers are conducting clinical trials with cbd and its variants for other indications , including severe acne and graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) .

however , until such studies are completed , conclusive evidence supporting the use of cbd to treat various health conditions is limited .

in february 2017 , the national academies of sciences , engineering , and medicine ( nasem ) published a comprehensive review of fair - and good - quality systematic reviews of literature and high - quality primary research on cannabis and cannabinoids .

nasem did not make specific comparisons between cannabinoids derived from hemp versus marijuana , or between cannabinoids from low versus high thc strains of marijuana .

however , for cbd or cbd - enriched cannabis specifically , the report noted research gaps among existing literature in treating numerous conditions , including cancer in general , chemotherapy - induced nausea , epilepsy , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , among other conditions .

nonetheless , cbd is promoted as treatment for a range of conditions , including ptsd , anxiety , inflammation , and sleeplessnessâdespite limited scientific evidence substantiating or disproving these claims .

these research gaps can be attributed , in part , to the status of marijuana as a schedule i controlled substance under the csa .

individuals who seek to conduct research on any controlled substance must do so in accordance with the csa and other federal laws .

dea research requirements are more stringent for schedule i and schedule ii substances than for substances in schedules iii - v. for example , for schedule i substances such as marijuana , even if practitioners have a dea registration for a substance in schedules ii - v , they must obtain a separate dea registration for researching a schedule i substance .

in addition , due to its schedule i status , the dea strictly limits the quantity of marijuana manufactured each year .

these requirements can prolong the process of acquiring marijuana ( including marijuana - derived cbd ) for research .

as mentioned previously , the 2018 farm bill removed hemp and hemp derivatives ( including hemp - derived cbd ) from the csa definition of marijuana , making them no longer subject to regulation and oversight as a controlled substance by dea .

dea has confirmed that a dea registration is no longer required to grow or research hemp plants and cbd preparations that meet the statutory definition of hemp .

however , cbd preparations containing above the 0.3% delta - 9 thc level ( i.e. , meeting the statutory definition of marijuana ) continue to be subject to schedule i csa requirements .

as a result , conducting research on these substances may continue to be a challenge .

as mentioned previously , fda has determined that at this time , cbd cannot be added to any food that is sold in interstate commerce and that cbd cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement .

although fda could issue a regulation allowing cbd to be added to food or allowing its use in dietary supplements , the agency has never issued such a regulation for any substance ( whether cannabis - derived or not ) that is an approved drug or authorized for investigation as a new drug .

although fda has determined that cbd ( and thc ) may not be added to food or marketed as a dietary supplement , the agency has not made this same determination for other compounds derived from cannabis , although those compounds may be subject to dea restrictions ; fda's determination is specific to cbd and thc because both are active ingredients in fda - approved drugs .

fda also has not determined that cbd may not be added to cosmetics ; however , if a cbd - containing cosmetic product makes therapeutic claims ( eg , that it is intended to diagnose , treat , cure , mitigate , or prevent a disease ) , fda would likely consider the product to be a drug subject to the new drug approval requirements .

cbd may be lawfully marketed as a drug , pursuant to fda approval , and in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements .

if a firm seeks to market cbd as a treatment or an otherwise therapeutic product , the firm generally would need to obtain premarket approval from fda via the new drug approval pathway .

to date , fda has approved one cbd - containing drug , epidiolex , which is available by prescription for the treatment of seizures associated with lennox - gastaut syndrome or dravet syndrome in patients two years old and older .

epidiolex is marketed by gw pharmaceuticals .

on may 31 , 2019 , fda held a public hearing "to obtain scientific data and information about the safety , manufacturing , product quality , marketing , labeling , and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis - derived compounds. .

prior to the hearing , fda had opened a docket to which interested stakeholders could submit a request for fda to review scientific data and information about products containing cannabis or cannabis - derived compounds .

although fda has maintained that it is unlawful to add cbd to food or to market cbd as a dietary supplement , cbd continues to be marketed in violation of this determination .

the agency has generally prioritized enforcement against companies and products that pose the greatest risk to consumersâfor example , products making claims that cbd can treat alzheimer's or stop cancer cell growth .

fda has said that it "does not have a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to any cbd products," although this is expected to change in light of language included in the explanatory statement accompanying the fy2020 enacted appropriation ( see " what could congress do to allow cbd to be marketed as a food additive or dietary supplement ? .

" ) .

some industry stakeholders are recommending that , absent an fda regulatory framework for cbd products , manufacturers and marketers of dietary supplements or foods that contain hemp or cbd comply with federal regulations for supplements and food in the interim to help ensure the quality of these cbd products .

such compliance would include facility registration , adherence to cgmps , and meeting labeling requirements .

in an effort to establish industry - wide standards , one organization has established its own third - party certification program designed for hemp food , dietary supplements , and cosmetic companies .

this certification program is independent of federal requirements , and fda has not validated or verified any third - party certification program for hemp .

at the retail level , consumer products labeled as containing cbd are being marketed and sold in food and beverages , cosmetics and personal care products , certain tobacco products , and dietary supplementsâdespite fda's position that cbd may not be sold in food and beverages or dietary supplements .

cbd - containing products that claim to meet the definition of hemp are sold through specialty retailers , such as natural / organic grocery stores , tobacco ( or smoke ) shops , yoga studios , and farmers' markets ; through direct - to - consumer and online sales ; from herbal practitioners ; and by large retailers such as cvs and walgreens .

although some industry analysts foresee a strong market for marijuana - derived cbd , it remains prohibited ( aside for lawful research purposes ) under the csa if the product does not meet the statutory definition of hemp in 7 u.s.c .

â§1639o .

the dea has confirmed that a dea registration is not required to grow or research hemp plants and cbd preparations that meet the statutory definition of hemp .

despite the federal prohibition on growing , selling , or possessing marijuana , marijuana - derived cbd products that have not been approved by fda have been made available in states where medical and / or recreational cannabis is legal under state law , in violation of federal law .

depending on where a cbd product is manufactured and sold , it may primarily be produced using only drug - grade cannabis and marketed as a medicinal or therapeutic product , in violation of fda requirements .

to date , most of the cbd products sold in states where medical and / or recreational cannabis is legal do not meet the statutory definition of hemp .

typically , these products contain 0.45% to 1.5% thc , with some products containing up to 9% thcâlevels that could result in psychoactive effects by the user .

in 2018 , cbd sales in the united states were estimated at $534 million , according to the hemp business journal .

this amount includes sales from hemp - derived cbd products , marijuana - derived cbd products ( currently a schedule i controlled substance ) , and the fda - approved drug epidiolex .

in 2018 , more than 1,000 companies were producing and marketing cbd products for the u.s. market .

since 2014 , when total cbd sales were a reported $108 million , u.s. sales of cbd have risen fivefold ( figure 3 ) .

in 2018 , hemp - and marijuana - derived cbd sales were $240 million and $264 million , respectively , while sales of epidiolex were estimated at $30 million ( figure 3 ) .

current projections of u.s. sales of cbd indicate expected growth over the next few years .

such sales are expected to exceed $1 billion in 2020 and reach nearly $2 billion in 2022 , roughly split between the three markets ( hemp - derived , marijuana - derived , and pharmaceutical cbd ; see figure 3 ) .

others forecast sales well beyond these levels , with some predicting that sales of hemp - derived cbd will eventually dominate the cannabis market , since hemp - derived cbd does not tend to carry the stigma associated with marijuana .

an atkearney survey shows that u.s. consumers , regardless of age , strongly believe that cannabis can "offer wellness and therapeutic benefits," ranging from 74% to 83% of those surveyed across all age demographics .

some global markets where cannabis is legal are already reporting product shortages of cbd medicinal cannabis products .

in the united states , growth in cbd sales is expected despite continued regulatory and legal uncertainty , given continued fda , dea , and state and local restrictions .

despite fda's current determination that cbd cannot be marketed as a food additive or a dietary supplement , these products continue to be sold .

in response , some members of congress have expressed support for a regulatory framework for hemp - derived cbd in certain fda - regulated consumer products .

in absence of a regulatory framework for hemp - derived cbd products , congress has directed fda to issue a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to cbd products that meet the statutory definition of hemp that also come under fda jurisdiction .

more specifically , the explanatory statement accompanying the enacted fy2020 appropriation states that [t]he agreement includes $2,000,000 for research , policy evaluation , market surveillance , issuance of an enforcement discretion policy , and appropriate regulatory activities with respect to products under the jurisdiction of the fda which contain cbd and meet the definition of hemp , as set forth in section 297a of the agricultural marketing act of 1946 ( 7 u.s.c .

16390 ) .

within 60 days of enactment of this act , the fda shall provide the committees with a report regarding the agency's progress toward obtaining and analyzing data to help determine a policy of enforcement discretion and the process in which cbd meeting the definition of hemp will be evaluated for use in products .

the fda is further directed to perform a sampling study of the current cbd marketplace to determine the extent to which products are mislabeled or adulterated and report to the committees within 180 days of enactment of this act .

the statement does not explicitly require fda to set a safe level or threshold for cbd in consumer products .

however , the activities conducted pursuant to this directive may inform the establishment of such a level in the future .

in addition to the activities directed in the explanatory statement , congress also could take further legislative action , such as requiring fda to issue a regulation , under its ffdca authorities , expressly permitting cbd that meets the definition of hemp to be used as a food additive or dietary supplement .

for example , such a regulation could prescribe the conditions under which cbd may be safely used as a food additive ( eg , to add flavor or nutritional value to food , in specified quantities , subject to specified labeling requirements ) .

however , because fda has never before issued such a regulation allowing an approved drug or a substance authorized for investigation as a new drug to be a food additive or added to a dietary supplement , it is not clear what such a regulation would look like .

congress also could consider amending the ffdca provisions that fda has identified as restricting marketing of cbd in food and dietary supplements .

for example , congress could exclude from these provisions cbd that meets the statutory definition of hemp .

however , even if the marketing of cbd - containing products were no longer restricted by these provisions , cbd - containing products may still be subject to other ffdca requirements .

for example , to lawfully market a cbd product as a dietary supplement , a firm may need to submit an ndi notification to fda , in addition to meeting other statutory and regulatory requirements for supplements .

to lawfully market cbd as a food additive , a firm would be expected to either obtain approval via a food additive petition or pursuant to a gras determination .

as fda has said that the agency "is not aware of any basis to conclude that cbd is gras among qualified experts for its use in human or animal food," a food additive petition may be necessary .

as mentioned above , food and dietary supplements are not evaluated by fda for safety and effectiveness prior to marketing .

given this fact , in determining whether a legislative approach is appropriate , congress may consider the potential for adverse health effects and other unintended consequences .

for example , clinical trials to support the approval of epidiolex demonstrated the potential for liver injury at certain doses , and cbd may interact with other drugs or dietary supplements .

other concerns include the potential dosing and cumulative effects of exposure to cbd from multiple sources ( eg , food , supplements , and cosmetics ) ; whether there are populations for whom cbd is not appropriate ( eg , pregnant or lactating women ) ; and whether allowing cbd to be marketed as a supplement or food additive could undermine incentives for conducting clinical trials and obtaining evidence of safety and effectiveness to support drug approval .

fda's position with respect to the status of cbd impacts other agencies' and regulatory bodies' policies and guidance .

for example , ttb consults with fda on alcohol ingredient safety issues and generally requires that any ingredient added to alcohol beverages must be either an fda - approved food additive or determined to be gras .

cbd is not an approved food additive nor has it been found to be gras for use in alcohol or otherwise .

it remains to be seen whether ttb would allow cbd that meets the definition of hemp to be added to alcoholic beverages if fda issues a policy of enforcement discretion as directed by the explanatory statement accompanying the fy2020 enacted appropriation .

similarly , the aafco has issued guidelines on hemp in animal food , which are generally consistent with fda's policy .

a new policy of enforcement discretion issued pursuant to the language in the explanatory statement may affect aafco's guidelines .

additionally , in may 2019 , the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) issued guidance that limits trademark registrations for cbd products .

uspto's guidance describes how it would review marks for cannabis and cannabis - related goods and services , and clarifies that compliance with federal law is a condition of federal trademark registration , regardless of the legality of the activities under state law .

it further states that a "determination of whether commerce involving cannabis and cannabis - related goods and services is lawful requires consultation of several different federal laws," including the csa , ffdca , and the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) .

therefore , "registration of marks for foods , beverages , dietary supplements , or pet treats containing cbd will still be refused as unlawful under the fdca , even if derived from hemp , as such goods may not be introduced lawfully into interstate commerce. .

some claim that because the guidance does not specifically address cosmetic products , this could suggest that federal uspto registration could be possible for such products ; however , they also assert that uspto is looking to fda to further clarify conditions under which cbd foods , beverages , dietary supplements or pet treats may be lawfully marketed .

appendix a .

food additive petition process and gras notification submission food additive petition process fda has determined that cbd cannot be added to any food that is sold in interstate commerce .

fda is authorized to issue a regulation , after notice and comment , approving the use of a drug ( eg , cbd ) as a food additive , although the agency has never done so for any substance .

the ffdca does not specify a process for fda to issue such a regulation , other than that it must be after notice and comment .

in regard to the process for food additive approval , fda is authorized to "by order establish a regulation" that prescribes the conditions under which a food additive may be safely used .

the issuance of such regulation may be proposed by fda on its own initiative or by an interested person via submission of a food additive petition .

a food additive petition must include , in addition to any explanatory or supporting data , the following information: the name and all pertinent information relating to the food additive , including its chemical identity and composition ( if possible ) ; a statement of the conditions of its proposed use , including directions , recommendations , and suggestions , and the proposed labeling ; "all relevant data bearing on the physical or other technical effect such additive is intended to produce , and the quantity of such additive required to produce such effect" ; a description of methods for determining the quantity of such additive in or on food , and any substance formed in or on food , because of its use ; and full reports of safety investigations , including the methods and controls used in conducting such investigations .

fda may request that the petitioner also provide information about the manufacturing methods , facilities , and controls , as well as samples of the food additive ( or articles used as its components ) and samples "of the food in or on which the additive is proposed to be used. .

additional requirements are specified in fda regulations .

within 30 days of the petition filing date , fda must publish notice in the federal register of the regulation proposed by the petitioner .

within 90 days of petition filing , fda must issue either an order denying the petition or an order establishing a regulation prescribing the conditions under which the food additive may be used safely ( eg , particular foods in which it may be used , maximum quantity , labeling and directions ) .

this 90-day period may be extended by fda , as specified .

fda may not issue such a regulation if a fair evaluation of the data "fails to establish that the proposed use of the food additive , under the conditions of use to be specified in the regulation , will be safe," subject to specified limitations , or if a fair evaluation of the data "shows that the proposed use of the additive would promote deception of the consumer in violation of [the ffdca] or would otherwise result in adulteration or in misbranding of food. .

fda is authorized to fix a "tolerance limitation" if necessary to ensure safe use of the additive .

in considering whether the use of a food additive is safe , fda must consider , among other relevant factors , the probable consumption of the additive and cumulative effect in the diet .

any person adversely affected by such order may file objections with fda and request a public hearing and may file for judicial review , as specified .

food additive regulations may be amended or repealed .

an interested person may , for example , submit a food additive petition requesting issuance of a regulation allowing a new use of a previously approved additive .

if a food additive is already subject to an fda regulation for the proposed intended use , it does not require premarket approval via a petition .

instead , that food additive may be marketed by complying with the applicable food additive regulation .

gras notice submission any person may submit a notice to fda expressing the view that a substance is gras and not subject to the premarket review requirements for food additives under ffdca section 409 .

a gras notice has seven parts , each of which must be included in a submission to fda .

if one of the seven parts of a gras notice is omitted , the submission must explain why that part does not apply .

the seven parts of a gras notice are as follows: 1. signed statements and certification ; 2. identity , method of manufacture , specifications , and physical or technical effect ; 3. dietary exposure ; 4. self - limiting levels of use ; 5. experience based on common use in food before 1958 ; 6. narrative ; and 7. a list of supporting data and information in the gras notice .

fda evaluates the submission to determine whether to file it and then informs the submitter of the agency's decision .

if fda decides to file the gras notice , the agency sends a letter to the submitter with the filing date .

the regulations do not specify a filing deadline for fda .

the regulations do state that fda is required to respond to a gras notice within 180 days of filing .

fda may extend that timeframe by 90 days as needed .

filed gras notices are made public by fda .
