in conference the cap was increased from 35% to 39% .

originally , both the houseand senate bills included amendments that would have restored the 35% broadcastownership cap , which had been increased to 45% by the fcc in june 2003 .

the 39%figure was a compromise with the white house , which promised to veto the omnibusbill if the limit was not raised .

the origins of the department date back to 1903 with theestablishment of the department of commerce and labor ( 32 stat .

825 ) .

theseparate department of commerce was established on march 4 , 1913 ( 37 stat .

equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) .

fy2004 appropriations .

according to the conference report ( h.rept .

108-401 ) on the omnibus appropriations bill ( h.r .

2673 ) , the eeoc's appropriation for fy2004 is $328.4 million .

 ( this is subject to a 0.59% across - the - board rescission. ) .

the house previously hadapproved the same sum .

the senate had approved $6.3 million more ( $334.7million ) in accordance with the administration's request .

the $328.4 million appropriation for fy2004 is almost $21.6 million more than the $306.8 million ( including the across - the - board rescission ) congress approved forthe agency in p.l .

108-7 , the fy2003 appropriations law .

because of a fundingshortfall during the year , the commission received an additional appropriation of $15million in the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act for fy2003 ( p.l .

108-11 ) .

accordingly , the omnibus bill's funding level for fy2004 is $6.6million above the total appropriated to the eeoc for the prior year .

while recognizing that the commission has solicited the different perspectives of stakeholders about its proposed restructuring effort , the conferees expressedconcern that the restructuring could affect the agency's quality of service .

accordingly , it instructed the eeoc to keep the committees on appropriationsapprized of any organizational changes in accordance with reprogrammingrequirements .

the conferees also urged the agency to continue its commendablemeasures aimed at cost saving and financial management discipline .

the conferenceagreement includes , by reference , language in the house report instructing the eeocto continue submitting quarterly reports on projected and actual spending and staffinglevels .

it similarly adopts , by reference , language in the house report aboutalternative dispute resolutions ( adr ) programs , namely , encouragement of theeeoc to rely on the experience of fair employment practices agencies ( fepas ) with mediation as the commission goes forward with its adr programs in order toreduce the average processing time of charges .

 ( fepas are state and local bodieswith which the agency has work - sharing agreements .

also included by reference tothe house report may be payment of $33.0 million to fepas ; the senate report wassilent on this matter. ) .

of the $334.7 million in appropriations for the eeoc that the president requested for fy2004 , $30.0 million would have been provided to fepas .

another$5 million of the total would have gone toward beginning implementation of a 5-yearrestructuring initiative based upon studies undertaken by the national academy ofpublic administration and by the agency's inspector general .

agency overview .

the eeoc enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race , color , nationalorigin , sex , age , or disability .

the commission's workload has increaseddramatically since it was created under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 .

passage of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the civil rights act of1991 , as well as employees' growing awareness of their rights , have made it difficultfor the agency's budget and staffing resources to keep pace with its heightenedcaseload .

fy2003 funding .

the president's budget request of $323.5 million for the eeoc for fy2003 included $14.7 millionto fund the agency's full share of federal employee retirement costs as part of theadministration's government - wide proposal .

without this expense , the fy2003budget request was $308.8 million .

the 108th congress approved the smaller figure in p.l .

108-7 .

after taking into account the across - the - board rescission , the fy2003 appropriation was $306.8million .

this is $3.4 million less than the fy2002 appropriation of $310.2 million ( including that year's rescission ) and $16.7 million less than the administration'sfy2003 budget request .

as a reflection of the importance congress places on the work of fepas , it directed that $33.0 million of the commission's fy2003 appropriation ( rather thanthe $30.0 million in the administration's proposal ) be directed toward their funding .

the higher allocation allowed for a contract rate of $500 per charge .

the conferees to the fy2003 cjs appropriations bill expressed concern about the lack of sound managerial and fiscal practices that led to the possibility of a budgetshortfall for the year and instructed the commission to prevent this eventualitythrough savings in salary expenses and other operational costs .

they further requiredthe eeoc to submit to the appropriations committees , within 60 days of the bill'senactment in february 2003 , a financial plan including steps the commission wouldtake to stay within its fy2003 appropriation level .

as noted above , however,congress approved an additional $15 million for the eeoc to avoid furloughs duringthe fiscal year .

 ( the funds could be used to pursue employee buyouts. ) .

againexpressing concern about the agency's managerial and fiscal practices that allowedthis situation to develop , the conferees to the supplemental appropriations billrequired the eeoc to submit quarterly reports ( including projected and actualspending and staffing levels ) to the appropriations committees ( h.rept .

108-76 ) .

federal communications commission ( fcc ) .

the federal communications commission , created in 1934,is an independent agency charged with regulating interstate and foreign radio,television , wire , cable , and satellite communications .

of the amounts provided , $272,958,000 will be derived from offsettingfee collections , resulting in a net direct appropriation of $1,000,000 .

the fcc isallocated up to $85,000,000 to administer the spectrum auctions program .

thefollowing additional provisions were also included: increases the broadcast - ownership cap for national audience reach from 35 to 39 percent .

originally , both the house and senate bills includedamendments that would have restored the 35 percent broadcast ownership cap , whichwas increased to 45 percent by the fcc in june 2003 .

the 39 percent figure was acompromise with the white house , which promised to veto the omnibus bill if thelimit was not raised .

requires that the fcc expend for enforcement in fy2004 anamount equal to or greater than the amount expended for enforcement in fy2003 .

infy2003 , the fcc expended $66,170,000 on enforcement activities ( excluding$1,776,000 associated with one time equipment purchases and the relocation of aremote facility in alaska ) .

references language included in the house and senate reportsexpressing concern about the declining standards of broadcast television and theimpact that decline is having on america's children .

more specifically , the fcc wasdirected to continue to report to congress on issues associated with "resurrecting abroadcast industry code of conduct for programming content. .

references language in he senate report requiring audits of theuniversal service fund ( usf ) ( including the e - rate program ) be drawn from usffunds rather than office of inspector general funds .

references language expressing pleasure at the fcc'sdevelopment of wireless portability requirements .

federal trade commission ( ftc ) .

for fy2004 , the administration requested a program level of $191 million for theftc , an increase of $14 million over the fy2003 level .

the requested program levelfor fy2004 was to have been fully funded by a $14 million direct appropriation andoffsetting collections from two sources: $159 million from fees forhart - scott - rodino premerger notification filings ; and $18 million from feessufficient to implement and enforce new do - not - call provisions of thetelemarketing sales rule .

the house approved a program level of $183 million forthe ftc .

the senate recommended a program level of $189 million .

congressenacted $186 million for the ftc .

for fy2000 through fy2002 , zero ( $0 ) direct appropriationswere required .

for fy2003 , the president's budget requested $171.6 million for theagency , an increase of approximately $15.6 million more than the ftc received forfy2002 .

the conference agreement provided the ftc with an fy2003 programlevel of $176.6 million ; with offsetting fee collections , the agency received a finaldirect appropriation of $8.5 million .

legal services corporation ( lsc ) .

the lsc is a private , non - profit , federally - fundedcorporation that provides grants to local offices that , in turn , provide legal assistanceto low - income people in civil ( non - criminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversialsince its incorporation in the early 1970s , and has been operating without authorizinglegislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy offunding for the agency , and the extent to which certain types of activities areappropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annualappropriations laws , congress traditionally has included legislative provisionsrestricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting representationin certain types of cases or conducting any lobbying activities .

p.l .

108-7 , the consolidated appropriations for fy2003 , among other things increased the lsc funding by $9.5 million to $338.8 million to offset decennialcensus funding reallocations .

the additional $9.5 million is to provide supplementalfunding for states that were scheduled to receive less funding for fy2003 than thestate received in fy2002 because of the use of data from the 2000 census whichshowed a shift in state poverty populations .

the fy2003 appropriation for the lscincluded $310 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ofthose programs , $13.3 million for management and administration , $3.4 million forclient self - help and information technology , and $2.6 million for the inspectorgeneral .

the $338.8 million lsc appropriation for fy2003 issubject to the mandated 0.65% across - the - board government - wide rescission , whichreduced the lsc appropriation to $336.6 million for fy2003 .

current funding stillremains below the corporation's highest level of $400 million in fy1994 andfy1995 .

for fy2004 , the bush administration requested $329.3 million for the lsc .

this is $7.3 million less than the $336.6 million ( after the rescission ) that wasappropriated for the lsc for fy2003 .

the fy2004 budget request for the lscincludes $310 million for basic field programs and required independent audits,$14.5 million for management and administration , $2.2 million for client self - helpand information technology , and $2.6 million for the inspector general .

the budgetrequest for the lsc also includes existing provisions restricting the activities of lscgrantees .

on july 16 , 2003 , the house appropriations committee recommended a total of $338.8 million for the lsc for fy2004 .

this is $2.2 million above the fy2003appropriation for lsc ( the same amount as the original fy2003 appropriation beforethe 0.65% rescission ) ; and $9.5 million above the bush administration's fy2004budget request for the lsc .

the fy2004 house committee recommendation for thelsc includes $319.5 million for basic field programs and required independentaudits , $13.3 million for management and administration , $3.4 million for clientself - help and information technology , and $2.6 million for the inspector general .

108-401 ) on a consolidated appropriations bill .

the conferenceagreement includes $338,848,000 for the lsc , as proposed in both the house andsenate bills .

it also includes existing provisions restricting theactivities of lsc grantees .

moreover , h.r .

2673 authorizes a 0.59%across - the - board government - wide rescission and an additional 0.465% uniformrescission applicable only to funding for the commerce , justice , state , and relatedagencies appropriation ( which includes the lsc ) , thereby lowering the fy2004 lscappropriation to $335.3 million .

the senate passed h.r .

2673 on january22 , 2004 .

h.r .

securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .

the sec administers and enforces federal securities laws toprotect investors and maintain fair and orderly stock and bond markets .

the seccollects fees on various securities market transactions .

during the stock marketboom of the 1990s , these collections exceeded the agency's budget by a wide margin .

107-123 ) reduced these fees , with theintention of limiting collections to approximately the amount of the sec's budget .

for fy2003 , the administration requested $466.9 million for the sec , an increase of 6.6% over fy2002 .

in the wake of enron and other corporate accountingscandals , broad support emerged in congress for a much larger increase in the sec'sbudget .

the sarbanes - oxley accounting reform legislation ( p.l .

107-204 ) authorizedfy2003 appropriations of $775.0 million .

the 107th congress senateappropriations committee approved $750.5 million , 60% more than theadministration requested .

p.l .

108-199 , the omnibus appropriations measure,approves the $811.5 million .

of the total , $691.5 million is to come from feecollections , and $120 million from prior year unobligated balances .

small business administration ( sba ) .

for fy2004 , the administration had requested a totalappropriation of $801 million for the sba , an increase of $69 million or 9.4% overthe agency's fy2003 funding .

the fy2004 request included $360 million forsalaries and expenses ( s&e ) , an increase of approximately $48 million or 13% morethan sba received for fy2003 .

the house approved $745.6 million for the sba,which would have been roughly a 1.9% increase over the fy2003 amount .

thehouse - approved version included $326.6 million for s&e , about $33.6 million belowthe administration request .

the senate appropriations committee recommended$751.7 million for the agency , including $332.4 million for s&e .

congressappropriated $718.3 million for fy2004 , or $18.2 million less than sba received forfy2003 .

the conference agreement provides sbawith a total appropriation of $736.5 million , including $314 million for s&e .

the sba is an independent federal agency created by the small business act of 1953 .

although the agency administers a number of programs intended to assistsmall firms , arguably its three most important functions are to guarantee - - principally through the agency's section 7 ( a ) general business loan program - - business loans made by banks and other financial institutions ; to make long - term,low - interest loans to small businesses that are victims of hurricanes , earthquakes,other physical disasters , and acts of terrorism ; and to serve as an advocate for smallbusiness within the federal government .

state justice institute ( sji ) .

the institute is a private , nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts andconducts activities to further the development of judicial administration in statecourts throughout the united states .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sjiis authorized to present its request directly to congress , apart from the president'sbudget .

for fy2004 , the sji requested $8 million , compared with $3 millionappropriated to it for fy2003 .

for its part , the president's fy2004 budget proposednothing for sji .

subsequently , the house , in passing its fy2004 cjs appropriationsbill , provided $3 million for sji .

the senate appropriations committeerecommended a $5 million appropriation .

however , in its report , the senatecommittee ( at s. rept .

108-144 , p. 178 ) earmarked all of the $5 million for specifiedstate projects , reserving no funds for salaries of sji staff or for discretionary grantsby the institute .

the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 ( p.l .

108-199 ) ,signed into law by the president on january 23 , 2004 , provides $2.25 million for theinstitute , with none of the funding earmarked .

in the fy2002 annual appropriations cycle , congress had scaled back the institute's funding significantly , approving $3.0 million , instead of $6.835 millionand $6.2 million approved earlier by the house and senate respectively .

the actionto reduce sji funding occurred at the conference committee stage .

in their report , thefy2002 conferees stated that the $3.0 million appropriated for the sji was "availablefor fiscal year 2002 only" and that the conferees did not recommend continuedfederal support for the institute beyond fy2002 .

"the termination of funding for thisprogram," the report explained , "does not necessarily mean the dissolution of theinstitute. .

the conferees encouraged the institute to solicit private donations andresources from state and local agencies .

conferees for the fy2003 omnibus fundingbill , however , noted ( in h.rept .

108-10 ) that sji had "not been successful in itsefforts to obtain non - federal funds" ; the conferees , therefore , had included $3 million"to keep sji operating. .

at the same time , the conferees encouraged sji to continueto solicit donations from state , local , and national bar associations .

in its recommendations for fy2004 , the house appropriations committee ( at h. rept .

108-221 , p. 156 ) , said it understood that the institute had continued tocontact bar associations and state court organizations .

while "these organizationssupport sji , and enjoy grant funding and services from sji," the committee said,"they are not inclined to contribute to operations of the sji beyond matching grantfunding for individual projects. .

the house committee encouraged sji to apply forfunding from the office of justice programs ( ojp ) in the department of justice,noting that a variety of grant programs to assist state courts exist within ojp .

in asimilar vein , conferees for the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 ( at h.rept .

108-401 , at p. 642 ) encouraged sji "to work with the office of justiceprograms on issues involving state courts" and "to apply for funding under ojp grantprograms that support state court programs. .

earlier , in november 2002 , the attorney general , as mandated by p.l .

107-179 , transmitted to the house and senate judiciary committees a report on theeffectiveness of the institute in carrying out its statutory duties .

the report concludedby stating , among other things , that sji appeared "to have been effective in awardinggrants to improve the quality of justice in the state courts , facilitating bettercoordination and information sharing between state and federal courts , and fosteringsolutions to common problems faced by all courts. .

 ( see report [of the attorneygeneral] on the state justice institute pursuant to public law 107-179 , transmittednovember 2002 to the committee on judiciary , u.s. senate , and committee on thejudiciary , u.s. house of representatives , available at: http: / / www.statejustice.org / attorney_general_evaluation.htm . ) .

commission on civil rights .

for fy2004 , the administration requested roughly $9.1 million .

this amount wasroughly $59,000 more than the fy2003 appropriation of 9.04 million .

the houseappropriations committee also recommended $9.1 million , which was approved bythe full house on july 23 , 2003 .

the senate appropriations committee legislationwould have matched the administration request .

the fy2004 enacted funding levelis $9.1 million .

u.s. commission on international religious freedom .

the administration requested $3 million for thecommission in fy2004 .

this amount is $135,000 more than the fy2003 amount of$2.865 million .

the house cjs bill set funding at $3 million .

the senateappropriations committee recommended $2 million , which would be $875,000 lessthan its fy2003 amount .

the enacted level for fy2004 equals the administrationrequest and house level of $3 million .
