bertelsmann stiftung , a private foundation based in germany , has published the bertelsmann transformation index ( bti ) biannually since 2006 .

key regional findings and country reports are available in english ( bti publishes the full regional report in german ) .

bti 2018 evaluates the quality of democracy , a market economy , and political management in 129 developing and transition countries .

for political transformation specifically , bti ranks countries using 18 indicators grouped into five criteria: ( 1 ) stateness , ( 2 ) political participation , ( 3 ) rule of law , ( 4 ) stability of democratic institutions , and ( 5 ) political and social integration .

based on the criteria , bti assigns a category: democracy in consolidation , defective democracy , highly defective democracy , moderate autocracy , and hardline autocracy .

with the exception of cuba , the dominican republic , haiti , and jamaica , bti does not evaluate caribbean nations .

the economist intelligence unit ( eiu ) , based in london and new york , has offices and analysts in various countries .

since 2006 , eiu has produced a democracy index that provides an annual snapshot of the state of democracy for 165 independent states and two territories .

freedom house is a u.s. - based ngo that conducts research on democracy , political freedom , and human rights worldwide .

freedom house assigns each country 0 to 4 points on 25 indicators ( 10 political rights indicators and 15 civil liberties indicators ) for a total of up to 100 points .

the scores determine numerical ratings for political rights and civil liberties freedoms on a scale of 1 ( most free ) to 7 ( least free ) .

the political rights and civil liberties ratings are averaged to produce an overall status of free , partly free , or not free .

freedom house's report covering 2018 found that nicaragua was the country with the greatest decline in the world regarding conditions for political rights and civil liberties as compared to 2017 .

venezuela had the third - greatest decline ; brazil , el salvador , and guatemala also made the top 20 for steepest declines .

the report's analysis is based on data that are detailed in full on the freedom house web page on "countries," which ranks the state of democracy for 197 countries and 15 territories .
