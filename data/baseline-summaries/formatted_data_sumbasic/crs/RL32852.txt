the bush administration's fy2006 budget request was released in february 2005 .

after the budget was submitted , both the house and the senate appropriations committees voted to reorganize the subcommittee structure , and with it the programs included in specific appropriations bills .

under the reorganization , the energy and water development appropriations bill acquired department of energy ( doe ) programs that previously had been included in the appropriations bill for interior and related agencies .

including these programs , the requested amount for fy2006 energy and water development totaled $29.75 billion .

for fy2005 , $30.17 billion was appropriated for comparable programs ( including emergency supplemental appropriations for the corps of engineers ) .

the house appropriations energy and water development subcommittee marked up its bill on may 11 , 2005 , and the full committee reported out h.r .

2419 on may 18 ( h.rept .

109-86 ) .

the house passed the bill may 24 .

h.r .

2419 would have appropriated $29.75 billion for fy2006 for energy and water development programs , including those formerly included in the interior and related agencies bill .

the senate appropriations committee reported out its version of h.r .

2419 on june 16 ( s.rept .

109-84 ) .

the bill totaled $31.245 billion .

the senate approved the bill june 30 by a vote of 92-3 .

on november 7 , 2005 , the house - senate conference on h.r .

2419 agreed to a bill funding these programs at $30.49 billion .

the house approved the conference report ( h.rept .

109-275 ) on november 9 ; the senate approved it on november 14 .

president bush signed the bill on november 19 ( p.l .

109-103 ) .

the energy and water development bill has historically included funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , most of doe , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

with the reorganization of the appropriations subcommittees , doe programs that had been funded in the interior and related agencies bill were transferred to the energy and water development bill .

the bush administration's request was $29.747 billion for all of the programs now included in the energy and water bill for fy2006 , compared with $30.169 billion appropriated for fy2005 .

the house bill , h.r .

2419 , as reported out by the house appropriations committee may 18 and passed by the house may 24 , would have appropriated $29.746 billion for energy and water development programs for fy2006 .

the senate version of h.r .

2419 , as reported out by the senate appropriations committee june 16 and passed by the senate june 30 , would have appropriated $31.245 billion .

the conference report on h.r .

2419 ( h.rept .

109-275 ) funded fy2006 programs at $30.488 billion .

the major actions by the conference committee were to raise funding for the corps of engineers by $749 million over the requested amount , in the wake of the katrina and rita disasters , and to resolve a difference in the house and senate bills regarding reprogramming of funding and contracts for corps projects .

 ( see " title i: corps of engineers ." ) .

the conference also reduced funding for the yucca mountain nuclear waste disposal project .

 ( see " title iii: department of energy ," " nuclear waste disposal ." ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy1999 to fy2006 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the four titles .

the table also lists several "scorekeeping" adjustments of accounts within the four titles , reflecting various expenditures or sources of revenue besides appropriated funds .

these adjustments affect the total amount appropriated in the bill but are not included in the totals of the individual titles .

amounts listed in this report are derived from the report of the conference committee on h.r .

2419 ( h.rept .

109-275 ) .

for the corps in fy2006 , the administration requested $4.32 billion , a decrease of $1.044 billion from the enacted appropriation for fy2005 .

it asked for $951 million for fy2006 for the department of the interior ( doi ) programs included in the energy and water development bill: the bureau of reclamation and the central utah project .

this would have been a decrease of $66 million from the fy2005 funding level .

the house bill would have funded the corps at $4.746 billion , and the doi programs at $1.011 billion .

the senate bill would have appropriated $5.298 billion for the corps and $1.081 billion for the interior programs .

the conference bill provided $5.383 billion for the corps and $1.065 billion for the doi programs .

the fy2006 request for doe programs was $24.213 billion , about $200 million less than the previous year .

the house bill would have appropriated $24.318 billion , and the senate bill $25.077 billion .

the major activities in the doe budget are energy research and development , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs .

also included in the doe total is funding of doe's programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , and energy statistics , which had historically been included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

the conference bill funded all doe programs at $24.290 billion .

the fy2006 request for funding the independent agencies in title iv of the bill was $234 million , compared with $289 million appropriated for fy2005 .

the house bill reduced the funding to $207 million .

the senate bill would have appropriated $307 million .

the conference bill appropriated $271 million .

tables 4 through 15 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2005-fy2006 .

the energy and water development appropriations bill approved by the house , h.r .

2419 , included $4.746 billion for the corps' fy2006 budget , $414 million more than requested .

for the department of the interior , the energy and water development bill provides funding for the central utah project completion account and the bureau of reclamation ( bor ) .

until this year , the energy and water development bill has included funding for most , but not all , of doe's programs ; some other doe programs were funded in the interior and related agencies bill .

major doe activities historically funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs .

the subcommittee reorganization of the appropriations committees transferred doe's programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics , formerly included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill , to the energy and water development bill .

including the transferred programs , the total request for title iii for fy2006 was $24.213 billion , compared to $24.419 billion appropriated for fy2005 ( excluding the adjustments noted in table 3 ) .

the house appropriations committee recommended $24.318 billion , and the house approved that amount in passing h.r .

2419 .

the senate version of h.r .

2419 would have appropriated $25.077 billion .

the conference bill , p.l .

109-103 , appropriated $24.290 billion .

in reporting out h.r .

2419 , the house appropriations committee listed the transferred programs in title iii so as to integrate them with the existing programs .

in particular , the energy efficiency programs transferred from the interior bill were combined with the renewable energy programs in the energy and water bill into a single account , energy efficiency and renewable energy supply r&d .

the senate and the conference followed the same order .

in table 7 below , the title iii programs are listed in the order presented in the house report .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .
