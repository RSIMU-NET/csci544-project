this report describes the president's fy2006 request for funding for dhs programs and activities , as submitted to congress on february 7 , 2005 .

this report compares the enacted fy2005 amounts to the request for fy2006 .

this report will also track legislative action and congressional issues related to the fy2006 dhs appropriations bill , with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts .

however , this report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory funding — such as retirement pay — nor does the report systematically follow any legislation related to the authorization or amendment of dhs programs .

the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-296 ) transferred the functions , relevant funding , and most of the personnel of 22 agencies and offices to the new department of homeland security ( dhs ) created by the act .

dhs is organized into four major directorates : border and transportation security ( bts ) ; emergency preparedness and response ( epr ) ; science and technology ( s&t ) ; and information analysis and infrastructure protection ( iaip ) .

bts , the largest of the four directorates , contains three main agencies: customs and border protection ( cbp ) ; immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) ; and transportation security administration ( tsa ) .

epr is comprised primarily of the former federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , and iaip houses the homeland security operations center ( hsoc ) , information analysis ( ia ) and the infrastructure protection ( ip ) offices .

s&t is home to the office of national laboratories , homeland security laboratories , and the homeland security advanced research projects agency ( hsarpa ) .

u.s .

citizenship and immigration ( uscis ) , the u.s. coast guard , and the u.s. secret service are all stand - alone agencies within dhs directly under the secretary of homeland security .

appropriations measures for dhs have been organized into four titles: title i departmental management and operations ; title ii security , enforcement , and investigations ; title iii preparedness and recovery ; and title iv research and development , training , assessments , and services .

title i contains appropriations for the office of management , the office of the secretary , the office of the chief financial officer ( cfo ) , the office of the chief information officer ( cio ) , and the office of the inspector general ( oig ) .

title ii contains appropriations for the office of the undersecretary for bts , cbp , immigration ice , tsa , the coast guard , the secret service , and the newly proposed office of screening operations ( sco ) .

title iii contains appropriations for epr and the office of state and local government coordination and preparedness ( slgcp ) .

title iv contains appropriations for uscis , iaip , s&t , and the federal law enforcement training center ( fletc ) .

title ii funds security , enforcement , and investigations .

the largest component of title ii was the directorate of border and transportation security ( bts ) .

bts was comprised of the office of the under secretary for bts , cbp , ice , and tsa .

for fy2006 , the administration proposed the creation of sco within bts ( now located in the office of policy under p.l .

109-90 ) , that would coordinate the passenger ( and to some extent the cargo ) screening operations of bts .

also included in title ii ( though they were not operationally a part of the bts directorate ) are the u.s. coast guard , and the u.s. secret service .

with the passage of p.l .

109-90 the office of the undersecretary for bts is eliminated , and the agencies ( cbp , ice , and tsa ) that were a part of bts report directly to the office of the secretary .

table 7 shows the fy2005 enacted and fy2006 requested appropriations for title ii .

the administration requested an appropriation of $20.6 billion in net discretionary budget authority for title ii for fy2006 .

this amount represented a decrease of $13 million or less than 1% decrease compared to the fy2005 enacted total of $20.7 billion .

while almost every account in title ii is up , the requested gross increase of $2,138 million from fy2005 to fy2006 is more than offset by the total increase in offsetting collections of $2,202 million in title ii ; $1,780 million of which would be the result of the proposed fee increase within tsa .

for the fy2006 request , the bts directorate accounts for 67% of total appropriated dhs budget authority , while title ii accounts for 69% of total appropriated dhs budget authority .

house - passed h.r .

2360 recommended a net appropriation of nearly $22 billion for activities and agencies of title ii .

this amount represented a $1.4 billion or nearly 7% increase over the president's requested level for fy2006 , and a $728 million or 3% increase over the fy2005 enacted level ( including supplemental appropriations ) .

h.rept .

109-79 did not approve the tsa security fee increase requested by the administration .

house - passed h.r .

2360 therefore shows an increased appropriation , as compared to the administration's request .

house - passed h.r .

2360 provided $22 billion for title ii , which accounts for 69% of total dhs budget authority .

senate - passed h.r .

2360 provided $22.2 billion for the activities of title ii .

this amount represented an increase of $1,625 million or 7% as compared to the president's request , an increase of $203 million or 1% as compared to the house - passed amount ; and an increase of $931 million or 4% as compared to the fy2005 enacted amount .

the $22.2 billion that would have been provided by the senate - passed version of h.r .

2360 would have accounted for 70% of total dhs budget authority in fy2006 .

p.l .

109-90 provides $22.4 billion for the activities of title ii , representing and increase of $141 million or less than 1% as compared to fy2005 , an increase of $1,835 million or 9% as compared to the request for fy2006 , an increase of $403 million or 2% as compared to the house - passed version of h.r .

2360 , and an increase of $208 million or 1% as compared to the senate - passed version of h.r .

2360 .

title iii preparedness and recovery , provides funding for the office of state and local government coordination and preparedness ( slgcp ) , which includes the office for domestic preparedness .

in addition , title iii funds the emergency preparedness and response ( epr ) directorate .

table 8 shows the fy2005 enacted and fy2006 requested appropriations for title iii .

the administration requested an appropriation of $6,710 million in net budget authority for title iii for fy2006 .

this amount represents an 4% decrease compared to the fy2005 enacted total of $6,963 million ( not including $2,508 million for bioshield ) .

for the fy2006 request , title iii accounts for 22% of requested net appropriated dhs budget authority ; 10% for epr , and 12% for slcgp .

the house - passed version of h.r .

2360 recommended an appropriation of $6,688 million in net budget authority for title iii , represents a $21 million or less than 1% decrease compared to the president's request .

the senate - passed version of h.r .

2360 recommended $6,336 million for the activities of title iii , representing a decrease of $374 million or nearly 6% compared to the fy2006 request ; and a decrease of $352 million or 5% as compared to house - passed h.r .

2360 .

p.l .

109-90 provides $6,666 million for the activities of title iii .

this amount includes $625 million for infrastructure protection and information security ( ipis ) activities that were transferred from the now disbanded iaip directorate in title iv , pursuant to the secretary's reorganization proposal .

activities funded by title iv include the bureau of citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) , iaip , fletc , and the s&t .

table 8 shows the fy2005 enacted and fy2006 requested appropriations for title iv .

the administration requested an appropriation of $4,320 million in gross budget authority for title iv in fy2006 , representing an 8% increase over the enacted fy2005 level of $4,011 million .

the administration requested an appropriation of $2,546 million in net budget authority for title iv in fy2006 , representing a 6% increase over the fy2005 enacted level of $2,392 million .

of the requested net appropriation for dhs for fy2006: uscis accounts for less than 1% ; iaip accounts for 3% ; s&t accounts for 5% ; fletc accounts for less than 1% ; and all title iv accounts combined account for 8% of requested net appropriated dhs budget authority .

house - passed h.r .

2360 recommended a net appropriation of $2,522 million in net budget authority for title iv in fy2006 , representing a $126 million or nearly 5% increase as compared to the fy2005 enacted amount ; and a $24 million or 1% decrease as compared to the fy2006 request .

the senate - passed version of h.r .

2360 would have provided $2,686 million for the activities of title iv , representing an increase of $140 million , or 5% , compared to the fy2006 request ; an increase of $164 million , or 7% , compared to the amount provided in the house - passed version of h.r .

2360 ; and an increase of $290 million , or 12% , compared to the fy2005 enacted amount .

p.l .

109-90 provides $1,899 million for the activities of title iv .

this does not include funding for iaip ( see tablenote b to table 10 ) .

p.l .

109-148 contains a number of provisions that impact dhs budget accounts .

division a of p.l .

109-148 contains the department of defense ( dod ) appropriations act for fy2006 .

division b of p.l .

109-148 contains emergency supplemental appropriations to address hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and the pandemic influenza in 2006 .

division b also contains a number of rescissions that affect dhs accounts , including an across - the - board rescission of 1% .

division a , title ix of the dod appropriations act ( p.l .

109-148 ) contains a provision that transfers up to $100 million to the coast guard's operating expenses account from the iraq freedom fund .

these funds are available for transfer until september 30 , 2007 , and are to be used only to support operations in iraq or afghanistan and classified activities .

division b , title iii , chapter 8 , of p.l .

109-148 contains a 1% across - the - board ( atb ) rescission that is to be applied to all discretionary fy2006 appropriations .

specifically , sec .

3801 rescinds 1% of: the budget authority provided ( or obligation limit imposed ) for fy2006 for any discretionary account in any prior and in any other fy2006 appropriations act ; the budget authority provided in any advance appropriation for fy2006 for any discretionary account in any prior fiscal year appropriation ; and the contract authority provided in fy2006 for any program subject to limitation contained in any fy2006 appropriation act .

the atb rescission does not apply to emergency appropriations ( as defined by sec .

402 of h.con.res .

95 , the fy2006 budget resolution ) , nor does it apply to the discretionary budget authority made available to the department of veterans affairs .

at the time of the final update of this report , it was unclear how the rescission would be applied across dhs discretionary accounts .

division b , title i , chapter 4 , of p.l .

109-148 provides emergency supplemental appropriations to various dhs accounts to address the impacts of hurricane katrina .

on october 28 , 2005 , the president submitted a request to congress to reallocate $17.1 billion of the $60 billion previously appropriated by congress to fema's disaster relief fund ( drf ) to respond to hurricanes katrina , rita , wilma , and other disasters .

the congressional response to this request was included in title i of division b of p.l .

109-148 ; the rescissions ( from dhs accounts ) funding this request were included in title iii of division b of p.l .

109-148 .

most of the additional funding provided to dhs accounts is to be used to repair and / or replace dhs equipment and facilities lost or damage by the hurricanes .

these include: $24.1 million for cbp's salaries and expenses account ; $10.4 million for cbp's construction account ; $13 million for ice's salaries and expenses account ; $132 million for the coast guard's operating expenses account ; $74.5 million for the coast guard's acquisition , construction , and improvements account ; $3.6 million for the secret service's salaries and expenses account ; $10.3 million for odp's state and local programs account ; and 17.2 million for fema's administrative and regional operations account .

this section of p.l .

109-148 also transfers $1.5 million ( of the funds previously appropriated to this account by p.l .

109-62 , see supplemental funds for hurricane katrina below ) from fema's disaster relief account to the "disaster assistance direct loan program account" to carry out the direct loan program .

all of the funds provided to dhs accounts under this section of p.l .

109-148 are designated as emergency funds .

title iii , chapter 4 , of division b of p.l .

109-148 contains rescissions affecting dhs accounts .

these include: $23.4 billion in funds previously appropriated by p.l .

109-62 , from fema's disaster relief account ; and $260.5 million in funds previously appropriated by p.l .

109-90 , from the coast guard's operating expenses account .

division b , title ii , chapter 4 of p.l .

109-148 provides an additional $47.3 million for the dhs office of the secretary and executive management account .

these funds are for "necessary expenses to train , plan , and prepare for a potential outbreak of highly pathogenic influenza. .

these funds are designated as emergency funds .

during the conference consideration of h.r .

2863 , two other divisions , c and d were inserted into the conference report ( h.rept .

109-359 ) attached to the bill .

division c , the american energy independence and security act of 2005 , would have allowed oil well drilling in alaska's national wildlife refuge ( anwr ) .

division d , contained provisions that would have distributed the revenues from the anwr drilling .

among the items that would have been funded with these revenues was more than $1 billion in additional border security funding for dhs .

after a contentious floor debate concerning the attachment of the anwr provisions to the defense appropriations bill , both divisions c and d were removed from the bill by s.con.res .

74 , the enrollment correction measure , and are not included in p.l .

109-148 .

in response to the widespread destruction brought to the gulf coast by hurricane katrina , the 109 th congress has completed action on two separate emergency supplemental bills ( p.l .

109-61 / h.r .

3645 and p.l .

109-62 / h.r .

3673 ) which together provide an additional $62.3 billion for emergency response and recovery needs .

of the combined amount provided in the two measures , $60 billion is for the ongoing efforts of fema to provide emergency food , shelter , and medical care to areas stricken by the hurricane and other disasters .

in addition , $1.9 billion is for the department of defense to defray the cost of deploying military personnel to the region for rescue , relief , and for other response costs , and $400 million is for the army corps of engineers to restore navigation waterways and repair damaged flood control projects in affected gulf states .

additional requests for supplemental funding may be forthcoming in the weeks and months ahead as loss and recovery statements , and assessments of the damage caused by hurricane rita become available .

the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget .

the senate budget resolution , s.con.res .

18 was introduced on march 11 , 2005 , and passed the senate on march 17 , 2005 .

s.con.res .

18 provides $848.8 billion in discretionary spending .

the house budget resolution , h.con.res .

95 , was introduced on march 11 , 2005 , and passed the house on march 17 , 2005 .

h.con.res .

95 proposes $843 billion in discretionary budget authority .

on april 28 , 2005 the conference committee reported , and both the house and senate passed , h.rept .

109-62 providing $843 billion in discretionary budget authority for fy2006 .

on february 14 , 2005 , the president submitted an $81.9 billion request for supplemental fy2005 funding for military operations , international affairs , intelligence , and homeland security activities .

the request includes an additional $161 million for the coast guard to offset the costs of operations in iraq .

the request for coast guard includes $111 million for operations in support of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom , including port security and law enforcement capabilities ; strategic waterside security teams ; and funding of active duty and mobilized reserve personnel .

the request further includes $49 million for the retrofit , renovation and subsystem replacement of coast guard 110-foot patrol boats .

the supplemental request also includes $110 million for the department of energy's megaports initiative .

this initiative provides for the deployment of radiation detection technology and law enforcement personnel to foreign ports ( in this case the funding would be for four specific ports ) to detect , deter , and interdict nuclear and other radioactive material .

though this request is for the doe , the megaports initiative supports cbp's csi program .

h.r .

1268 was introduced on march 11 , 2005 , and passed the house march 16 , 2005 .

the bill passed the senate on april 21 , 2005 .

the conference committee reported the conference report ( h.rept .

109-72 ) was filed on may 3 , 2005 .

h.rept .

109-72 was agreed to in the house on may 5 , 2005 ; and was agreed to in the senate on may 10 , 2005 .

the president signed h.r .

1268 on may 11 , 2005 , and the bill became p.l .

109-13 .

within dhs , p.l .

109-13 provides cbp with an additional $125 million for 500 new border patrol agents above the fy2005 enacted level , and with $52 million in additional construction funding ; ice with an additional $454 million for additional investigators , enforcement agents , detention officers and detention bedspace ; coast guard with an additional $161 million as requested ( see above ) ; and fletc with an additional $4 million .

as enacted , p.l .

109-13 also includes the real id act of 2005 .

appendix a. dhs appropriations in context dhs appropriations and federal homeland security spending since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts .

the office of management and budget , as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act , has published an annual report to congress on combating terrorism .

beginning with the june 24 , 2002 edition of this report , homeland security was included as a part of the analysis .

in subsequent years , this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined , as distinctions ( and account lines ) between homeland and non - homeland security activities have become more precise .

this means that while table a - 1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons , they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis , as outlined above .

with regard to dhs funding , it is important to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts .

in fact , while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within dhs , the dhs homeland security request for fy2006 accounts for approximately 54% of total federal funding for homeland security .

the department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 19% of all federal spending on homeland security .

the department of health and human services at 8.8% , the department of justice at 6.2% and the department of energy at 3.3% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security .

these five agencies collectively account for nearly 95% of all federal spending on homeland security .

it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities .

the legacy agencies that became a part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related .

therefore , while the fy2006 requests a total homeland security budget authority of $27.3 billion for dhs , the requested gross budget authority is reported as $41.1 billion .

the same is true of the other agencies listed in the table .
