"phthalates" refers to a group of chemical compounds that are heavily produced and widely used to make the plastics found in thousands of consumer products .

the most common use of phthalates is to increase the flexibility of polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) and polyvinylidene chloride ( pvdc ) polymers .

phthalates are released from those products over time , and are dispersed to the air , water , soil , and living things .

some ( but not all ) of these phthalates are known to cause reproductive damage in rodents .

recent interest by governmental bodies , including congress , in the potential adverse human health effects that might be related to phthalate exposure has focused on six phthalates that are produced and used in very large quantities .

the six phthalates are di - ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) , dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) , benzyl butyl phthalate ( bbp ) , diisononyl phthalate ( dinp ) , diisodecyl phthalate ( didp ) , and di - n - octyl phthalate ( dnop ) .

newly enacted p.l .

110 - 314 , the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) , prohibits the sale of children's toys and child care articles that contain more than 0.1% of dehp , dbp , or bbp .

a similar ban applies for dinp , didp , and dnop , until the consumer product safety commission issues a rule either establishing or eliminating the ban on a permanent basis .

there were two issues of particular concern during development of the final phthalate provisions of the cspia .

first , what is the scientific basis for health concerns about exposure to these chemicals ? .

second , would the provision reduce the risks without generating greater risks ? .

these issues are discussed briefly here , based on the scientific and legal information presented above .

the scientific basis for concerns about risks to human health appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates , adequate with respect to others , and weak for the remaining chemicals .

the strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000 .

many of these studies were not available to the ntp or to cpsc when they reviewed the phthalate literature in 2000 or 2001 .

at that time , regulators focused on carcinogenic effects , rather than effects on fetal development .

this more recent animal evidence strongly supports a claim that dehp , dbp , and dbb can harm reproduction and damage fetal and juvenile development in rats .

the structure - activity relationship ( between the molecular structure of the phthalates and developmental damage ) is well understood , such that scientific concern focuses now on dehp , dbp , and dbb .

dinp also is a developmental toxicant , but is only about 15% as potent as the most potent phthalates .

to the extent that it is still studied , it is generally studied together with other more potent toxic phthalates to evaluate additivity of effects .

scientific evidence regarding the other phthalates mentioned in the new law is lacking .

limited evidence indicates that didp , dinp , and dnop might have effects on the immune system , but these phthalates appear to be much less toxic to developing rodents .

data indicate that people are exposed to many phthalates , especially dehp , dbp ( di - n - butyl ) , and dbb .

children appear to be most heavily exposed .

data are insufficient to judge exposure for dinp , didp , and dnop .

individuals such as newborn babies in the intensive care units of hospitals face multiple and continuous phthalate exposures .

scientists are just beginning to explore the additive effects of exposure to multiple phthalates , as well as to phthalates in combination with certain pesticides .

to date , studies suggest there may be additive effects of multiple phthalate exposures .

the national academy of sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to multiple phthalates , and is expected to report before the end of 2008 .

by restricting the use of six phthalates in child - care items and toys , the new law codifies the voluntary agreements reached by cpsc with product manufacturers ( to keep dehp and dinp out of nipples , pacifiers , and teething toys , and dehp out of toys that might be mouthed ) and should reduce exposure to dinp , the only phthalate currently used in the united states to produce toys .

the effect of banning use of the other phthalates is less clear , because their child - related uses are not known .

however , because the law prohibits their use as substitutes for dinp in toys , toys should be eliminated as a source of exposure .

for each use , different chemicals might be used in lieu of the six phthalates .

acetates might be used in some applications ; phthalates other than the six specified might be used in others .

the risks of such chemicals may be known or unknown .

given the lack of legal authority to require testing for a chemical proposed for most uses , and the cost of testing , new formulations of products might pose either more or less risk than the current formulations .
