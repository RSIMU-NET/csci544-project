157 / s. 160 , the district of columbia house voting rights act of 2009 introduced in the 111 th congress , provided for a permanent increase in the size of the u.s. house of representatives , from 435 seats to 437 seats .

the bills specified that one of the additional seats was to be allocated to the district of columbia while the other seat was to be assigned either by using the normal apportionment formula allocation procedure ( h.r .

157 ) or specifying that the seat would be allocated to utah , the state which would have received the 436 th seat under the 2000 apportionment process .

thus , this would add a fourth seat to utah's three ( s. 160 ) .

while both versions treated the district of columbia as if it were a state for the purposes of the allocation of house seats , each bill restricted the district of columbia to a single congressional seat under any future apportionments .

similar bills had been introduced in the 110 th congress .

on april 19 , 2007 , the house approved h.r .

1905 ( a revised version of h.r .

1433 ) by a vote of 241 to 177 ( roll call vote 231 ) and sent it to the senate for consideration .

on june 28 , 2007 , s. 1257 was reported out of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs with amendments .

on september 18 , 2007 , cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was not invoked in the senate on a yea - nay vote , 57 - 42 , leaving the measure pending .

no further action occurred on the legislation .

the 435 seat limit for the size of the house was imposed in 1929 by statute ( 46 stat .

21 , 26-27 ) .

altering the size of the house would require a new law setting a different limit .

article i , ยง2 of the constitution establishes a minimum house size ( one representative for each state ) , and a maximum house size ( one for every 30,000 persons , or 10,306 representatives based on the 2010 census ) .

for the 2010 apportionment , a house size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats held from the 112 th to the 116 th congresses .

however , by retaining seats through such an increase in the house size , other state delegations would become larger .

at a house size of 468 , california's delegation size , for example , would be 56 instead of 53 seats , texas's delegation size would be 38 instead of 36 seats , and florida's delegation size would be 29 instead of 27 seats .

 table 1 , below displays the apportionment of the seats in the house of representatives based on the 2000 census apportionment population ( the current house apportionment ) and the apportionment of seats in the house based on the 2010 census apportionment population ( the distribution of seats among the states for the 113 th congress ) .

in addition , table 1 also shows the impact on the distribution of seats in the house if the district of columbia were to be treated as if it were a state for apportionment purposes for both a house size of 435 seats and a house size of 437 seats .

first , due to population changes between the 2000 census and the 2010 census , table 1 shows a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th congress ( beginning in january 2013 ) .

illinois , iowa , louisiana , massachusetts , michigan , missouri , new jersey , and pennsylvania will each lose one seat ; new york and ohio will each lose two seats .

arizona , georgia , nevada , south carolina , utah , and washington will each gain one seat ; florida will gain two seats ; and texas will gain four seats .

these are the actual seats to be allocated based on the results of the 2010 census .

second , if the district of columbia were to be given a vote in the house of representatives and treated as if it were a state in the reapportionment of congressional seats following the 2010 census , and the house size remained at 435 , minnesota would lose a seat relative to what it is scheduled to get as a result of the 2010 census .

thus , minnesota's delegation would fall to seven representatives if the district of columbia were to given a vote and the house size remained at 435 representatives .

third , if , on the other hand , the district of columbia were to be given a vote in the house of representatives and treated as if it were a state and the house size were to be increased to 437 , the district of columbia would receive one representative and north carolina would be entitled to fourteen representatives , one more than the state is scheduled to receive in the apportionment following the 2010 census .

also , minnesota would retain its eighth seat and no other state would be affected by the change .

another way to see the impact is to examine the allocation of the last seats assigned to the states when the district of columbia is allocated a seat ( presumably the 51 st seat ) .

the actual apportionment is done through a "priority list" calculated using the equal proportions formula provided in 2 u.s.c .

ยง2a. ( a ) .

table 2 , below , displays the end of the priority list that was used to allocate representatives based on the 2010 census , including the district of columbia .

the law only provides for 435 seats in the house , but the table illustrates not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula ( ending at 435 ) , but the states that would just miss getting additional representation .

table 3 is similar to table 2 , in that it displays the end of the priority list , but the last seat is 437 instead of 435 .

the priority values and the population needed to gain or lose a seat do not change if dc is treated like state , as dc is entitled the constitutional minimum of one representative .
