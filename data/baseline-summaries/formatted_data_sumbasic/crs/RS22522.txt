the world trade organization's ( wto's ) 149 members have agreed to a set of trading rules , including constraints on domestic subsidies and a process for challenging violations .

now , the combination of three relatively recent eventsâ ( 1 ) the expiration of the wto peace clause on january 1 , 2004 ; ( 2 ) brazil's successful challenge of certain provisions of the u.s. cotton program in a wto dispute settlement proceeding ( upheld on appeal in march 2005 ) ; and ( 3 ) the indefinite suspension of the doha round of wto trade negotiations in july 2006âhave raised concerns that u.s. farm programs could be subject to a new wave of wto dispute settlement challenges .

the peace clause had provided protection for actionable subsidies provided they met certain compliance conditions .

now an agricultural subsidy may be challenged under claims of "adverse effects" in agricultural marketsâeven if the subsidy remains within specified spending limits .

the potential list of actionable subsidies includes export subsidies , amber box , blue box , green box , and de minimis domestic support measures .

 ( see crs report rl32916 , agriculture in the wto: policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture , by [author name scrubbed] ( pdf ) , for an explanation of these categories. ) .

in particular , the "serious prejudice" claim of the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures ( scm ) , article 5 ( c ) , according to expert opinion , is a lower threshold for achieving successful challenges than the injury requirement under a countervailing duty claim .

if challenges are successful , the wto remedy likely would imply either elimination , alteration , or amendment by congress of the programs in question to remove their adverse effects .

since most governing provisions over u.s. farm programs are statutory , new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance .

alternately , in light of an adverse ruling the united states could choose to make compensatory payments ( under agreement with the challenging country ) to offset the alleged injury .

usda secretary johanns has stated that one of his primary objectives for the 2007 farm bill is to make u.s. farm programs "beyond challenge. .

this objective was translated into specifics in the administration's 2007 farm bill proposals .

nevertheless , some trade specialists argue that numerous new wto challenges of u.s. farm support are unlikely .

they contend that challenges require intense effort , the financial costs are high , and the broader geopolitical consequences may far outweigh any potential trade gains .

few developing countries have the needed resources for a challenge .

in addition , there is the inherent risk that , if the challenge fails , the effort could legitimize those very programs targeted for discipline .

however , in january 2007 , canada requested consultations with the united states under the auspices of the wto ( case ds357 ) to discuss three explicit charges against u.s. farm programs: that corn subsidies have caused serious prejudice to canadian producers in the form of market price suppression ; that the export credit guarantee program operates as an illegal export subsidy ; and that fixed direct payments are not green box compliant and should be counted as amber box payments , putting the united states in violation of its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit in six of the past eight years .

based on precedent from wto past decisions , several criteria are important in establishing the existence of adverse effects contributing to serious prejudice: ( 1 ) the subsidies constitute a substantial share of farmer returns or cover a substantial share of production costs ; ( 2 ) the subsidized commodity is important to world markets because it forms a large share of either world production or world trade ; and ( 3 ) there is a causal relationship between the subsidy and adverse effects in the relevant market .

a wto challenge , under scm articles 5 and 6.3 , is most likely to focus on those programs that are production - and trade - distorting ( i.e. , amber box ) or that have been exempted from the amber box under the blue box , de minimis , or green box criteria , but can be shown to cause adverse effects in certain markets .

to identify commodities that are potentially vulnerable to wto challenges , usda data are used to measure the level of subsidy dependence .

then , those commodities identified as depending heavily on government subsidies are evaluated in terms of the potential for the subsidies to be linked to adverse effects in international commodity markets .

the remedy to a successful wto legal challenge of a subsidy program depends on the nature of the subsidyâprohibited versus actionableâand on the recommendation of the panel hearing the case .

prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn without delay ( scm article 4.7 ) according to a time period specified by the panel in its recommendation .

if withdrawal is not accomplished within the specified time frame , then the dispute settlement body ( dsb ) shall grant authorization to the complaining member to take appropriate retaliatory countermeasures ( scm articleâ 4.10 ) .

with respect to actionable subsidies , the remedy is to remove the subsidy's adverse effects or withdraw the subsidy ( scm article 7.8 ) .

the subsidizing party is given some leeway in deciding how to remove the adverse effect .

options could include eliminating the subsidy program , reducing the subsidy amounts , reducing the linkage between the subsidy and the adverse effects ( eg , decoupling ) , or making some sort of mutually acceptable compensatory payment .

furthermore , if the recommendation is not followed within six months of the adoption of the panel report ( or the appellate body report on appeal ) , then the dsb shall grant the complaining member authority to take appropriate retaliatory countermeasures commensurate with the degree and nature of the adverse effects determined to exist ( scm article 7.9 ) .

an arbitrator may be asked to determine whether proposed countermeasures are commensurate .

when measured against wto criteria , all major u.s. subsidized crops ( both "covered commodities" and "loan commodities" ) appear potentially vulnerable to wto legal challenges .

furthermore , several commodities may be more vulnerable to challenges because of impacts in specific export markets ( rather than on a global basis ) or in sub - product domestic and export markets .

another important concern is the potential for certain u.s. farm programs ( eg , foreign market development programs ) to be ruled prohibited subsidies when subject to detailed analysis by a wto panel .

a review of recent economic analyses suggests that a partial u.s. policy reform ( such as the u.s. doha - round proposal to reduce u.s. amber box spending by 60% ) would provide only a modest reduction in adverse effects in international markets .

this happens because the united states plays such a large role in world commodity markets .

as a result , u.s. subsidy programs would appear vulnerable to wto challenge under scm article 5 and 6.3 following even such a policy reform .

the most clear method for decreasing exposure to wto legal challenges is through extensive decoupling ( i.e. , remove the linkage between payments and producer or consumer behavior ) .

such decoupling would sever the causality linkage necessary to accomplish a successful wto challenge .

several options for decoupling have been considered or discussed as part of the ongoing 2007 farm bill debate .

these include fully decoupled direct payments , whole - farm revenue - insurance - type programs , and conservation or "green" payments .

the attraction of these alternatives is their likely qualification as green box programs .

the costs thus would fall outside the wto's aggregate measures of support ( ams ) spending limits .
