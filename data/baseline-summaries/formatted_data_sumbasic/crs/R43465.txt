after several years of growing producer discontent with the apparent ineffectiveness of the federal dairy price support program and growing concerns about rapidly escalating dairy feed costs , the u.s. dairy industry advocated for substantial changes in the nature of federal dairy support .

as a result , the 2014 farm bill ( the agricultural act of 2014 ; p.l .

113-79 ) , which was signed into law on february 7 , 2014 , makes significant changes to the structure of u.s. dairy support programs including the elimination of several major price and income support program provisions from the 2008 farm bill ( the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , p.l .

110-246 ) , the extension of several smaller dairy programs , and the addition of two new programs .

this report describes the major dairy provisions contained in the 2014 farm bill as well as congressional budget office ( cbo ) cost projections of historical program outlays compared with outlays under the new dairy programs .

the report also includes a discussion of potential issues related to the new dairy policies .

finally , a table at the end of this report ( table a - 1 ) provides a side - by - side comparison of dairy provisions from the 2008 and 2014 farm bills .

reaching a final compromise on u.s. dairy policy , as contained in the 2014 farm bill , was a long and arduous task involving considerable debate over what the nature and role of federal support programs should be .

the following section provides background on the shift of federal support from dairy product prices to the dairy operating margin .

federal dairy price supports were first established by federal law in 1949 and modified in subsequent legislation including the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) , which established the dairy product price support program ( dppsp ) .

dppsp indirectly supported the farm price of fluid milk at $9.90 per hundred lbs .

 ( i.e. , hundredweight or cwt. ) .

through government purchases of dairy products from dairy processors at statutorily set prices .

the program was countercyclical , in that government purchases occurred when product prices were low , and ceased as product prices rose above support levels .

however , by the mid - 1990s , the annual farm price of milk had trended higher , albeit subject to an increasingly volatile pattern ( figure 1 ) , whereas the federal support rate was flat at $9.90 per cwt .

volatile milk prices made planning more difficult and made dairy producers more vulnerable to unexpected or sustained increases in the cost of feed ( the major cost component of dairy production ) .

milk producers have argued since the early 1990s that support levels had become too low , relative to market prices and costs of production , to provide meaningful support .

more recently , milk producers argued that support based strictly on the price of milk failed to account for the sharp escalation of feed costs that has occurred since 2006 ( figure 2 ) .

after the emergence of the u.s. ethanol industry as a major source of corn demand in 2006 , coupled with a series of weather - related , below - trend yield years ( especially 2010-2012 ) for the u.s. corn crop , u.s. feed grain markets surged to new price levels by 2012 that were nearly three times above the levels that had persisted during the previous four decades .

rising feed costs are of particular concern to dairy producers because they represent a substantial portion of the cost of milk production — in 2011 , feed costs accounted for 80% of operating costs and 54% of total costs of milk production ( compared with 71% and 37% shares during the 2000-2004 period ) .

the combination of volatile milk market prices rising well beyond support levels coupled with rapidly rising feed costs contributed to a shifting of focus away from price supports and towards protecting or guaranteeing some portion of the margin between milk prices and feed costs .

this refocusing of policy interest on the dairy operating margin was formalized by a proposed dairy margin protection program published in june 2010 by the national milk producers federation ( nmpf ) called the foundation for the future ( ftf ) .

a version of the ftf was introduced in the 112 th congress as h.r .

3062 , the dairy security act ( dsa ) , by house agriculture committee ranking member collin peterson on september 23 , 2011 .

through the legislative process ftf eventually evolved into the new dairy program described in the following sections .

an appendix at the end of this report ( appendix ) provides additional detail on the legislative debate behind the new dairy policy .

the 2014 farm bill repealed several previously existing dairy programs , extended others , added some new programs , and was silent on several existing dairy programs that derive their authority from outside of the farm bill .

each of these aspects is briefly summarized below .

according to the 2014 farm bill , usda shall establish and administer a dairy product donation program ( dpdp ) to ( 1 ) address low dairy operating margins , and ( 2 ) provide nutrition assistance to individuals in low - income groups .

a result from the dairy policy debate that preceded the final 2014 farm bill ( see appendix ) was as follows .

it is generally agreed that dairy operating margins are low when the equilibrium between milk supply and demand is out of balance with supply exceeding demand .

the original proponents of the dairy margin program had argued that an additional policy feature — a supply disincentive component — should be added that would work to reduce supply and bring the milk supply - demand equation back into balance at a higher margin .

opponents of this concept argued that the government should not manage supplies , but should instead work to enhance demand to rebalance the milk supply and demand .

this latter argument won out in conference when conferees proposed an entirely new "demand enhancing" program — dpdp .

usda outlays for the major dairy support programs have trended downward since the 1980 farm bill period ( table 3 ) .

an outlook for strong dairy product prices for the next several years in the cbo may 2013 baseline accounts for the relatively small net outlay projections of $161 million over 5 years ( fy2014-fy2018 ) and $250 million over 10 years ( fy2014-fy2023 ) for the major dairy programs , assuming an extension of dairy policy as it existed under the 2008 farm bill .

according to cbo , replacing current dairy policy with the new dairy programs of the 2014 farm bill will result in projected additional budgetary outlays above baseline over the 5-year ( fy2014-fy2018 ) and 10-year ( fy2014-fy2023 ) periods of $241 million and $912 million , respectively , under the agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-79 ) .

in other words , the total 5-year and 10-year outlays projected by cbo under the new dairy programs are $402 million and $1.162 billion , respectively , thus continuing the downward trend in program outlays per farm bill period .

because the mpp and dpdp are new programs that differ notably from previous support programs , several questions have been raised concerning their implementation and potential cost , as well as their effect on u.s. and international dairy markets and consumers .

history provides some indications but solid evidence will likely only emerge with implementation .

some of the more noteworthy related issues are briefly discussed here .

the answers to these questions may emerge only slowly .

the new mpp and dpdp programs are likely to be implemented during a period of sustained strong milk prices , moderate to weak feed costs , and sustained large margins that , if realized , would minimize the impact of the new dairy programs ( figure 3 ) .

as mentioned earlier in the text ( " origins of the new dairy policy " ) , a version of the national milk producers federation's ( nmpf's ) feed the future ( ftf ) proposal was introduced in the 112 th congress as h.r .

3062 , the dairy security act ( dsa ) , by house agriculture committee ranking member collin peterson on september 23 , 2011 .

a modified version of dsa appeared as "subtitle d — dairy," in title i of both the house - reported ( h.r .

6083 ) and senate - passed ( s. 3240 ) farm bills of the 112 th congress .

dairy policy in the 113 th congress in the 113 th congress , both the senate and the house passed different farm bills ( s. 954 , passed by the senate on june 10 , 2013 , and h.r .

2642 , passed by the house on july 11 , 2013 ) that proposed replacing the traditional set of dairy price and income support programs with a new margin - based income support program — called the dairy production margin protection program ( dpmpp ) under s. 954 , and the dairy producer margin insurance program ( dpmip ) under h.r .

2642 .

the two proposed margin programs were similar in many respects ; however , the senate bill ( but not the house bill ) also included an accompanying market stabilization program — the dairy market stabilization program ( dmsp ) , which , under certain conditions , would reduce payments to participating producers for their milk marketings when the margin falls below proposed statutory thresholds .

early versions of the house farm bill in the 113 th congress also included the dmsp as part of new dairy policy .

however , during the house agriculture committee's markup of its first version of the 2013 farm bill ( h.r .

1947 ) in may 2013 , an amendment ( h.amdt .

228 ) was introduced by representatives goodlatte and scott that proposed removing the dmsp from h.r .

1947 and making some minor adjustments to dpmpp .

the goodlatte - scott amendment ( gsa ) was defeated in committee by a vote of 28 to 26 .

the amendment was reintroduced during the house floor debate of h.r .

1947 and passed by a vote of 291-135 ( may 15 , 2013 ) .

however , the full house voted to reject the amended farm bill ( 195-234 ) on june 20 , 2013 .

on july 11 , 2013 , the full house passed ( by a vote of 216-208 ) a second version of the 2013 farm bill ( h.r .

2642 ) which included the goodlatte - scott amendment — thus removing dmsp and replacing dpmpp with dpmip .

conference committee resolves differences the differences between the senate - and house - passed farm bills were resolved when conferees reported a conference agreement on january 27 , 2014 ( the agricultural act of 2014 , h.r .

2642 / h.rept .

113-333 ) .

the dairy supply management debate was resolved when the conferees included an entirely new program — the dairy product distribution program ( dpdp ) — focused on demand enhancement , rather than supply control .

prior to the conference , the dairy debate had been limited to whether a supply management component should be included in the final bill — the concept of a dpdp did not emerge until conference .

the full house and senate approved the conference agreement on january 29 and february 4 , respectively , and the president signed the measure into law on february 7 , 2014 ( p.l .

113-79 ) .
