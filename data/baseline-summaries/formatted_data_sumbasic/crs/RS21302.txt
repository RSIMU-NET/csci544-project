firefighting activities are traditionally the responsibility of states and local communities .

as such , funding for firefighters is provided mostly by state and local governments .

during the 1990s , shortfalls in state and local budgets , coupled with increased responsibilities ( i.e. , counterterrorism ) of local fire departments , led many in the fire community to call for additional financial support from the federal government .

while federally funded training programs existed ( and continue to exist ) through usfa's national fire academy , and while federal money has been available to first responders for counterterrorism training and equipment through the department of justice , there did not exist a dedicated program , exclusively for firefighters , which provided federal money directly to local fire departments to help address a wide variety of equipment , training , and other firefighter - related needs .

during the 106 th congress , many in the fire community asserted that local fire departments require and deserve greater support from the federal government .

in response , h.r .

1168 , the firefighter investment and response enhancement ( fire ) act , was introduced on march 17 , 1999 , by representative pascrell .

the bill authorized the director of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) "to make grants to fire departments for the purpose of protecting the public and firefighting personnel against fire and fire - related hazards. .

in the senate , the fire act was introduced by senator dodd ( s. 1941 ) and senator campbell ( s. 1899 ) .

ultimately , fire act language was agreed to in the senate by unanimous consent as an amendment offered by senator dodd to the fy2001 national defense authorization act ( p.l .

106-398 , signed into law on october 30 , 2000 ) .

title xvii of p.l .

106-398 amended the federal fire prevention and control act ( p.l .

93-498 ) to establish a new office in fema to administer grants to fire departments and fire prevention organizations for a variety of purposes , including hiring and training personnel , prevention programs , equipment and facilities , and public education .

the law stipulated that volunteer departments receive a proportion of the total grant funding that is not less than the proportion of the u.s. population that those departments protect .

meanwhile , fema was directed to conduct an 18-month study ( in conjunction with the national fire protection association ) on the need for federal assistance to state and local communities to fund firefighting and emergency response activities .

the study , entitled , a needs assessment of the u.s. fire service , was released in january 2003 and found that many fire departments — particularly volunteer companies in rural communities — report shortfalls in facilities , equipment , and training of personnel .

for firefighter assistance , p.l .

106-398 authorized $100 million for fy2001 and $300 million for fy2002 .

however , in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center and the pentagon , the senate amended the fy2002 department of defense authorization act ( s. 1438 ) to include language providing increased authorization levels for the assistance to firefighters program .

an additional increase was inserted during the house - senate conference on the defense authorization bill , authorizing the program at $900 million per year through fy2004 , and expanding the scope of the grants to include equipment and training to help firefighters respond to a terrorist attack or an attack using weapons of mass destruction .

the bill was signed into law ( p.l .

107-107 ) on december 28 , 2001 .

with the authorization of the fire grant program expiring on september 30 , 2004 , the 108 th congress took up fire act reauthorization legislation .

on april 1 , 2004 , representative boehlert introduced h.r .

4107 — the assistance to firefighters grant reauthorization act of 2004 .

h.r .

4107 sought to extend the authorization through fy2007 .

the usfa administrator was specifically designated as the entity who shall administer the program .

additionally , h.r .

4107 sought to increase the current award caps for grant recipients , while reducing required cost - sharing nonfederal matches .

of perhaps greatest controversy was a provision which would prohibit grant recipients from discriminating against or prohibiting firefighters from engaging in volunteer firefighting activities in other jurisdictions during off - duty hours .

the house committee on science held a hearing on h.r .

4107 on may 12 , 2004 .

on may 11 , 2004 , the senate version of the fire grant reauthorization was introduced by senator dodd .

s. 2411 , the assistance to firefighters act of 2004 , sought to authorize the fire grant program through fy2010 and designate the secretary of the department of homeland security as the program's administering authority .

the senate committee on commerce , science and transportation held a hearing on s. 2411 on july 8 , 2004 .

unlike the house bill , s. 2411 did not contain a provision on volunteer firefighter discrimination .

on june 17 , 2004 , the text of s. 2411 was adopted as an amendment ( offered by senator dodd ) to the fy2005 national defense authorization act ( s. 2400 , division d , sections 4001-4013 ) .

on june 23 , 2004 , s. 2400 was passed by the senate and incorporated into the house defense authorization bill ( h.r .

4200 ) .

on october 9 , 2004 , the house and senate approved the conference agreement on h.r .

4200 ( h.rept .

108-767 ) .

title xxxvi of h.r .

4200 ( assistance to firefighters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 ) reauthorized the fire grant program at $900 million for fy2005 , $950 million for fy2006 , and $1 billion for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2009 .

award caps were raised , nonfederal matching requirements were lowered , eligibility was extended to include nonaffiliated emergency medical services ( i.e .

ambulance services not affiliated with fire departments ) , and the scope of grants was expanded to include firefighter safety r&d .

h.r .

4200 did not contain the provision on volunteer firefighter discrimination .

the reauthorization legislation designated the usfa administrator as the administering authority of the fire grant program .

h.r .

4200 was signed into law ( p.l .

108-375 ) on october 28 , 2004 .

section 3603 of p.l .

108-375 directed usfa , in conjunction with the national fire protection association , to assess the needs and capacity of fire departments and to measure the impact of the fire grant program in meeting the needs of the fire service .

in october 2006 , the usfa released two studies addressing these issues .

a related issue is the role of the federal government in assisting fire departments to hire personnel .

in the 108 th congress , congress enacted the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response firefighters ( safer ) act as section 1057 of the fy2004 national defense authorization act ( p.l .

108-136 ) .

the safer act authorizes federal grants of over $1 billion per year through 2010 directly to fire departments for the hiring of firefighters and recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters .

from fy2001 through fy2003 , the assistance to firefighters grant ( afg ) program ( as part of usfa / fema ) received its primary appropriation through the va - hud - independent agencies appropriation act .

in fy2004 , the assistance to firefighters program began to receive its annual appropriation through the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on homeland security .

the program received an appropriation of $100 million in fy2001 ( its initial year ) , $360 million in fy2002 , $745 million in fy2003 , $746 million in fy2004 , $650 million in fy2005 , $539 million in fy2006 , $547 million in fy2007 , and $560 million in fy2008 .

table 1 shows recent appropriated funding for firefighter assistance .

a primary issue in the 110 th congress is how appropriations for fire grants should compare with the authorized levels of $1 billion for those years .

the administration's budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants , as well as zero funding for safer grants .

opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments , while the administration has cited the availability of other risk - based dhs first responder grant programs , and has argued that reduced levels for afg are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of a terrorist attack or major disaster .

aside from budget issues , an ongoing issue has been the focus of the fire grant program .

administration budget proposals have sought to shift the priority of the fire grant program to terrorism preparedness .

firefighting groups have questioned this proposed shift , arguing that the original purpose of the fire act ( enhancing basic firefighting needs ) should not be compromised or diluted .

similarly , in recent years , the house and senate appropriations committees have directed the afg program to maintain a broad all - hazards focus .

s. 608 , the risk - based homeland security grants act of 2007 , would direct dhs to conduct a study analyzing the distribution of fire grant awards and the level of unmet firefighting equipment needs in each state .

a related issue is the role of the u.s. fire administration in the administration of the fire grant program .

at its inception , the program was administered by the usfa / fema and focused on enhancing the basic needs of fire departments across the nation .

in the fy2004 budget request , as part of its effort to consolidate terrorism preparedness grants under a single entity , the administration proposed to relocate the fire grant program within the office for domestic preparedness ( odp ) , whose mission was to provide state and local governments with assistance to improve their readiness for terrorism incidents .

the fy2004 dhs appropriations act ( p.l .

108-90 ) acceded to the administration's request , and relocated the fire grants to odp .

the conferees directed that dhs shall "continue current administrative practices in a manner identical to the current fiscal year , including a peer review process of applications , granting funds directly to local fire departments , and the inclusion of the united states fire administration during grant administration. .

on january 26 , 2004 , then - dhs secretary ridge informed congress of his intention to consolidate odp , including the assistance to firefighters program , into the office of state and local government coordination preparedness ( oslgcp ) .

the fy2005 homeland security appropriations act ( p.l .

108-334 ) placed the fire grant program within oslgcp .

however , the assistance to firefighters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-375 ) designated administration of the fire grant program to usfa .

according to the fy2006 budget request , the fire grant program would be administered by the oslgcp "in cooperation with the usfa. .

on july 13 , 2005 , dhs secretary michael chertoff announced a restructuring of dhs , effective october 1 , 2005 .

under the restructuring plan , the fire grants ( as well as the safer grants ) were to be administered by the office of grants and training in the new dhs directorate for preparedness .

however , legislation considered in the 109 th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs , with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema .

ultimately , title vi of the conference agreement on the dhs appropriations bill ( p.l .

109-295 ; h.rept .

109-699 ) , the post katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 , transferred most of the existing preparedness directorate ( including fire and safer grants and the usfa ) back to an enhanced fema .
