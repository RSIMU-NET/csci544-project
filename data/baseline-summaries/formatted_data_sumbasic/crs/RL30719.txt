the "digital divide" is a term used to describe a gap between "information haves and have - nots," or in other words , between those americans who use or have adequate access to telecommun ications and information technologies and those who do not .

whether or not individuals or communities fall into the "information haves" category depends on a number of factors , ranging from the presence of computers in the home , to training and education , to the availability of affordable internet access .

broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the united states .

while the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow , studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban / suburban and high - income areas is outpacing deployment in rural and low - income areas .

prior to the late 1990s , american homes accessed the internet at maximum speeds of 56 kilobits per second by dialing up an internet service provider over the same copper telephone line used for traditional voice service .

a relatively small number of businesses and institutions used broadband or high - speed connections through the installation of special "dedicated lines" typically provided by their local telephone company .

starting in the late 1990s , cable television companies began offering cable modem broadband service to homes and businesses .

this was accompanied by telephone companies beginning to offer dsl service ( broadband over existing copper telephone wireline ) .

growth in broadband service has been steep , rising from 2.8 million high - speed lines reported as of december 1999 , to 409 million connections as of june 30 , 2017 .

of the 409 million high - speed connections reported by the fcc , 353 million serve residential users .

table 1 depicts the relative deployment of different types of broadband technologies .

a distinction is often made between "current generation" and "next generation" broadband ( commonly referred to as next generation networks or ngn ) .

"current generation" typically refers to initially deployed cable , dsl , and many wireless systems , while "next generation" refers to dramatically faster download and upload speeds offered by fiber technologies and also by successive generations of cable , dsl , and wireless technologies .

in general , the greater the download and upload speeds offered by a broadband connection , the more sophisticated ( and potentially valuable ) the application that is enabled .

with the conclusion of grant and loan awards established by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) , there remain two ongoing major federal vehicles which direct federal money to fund broadband: the universal service fund ( usf ) programs under the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , and the broadband and telecommunications programs at the rural utilities service ( rus ) of the u.s. department of agriculture .

in june 2017 , the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) released an updated comprehensive guide to federal funding of broadband projects .

the guide provides summary and contact information for a variety of federal programs that may fund projects involving broadband infrastructure , adoption , access , planning , or research .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-141 ) contained many broadband - related provisions title vii , section 779 of division a ( agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act , 2018 ) appropriates $600 million to rus to "conduct a new broadband loan and grant pilot program. .

the law states that the funding is to "remain available until expended," and that at least 90% of the households to be served by a project receiving a loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to broadband , defined for this pilot program as 10 mbps downstream , and 1 mbps upstream , which shall be reevaluated and redetermined , as necessary , on an annual basis by the secretary of agriculture .

the pilot broadband loan and grant program is being implemented as the reconnect program , which is offering loans , grants , and loan / grant combinations .

more information on the reconnect program is available at https: / / reconnect.usda.gov .

title i of division b ( commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2018 ) appropriates $7.5 million to update the national broadband availability map in coordination with the fcc and using partnerships previously developed with the states .

title v of division p ( ray baum's act of 2018 ) .

section 101 amends the communications act of 1934 to provide for the deposits of bidders in auctions of spectrum frequencies to be deposited in the treasury .

section 504 directs the fcc to submit a report to congress on promoting broadband for veterans , in particular low - income veterans and veterans residing in rural areas .

section 505 directs the fcc to promulgate regulations to establish a methodology that shall apply to the collection of mobile service coverage data for the purposes of the universal service program .

section 508 requires the fcc to submit a report to congress evaluating broadband coverage in indian country and on land held by a native corporation pursuant to the alaska native claims settlement act , with the fcc required to complete a proceeding to address the unserved areas identified in the report .

title vi ( mobile now ) of division p seeks to make more spectrum available for wireless broadband , facilitate broadband infrastructure deployment on federal lands , include communications facility installation data in the federal real property database , and require consultation between telecommunications providers and state highway authorities receiving federal highway money .

additionally , section 615 directs gao to conduct a study to evaluate the availability of broadband access using unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks in low - income neighborhoods .

to the extent that congress may consider various options for encouraging broadband deployment and adoption , a key issue is how to strike a balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service , while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment .

the 116 th congress may address the digital divide issue by considering various approaches to providing support for infrastructure deployment , including support for rural broadband .

in addition to loans , loan guarantees , and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment , a wide array of policy instruments are available to policymakers , including universal service reform , tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment , broadband bonds , demand - side incentives ( such as assistance to low - income families for purchasing computers ) , reducing regulatory barriers to broadband deployment , and spectrum policy to spur rollout of wireless broadband services .

in assessing federal incentives for broadband deployment , congress may consider the appropriate mix of broadband deployment incentives to create jobs in the short and long term , the extent to which incentives should target next - generation broadband technologies , and the extent to which unserved and underserved areas with existing broadband providers should receive federal assistance .

115-334 ) and annual appropriations legislation , the following broadband - related bills were introduced into the 115th congress: funding and federal assistance h.r .
