the prevention and control of domestic crime has traditionally been a responsibility of state and local governments , with the federal government playing more of a supportive role .

as crime rates continued to increase throughout the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , the federal government increased its involvement in domestic crime control efforts .

it did so primarily through a series of grant programs to encourage and assist states and communities in their efforts to control crime , as well as through the expansion in the number of offenses that could be prosecuted in the federal criminal justice system .

over a 10-year period ( 1984-1994 ) , congress enacted five major anti - crime bills and increased appropriations for federal assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies .

as a result , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) had seen an expansion of its role in fighting domestic crime as congress began to add more crimes to the federal criminal code that were previously under the sole jurisdiction of state and local governments .

within the past several years , however , some federal assistance to state and local law enforcement has declined , and the fbi has refocused its resources on countering terrorism as federal law enforcement efforts since september 11 , 2001 ( 9 / 11 ) , have focused primarily on protecting the nation against terrorist attacks .

a major policy question facing congress is , what should be the role of the federal government in crime control ? .

more specifically , what should its role be in controlling violent crime , combating fraud , setting drug control policy , and overseeing department of justice ( doj ) grant programs ? .

as mentioned , the prevention and control of domestic crime has conventionally been under the purview of state and local governments .

however , as the violent crime rate increased in the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , and some questioned the ability of state and local law enforcement to combat the growing problem with limited resources at their disposal , the federal government began to take a more direct role in crime control .

the following section discusses the trends in the nation's violent and property crime rates over the past two decades .

the fbi's uniform crime report ( ucr ) program compiles data from monthly reports transmitted directly to the fbi from approximately 17,000 local police departments or state agencies .

of interest to lawmakers are the two indices of crimes that are the basis of the ucr .

the fbi collects data on the number of offenses known to police , the number and characteristics of persons arrested , and the number of "clearances" for eight different offenses , collectively referred to as part i offenses .

part i offenses include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter , forcible rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , larceny - theft , motor vehicle theft , and arson .

within the part i offenses , crimes are categorized as either violent or property crimes .

violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter , forcible rape , robbery , and aggravated assault .

property crimes include burglary , larceny - theft , motor vehicle theft , and arson .

the fbi also collects data on the number of arrests made for 21 other offenses , known as part ii offenses .

the ucr collects crime data from the various state and local law enforcement agencies and presents it in a variety of formats in the ucr .

the data on which the crime rates are derived are offenses reported to the police ( as opposed to arrests made by police or cases cleared by the police ) .

the national violent crime rate has generally decreased since the mid - 1990s .

however , interest in combating violent crimes across the united states has remained .

although policy makers have been concerned with all forms of violent crimes , the selected issue areas discussed below were of interest to the 111 th congress .

one of the primary questions spanning these issues was , what should be the federal government's role in combating various crimes ? .

another general issue was whether congress has provided the best regulatory , investigative , and prosecutorial tools to counter violent crime around the country .

policy makers have been concerned with the prevalence and types of fraud committed across the country .

in response , the 111 th congress passed the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 ( fera ) , in part to address mortgage , securities , commodities , and financial fraud , among other things .

the broad policy issue cross - cutting various types of fraud and theft was whether the federal response has or can effectively keep pace with the evolving nature of these crimes .

as the nature of these crimes changes , how can policy makers provide the necessary resources and update the criminal statutes to allow for effective investigation and prosecution of these crimes ? .

the national drug intelligence center ( ndic ) has indicated that illicit drugs — particularly their trafficking and abuse — remain a significant threat to american society .

drugs are involved in other violent and non - violent crimes ; as of 2009 , about 53% of the total federal prison population had been convicted and sentenced for drug - related offenses .

policy makers have been concerned with combating drug crimes and sentencing offenders .

questions remain , however , whether current drug policies are effective in reducing domestic production , trafficking , and use of illicit drugs .

drug trafficking organizations ( dtos ) pose economic and social threats to the united states , and according to the ndic , mexican dtos are now the largest drug trafficking threat .

the ndic estimates that mexican dtos maintain drug distribution networks , or supply drugs to distributors , in at least 230 u.s. cities .

some areas of the country have experienced higher incidences of drug trafficking than others , and currently 14% of u.s. counties are designated as high intensity drug trafficking areas ( hidtas ) .

the hidta program provides additional federal resources to areas plagued by drug trafficking and promotes multilateral coordination among drug control organizations .

policy makers in the 111 th congress questioned whether to designate ( via legislation ) more counties as part of hidtas .

other policy options debated for including additional areas with an increased prevalence of drug trafficking into the hidta program included adjusting the criterion for inclusion into the hidta program or adjusting the unit of inclusion into the program .

policy makers remained concerned that escalating drug - related violence in mexico along the u.s. - mexico border may spill over in to the u.s. for example , there have been anecdotal reports of increased drug - related violence , such as kidnappings related to drug smuggling ( also related to other crimes such as human smuggling ) .

issues facing the 111 th congress included whether to authorize additional funding for increased law enforcement initiatives along the southwest border as well as whether to direct the formulation of border task forces specifically to address drug - related violence .

in addition , congress considered whether to increase penalties for the manufacture , possession , distribution , or trafficking of illegal substances .

judges have discretion in sentencing defendants unless the offense carries a mandatory sentence , as specified in the law .

while some view this as an opportunity for federal judges to take into consideration the circumstances unique to each individual offender , thus handing down a sentence that better fits the offender , others fear that such discretion may result in unwarranted disparity and inconsistencies in sentencing across judicial districts such as those that led to the original enactment of federal sentencing guidelines in 1984 .

with respect to sentencing , several issues confronted the 111 th congress .

as discussed below , one issue was whether congress should eliminate or reduce the disparity in federal sentences for crack and powder cocaine violations .

another issue was whether the federal prison system should allow for early release for certain prisoners under certain circumstances .

department of justice ( doj ) grant programs and appropriations is a perennial issue of oversight and legislation for congress .

while some programs provide assistance to state and local law enforcement , others provide assistance to other aspects of justice administration around the country .

many of these grant programs have experienced decreases in funding .

one overarching issue that the 111 th congress considered was the adequacy of funding provided for justice assistance programs .

yet another aspect of these grant programs that congress considered was their scope , including whether the number of grant programs should be changed or their purpose areas altered .

partly in response to the united states having the highest reported incarceration rate in the world , legislation was introduced in the 111 th congress that would have established a commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the u.s. criminal justice system .

the national criminal justice commission act of 2010 ( h.r .

5143 , s. 714 ) — passed by the house — would have , among other things , established a 14-member commission to evaluate costs , practices , and policies of federal and state criminal justice systems around the country .

upon completion of the review , the commission would have been charged with providing recommendations to congress regarding potential policy changes to reduce incarceration rates , decrease prison violence , improve prison administration , utilize proven strategies to reduce criminal behavior , bolster reintegration of ex - offenders , reevaluate criminalization of and treatment for selected drug - related crimes , improve treatment for mental illness , and enhance law enforcement response to criminal organizations .
