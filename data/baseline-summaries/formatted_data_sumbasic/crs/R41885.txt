federal funding for fy2011 was provided through a series of eight continuing appropriations of varying lengths .

normally , a continuing appropriation permits government agencies to operate at the same rate as experienced in the most recent full - year appropriation — in this case fy2010 — for the duration of the appropriation .

the first bill of the series , the continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

111-242 ) , was enacted on september 30 , 2010 , and provided funding through december 3 , 2010 .

this original act , rather than merely extending existing appropriations into the new year , adjusted the amounts available to several appropriations accounts from their prorated fy2010 levels .

the most substantial adjustment to military construction accounts was the reduction of the brac 2005 account from the $8.0 billion needed near the height of brac construction in fy2010 to $2.4 billion .

nevertheless , the act also contained the following text: sec .

102 .

 ( a ) no appropriation or funds made available or authority granted pursuant to section 101 for the department of defense shall be used for ( 1 ) the new production of items not funded for production in fiscal year 2010 or prior years ; ( 2 ) the increase in production rates above those sustained with fiscal year 2010 funds ; or ( 3 ) the initiation , resumption , or continuation of any project , activity , operation , or organization ( defined as any project , subproject , activity , budget activity , program element , and subprogram within a program element , and for any investment items defined as a p - 1 line item in a budget activity within an appropriation account and an r - 1 line item that includes a program element and subprogram element within an appropriation account ) for which appropriations , funds , or other authority were not available during fiscal year 2010 .

this section , therefore , did not permit the initiation of any new fy2011 construction projects .

none of the subsequent enacted appropriations altered this language until the enactment of the full - year continuing appropriation act for fy2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ) on april 15 , 2011 .

the president submitted his fy2012 appropriation request for military construction and family housing to congress on february 14 , 2011 , and the house passed its version of the military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act ( h.r .

2055 ) on june 14 , 2011 .

the overall level of funding in the president's request represents a 17.1% ( $3.0 billion ) reduction below the combined title i ( military construction ) and title iv ( overseas contingency operations construction ) amount enacted for fy2011 .

the house version of h.r .

2055 funding levels in new budget authority represent a 20.5% ( $3.6 billion ) reduction from fy2011 enacted amounts .

the major portion of that reduction comes from the $2.1 billion less in brac 2005 funding needed to support the first post - implementation year of that program .

the president's fy2012 request is less than one - quarter of the amount needed during the last year of brac construction and movement .

the president also requested no funds for the overseas contingency operations construction account .

this represented $1.2 billion in the fy2011 appropriation .

even though the fy2012 base budget request includes $80 million in construction for afghanistan , plus another $137 million elsewhere in central command , this marks a substantial reduction in construction activity in the area of the most intense u.s. military operations .

the house passed its version of a military construction appropriations bill ( h.r .

2055 ) on june 14 , 2011 .

the senate committee on appropriations reported its amendment to h.r .

2055 on june 30 , and the chamber may take up the measure in the near future .

as members of congress and the defense committees consider the president's request for fy2012 , a number of questions may suggest themselves: to what extent did the delay in fy2011 appropriations disrupt executive branch planning and commitment of construction funds ? .

do the findings made by the gao regarding u.s. basing in asia indicate inadequate management and planning on the part of dod , or are there extenuating circumstances that inhibit dod's ability to effectively plan and execute the adjustment of its military posture there ? .

how , and to what extent , will limits on government debt impact both the timing and the number of military construction projects that can be undertaken ? .

does the prohibition on congressionally directed spending ( "earmarks" ) limit congress's ability to exercise its constitutional power to "raise and support armies" and "provide and maintain a navy," and if so , how and to what extent ? .

is it appropriate for dod to assist local jurisdictions in absorbing the demands on infrastructure and services created by significantly increased military community size ? .

if so , what legislation is required to create the necessary authority and / or additional funding ? .

would new authority to extend implementation of some recommendations of the 2005 brac commission reflect the complexity of the current brac round , or have the military services not adequately planned to the mandatory deadline ? .
