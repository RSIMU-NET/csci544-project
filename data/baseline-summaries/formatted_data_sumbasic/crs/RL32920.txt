federal counter - terrorism training programs are varied and are provided by numerous federal agencies and departments .

some of these departments and agencies include the departments of defense , energy , homeland security , health and human services , justice , and transportation , and the environmental protection agency .

each department and agency provides specific counter - terrorism training targeted to a given categories of recipients .

training recipients include federal , state , and local government personnel , emergency responders , and private and public critical infrastructure personnel .

the programs train individuals to prepare for , respond to , and recover from terrorist attacks .

some of the training programs , such as those of the departments of transportation ( dot ) and energy ( doe ) , and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , are designed for personnel working in critical infrastructure sectors .

other programs , such as those of the departments of defense ( dod ) and homeland security ( dhs ) , are intended for personnel who are not identified with specific critical infrastructure .

instead , dod and dhs provide training for government personnel , emergency responders , and medical professionals who would respond to a terrorist attack , regardless of location or target .

the department of health and human services ( hhs ) provides training specifically to public health and medical personnel to prepare them to respond to any disaster , but especially to terrorist attacks using biological , chemical , and radiological weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) .

the department of justice ( doj ) provides training specifically for federal , state , and local law enforcement personnel .

most of these federal departments and agencies provide training in conjunction with private and public educational institutions , federal laboratories , and federal research and development centers .

the mission of dhs to secure the nation from terrorist attacks gives it primary federal responsibility for providing counter - terrorism training to federal , state , and local emergency responders .

other departments and agencies provide counter - terrorism training , but their programs focus either on specific critical infrastructure sectors , such as energy and transportation , or on specific emergency responders , such as hhs training for medical personnel and doj training for law enforcement personnel .

dhs provides training to a wide range of critical infrastructure personnel , law enforcement and other emergency responders , government ( federal , state , and local ) personnel , and medical personnel .

this report provides an overview of the major training activities and facilities of the federal departments and agencies that provide counter - terrorism training .

it identifies some of the issues associated with that training .

the issues include: possible duplication of federal counter - terrorism training programs ; determination of department of homeland security ( dhs ) counter - terrorism training priorities ; and possible redundancy and coordination of dhs counter - terrorism trainingâ programs .

the primary stakeholders in responding to terrorist attacks , and thus the recipients of counter - terrorism training , are federal , state , and local governments ; private and public medical systems ; and critical infrastructure administrators .

in the evolution of counter - terrorism training , a number of issues have arisen , among which are possible duplication of training programs , allocation of dhs training funding , prioritizing attendance , potential redundancy , and consolidation of dhs training programs .

these issues and possible oversight approaches available to congress are discussed below .

crs takes no position with respect to any of the possible approaches listed .

because of the rapid evolution of counter - terrorism training programs offered by different federal departments and agencies , there may be a duplication of certain types of training provided to federal , state , and local government personnel , emergency responders , and critical infrastructure facility personnel .

for example , dhs , hhs , and epa all offer training related to responding to hazardous material incidents .

it is possible that training provided by dhs , dod , doj , dot , epa , and hhs to first responders is not coordinated , and that a federal effort should be made to ensure these federal entities provide coordinated , non - duplicative training .

possible oversight approaches could include .

congress might decide that federal counter - terrorism training programs for federal , state , and local emergency responders do not warrant congressional oversight at this time .

arguably , this option could leave congress with limited systematic information about the extent of any duplication and the potential need for interagency coordination of training .

congress could ask gao to undertake an evaluation of all federal counter - terrorism training programs .

gao could be asked to review individual courses , training curricula , training audiences , and training facilities .

after conducting a review of these courses , gao might be able to identify any duplication of training and possible alternatives for consolidating or coordinating this training .

this option would require congress to work with gao to set a mutually acceptable scope and time for the evaluation .

congress might direct , through statutory and conference language , the federal departments and agencies that provide counter - terrorism training to establish an interagency task force to review their counter - terrorism programs .

because of the lead role dhs provides in counter - terrorism training , congress could consider directing dhs to chair the task force .

once the training has been reviewed , the task force could be directed to coordinate and consolidate the training as necessary .

this option , however , could result in "turf" disputes and federal departments and agencies attempting to protect training programs and the funding associated with them .

state and local governments receive counter - terrorism training funding through the dhs homeland security grant program ( hsgp ) .

two sub - grants within hsgp , the state homeland security grant program ( shsgp ) and the urban area security initiative ( uasi ) , provide funds to be used for counter - terrorism and homeland security training of first responders , state and local government personnel , and emergency managers .

the allocation method for fy2006 dhs grants differs from that of earlier years .

in fy2003 and fy2004 , congress required dhs to allocate 0.75% of total appropriations for shsgp and letpp to each state , with the remainder of total appropriations to be allocated at the discretion of dhs .

dhs chose to use the state's population percentage of the national population as the basis for this secondary distribution and to distribute a base amount of 0.25% to u.s. insular areas .

congress required dhs to allocate fy2005 shsgp and letpp grants in the same manner as in fy2004 .

dhs is also changing the distribution method for uasi in fy2006 .

in fy2003-fy2005 , uasi discretionary allocations were distributed using credible threat , presence of critical infrastructure , vulnerability , population , population density , law enforcement investigative and enforcement activity , and the existence of formal mutual aid agreements as funding formula factors .

in fy2006 , dhs intends to allocate uasi funding using a risk - and needs - based formula .

dhs also intends to group major jurisdictions into single urban areas , requiring grouped jurisdictions to determine allocations within the urban areas .

eleven urban areas that received uasi funding in fy2005 are not eligible to apply for funding for new homeland security projects , but they may apply for sustainment funding to complete homeland security projects begun in previous years .

finally , dhs intends to authorize urban areas to apply for funding for homeland security projects that have dual - use ( for terrorist incidents or natural disasters ) capabilities , such as evacuations and search and rescue teams .

critics of the present funding distribution method , including some members of congress and the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states , have stated that the funding distribution methods used to provide federal homeland security assistance to states and localities are inadequate and unfair .

the issue of allocation of dhs counter - terrorism training funding is part of a larger issue: the distribution of federal homeland security funding to states and localities .

the allocation of counter - terrorism training funding , however , presents some policy questions that can be addressed separately from the issue of federal homeland security assistance distribution .

it could be argued that every state should receive a minimum amount of homeland security funding , but that not every state and locality can receive priority in counter - terrorism training .

terrorism intelligence may identify one state or locality at a greater risk of attacks , whereas other locations may not be at the same risk .

some states and localities may have a greater risk of terrorist attacks due to their population density or critical infrastructure .

additionally , it could be argued that a state or locality should not receive training funding that would allow first responders , government officials , and emergency managers to attend counter - terrorism training that would not enhance their preparedness , because the state or locality does not face a terrorist threat , have critical infrastructure , or possess threat - specific counter - terrorism equipment .

these arguments , however , may not address the need for baseline counter - terrorism training .

it could be argued that every state should receive the same training , due to the unpredictable nature of terrorism .

some may argue that neither the absence of critical infrastructure nor relatively low population density protects a state or locality from terrorist attacks .

from that perspective , every state and locality can be seen as needing some , if not an equal amount , of counter - terrorism training .

possible approaches include .

congress could determine that the present amount of training and funding that states and localities receive is adequate .

in support of this position , it might be argued that the current allocation of training funding and priority of training is necessary to ensure that every state and locality is provided a baseline amount of counter - terrorism training .

this option , however , does not address the argument that some states and localities are at a greater risk of terrorist attacks and may need more training or funding than those states or localities at a lesser risk .

if congress were to decide that the present counter - terrorism training provided by dhs is not fully meeting the needs of states and localities at a greater risk of terrorist attacks , it could direct dhs , specifically g&t , through statutory or conference language , to establish a priority attendance list of states and localities .

this list could give training priority to states and localities that are determined to be at a greater risk of or vulnerability to terrorist attacks .

g&t , with access to intelligence concerning the national terrorist threat , might be designated to determine which states and localities appear to have a greater need for training .

this option , however , might result in some states or localities receiving reduced training due to the limited space in and availability of the training programs ; and it could be argued that this would not ensure adequate security for some states and localities .

congress could direct g&t to increase funding to specific states or localities based on terrorist threat information .

since congress , through the usa patriot act , directed only that a minimum of 0.75% of total appropriations be allocated to states for homeland security , it could through statutory or conference language require g&t to provide additional funding to specific states and localities for counter - terrorism training .

this option could increase preparedness of states and localities at greater risk of terrorist attacks as determined by threat information .

this option , however , would require g&t to coordinate terrorist threat information with its allocation of shsgp funding , which it presently does not do .

supporters of this position would be likely to argue that since g&t coordinates terrorist threat information with its allocation of uasi funding , it could do this for shsgp allocations .

within dhs , g&t and the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) administer training programs at the state and local levels , and at national training institutes .

at the national level , fema administers the emergency management institute ( emi ) and the national fire academy ( nfa ) .

g&t does not directly administer any training institute ; however , it provides guidance and funding to training institutes that are part of the national domestic preparedness consortium ( ndpc ) , described earlier in this report .

some training programs offered by emi and nfa have similar subject matter in training provided by ndpc training institutes , such as incident management , homeland security planning , hazardous material incident response , emergency operations , and wmd response .

because of a the possible similarity of these training programs for state and local first responders , it could be argued that there is a need to consolidate or coordinate training offered by these two separate dhs agencies .

fema's firefighting training provided by the nfa , however , focuses primarily on the needs of local fire departments , whereas ndpc provides some training primarily focusing on law enforcement .

some of the training that is tailored to a specific profession such as law enforcement or firefighting would not seem to be redundant .

basic or introductory training such as incident management or wmd response , however , may not be specifically tailored for a single profession or type of first responder .

this possible redundancy of training and the potential consolidation of training may be policy questions that congress may choose to address through oversight of dhs's role in providing assistance to states and localities .

possible approaches include .

if congress were to determine that there was no redundancy or a need to consolidate dhs training programs , it could allow dhs to continue to provide first responder training through two separate agencies .

this would allow emergency managers , law enforcement personnel , firefighters , and emergency medical personnel to apply for and receive training from the two agencies and the training institutes they administer .

this option , however , appears to leave unresolved the claims of possible redundancy of training or the possibility that these training programs are not coordinated .

congress could ask gao to undertake an evaluation of dhs counter - terrorism training programs .

the evaluation could review odp and fema training curricula , individual courses , intended and actual trainees , and training facilities .

after conducting a review of these courses , gao might be able to identify any duplication of training and possible options for consolidating or coordinating this training .

this option would give the committee additional tools for oversight of these programs .

h.r .

1544 ( as reported ) , section 6 , proposes this evaluation .

this option , however , would require the committee to work with gao to set a mutually acceptable scope and time forâ the study .

if congress were to find undesirable redundancy in training programs , it could direct dhs to be more attentive to coordinating the counter - terrorism training programs administered by g&t and fema .

dhs could possibly establish a board to review the g&t and fema training programs , and to recommend coordination or other steps to reduce duplication .

if congress were to determine that there is a need to consolidate dhs training programs , it could direct dhs , through statutory or conference language , to conduct a review of its training programs and develop a plan to consolidate its training .

this consolidation might involve the removal of similar programs provided by g&t and fema to ensure there is no redundancy .

if congress did not consider this consolidation adequate to ensure against redundant or uncoordinated dhs training , it could also direct dhs to consolidate all counter - terrorism training under one agency .

g&t might be directed to assume the responsibility of administering not only its training , but also the training fema provides first responders through emi and nfa .

some would argue this is a logical choice since g&t is responsible for administering the funding to states and localities that assist them in receiving this training .

this option , however , might be seen as impractical due to the specific training emi provides state and local emergency managers that is specific to natural disasters , and the specific training nfa provides firefighters .

fema historically has administered training programs for emergency managers and firefighters , whereas g&t has administered law enforcement focused training .
