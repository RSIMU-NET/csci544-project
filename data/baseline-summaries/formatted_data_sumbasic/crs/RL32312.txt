on november 20 , 2004 , both houses agreed to the conference report on a consolidatedappropriations bill ( h.r .

4818 ) , containing the fy2005 legislative branchappropriations bill , along with eight other regular annual appropriations bills on which action hadnot yet been completed .

 ( 1 ) h.r .

4818 was signedby the president on december 8 , 2004 ( p.l .

108-447 , 118 stat .

2809 ; 658 pages ) .

the annual legislative branch appropriations bill contains two titles .

appropriations forlegislative branch agencies are contained in title i .

title ii contains general administrativeprovisions , and from time to time , appropriations for legislative branch entities .

for example , in thefy2003 act title ii contained funding for the john c. stennis center for public service trainingand development and the congressional award act .

congress changed the structure of the annual legislative branch appropriations bill effective in fy2003 .

prior to enactment of the fy2003 bill , and effective in fy1978 , the legislative branchappropriations bill was divided into two titles .

title i , congressional operations , contained budgetauthorities for activities directly serving congress .

included in this title were the budgets of thehouse , the senate , joint items ( joint house and senate activities ) , the office of compliance , thecongressional budget office ( cbo ) , the architect of the capitol ( aoc ) ( except the library ofcongress ( loc ) buildings and grounds ) , the congressional research service ( crs ) within thelibrary of congress , and congressional printing and binding activities of the government printingoffice ( gpo ) .

title ii , related agencies , contained budgets for activities not directly supporting congress .

included in this title were budgets of the botanic garden , the library of congress ( except thecongressional research service ) , the library buildings and grounds maintained by the architect ofthe capitol , the government printing office ( except congressional printing and binding costs ) , andthe government accountability office ( gao ) , formerly named the general accounting office .

periodically since fy1978 , the bill contained additional titles for such purposes as capitalimprovements and special one - time functions .

in addition to activities funded in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill , other legislative budget authorities include permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trustfunds , and non - legislative entities .

these include the following: permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action .

 ( 2 ) permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose .

trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority .

they are included in the u.s. budget , prepared by the officeof management and budget , either as budget receipts or offsetting collections .

 ( 3 ) the u.s. budget also contains non - legislative entities within the legislative branch budget .

they are funded in other appropriation bills , but are counted as legislative branch funds by the officeof management and budget for bookkeeping purposes .

 ( 4 ) for a more accurate picture of the legislative branch budget , as contained in the annual legislative branch appropriation bill , the total fy2005 legislative branch appropriation figure in thefy2005 u.s. budget must be adjusted .

this is accomplished by subtracting non - legislative fundsand permanent federal and trust funds .

the fy2005 u.s. budget contains a legislative budgetauthority request of $4.4 billion .

after subtracting non - legislative entities ( $48 million ) , permanentfederal funds ( $358 million ) , and permanent trust funds ( $27 million ) , the total request for entitiesfunded in the regular annual appropriation bill is $3.97 billion .
