the office of personnel management ( opm ) has issued guidance for federal executive branch departments and agencies on various flexibilities available to facilitate hrm for emergency situations involving severe weather , natural disaster , and other circumstances multiple times since 2001 .

notably , these issuances occurred following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks ; in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita , which occurred back - to - back in the gulf coast region of the united states in late summer 2005 ; and as part of fulfilling opm's responsibilities under the president's national strategy on pandemic influenza in 2006 .

most recently , opm issued guidance in a memorandum titled , "human resources flexibilities for hurricane harvey and its aftermath," issued on august 27 , 2017 .

the memorandum "remind[s] agencies of the wide range of human resources ( hr ) policies and flexibilities currently available to assist federal employees. .

on september 1 , 2017 , opm , in consultation with the office of management and budget ( omb ) , established an emergency leave transfer program for federal employees who were adversely affected by hurricane harvey .

seven days later , on september 8 , 2017 , as hurricane irma tracked toward florida , opm authorized departments and agencies to hire individuals under excepted service appointments and on a temporary basis for up to one year ( with an extension up to one year ) .

the individuals "will be directly involved with the recovery and relief efforts associated with hurricane harvey or hurricane irma. .

subject to guidance from the opm director , federal executive boards ( febs ) are available to assist the agency with matters related to emergency operations , such as operations under hazardous weather conditions .

the febs were established by a presidential memorandum issued by president john f. kennedy in november 1961 , to "provide means for closer coordination of federal activities at the regional level. .

currently , febs operate in 28 metropolitan areas .

a goal of the febs is "to create effective collaboration on emergency readiness and recovery , and to educate [the] federal workforce on issues in emergency situations. .

table 1 , below , provides information on selected flexibilities related to staffing , compensation , leave transfer , and telework in title 5 of the united states code and title 5 of the code of federal regulations .

the table refers to several hr terms , which are explained as follows: competitive s ervice positions are civil service positions in the executive branch , except positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute ; positions to which appointments are made by nomination for confirmation by the senate , unless the senate otherwise directs ; and positions in the senior executive service ( ses ) .

such positions require applicants to compete against one another in open competition based on job - related criteria to obtain employment .

the positions are subject to the civil service laws codified at title 5 of the united states code and to oversight by opm .

employees are to be selected from among the best - qualified candidates and without discrimination .

excepted s ervice positions are civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the ses .

qualification standards and requirements for these positions are established by the individual agencies .

the title 5 rules on appointment ( except for veterans' preference ) , pay , and classification do not apply .

ses positions are classified above grade 15 of the general schedule or in level iv or v of the executive schedule , or an equivalent position , and are not filled by presidential appointment by and with the advice and consent of the senate .

members of the ses , among other duties , direct the work of an organizational unit and exercise important policymaking , policy - determining , or other executive functions .

the reemployment priority list is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their current and former competitive service employees who will be , or were , separated by reduction in force or who are fully recovered from a compensable injury after more than one year .
