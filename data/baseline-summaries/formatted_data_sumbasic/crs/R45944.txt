the united kingdom's ( uk's ) exit from the european union ( eu ) , commonly termed brexit , remains the overwhelmingly predominant issue in uk politics .

in a national referendum held in june 2016 , 52% of uk voters favored leaving the eu .

in march 2017 , the uk officially notified the eu of its intention to leave the bloc , and the uk and the eu began negotiations on the terms of the uk's withdrawal .

brexit was originally scheduled to occur on march 29 , 2019 , but the uk parliament was unable to agree on a way forward due to divisions over what type of brexit the uk should pursue and challenges related to the future of the border between northern ireland ( part of the uk ) and the republic of ireland ( an eu member state ) .

in early 2019 , parliament repeatedly rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated between then - prime minister theresa may's government and the eu , while also indicating opposition to a no - deal scenario , in which the uk would exit the eu without a negotiated withdrawal agreement .

amid this impasse , in april 2019 , eu leaders agreed to grant the uk an extension until october 31 , 2019 .

on october 17 , 2019 , negotiators from the eu and the government of uk prime minister boris johnson concluded a new withdrawal agreement , but johnson encountered challenges in securing the uk parliament's approval of the deal .

the eu granted the uk another extension until january 31 , 2020 , while parliament set an early general election for december 12 , 2019 .

johnson's conservative party scored a decisive victory in the election , winning 365 out of 650 seats in the uk house of commons .

the result provided prime minister johnson with a mandate to proceed with his preferred plans for brexit .

the uk the eu ratified the withdrawal agreement in january 2020 , and the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 , 2020 .

brexit remains far from over , however , as the uk and the eu enter a process of determining the character of their future relationship .

many members of congress have a broad interest in brexit .

brexit - related developments are likely to have implications for the global economy , u.s. - uk and u.s. - eu political and economic relations , and transatlantic cooperation on foreign policy and security issues .

in 2018 , the administration formally notified congress under trade promotion authority ( tpa ) of its intent to launch u.s. - uk free trade agreement ( fta ) negotiations after the uk leaves the eu , and congress may consider how brexit developments affect the prospects for an agreement .

whether a potential final agreement would meet congressional expectations or tpa requirements or be concluded as an executive agreement is unclear.â congress would likely need to pass legislation to implement the potential fta before it could enter into force , particularly if it were a comprehensive fta .

u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer has said that trade negotiations with the uk are a "priority" and will start as soon as the uk is in a position to negotiate , but he cautioned that the negotiations may take time .

some members of congress also have demonstrated an interest in how brexit might affect northern ireland .

in april 2019 , house speaker nancy pelosi said there would be "no chance whatsoever" for a u.s. - uk trade agreement if brexit were to weaken the northern ireland peace process .

on october 22 , 2019 , the house subcommittee on europe , eurasia , energy , and the environment held a hearing titled "protecting the good friday agreement from brexit. .

on december 3 , 2020 , the house passed h.res .

585 , reaffirming support for the good friday agreement in light of brexit and asserting that any future u.s. - uk trade agreement and other u.s. - uk bilateral agreements must include conditions to uphold the peace accord .

other members of congress , including senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley , have expressed support for the uk and a bilateral trade agreement post - brexit and have not conditioned such support on protecting northern ireland .

the december 2019 election resolved a political deadlock that dominated uk politics for three and a half years .

unable to break the stalemate over brexit in parliament , prime minister theresa may resigned as leader of the conservative party on june 7 , 2019 .

boris johnson became prime minister on july 24 , 2019 , after winning the resulting conservative party leadership contest .

seen as a colorful and polarizing figure who was one of the leading voices in the campaign for the uk to leave the eu , johnson previously served as uk foreign secretary in the may government from 2016 to 2018 and mayor of london from 2008 to 2016 .

he inherited a government in which , at the time , the conservative party held a one - seat parliamentary majority by virtue of support from the democratic unionist party ( dup ) , the largest unionist party in northern ireland , which strongly supports northern ireland's continued integration as part of the uk .

after taking office , prime minister johnson announced that he intended to negotiate a new deal with the eu that discarded the contentious northern ireland backstop provision that would have kept the uk in the eu customs union until the two sides agreed on their future trade relationship .

the backstop was intended to prevent a hard border with customs and security checks on the island of ireland and to ensure that brexit would not compromise the rules of the eu single market ( see appendix a , which reviews the backstop and the rejected withdrawal deal ) .

although prime minister johnson asserted that he did not desire a hard land border , he strongly opposed the backstop arrangement .

like many members of parliament both within and outside the conservative party , johnson viewed the backstop as potentially curbing the uk's sovereignty and limiting its ability to conclude free trade deals .

given initial skepticism about the chances for renegotiating the withdrawal agreement with the eu , the johnson government began to ramp up preparations for a possible no - deal brexit .

in september 2019 , parliament passed legislation requiring the government to request a three - month deadline extension ( through january 31 , 2020 ) from the eu on october 19 , 2019 , unless the government had reached an agreement with the eu that parliament had approved or received parliament's approval to leave the eu without a withdrawal agreement .

the government also lost its parliamentary majority in september 2019 , with the defection of one conservative member of parliament ( mp ) to the liberal democrats and the expulsion from the party of 21 conservative mps ( 10 of the 21 were later reinstated ) who worked with the opposition parties to limit the government's ability to pursue a no - deal brexit .

prime minister johnson subsequently sought to trigger an early general election , to take place before the october 31 brexit deadline , but fell short of the needed two - thirds majority in parliament to support the motion .

in the 2016 brexit referendum , northern ireland voted 56% to 44% against leaving the eu .

brexit poses considerable challenges for northern ireland , with potential implications for its peace process , economy , and , in the longer term , constitutional status in the uk .

following brexit , northern ireland is the only part of the uk to share a land border with an eu member state ( see figure 2 ) .

preventing a hard border on the island of ireland ( with customs checks and physical infrastructure ) was a key goal , and a major stumbling block , in negotiating and finalizing the uk's withdrawal agreement with the eu .

northern ireland's history of political violence complicated arrangements for the post - brexit border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland .

roughly 3,500 people died during "the troubles," northern ireland's 30-year sectarian conflict ( 1969 to 1999 ) between unionists ( protestants who largely define themselves as british and support remaining part of the uk ) and nationalists ( catholics who consider themselves irish and may desire a united ireland ) .

at the time of the 1998 peace accord in northern ireland ( known as the good friday agreement or the belfast agreement ) , the eu membership of both the uk and the republic of ireland was regarded as essential to underpinning the political settlement by providing a common european identity for both unionists and nationalists in northern ireland .

eu law also provided a supporting framework for guaranteeing the human rights , equality , and nondiscrimination provisions of the peace accord .

since 1998 , as security checkpoints were dismantled in accordance with the peace agreement , and because both the uk and ireland belonged to the eu's single market and customs union , the circuitous 300-mile land border between northern ireland and ireland effectively disappeared .

the border's disappearance served as an important political and psychological symbol on both sides of the sectarian divide and helped produce a dynamic cross - border economy .

many experts deem an open , invisible border as crucial to a still - fragile peace process , in which deep divisions and a lack of trust persist .

some analysts suggest that differences over brexit also heightened tensions between the unionist and nationalist communities' respective political parties and stymied the reestablishment of the regional ( or devolved ) government for close to three years following the last legislative assembly elections in march 2017 .

 ( for more background , see appendix b . ) .

many u.s. officials and members of congress view the uk as the united states' closest and most reliable ally .

this perception stems from a combination of factors , including a sense of shared history , values , and culture ; a large and mutually beneficial economic relationship ; and extensive cooperation on foreign policy and security issues .

the uk and the united states have a particularly close defense relationship and a unique intelligence - sharing partnership .

since 2016 , president trump has been outspoken in repeatedly expressing his support for brexit .

president trump counts leading brexit supporters , including boris johnson and brexit party leader nigel farage , among his personal friends .

he publicly criticized theresa may's handling of brexit and stated during the most recent conservative leadership race that boris johnson would "make a great prime minister. .

president trump repeated his support for johnson prior to the december 2019 uk election and celebrated johnson's win , writing on social media that the election outcome would allow the united states and uk to reach a new trade deal .

senior administration officials have reinforced the president's pro - brexit messages .

during an august 2019 visit to london , then - u.s. national security adviser john bolton stated that the administration would "enthusiastically" support a no - deal brexit ; he asserted that a u.s. - uk trade deal could be negotiated quickly and possibly be concluded sector - by - sector to speed up the process .

in a september 2019 visit to ireland , vice president mike pence reiterated the administration's support for the uk leaving the eu and urged ireland and the eu to "work to reach an agreement that respects the united kingdom's sovereignty. .

vice president pence expressed his hope that an agreement would "also provide for an orderly brexit. .

three and a half years after the brexit referendum , a decisive victory in the uk's december 2019 general election allowed uk prime minister johnson to proceed with brexit .

the uk withdrew from the eu at the end of january 2020 and began a transition period , scheduled to last until the end of 2020 , during which it is expected to focus on negotiations with the eu on an fta and other elements of the future uk - eu relationship .

a significant number of unknowns remain , including how elements of the withdrawal agreement will be implemented , whether the two sides will be able to conclude an agreement on the future relationship during the 11-month transition period , and the effects of ending the transition period without such an agreement .

regardless of the precise turn of events , the aftermath of brexit is expected to remain a primary focus of uk politics and a leading concern for the eu for the foreseeable future .

during the 116 th congress , developments with regard to brexit and their implications for u.s. - uk and u.s. - eu relations , foreign policy and security cooperation , and the global economy and trade issues may remain of interest to members of congress .

the topic of a prospective u.s. - uk fta may be a particular area of congressional interest .

congress also may consider how brexit could affect northern ireland and the northern ireland peace process .

appendix a .

review of the backstop and the rejected withdrawal deal under former united kingdom ( uk ) prime minister theresa may , the approach of the uk government to leaving the european union ( eu ) was to pursue a relatively hard brexit , meaning a full departure from the eu single market and customs union , and a full restoration of british sovereignty over lawmaking , including with regard to controlling immigration .

the approach called for the uk to subsequently negotiate a free trade agreement with the eu to secure as much access to the eu market as possible .

in november 2018 , eu and uk negotiators finalized a 585-page draft withdrawal agreement and a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship .

the withdrawal agreement contained four main elements to guide the uk's orderly departure from the eu: guarantees pertaining to the rights of the approximately 3 million eu citizens residing in the uk and the approximately 1 million uk citizens residing in the eu .

a commitment by the uk to pay the eu â£39 billion ( approximately $50 billion ) to settle outstanding budgetary and financial pledges .

a transition period , lasting through 2020 , in which the uk would be bound to follow all rules governing the eu single market while the two sides negotiate their future relationship and implement steps needed to effect an orderly separation .

a backstop provision , which would keep the uk in the eu customs union until the two sides agreed on their future trade relationship .

the backstop was made necessary by the lack of an apparent solution to the irish border question , with both sides intent on avoiding a hard border with customs checks and physical infrastructure between northern ireland and the republic of ireland .

the provision was intended to protect cross - border trade and preserve the peace process between parties to northern ireland's long sectarian conflict .

the eu also viewed the backstop as necessary to ensure that brexit would not violate the rules and structure of the eu single market .

the nonbinding political declaration on the future uk - eu relationship called for an economic partnership with the eu that features an ambitious free trade area and deep cooperation , but also "separate markets and distinct legal orders," and the development of an independent uk trade policy .

the backstop provision became one of the main obstacles to securing parliament's approval of the withdrawal agreement .

although the former may government contended that it would never be necessary to implement the backstop , critics noted that the uk would be unable to conduct an independent national trade policy , one of the main selling points for brexit's supporters , as long as the uk remained a member of the eu customs union .

 ( the backstop would have taken effect at the conclusion of the transition periodâthat is , at the end of 2020âif the two sides had not reached a new trade agreement with more preferable arrangements for resolving the border issue. ) .

supporters of a hard brexit , led by a faction of the conservative party , objected that the backstop would leave the uk a "vassal state" of the eu , bound indefinitely to many eu rules ( both sides would have to jointly agree to end the backstop ) .

many unionists in northern ireland strongly opposed the deal because a provision in the backstop would preserve deeper regulatory alignment between northern ireland and the eu to avoid a hard border .

they argue that it is unacceptable to treat northern ireland differently from the rest of the uk and that doing so weakens the uk's constitutional integrity .

advocates of a soft brexit maintain that permanent membership in the eu single market would be the least damaging outcome in economic terms , and that an assurance of permanent customs union membership would mitigate brexit - related uncertainties .

many who favor a soft brexit argued that may's withdrawal agreement prolonged such uncertainties while failing to deliver sufficient benefits .

others in the opposition parties voted against the deal in the hopes that its defeat would lead to an early general election or a second referendum on eu membership .

between january 2019 and march 2019 , the house of commons rejected the withdrawal agreement three times .

the house of commons also held a series of nonbinding "indicative" votes to determine where members stood on options and proposals , including staying in the eu single market and / or customs union , leaving without a deal , cancelling the withdrawal process to avoid "no deal," and holding a public vote to confirm any deal .

no proposal received a majority .

appendix b .

northern ireland: from the troubles to a fragile peace between 1969 and 1999 , roughly 3,500 people died as a result of political violence in northern ireland .

the conflict , often referred to as "the troubles," has its origins in the 1921 division of ireland and reflects a struggle between different national , cultural , and religious identities .

protestants in northern ireland ( 48% ) largely define themselves as british and support remaining part of the united kingdom ( unionists ) .

catholics in northern ireland ( 45% ) consider themselves irish , and many catholics desire a united ireland ( nationalists ) .

in the past , more militant unionists ( loyalists ) and more militant nationalists ( republicans ) were willing to use violence to achieve their goals .

the 1998 peace agreement for years , the british and irish governments sought to facilitate a negotiated political settlement to the conflict .

after many ups and downs , the two governments and the northern ireland political parties participating in peace talks announced an agreement on april 10 , 1998 .

the resulting good friday agreementâor belfast agreementâis a multi - layered and interlocking document , consisting of a political settlement reached by northern ireland's political parties and an international treaty between the uk and irish governments .

at the core of the good friday agreement is the consent principle âthat is , a change in northern ireland's status as part of the united kingdom ( uk ) can come about only with the consent of the majority of northern ireland's people ( as well as with the consent of a majority in ireland ) .

although the agreement acknowledged that a substantial section of the population in northern ireland and a majority on the island desired a united ireland , it recognized that the majority of people in northern ireland wished to remain part of the uk .

if the preferences of these majorities were to change , the agreement asserted that both the uk and irish governments would have a binding obligation to bring about the wish of the people ; thus , the agreement included provisions for future polls ( a border poll ) to be held in northern ireland on its constitutional status should events warrant .

the good friday agreement set out a framework for devolved governmentâthe transfer of specified powers over local governance from london to belfastâwith a northern ireland assembly and executive committee in which unionist and nationalist parties would share power .

the agreement also contained provisions on the decommissioning ( disarmament ) of paramilitary weapons , policing , human rights , uk security normalization ( demilitarization ) in northern ireland , and the status of prisoners .

finally , the good friday agreement created several new institutions to promote "north - south" cooperation on cross - border issues among leaders on the island of ireland and "east - west" institutions to address regional issues affecting the uk , ireland , the channel islands , and the isle of man .

despite a much - improved security situation since 1998 , full implementation of the good friday agreement has been challenging .

for years , instability in northern ireland's devolved government was the rule rather than the exception .

decommissioning and police reforms were key sticking points .

in 2007 , however , the hard - line democratic unionist party ( dup ) and sinn fein , the political party associated with the irish republican army ( ira ) , reached a landmark power - sharing deal .

regularly scheduled assembly elections since the 2007 deal ( in 2011 and 2016 ) produced successive power - sharing governments led by the dup and sinn fein .

in 2010 , the dup and sinn fein also reached an agreement to resolve the controversial issue of devolving police and justice affairs from london to belfast .

recent crisis in the devolved government and other challenges analysts largely view implementation of the most important aspects of the good friday agreement as complete .

at the same time , tensions and distrust persist among the unionist and nationalist communities and their respective political parties , and many experts suggest that the peace process remains fragile .

the inability of northern ireland's political parties to reach an agreement on reestablishing a devolved government for nearly three years following snap 2017 assembly elections exemplifies the ongoing divisions and frictions in northern ireland's politics and society .

the previous devolved government led by the dup and sinn fein collapsed in january 2017 , after 10 months in office .

the immediate impetus for the collapse was a renewable energy scandal involving dup leader and northern ireland first minister arlene foster .

however , frictions on several other issuesâincluding giving the irish language the same official status as english , legalizing same - sex marriage , and brexitâcontributed to sinn fein's decision to force snap assembly elections .

the dup and sinn fein remain at odds over brexit ; sinn fein strongly opposes brexit , whereas the dup is the only major northern ireland political party to support it .

the dup retained the largest number of assembly seats in the march 2017 elections , but sinn fein reduced the gap with the dup to one seat in the assembly and was widely regarded as the biggest winner .

negotiations on forming a new devolved government proceeded in fits and starts but repeatedly stalled , primarily over a potential stand - alone irish language act .

some analysts suggest that the dup's support for the conservative party government in the uk parliament following the june 2017 snap general election further heightened distrust between sinn fein and the dup , hardened the positions of both parties , and made reaching an agreement on a new devolved government more difficult .

others note that brexit has consumed uk and northern ireland politicians' time and attention and largely overshadowed negotiations on a new devolved government .

in april 2019 , journalist lyra mckee was shot and killed while covering riots in londonderry ( also known as derry ) .

the new ira , a dissident republican group opposed to the peace process , claimed responsibility ( but also apologized , asserting that it had been aiming to shoot a police officer but hit mckee by accident ) .

mckee's death sparked a significant public outcry and prompted the uk and irish governments to launch a more intensive effort to revive talks with northern ireland's political parties on forming a new devolved government .

negotiations remained largely deadlocked , however , throughout the summer and fall of 2019 amid ongoing uncertainty over brexit .

on december 16 , 2019 , the uk and irish governments launched a new round of talks with the dup , sinn fein , and northern ireland's other main political parties aimed at reestablishing the devolved government .

these negotiations followed the uk's december 12 , 2019 , general election in which prime minister johnson's conservative party won a convincing parliamentary majority , negating the influence of the dup in the uk parliament and clearing the way for approval of the brexit withdrawal agreement with the eu .

some analysts suggested the uk election results improved the prospects for restoring northern ireland's devolved government .

both the dup and sinn fein saw a decrease in their shares of the vote , while more moderate "middle ground" parties saw an increase , in part due to voter dissatisfaction with the impasse in reestablishing the devolved government .

on january 10 , 2020 , the dup and sinn fein agreed to a deal to restore devolved government put forward by the uk and irish governments .

the new assembly convened the following day and elected a new executive , including the dup's arlene foster as first minister and sinn fein's michelle o'neill as deputy first minister .

the power - sharing deal is wide - ranging and addresses a number of key issues , including use of the irish language , health and education concerns , increasing the number of police officers , and measures to improve the sustainability and transparency of northern ireland's political institutions .

both the uk and irish governments also promised additional financial support for northern ireland as part of the deal .

despite the decrease in the levels of violence since the good friday agreement , northern ireland continues to grapple with a number of issues in its search for peace and reconciliation .

northern ireland remains a largely divided society , with protestant and catholic communities existing in parallel .

around 100 peace walls or other physical barriers throughout northern ireland separate some protestant and catholic neighborhoods , and schools and housing estates remain mostly single - identity communities .

sectarian tensions continue to flare periodically on issues such as parading , protests , and the use of flags and emblems .

other prominent challenges include addressing northern ireland's legacy of violence ( often termed dealing with the past ) , curbing remaining paramilitary and dissident activity , and promoting economic development and equality .

experts also contend that brexit may continue to pose significant concerns for northern ireland's still - tenuous peace process and its future political and economic development .
