the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2002 to fy2009 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the bill's four titles .

it also lists the total of several scorekeeping adjustments .

tables 4 through 1 4 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2009-fy2010 .

accompanying these tables is a discussion of the key issues involved in the major programs in the four titles .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities historically funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs , and the bill now includes programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics , which formerly had been included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

the fy2009 appropriations acts funded doe programs at $34.2 billion .

this sum included $7.5 billion for advanced technical vehicles manufacturing loans , appropriated in the continuing resolution , p.l .

110-329 .

in addition , the arra ( p.l .

111-5 ) appropriated $38.7 billion for selected doe programs: primarily conservation and renewable energy , electricity delivery , fossil energy r&d , science , and environmental clean - up .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) requested $1.071 billion for fy2010 ( including $10.1 million for the inspector general's office ) , an increase of $25.6 million from the fy2009 funding level .

the house endorsed the full nrc request , including funding for licensing the proposed yucca mountain nuclear waste repository .

the senate provided the full request for nrc , plus a slight increase for the inspector general , and included a higher revenue offset that resulted in a net appropriation level that was $24.3 million below the total request .

the conference agreement provides $1.067 billion , including $10.9 million for the inspector general .

major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users .

the nrc budget request included $248.3 million for new reactor activities , largely to handle new nuclear power plant license applications .

until recently , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s .

however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities to apply for licenses for 26 reactors since september 2007 , with several more expected through 2010 .

nrc's proposed fy2010 budget also included $56.0 million from the nuclear waste fund for licensing doe's proposed yucca mountain nuclear waste repository , for which the license application was submitted june 3 , 2008 .

nrc's fy2009 appropriation for yucca mountain licensing was $49.0 million , but nrc noted that previously appropriated funding raised the total fy2009 spending level to $59.0 million .

the house provided the full nrc request for yucca mountain licensing , but the senate cut the amount to $29.0 million .

the conference agreement included the lower senate level .

the obama administration has pledged to halt the yucca mountain repository and find alternative strategies for handling nuclear waste , but it has allowed the yucca mountain licensing process to continue .

however , senator reid , a long - time opponent of the proposed yucca mountain repository , announced on july 29 , 2009 , that the administration had agreed to terminate the yucca mountain licensing effort in the fy2011 budget request .

for reactor oversight and incident response , nrc's fy2010 budget request included $263.2 million , about $2 million above the fy2009 level .

those activities include reactor safety inspections , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises .

 ( for more information on protecting licensed nuclear facilities , see crs report rl34331 , nuclear power plant security and vulnerabilities , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. ) .

the energy policy act of 2005 permanently extended a requirement that 90% of nrc's budget be offset by fees on licensees .

not subject to the offset are expenditures from the nuclear waste fund to pay for waste repository licensing , spending on general homeland security , and doe defense waste oversight .

the offsets in the fy2010 request would have resulted in a net appropriation of $183.9 million , an increase of $9 million from fy2009 .

the house approved the requested fy2010 net appropriation , while the senate - passed net appropriation was $159.7 million .

the net appropriation in the conference agreement , including the inspector general , is $154.7 million .
