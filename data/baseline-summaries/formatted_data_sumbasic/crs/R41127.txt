the hcera also extends mandatory appropriations for existing hea programs and provides mandatory appropriations for a program authorized under the trade act of 1974 ( 19 u.s.c. , chapter 12 ) .

the hea authorizes a broad array of federal student aid programs that assist students and their families with paying for or financing the cost of postsecondary education , as well as programs that provide aid to institutions of higher education ( ihes ) .

in recent years , major amendments to selected hea programs — particularly those that receive mandatory funding — have been made as part of recent budget reconciliation measures .

in the 109 th congress , the federal family education loan ( ffel ) program and the william d. ford federal direct loan ( dl ) program were amended and extended under the higher education reconciliation act ( hera , part of p.l .

109-171 ) .

in the 110 th congress , the college cost reduction and access act ( ccraa ; p.l .

finally , the 110 th congress enacted the higher education opportunity act ( heoa ; p.l .

110-315 ) to amend , extend , and authorize new programs under the hea , including amendments to the ffel , dl , and pell grant programs .

effective march 30 , 2010 , indefinite mandatory appropriations are provided for the federal pell grant program to supplement annual discretionary appropriations and to fund an increase above the annual appropriated pell grant maximum award .

from ay2013-2014 to ay2017-2018 , these annual increases to the pell grant award amount are indexed to the percent change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers ( cpi - u ) .

effective fy2011 , an additional $13.5 billion in mandatory appropriations for pell grants will be available for obligation until september 30 , 2012 .

the remainder of this report summarizes the legislative history , estimated cost savings , and education - related provisions of p.l .

111-152 .

the legislative history describes the budget reconciliation process .

the cost estimate is subsequently presented and is followed by a description of the hea programs and other programs that would be amended .

this begins with a review of changes that affect the ffel program and reduce federal spending .

this is followed by a review of the corresponding revisions to the dl program .

finally , changes that increase spending under the pell grant program and other programs are described .

the house and the senate approved h.rept .

111-89 , the conference report to accompany s.con.res .

13 , the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010 , on april 29 , 2009 .

the fy2010 budget resolution includes six reconciliation instructions to three house committees and two senate committees .

the house education and labor committee received two reconciliation instructions , each directing the committee to report changes in laws within its jurisdictions to reduce the deficit by $1 billion for the period of fy2009 through fy2014 .

the first reconciliation instruction included the term "health care reform," and the second instruction included the term , "investing in education," although the committee has discretion to respond to each directive with any type of legislative language within their jurisdiction that would achieve the budgetary outcome included in the directive .

h.r .

3221 , the student aid and fiscal responsibility act of 2009 , was introduced on july 15 , 2009 , to increase student aid through loan reform , improve college access and completion rates , invest in educational facilities and early childhood education , and other purposes .

on july 27 , 2009 , the house education and labor committee reported h.r .

3221 to the house .

on october 7 , 2009 , the committee also submitted h.rept .

111-232 , which contained language identical to the text of h.r .

3221 , as reconciliation instructions to the house budget committee .

on september 17 , 2009 , the house passed h.r .

3221 by a vote of 253 to 171 .

h.r .

3221 , as passed by the house , would amend the higher education act ( hea ) of 1965 , as amended , by making changes to existing programs and by establishing several new programs and benefits .

it would also establish several new non - hea programs .

major proposals in h.r .

3221 include the following .

the authority to make loans under the federal family education loan ( ffel ) program would be terminated after june 2010 .

beginning july 1 , 2010 , all student loans made under title iv of the hea would be made under the william d. ford federal direct loan ( dl ) program .

beginning july 1 , 2010 , a new federal direct perkins loan would be offered under the dl program , and authority to make new loans under the current federal perkins loan program would end .

beginning in fy2010 , indefinite mandatory appropriations would be provided for the federal pell grant program to supplement annual discretionary appropriations .

effective for award year ( ay ) 2011-2012 , the hea , title iv federal student aid need analysis methodology would be simplified and requirements for aid applicants to report certain asset - related financial information on the free application for federal student aid ( fafsa ) would be eliminated .

mandatory funding for hea programs serving historically black colleges and universities ( hbcus ) and other minority - serving institutions would be provided for fy2010 through fy2019 .

for fy2010 through fy2014 , mandatory funding would be provided for programs in a new hea college access and completion innovation fund ( cacif ) to promote success in postsecondary education , improve subsequent employment outcomes , and assist states in developing longitudinal data systems .

mandatory funding would be provided to establish and fund programs for the modernization , renovation , and repair of k - 12 school facilities in fy2010 and fy2011 ; for the modernization , renovation , and repair of postsecondary school facilities in fy2010 ; and for the construction and renovation of k - 12 school facilities in louisiana , mississippi , and alabama in fy2010 and fy2011 .

for fy2010-fy2017 , mandatory funding would be provided to establish and fund an early learning challenge fund to improve the standards and quality of state early childhood education programs .

for fy2010-fy2019 , mandatory funding would be provided to establish and fund the american graduation initiative grant program for the purpose of reforming community colleges , and to improve education and training for workforce development .

the "defund acorn act" would prohibit organizations that have run afoul of certain federal or state campaign finance , election , or voter registration laws from being awarded federal grants or contracts and from receiving federal funds .

the house budget committee prepared the reconciliation act of 2010 ( h.r .

4872 ) by packaging education - related reconciliation instructions submitted by the house education and labor committee with health care - related reconciliation instructions submitted by both the house committee on ways and means and the house committee on education and labor .

on december 24 , 2009 , the senate passed health care reform legislation , the patient protection and affordable care act ( h.r .

3590 ) .

in early march 2010 , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) released revised estimates of the savings associated with eliminating the ffel program .

whereas in july 2009 , cbo estimated savings of $86.8 billion over the fy2009-fy2019 period , in march 2010 , cbo estimated savings of $67 billion over the fy2011-fy2020 period .

in part , as a result of the lower estimates of the savings that would result from terminating the ffel program and because some of the education provisions might have violated senate rules regarding reconciliation bills — rules that require provisions be related to spending or revenues — the house rules committee made public an amendment in the nature of a substitute to h.r .

4872 on march 18 , 2010 .

the amendment in the nature of a substitute proposed to change several controversial elements contained in h.r .

3590 and removed or modified several education provisions contained in h.rept .

111-232 ( h.r .

3221 ) .

on march 21 , 2010 , the house agreed to a special rule ( h.res .

1203 ) that brought to the floor h.r .

4872 , as amended by the amendment in the nature of a substitute to h.r .

4872 .

later on march 21 , 2010 , the house passed h.r .

4872 by a vote of 220 to 211 , after having passed h.r .

3590 by a vote of 219 to 212 .

h.r .

3590 ( p.l .

111-148 ) was signed into law by the president on march 23 , 2010 .

in response to a ruling by the senate parliamentarian , the senate struck two provisions from h.r .

4872 before passing it on march 25 , 2010 , by a vote of 56 to 43 .

the provisions were deemed to be in violation of the senate byrd rule because they had no effect on federal outlays and revenue and thus were extraneous .

one provision would have eliminated a requirement established in the ccraa that the secretary of education either reduce or increase the additional mandatory pell grant amount in each award year if the budget authority provided for each year was insufficient or exceeded , respectively , the amount necessary to fully fund the prescribed additional mandatory amount in each year .

this requirement had never been implemented by ed and would have had no effect on the new provisions offered in h.r .

4872 .

the other provision would have established a new rule specifying that the additional mandatory pell grant award amount in each award year , as determined by a new formula in h.r .

4872 , could not be less than the additional mandatory award amount for the previous award year .

later on march 25 , 2010 , the house passed h.r .

4872 , as amended by the senate , by a vote of 220 to 207 , and it was signed into law by the president as p.l .

111-152 .

according to the cbo estimate of the safra act dated march 20 , 2010 , terminating ffel program lending and replacing it with increased lending under the dl program will reduce mandatory spending by $29 billion over the fy2010-fy2014 period , and by $61 billion over the fy2010-fy2019 period .

cbo also estimates that the safra act will increase discretionary spending by $1.3 billion over the fy2010-fy2014 period , and by $5.0 billion over the fy2010-fy2019 period .

most of these discretionary costs are estimated to be for the administrative costs of increased dl program lending .

the increase in mandatory appropriations for pell grants are estimated to increase mandatory spending by $21 billion over the fy2010-fy2014 period , and by $36 billion over the fy2010-fy2019 period .

overall , the cbo estimates that the safra act will reduce mandatory spending by $5 billion over the fy2010-fy2014 period , and by $19 billion over the fy2010-fy2019 period .

these estimated savings exceed the $1 billion reduction in spending specified in s.con.res .

13 .

the federal pell grant program , authorized by title iv , part a , subpart 1 of the hea , is the largest source of federal grant aid to low - income students for postsecondary education and is the foundation for all federal student aid awarded to undergraduate students .

the federal pell grant program is estimated to provide over $32 billion in aid to approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students in ay2010-2011 .

pell grants are need - based aid , and eligibility is limited to undergraduate students .

there is no absolute income threshold that determines who is eligible and who is ineligible for pell grants , although pell grant recipients primarily have low incomes .

for the most recent award year for which complete data are available ( ay2007-2008 ) , 83% of pell grant recipients considered to be dependent upon their parents for financial support had a total family income below $40,000 .

of pell grant recipients considered to be independent of their parents , 84% had a total family income below $30,000 .

the federal pell grant program is currently funded with both discretionary and mandatory appropriations , although the program is primarily funded with annual discretionary appropriations .

the program has garnered considerable attention over the past several years in congress , resulting in substantial increases in both mandatory and discretionary funding .

since the enactment of ccraa , the pell grant program's cumulative total funding level ( consisting of both discretionary and advance mandatory appropriations ) , for fy2007 through fy2010 and reflecting advance appropriations through fy2017 , is approximately $113.6 billion .

the statutory authority for the pell grant program was most recently reauthorized by the higher education opportunity act of 2008 ( heoa ; p.l .

110-315 ) .

the maximum appropriated pell grant award amount is specified in annual appropriations measures .

for ay2010-2011 , the maximum appropriated pell grant award amount is $4,860 .

for ay2008-2009 through ay2012-2013 , an automatic additional increase to the appropriated pell grant award amount is provided through mandatory funding .

for ay2010-2011 , the mandatory add - on is $690 .

in order to receive the additional mandatory increase , students must qualify for the minimum appropriated pell grant award , which , as defined for eligibility purposes , is 5% of the annually appropriated maximum pell grant award .

for ay2010-2011 , the total maximum pell grant award amount is $5,550 , and the effective minimum award for a full - time student is $1,176 .

the college access challenge grant program ( cacg ; hea title vii , part e ; 20 u.s.c .

§ 1141 ) fosters partnerships between federal , state , and local governments and philanthropic organizations through matching formula grants that are intended to increase the number of low - income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education .

the cacg was enacted under the ccraa .

the ccraa provided mandatory funding of $66 million for the program in each of fy2008 and fy2009 .

the heoa amended the cacg program to also authorize discretionary appropriations in such sums as may be necessary for fy2009 through fy2014 .

the program did not receive a discretionary appropriation in either fy2009 or fy2010 .

the safra act makes no changes to the purpose of the cacg program or the uses of funds except to provide mandatory funding of $150 million for each of fy2010 through fy2014 .

the safra act does not preclude additional discretionary appropriations through fy2014 .

the authority to award grants under the cacg program expires at the end of fy2014 .

finally , the safra act increases the minimum state grant from 0.5% of the appropriation to 1.0% of the appropriation .

the larger grants likewise increase the required non - federal share , which is 50% of the federal grant .

ed may reduce the state award proportionately if the state is unable to provide the full amount of the requisite non - federal share .

the proportionate reduction may be awarded to a philanthropic organization in the state if that organization is capable of providing the non - federal share .

title iv , part j of the ccraa provided mandatory appropriations for a set of new programs supporting minority - serving institutions .

the programs provided funding to improve academic programs , provide professional development , maintain educational facilities and equipment , strengthen institutional management , and encourage fiscal stability .

the institutions supported by the programs are historically black colleges and universities as defined in title iii , part b of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1061 ) ; hispanic - serving institutions as defined in title v , part a of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1101a ) ; tribal colleges or universities as defined in title iii , part a , section 316 of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1059c ) ; alaska native - and native hawaiian - serving institutions as defined in title iii , part a , section 317 of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1059d ) ; predominantly black institutions as defined in title iii , part f of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1059c ) ; asian american and native american pacific islander - serving institutions as defined in title iii , part f of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1059c ) ; and native american - serving nontribal institutions as defined in title iii , part f of the hea ( 20 u.s.c .

§ 1059c ) .

the ccraa provided mandatory funding of $255 million for the programs in each of fy2008 and fy2009 .

the authority to award grants under the programs expired at the end of fy2009 .

the heoa re - designated these programs under title iii , part f of the hea .

the safra act makes no changes to the part f programs except to extend mandatory funding of $255 million for each fiscal year from fy2008 through fy2019 .

the authority to award grants under part f expires at the end of fy2019 .

the trade adjustment assistance for communities ( taac ) program was incorporated into the trade act of 1974 ( 19 u.s.c. , chapter 12 ) , as amended , under the trade and globalization adjustment assistance act of 2009 ( tgaaa ) , which is part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) , to offer assistance to trade - impacted communities in response to the economic recession that began in 2007 .

tgaaa amends the trade act of 1974 to extend and revise trade adjustment assistance to various constituents .

taac , as reestablished through tgaaa , includes four subchapters .

subchapter a establishes the taac program within the u.s. department of commerce .

funds are competitively awarded to local governments in trade impacted areas in support of strategic planning and implementation activities aimed at diversifying and strengthening the area's economy .

subchapter b creates the community college and career training grant ( ccct ) program , a competitive grant administered by the u.s. department of labor ( dol ) .

the ccct supports efforts to strengthen the role of community colleges in addressing the education and skills deficiencies of workers in trade impacted communities .

subchapter c establishes the industry or sector partnership grants program for communities impacted by trade , also administered by dol .

voluntary public private partnerships in trade impacted communities are awarded competitive grants with the aim of identifying and addressing training and employment gaps in targeted industries and developing strategies to address the labor needs of current or emerging industries .

subchapter d includes general provisions related to program implementation .

the ccct program ( 19 u.s.c .

§ 2372 ) authorizes dol to award funds for the purpose of developing , offering , or improving educational or career training options for workers eligible for funds under trade adjustment assistance for workers .

eligible recipients are ihes , including proprietary institutions and postsecondary vocational institutions , as defined in section 102 of the hea .

eligible programs are two - year and less - than - two - year educational and training programs .

title i , part f of p.l .

111-152 amends section 279 ( b ) of the trade act of 1974 , as amended , to provide $500 million in mandatory funding per year for fy2011 through fy2014 for the ccct program , with the provision that each state receive no less than 0.5% of the funds appropriated for each year .

although arra terminates the program authorization on december 31 , 2010 , p.l .

111-152 implicitly authorizes the program through the appropriations .

under the statute as authorized prior to p.l .

111-152 , there was a stipulation that no eligible institution could be awarded more than one grant under this section or a grant under this section in excess of $1,000,000 , this stipulation is repealed , along with the provision that funds had to be used to supplement , not supplant , other federal , state , and local public funds .
