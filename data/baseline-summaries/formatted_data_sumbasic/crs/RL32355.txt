 ( 1 ) the payincrease is authorized by section 640 of title viof division h of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 ( h.r .

4818 ) , whichwas signed by the president on december 8 , 2004 , and became p.l .

108-447 .

the office ofpersonnel management ( opm ) published the salary tables for 2005 on its website on december 31,2004 , and these are available at http: / / www.opm.gov .

table 1 shows the recommended localitypayments , the authorized locality payments , and the net annual and locality pay increases .

federal white - collar employees are to receive an annual pay adjustment and a locality - based comparability payment , effective in january of each year , under section 529 of p.l .

101-509 , thefederal employees pay comparability act ( fepca ) of 1990 .

 ( 2 ) although the federal pay adjustmentsare sometimes referred to as cost - of - living adjustments , neither the annual adjustment nor the localitypayment is based on measures of the cost of living .

fepca has never been implemented asoriginally enacted .

the annual pay adjustment was not made in 1994 , and in 1995 , 1996 , and 1998,reduced amounts of the annual adjustment were provided .

for 1995 through 2005 , reduced amountsof the locality payments were provided .

table 2 shows annual and locality pay adjustments underfepca for the years 1991 through 2005 .

federal white - collar employees received an average 4.1%pay adjustment in january 2004 .

 ( 3 ) the nationwideaverage net pay increase in january 2004 , if theemployment cost index ( eci ) and locality - based comparability payments had been granted asspecified by fepca , would have been 15.15% .

in 2005 , federal white - collar employees receiveda 3.5% combined annual and locality pay adjustment .

the nationwide average net pay increase injanuary 2005 , if the eci and locality - based comparability payments had been granted as specifiedby fepca , would have been 13.06% .

this report discusses the january 2005 annual adjustment and locality payments .

president george w. bush issued his administration's fy2005 budget on february 2 , 2004 .

the budget proposed a 1.5% federal civilian pay adjustment , but did not state how the increasewould be allocated between the annual and locality adjustments required by fepca in january2005 .

 ( 45 ) the statutory annual pay adjustmentrequired in january 2005 is 2.5% .

if the presidentwanted to change the required rate of the annual adjustment , he would have had to submit analternative plan for the annual adjustment to congress by september 1 , 2004 .

he did not issue analternative plan .

to change the amount of locality - based comparability payments , he had to submitan alternative plan for the locality payments to congress by november 30 , 2004 ; otherwise thedouble - digit percentages stated in the pay agent report for the locality payments would have becomeeffective .

the president issued such an alternative plan on november 29 , 2004 , which stated that the locality pay percentages in effect for 2004 would continue for 2005 .

according to the president , heissued the plan because the nation is in the midst of a national emergency , which includes operationsin afghanistan and iraq , and the locality pay adjustments required by law would "divert resourcesfrom and interfere with our nation's ability to fight the war on terror. .

he stated that the localitypayments would average 10.6 percent , would cost about $9.8 billion in fy2005 , and when coupledwith the 2.5% annual adjustment would result in an overall average pay increase of some 13.1% .

this increase , said the president , would far exceed the 1.5% pay adjustment that he proposed in thefy2005 budget and , since the additional amount would have to be absorbed , could result in agencieshaving to freeze hiring .

the alternative plan notes that the quit rate for the federal government is "atan all - time low of 1.6 percent per year , well below the overall average quit rate in private enterprise"and that recruitment and retention bonuses and special salary rates are available to address anystaffing difficulties .

 ( 46 ) the president's budget also proposed an appropriation of $300 million for the human capitalperformance fund .

the fy2004 appropriation ( p.l .

108-199 ) was $1 million , but after the 0.59%rescission was $994,000 .

the fund is designed to create performance - driven pay systems for employees and reinforce the value of employee performance management systems .

it willprovide additional pay over and above any annual , across - the - board pay raise to certain civilianemployees based on individual or organizational performance and / or other critical agency humancapital needs .

ninety percent of funds appropriated are to be distributed to agencies on a pro ratabasis , upon opm approval of an agency's plan .

the remainder , and any amount withheld fromagencies due to inadequate plans , will be allocated at the discretion ofopm .

 ( 47 ) the consolidated appropriations act for f2005 , p.l .

108-447 , does not provide an appropriation for the fund .

 ( see discussion under "human capital performance fund," below. ) .

the senate subcommittee on oversight of government management , the federal workforce , and the district of columbia of the committee on governmental affairs conducted a hearing toexamine the progress made in implementing human capital flexibilities on july 20 , 2004 .

testifyingbefore the subcommittee , omb's deputy director for management , clay johnson , identified payincreases targeted to meet specific recruitment or retention needs as an eventuality for the federalworkforce .

according to him: today , we have targeted , not widespread , recruitment and retention problems in our civilian workforce , and pay surveys reveal that we are currentlyoverpaying employees in some occupational groups in some locations.... [w]e certainly should notgrant all civilian employees the same increase no matter what the need because that wouldn't befocusing on the desired result: that would be providing too small an increase where we do haverecruitment and retention problems , and too large an increase where we do not have aproblem .

 ( 48 ) .

the size of the federal white - collar pay adjustment is considered annually by congress , whichmay legislate a pay adjustment that is different from the adjustment recommended by the presidentin the budget or that might be authorized by the president in an alternative plan .

the january 1999 ( 3.6% ) , january 2000 ( 4.8% ) , january 2002 ( 4.6% ) , january 2003 ( 4.1% ) , and january 2004 ( 4.1% ) overall pay adjustment amounts were set by congress .

356 ) on february 3 , 2004 , and in the senate by senator paulsarbanes ( s.con.res .

88 ) on february 9 , 2004 , expressed the sense of the congress thatthere should continue to be parity between the pay adjustments for the uniformed military and federalcivilian employees .

the resolutions noted the longstanding policy of parity between both themilitary and civilian pay increases .

such resolutions are effective only in the chamber in which theyare proposed , express nonbinding opinions on policies , and do not require the president's signature .

ten members of congress from the washington , dc , metropolitan area wrote a letter to president bush on january 21 , 2004 , urging him to "embrace the principle of pay parity" for federalcivilian employees and the uniformed military .

 ( 50 ) the fy2005 budget proposes a 3.5% pay increasefor the military and a 1.5% pay increase for civilian employees .

 ( 51 ) .

president bush issued his administration's fy2006 budget on february 7 , 2005 .

the budgetproposes a 2.3% federal civilian pay adjustment , but does not state how the increase would beallocated between the annual and locality adjustments required by fepca in january 2006 .

 ( 62 ) thestatutory annual pay adjustment required in january 2006 is 2.1% .

if the president wants to changethe required rate of the annual adjustment , he must submit an alternative plan for the annualadjustment to congress by september 1 , 2005 .

to change the amount of locality - basedcomparability payments , he must submit an alternative plan for the locality payments to congressby november 30 , 2005 .

the net increase for each year was calculated by crs .

the actual pay rates are calculated by the following means .

first , the basic general schedule ( gs ) is increased by the annual adjustmentpercentage , resulting in a new gs schedule .

these new basic gs rates are then increased by thelocality payment .

the resulting pay rates ( annual + locality ) are compared with the pay rates ( annual+ locality ) for the previous year to derive the net increase in pay for the current year .
