since 1968 , state and local 911 systems have provided assistance to people in need .

911 systems are fast , reliable , and effective , and are credited with saving many lives .

however , many 911 centers ( also known as public safety answering points or psaps ) continue to use legacy telephone technologies that can receive 911 voice calls , but cannot accept data ( eg , text , photos ) .

recent advancements in technology have enabled the creation of a more advanced 911 system that can interact more easily with modern communication devices .

next generation 911 ( ng911 ) technologies offer callers the ability to either call 911 or send data ( eg , text , photos , or video ) to psaps .

ng911 technologies offer psaps the ability to accept data , share data with first responders , provide accurate location information , interconnect with other centers , and re - route calls during emergencies .

there is general consensus that psaps should migrate to ng911 ; however , the migration will be costly and complex , and will require coordination between state and local 911 agencies and telecommunication providers .

ng911 technologies are expected to change the way 911 systems operate and interoperate .

local 911 systems may need to create or revise policies to accommodate the new technology .

similarly , with the ability to interconnect systems , there is potential to create a nationwide 911 system , which may create the need for new policies to ensure psaps are interoperable and secure .

an issue for congress will be in finding the right level of federal involvement to support the deployment of ng911 nationwide , while respecting state and local authorities over 911 services .

911 systems are operated by state and local entities .

each psap uses different technologies , is in different phases of upgrade , and is dependent on different sources of funding .

each 911 agency has its own agreements with local carriers , whose networks are also in various stages of upgrades .

as a result , there is variability in 911 levels of services across jurisdictions .

there is consensus that upgrades to 911 systems are needed to ensure 911 systems are compatible with modern devices .

however , the adoption of ng911 may change the structure of the nation's 911 system from a system of individual psaps to one of interconnected psaps , and drive the need for national policies to ensure 911 systems are compatible , interoperable , and secure .

as the migration begins , issues for congress may include addressing the migration of 911 to ip - based 911 systems ( eg , ng911 ) ; whether national policies are needed to ensure systems are interoperable and secure ; the federal role in establishing and implementing national 911 policies ; and mechanisms for ensuring state and local compliance with national policies .

a key issue for congress may be determining the level of federal involvement in the deployment of the ng911 and the development of policies ( governance , funding , and technology policies ) that support the deployment without infringing on state and local authorities over 911 services .

a congressional next generation 911 caucus , led by senator klobuchar , senator burr , representative eshoo and representative shimkus , educates lawmakers , constituents , and communities about 911 issues .

in the 115 th congress , two legislative actions were advanced: kari's law of 2017 ( p.l .

115-127 ) requires that multi - line telephone systems permit users to directly dial 911 without having to first dial 9 or any other code .

next generation 911 act of 2017 ( s. 2061 ) recognizes the transition to ng911 as a national priority , expands the ico's authority , establishes an advisory board to advise on interoperability , creates a grant program , directs the fcc to study best practices in cybersecurity , and the government accountability office ( gao ) to study resiliency of psaps .

with the adoption of ng911 technologies underway , and the potential for a single nationwide system for 911 , there may be a need for nationwide policies related to interoperability and security to ensure the effective deployment of ng911 nationwide .

issues for congress may include current federal roles and responsibilities , funding options , and technology policies that could advance the deployment of ng911 while considering longstanding state and local control over 911 services .
