the small business administration ( sba ) administers several types of programs to support small businesses , including direct disaster loan programs for businesses , homeowners , and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters ; loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital ; small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion ; and contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting .

congressional interest in the sba's programs has increased in recent years , primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs .

congressional interest , however , has become especially acute in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic's widespread adverse economic impact on the national economy , including productivity losses , supply chain disruptions , major labor dislocation , and significant financial pressure on both businesses and households .

p.l .

116-123 , the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act , 2020 , was the first act during the 116 th congress that included provisions targeting sba assistance to small businesses adversely affected by covid - 19 .

the act provided the sba an additional $20 million for sba disaster assistance administrative expenses and deemed the coronavirus to be a disaster under the sba's economic injury disaster loan ( eidl ) program .

this change made economic injury from the coronavirus an eligible eidl expense .

congress followed with p.l .

116-136 , the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act ) .

the cares act makes numerous changes to sba programs , including the creation of the paycheck protection program ( ppp ) , which are loans 100% guaranteed by the sba with a maximum term of 10 years and a maximum interest rate of no more than 4% .

these loans are available to small businesses , small 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organizations , and small 501 ( c ) ( 19 ) veterans organizationsâand are eligible for loan forgiveness .

the sba announced that the loans will have a two - year term at a 1.0% interest rate .

the cares act provides deferment relief for ppp loans and existing loans made under the 7 ( a ) , 504 / cdc , and microloan programs .

the act also appropriates $349 billion for ppp loan guarantees and subsidies ( to remain available through fy2021 ) , $10 billion for emergency eidl grants , $675 million for the sba's salaries and expenses account , $25 million for the sba's office of inspector general ( oig ) , $265 million for entrepreneurial development programs ( $192 million for small business development centers ( sbdcs ) , $48 million for women's business centers ( wbcs ) , and $25 million for sba resource partners to provide online information and training ) , and $17 billion for subsidies for the sba's 7 ( a ) , 504 / cdc , and microloan programs .

a summary of the cares act's major small business - related provisions is presented in the appendix .

the sba started accepting ppp loan applications on april 3 , 2020 .

because the sba neared its $349 billion authorization limit for section 7 ( a ) lending , which includes the ppp , the sba stopped accepting new ppp loan applications on april 15 , 2020 .

more than 1.66 million ppp loans totaling nearly $342.3 billion were approved by nearly 5,000 lenders .

most of the loans ( 74% ) were for less than $150,000 ( see table 1 ) .

the sba also stopped accepting covid - 19-related eidl and emergency eidl grant applications on april 15 , because the sba was approaching its disaster loan assistance credit subsidy limit .

covid - 19-related eidl and emergency eidl grant applications already received continued to be processed on a first - in first - out basis .

the sba began accepting new eidl and emergency eidl grant applications on a limited basis on may 4 to accommodate agricultural businesses that were provided eidl eligibility by the paycheck protection program and healthcare enhancement act ( p.l .

116-139 ) .

the sba is also processing applications from agricultural businesses that had submitted an eidl application prior to the legislative change .

those agricultural businesses do not need to reapply .

all other eidl loan applications that were submitted before the sba stopped accepting new applications on april 15 are being processed on a first - in , first - out basis .

a summary of the paycheck protection program and healthcare enhancement act's major small business - related provisions is presented in the appendix .

as of may 17 , 2020 , the sba had approved 252,340 covid - 19-related eidl loans , totaling $24.8 billion .

as of may 8 , the sba had approved just over three million emergency eidl grants , totaling nearly $9.9 billion .

the sba resumed the acceptance of ppp applications on april 27 , 2020 , following enactment of the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act .

the act increased the sba's section 7 ( a ) loan authorization limit from $349 billion to $659 billion , and appropriated $321.335 billion to support that level of lending .

the act also appropriated $50 billion for eidl , $10 billion for emergency eidl grants , and $2.1 billion for sba salaries and expenses .

as of may 16 , 2020 , the sba had approved , after cancellations , more than 4.3 million ppp loans totaling more than $513 billion ( see table 1 ) .

for comparative purposes , that loan approval amount is more than the amount the sba has approved in all of its loan programs , including disaster loans , during the last 29 years ( from october 1 , 1991 through december 31 , 2019 ; $509.9 billion ) .

on may 15 , 2020 , the house passed h.r .

6800 , the health and economic recovery omnibus emergency solutions act ( heroes act ) .

the heroes act , among other provisions , would expand ppp eligibility to include all 501 ( c ) nonprofit organizations and appropriate another $10 billion for emergency eidl grants .

a summary of the heroes act's major small business - related provisions is presented in the appendix .

this report begins with an overview of sba disaster loans and discusses various issues related to providing disaster assistance to small businesses adversely affected by covid - 19 .

it presents an overview and discussion of sba access to capital programs ( including the 7 ( a ) loan guarantee , 504 / cdc loan guarantee , and microloan program ) , sba management and technical training programs ( sbdcs , wbcs , score , and microloan technical assistance ) , and sba contracting programs .

in response to the great recession , congress took a number of actions to enhance small businesses' access to capital , management and training programs , and contracting opportunities .

the goal then , as it is now , was to provide small businesses with the resources necessary to survive the economic downturn and retain or create jobs .

some of the cares act's provisions ( eg , fee waivers , increased loan limits , and increased guarantee percentages ) were used in legislation passed during the 111 th congress to address the severe economic slowdown during and immediately following the great recession ( 2007-2009 ) .

the main difference between that legislation and the cares act is that the cares act includes loan deferrals , loan forgiveness , and greatly expanded eligibility , including , for the first time , specified types of nonprofit organizations .

the cares act's inclusion of loan deferral and forgiveness is , at least partly , due to the unique economic dislocations and reduction in consumer spending resulting from individuals and households engaging in physical distancing to avoid covid - 19 infection .

as mentioned , because covid - 19's adverse economic impact is so widespread , including productivity losses , supply chain disruptions , labor dislocation , and financial pressure on businesses and households , there has been relatively little concern expressed about federal fiscal restraint during the current pandemic .

the debate has been primarily over which specific policies would have the greatest impact and which types of small businesses and small business owners should be helped the most .

among the lessons learned from the 111 th congress is the potential benefits that can be derived from providing additional funding for the sba's office of inspector general and the government accountability office .

gao and the sba's oig can provide congress information that could prove useful as congress engages in congressional oversight of the sba's administration of the cares act , provide an early warning if unforeseen administrative problems should arise , and , through investigations and audits , serve as a deterrent to fraud .

requiring the sba to report regularly on its implementation of the cares act could also promote transparency and assist congress in performing its oversight responsibilities .

in addition , requiring output and outcome performance measures and requiring the sba to report this information directly to both congress and the public by posting that information on the sba's website could enhance both congressional oversight and public confidence in the sba's efforts to assist small businesses .

the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act ; p.l .

116-136 ) established a paycheck protection program ( ppp ) to provide "covered loans" with a 100% sba loan guarantee , a maximum term of 10 years , and an interest rate not to exceed 4% to assist small businesses and other organizations adversely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) .

the sba announced that ppp loans will have a two - year term at a 1.0% interest rate ; defines a covered loan as a loan made to an eligible recipient from february 15 , 2020 , through june 30 , 2020 ; waives the up - front loan guarantee fee and annual servicing fee , the no credit elsewhere requirement , and the requirements for collateral and a personal guarantee for a covered loan ; expands eligibility for a covered loan to include 7 ( a ) eligible businesses and any business , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization , 501 ( c ) ( 19 ) veteran's organization , or tribal business not currently eligible that has not more than 500 employees or , if applicable , the sba's size standard in number of employees for the industry in which they operate .

sole proprietors , independent contractors , and eligible self - employed individuals are also eligible to receive a covered loan ; increases the maximum loan amount for a covered loan to the lesser of ( 1 ) 2.5 times the average total monthly payments by the applicant for payroll costs incurred during the one - year period before the date on which the loan is made plus the outstanding balance of any 7 ( a ) loan ( made on or after january 31 , 2020 ) that is refinanced as part of a covered loan , or ( 2 ) $10 million ; allows borrowers to refinance 7 ( a ) loans ( made on or after january 31 , 2020 ) as part of a covered loan ; specifies that covered loans are nonrecourse ( meaning that the sba cannot pursue collections actions against the recipient ( s ) in the case of nonpayment ) except to the extent that the covered loan proceeds are used for nonauthorized purposes ; allows covered loans to be used for payroll costs , costs related to the continuation of group health care benefits during periods of paid sick , medical , or family leave , and insurance premiums , employee salaries , commissions , or similar compensations , mortgage payments , rent , utilities , and interest on any other debt obligations that were incurred before the covered period ; expands lender delegated loan approval authority for making covered loans to all 7 ( a ) lenders to expedite ppp loan processing ; requires lenders , when evaluating borrower eligibility for a covered loan , to consider whether the borrower was in operation on february 15 , 2020 , had employees for whom the borrower paid salaries and payroll taxes , and paid independent contractors ; requires borrowers to , among other acknowledgements , make a good faith certification that the covered loan is needed because of the uncertainty of current economic conditions and to support ongoing operations , and acknowledge that the funds will be used to retain workers , maintain payroll , or make mortgage payments , lease payments , and utility payments ; requires lenders to provide "impacted borrowers" adversely affected by covid - 19 "complete payment deferment relief" on a covered ppp loan for not less than six months and not more than one year if the borrower was in operation on february 15 , 2020 , and has an application for a covered loan approved or pending approval on or after the date of enactment .

the sba announced that covered loan payments will be deferred for six months .

however , interest will continue to accrue on these loans during the six - month deferment ; presumes that each eligible recipient that applies for a ppp loan is an impacted borrower and authorizes the sba administrator to purchase covered loans sold on the secondary market so that affected borrowers may receive a deferral for not more than one year .

the sba has announced that the deferment relief on covered loans will be for six months ; provides for the forgiveness of covered loan amounts equal to the amount the borrower spent during an 8-week period after the loan's origination date on payroll costs , interest payment on any mortgage incurred prior to february 15 , 2020 , payment of rent on any lease in force prior to february 15 , 2020 , and payment on any utility for which service began before february 15 , 2020 .

the amount of loan forgiveness cannot exceed the covered loan's principal amount .

the forgiveness is reduced proportionally by formulas related to the borrower's retention of full - time equivalent employees compared to the borrower's choice of either: ( 1 ) the period beginning on february 15 , 2019 , and ending on june 30 , 2019 , or ( 2 ) january 1 , 2020 , and february 29 , 2020 ; and by the amount of any reduction in pay of any employee beyond 25% of their salary or wages during the most recent full quarter before the covered period .

borrowers that re - hire workers previously laid off will not be penalized for having a reduced payroll at the beginning of the period .

cancelled debt resulting from loan forgiveness would not be included in the borrower's taxable federal income ; the sba has announced that due to likely high subscription , at least 75% of the forgiven loan amount must have been used for payroll ; requires the sba to pay the principal , interest , and any associated fees that are owed on an existing 7 ( a ) , 504 / cdc , or microloan that is in a regular servicing status for a six - month period starting on the next payment due .

loans that are already on deferment will receive six months of payment by the sba beginning with the first payment after the deferral period .

loans made up until six months after enactment will also receive a full six months of sba loan payments ; requires federal banking agencies or the national credit union administration board applying capital requirements under their respective risk - based capital requirements to provide a covered loan with a 0% - risk weight ; increases the sba's lending authorization under section 7 ( a ) of the small business act from $30 billion to $349 billion during the covered period ; increases the sbaexpress loan limit from $350,000 to $1 million ( reverts to $350,000 on january 1 , 2021 ) ; permanently eliminates the zero subsidy requirement to waive sbaexpress loan fees for veterans ; appropriates $349 billion for loan guarantees and subsidies ( remaining available through fy2021 ) , $675 million for the sba's salaries and expenses account , $25 million for the sba's office of inspector general ( oig ) , $265 million for entrepreneurial development programs ( $192 million for sbdcs , $48 million for wbcs , and $25 million for sba resource partners to provide online information and training ) , $17 billion for subsidies for certain loan payments , and $10 million for the department of commerce's minority business development agency ; allows the period of use of fy2018 and fy2019 grant awards made under the state trade expansion program ( step ) through fy2021 ; reimburses ( up to the grant amount received ) step award recipients for financial losses relating to a foreign trade mission or a trade show exhibition that was cancelled solely due to a public health emergency declared due to covid - 19 ; waives sbdc and wbc matching requirements ; requires federal agencies to continue to pay small business contractors and revise delivery schedules , holding small contractors harmless for being unable to perform a contract due to covid - 19 caused interruptions until september 2021 ; requires federal agencies to promptly pay small business prime contractors and requires prime contractors to promptly pay small business subcontractors within 15 days , notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation , for the duration of the president invoking the defense production act in response to covid - 19 ; and provides sba emergency injury disaster loan ( eidl ) enhancements during the covered period of january 31 , 2020 , through december 31 , 2020 , including expanding eligibility beyond currently eligible small businesses , private nonprofit organizations , and small agricultural cooperatives , to include startups , cooperatives , and eligible esops ( employee stock ownership plans ) with not more than 500 employees , sole proprietors , and independent contractors ; authorizing the sba administrator , in response to economic injuries caused by covid - 19 , to waive the no credit available elsewhere requirement , approve an applicant based solely on their credit score , not require applicants to submit a tax return or tax return transcript for approval , waive any rules related to the personal guarantee on advances and loans of not more than $200,000 , waive the requirement that the applicant needs to be in business for the one - year period before the disaster declaration , except that no waiver may be made for a business that was not in operation on january 31 , 2020 ; authorizing the sba administrator , through december 31 , 2020 , to provide up to $10,000 as an advance payment in the amount requested within three days after receiving an eidl application from an eligible entity .

applicants are not required to repay the advance payment , even if subsequently denied an eidl loan .

the funds may be used for any eligible eidl expense , including , among other expenses , providing paid sick leave to employees unable to work due to covid - 19 , maintaining payroll to retain employees , and meeting increased costs to obtain materials due to supply chain disruptions .

the sba limited eidl - advance payments to $1,000 per employee , up to a maximum of $10,000 ; and appropriating an additional $10 billion for eidl assistance .

the paych eck protection program and health care enhancement act ( p.l .

116-139 ) increases the sba's lending authorization under section 7 ( a ) of the small business act from $349 billion during the covered period to $659 billion ; requires that no less than $30 billion of this authorization amount be set aside for loans issued by insured depository institutions and credit unions with consolidated assets of $10 billion to $50 billion ; requires that no less than $30 billion of this authorization amount be set aside for loans issued by community financial institutions ( including community development financial institutions ( cdfis ) , minority depository institutions , sba - certified development companies , and sba microloan intermediaries ) , and insured depository institutions and credit unions with consolidated assets less than $10 billion ; increases the ppp appropriation amount from $349 billion to $670.335 billion ; appropriates an additional $50 billion for eidl loans ; appropriates an additional $10 billion for emergency eidl grants ; appropriates an additional $2.1 billion for the sba's salaries and expenses account ( to remain available until september 30 , 2021 ) ; and provides agricultural enterprises eligibility for emergency eidl grants and eidl loans during the covered period ( january 31 , 2020 through december 31 , 2020 ) .
