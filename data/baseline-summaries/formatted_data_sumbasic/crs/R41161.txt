the origin of the department of commerce ( commerce department ) dates to 1903 with the establishment of the department of commerce and labor .

the separate commerce department was established on march 4 , 1913 .

the department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied ; its activities center on five basic missions: ( 1 ) promoting the development of u.s. business and increasing foreign trade ; ( 2 ) improving the nation's technological competitiveness ; ( 3 ) encouraging economic development ; ( 4 ) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment ; and ( 5 ) compiling , analyzing , and disseminating statistical information on the u.s. economy and population .

the following agencies within the commerce department carry out these missions: international trade administration ( ita ) seeks to develop the export potential of u.s. firms and to improve the trade performance of u.s. industry ; bureau of industry and security ( bis ) enforces u.s. export laws consistent with national security , foreign policy , and short - supply objectives ; economic development administration ( eda ) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions ; minority business development agency ( mbda ) seeks to promote private and public sector investment in minority businesses ; economic and statistics administration ( esa ) , excluding the bureau of the census , provides ( 1 ) information on the state of the economy through preparation , development , and interpretation of economic data , and ( 2 ) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities ; bureau of the census , a component of esa , collects , compiles , and publishes a broad range of economic , demographic , and social data ; national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) advises the president on domestic and international communications policy , manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum , and performs research in telecommunications sciences ; united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) examines and approves applications for patents for claimed inventions and registration of trademarks ; national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality , modernize manufacturing processes , ensure product reliability , and facilitate rapid commercialization of products on the basis of new scientific discoveries ; and national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) provides scientific , technical , and management expertise to ( 1 ) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation ; ( 2 ) assess the health of coastal and marine resources ; ( 3 ) monitor and predict the coastal , ocean , and global environments ( including weather forecasting ) ; and ( 4 ) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources .

established by an act of 1870 with the attorney general at its head , doj provides counsel for citizens in federal cases and protects them through law enforcement .

it represents the federal government in all proceedings , civil and criminal , before the supreme court .

in legal matters , generally , the department provides legal advice and opinions , upon request , to the president and executive branch department heads .

the major functions of doj agencies and offices are described below .

united states attorneys prosecute criminal offenses against the united states , represent the federal government in civil actions , and initiate proceedings for the collection of fines , penalties , and forfeitures owed to the united states .

united states marshals service provides security for the federal judiciary , protects witnesses , executes warrants and court orders , manages seized assets , detains and transports unsentenced prisoners , and apprehends fugitives .

federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) investigates violations of federal criminal law ; helps protect the united states against terrorism and hostile intelligence efforts ; provides assistance to other federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies ; and shares jurisdiction with drug enforcement administration over federal drug violations .

drug enforcement administration ( dea ) investigates federal drug law violations ; coordinates its efforts with state , local , and other federal law enforcement agencies ; develops and maintains drug intelligence systems ; regulates legitimate controlled substances activities ; and conducts joint intelligence - gathering activities with foreign governments .

bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) enforces federal law related to the manufacture , importation , and distribution of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives .

it was transferred from the department of the treasury to the doj by the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-296 ) .

federal prison system ( bureau of prisons ) provides for the custody and care of the federal prison population , the maintenance of prison - related facilities , and the boarding of sentenced federal prisoners incarcerated in state and local institutions .

community oriented policing services ( cops ) advances the practice of community policing by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies to hire and train community policing professionals , acquire and deploy crime - fighting technologies , and develop and test innovative policing strategies .

most crime control has traditionally been a state and local responsibility .

with the passage of the crime control act of 1968 ( p.l .

90-351 ) , however , the federal role in the administration of criminal justice has increased incrementally .

since 1984 , congress has approved five major omnibus crime control bills , designating new federal crimes , penalties , and additional law enforcement assistance programs for state and local governments .

the science agencies fund and otherwise support research and development ( r&d ) and related activities across a wide variety of federal missions , including national competitiveness , climate change , energy and the environment , and fundamental discovery .

for fy2011 , the administration requests a total of $26.431 billion for the science agencies .

the fy2011 request includes $7.0 million for the office of science and technology policy , $19.0 billion for the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and $7.424 billion for the national science foundation ( nsf ) .

the fy2011 funding request for the science agencies would be 3.0% greater than the fy2010 enacted amount of $25.658 billion .

h.r .

1 would have provided a total of $24.697 billion for the science agencies .

proposed funding for the science agencies in h.r .

1 would be 3.7% less than the fy2010-enacted level and 6.6% less than the president's fy2011 request .

the act provides a total of $25.315 billion for the science agencies , which includes $6.6 million for the office of science and technology policy , $18.448 billion for nasa , and $6.86 billion for nsf .

the fy2011-enacted appropriation is 1.3% less than the fy2010 appropriation and 4.2% less than the administration's request , but it is 2.5% more than what would have been provided in h.r .

1 .

for fy2011 , the administration requested a total of $973.4 million for the related agencies .

the fy2011 request was $38.6 million , or 4.1% , greater than the fy2010-enacted amount of $934.8 million .

the proposed $38.6 million increase is largely due to proposed increases in funding for the equal employment opportunity commission and the legal services corporation .

under h.r .

1 , the related agencies would have received a total of $864.8 million , which would have been 7.5% less than the fy2010-enacted appropriation of $934.8 million and 11.2% less than the administration's fy2011 request .

congress provides a total of $917.9 million for the related agencies for fy2011 , which is 1.8% less than the fy2010-enacted amount and 5.7% less than the administration's fy2011 request , but it is 6.1% more than what would have been provide in h.r .

established by the civil rights act of 1957 , the u.s. commission on civil rights ( the commission ) investigates allegations of citizens who may have been denied the right to vote based on color , race , religion , or national origin ; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws ; assesses the federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights ; and submits reports on its findings to the president and congress when the commission or the president deems it appropriate .

the requested funding for the commission on civil rights for fy2011 was $9.4 million , the same amount as the commission's fy2010 appropriation .

h.r .

1 would have provided $9.4 million for the commission , the same amount as its fy2010 appropriation .

the fy2011-enacted appropriation is $18,800 less than what the commission received for fy2010 , representing a 0.2% decrease compared to the fy2010 appropriation , the administration's request , and the amount that would have been provided in h.r .

the eeoc enforces several laws that ban employment discrimination based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability .

in the past few years , appropriators were particularly concerned about the agency's implementation of a restructuring plan , initiated in 2005 , that included the creation of the national contact center ( ncc ) , realignment of field structure and staff , and restructuring of headquarters operations .

in response to congressional concerns about call intake practices , the eeoc transitioned to an in - house call center ( see below ) .

the fy2011 president's request was $18.0 million ( 4.9% ) more than the fy2010-enacted level of $367.3 million .

the fy2011 president's request and the fy2010-enacted budget provided up to $30.0 million for fepas and teros .

under h.r .

1 , the eeoc would have received $367.3 million , the same amount as the commission's fy2010 appropriation but 4.7% less than the administration's fy2011 request .

the commission's fy2011-enacted appropriation is $366.6 , which is 0.2% less than both the fy2010 appropriation and the amount that would have been provided under h.r .

1 and it is 4.9% less than the administration's request .

according to the commission , the anticipated growth in its workload partly reflects the transition from a contractor - operated to an in - house call center , which allows the public to begin the charge process online .

in addition , more cases are likely to be filed under such recently enacted legislation as title ii of the genetic information nondiscrimination act ( gina ) , which became effective in november 2009 ; the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of 2009 ; and amendments to the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) , which became effective in january 2009 .

the fy2011 president's request for 188 new hires , such as investigators , mediators , attorneys , and support staff , was intended not only to address the expected increase in the agency's private sector charge backlog but also to promote enforcement of the commission's focus on systemic discrimination cases .

the eeoc began the systemic initiative in april 2006 .

the goal of the initiative is to strengthen and update the commission's nationwide approach to systemic cases ( i.e. , a pattern or practice , policy , and / or class in which discrimination has a broad effect on an industry , occupation , company , or geographic location ) .

the eeoc federal sector hearings workload is estimated to increase from 6,617 pending hearings in fy2009 , to 7,398 in fy2011 .

the commission is implementing three initiatives to support the federal sector program .

the proposed three track case processing system is meant to help administrative law judges process , manage , and track cases to increase the number of cases they hear .

the continuation and expansion of the hearings electronic case processing system ( hecaps ) pilot , currently being tested in five hearing units , would allow field offices to coordinate with the eeoc office of information technology through an electronic complaint system .

lastly , hotdocs software , a commercial document assembly software package , is being tested by a workgroup to develop and order templates for processing cases more efficiently .

the itc is an independent , quasi - judicial agency established by congress that advises the president and congress on u.s. foreign economic policies .

the mission of itc can be categorized into three separate functions: ( 1 ) administering u.s. trade remedy laws within its mandate in a fair and objective manner ; ( 2 ) providing the president , the u.s. trade representative , and congress with independent analysis , information , and support on matters of tariffs and international trade and competitiveness ; and ( 3 ) maintaining the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states .

as a matter of policy , its budget request is submitted to congress by the president without revision .

the fy2011 budget request for itc is $87.0 million , a $5.1 million ( 6.2% ) increase from the fy2010-enacted amount of $81.9 million .

the budget request states that the requested increase in the budget is driven largely by increases in salaries , benefits , and rent costs .

the full - year cr includes $81.9 million for itc , the same as the fy2010-enacted level and 5.9% less than the administration's fy2011 request .

the lsc is a private , nonprofit , federally funded corporation that provides grants to local offices that , in turn , provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( noncriminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annual appropriations bills , congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases .

the fy2010 appropriation for lsc was $420.0 million .

moreover , congress continued existing limitations on the use of lsc funds ( and non - lsc funds ) except for the restriction on the ability of lsc - funded programs to collect attorneys' fees .

the fy2010 appropriation for the lsc included $394.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $17.0 million for management and administration , $3.4 million for client self - help and information technology , $4.2 million for the office of the inspector general , and $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance .

current lsc funding now surpasses the lsc's previous highest funding level of $400.0 million in fy1994 and fy1995 .

for fy2011 , the obama administration requested $435.0 million for the lsc .

this amount is $15.0 million ( 3.6% ) above the fy2010 appropriation of $420.0 million for the lsc .

the administration's budget request included $407.0 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $20.0 million for management and grants oversight ; $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology ; $4.0 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance .

the administration also proposed that lsc restrictions on class action suits and attorneys' fees be eliminated .

h.r .

1 included $350.0 million for lsc .

this amount represented a proposed 16.7% reduction in funding compared to the fy2010-enacted appropriation of $420.0 million .

the amount in h.r .

1 would have been 19.5% less than the administration's fy2011 request .

the act includes $420.0 million for lsc for fy2011 , an amount that is 3.8% less than the fy2010 appropriation and 7.1% below the administration's request .

however , the amount provided to lsc for fy2011 is 15.5% greater than what would have been provided in h.r .

the marine mammal commission is an independent agency of the executive branch , established under title ii of the marine mammal protection act ( mmpa ; p.l .

92-522 ) .

as funding permits , the marine mammal commission supports research to further the purposes of the mmpa .

for fy2011 , the obama administration proposed $3.0 million for necessary expenses of the marine mammal commission , a decrease of approximately $0.3 million ( - 7.7% ) from the fy2010 appropriation of approximately $3.3 million for this independent agency .

under h.r .

1 , the marine mammal commission would have received $3.3 million , which would have been the same as the commission's fy2010 appropriation .

the proposed funding under h.r .

1 would have been 8.3% more than what the administration requested for fy2011 .

for fy2011 , congress provides an amount that is 0.2% less than the fy2010 appropriation and the amount that would have been provided in h.r .

1 ( $3.2 million ) , but is 8.1% more than the administration's request .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sji is authorized to present its budget request directly to congress , apart from the president's budget .

for fy2011 , the administration requested $5.4 million for sji , which would have represented a 5.5% increase in funding compared with the $5.1 million congress appropriated for sji for fy2010 .

under h.r .

1 , sji would have received $5.1 million , which would have been equal to sji's fy2010 appropriation , but the proposed funding level would have been 5.2% less than the administration's fy2011 request .

the fy2011-enacted amount for sji is $10,000 ( 0.2% ) less than the fy2010 appropriation and the amount that would have been provided in h.r .
