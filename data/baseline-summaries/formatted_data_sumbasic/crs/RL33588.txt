on june 29 , 2006 , the senate committee on appropriations reported h.r .

5427 , the energy and water appropriations bill for fy2007 ( s.rept .

109-274 ) .

this bill includes funding for the department of energy ( doe ) renewable energy program , which is conducted by the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) .

compared with house - passed funding , the fy2007 senate appropriations committee recommendation seeks an increase of $66.1 million ( 5% ) .

table 3 shows other differences , most notably those for biomass & biorefinery , geothermal , hydro , and weatherization programs .

compared with fy2006 funding , the senate committee recommends an increase of $240.4.8 million for r&d and deployment programs .

this reflects support for the advanced energy initiative , including increases for hydrogen ( $34.2 million ) , biomass / biorefineries ( $59.3 million ) , and solar ( $65.3 million ) .

the main cuts include the weatherization program ( - $42.6 million ) , facilities ( - $20.2 million ) , industrial programs ( - $9.3 million ) , and program management ( - $9.9 million ) .

 ( the renewable energy provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 [ p.l .

109-58 , h.r .

6 ] and other bills of the 109 th congress are discussed in the " renewables in the 109 th congress " and " legislation " sections below .

a list of all renewable energy bills introduced in the 109 th congress is provided in crs report rl32860 , energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation in the 109 th congress , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

because in most cases renewable energy appears to release less carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) than fossil fuels , renewables are seen as a key long - term resource that could substitute for fossil energy sources used to produce vehicle fuels and electricity .

the percentage of renewable energy substitution depends on technology cost , market penetration , and the use of energy efficiency measures to control energy prices and demand .

doe's november 2005 report u.s .

climate change technology programs — technology options for the near and long term compiles information from multiple federal agencies on more than 80 technologies .

for these end - use and supply technologies , the report describes president bush's initiatives and r&d goals for advancing technology development , but it does not estimate emissions saving potentials , as some previous doe reports on the topic had presented .

climate action report — 2002 describes federal renewable energy programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions .

in climate change 2001: mitigation , the intergovernmental panel on climate change looks at the role that renewables could play in curbing global co 2 emissions .

since 1988 , the federal government has accelerated programs that study the science of global climate change and has initiated programs aimed at mitigating fossil fuel - generated co 2 and other human - generated emissions .

the federal government funds programs for renewable energy as a mitigation measure at doe , usda , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , the agency for international development ( aid ) , and the world bank .

the latter two agencies have received funding for renewable energy - related climate actions through foreign operations appropriations bills .

because co 2 contributes the largest greenhouse gas emission impact , the reduction of co 2 has been the focus of studies of the potential for reducing emissions through renewable energy and other means .

except for biofuels and biopower , wherever renewable energy equipment displaces fossil fuel use , it will also reduce carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) emissions , as well as pollutants that contribute to water pollution , acid rain , and urban smog .

in general , the combustion of biomass for fuel and power production releases co 2 at an intensity that may rival or exceed that for natural gas .

however , the growth of biomass material , which absorbs co 2 , offsets this release .

hence , net emissions occur only when combustion is based on deforestation .

in a "closed loop" system , biomass combustion is based on rotating energy crops , there is no net release , and its displacement of any fossil fuel , including natural gas , reduces co 2 emissions .

in the 109 th congress , more than 260 bills with provisions for renewable energy or energy efficiency have been introduced .

a general description of the renewable energy provisions in these bills , including those enacted into law , is available in crs report rl32860 , energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation in the 109 th congress , by [author name scrubbed] .

the report also groups the bills by policy and issue areas , provides a table that identifies recent action on the bills , and discusses recent action on a month - by - month basis .
