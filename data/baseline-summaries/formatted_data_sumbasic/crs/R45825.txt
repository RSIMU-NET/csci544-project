t he constitution's supremacy clause provides that "the laws of the united states .

 .

 .

shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. .

this language is the foundation for the doctrine of federal preemption , according to which federal law supersedes conflicting state laws .

federal preemption of state law is a ubiquitous feature of the modern regulatory state and "almost certainly the most frequently used doctrine of constitutional law in practice. .

indeed , preemptive federal statutes shape the regulatory environment for most major industries , including drugs and medical devices , banking , air transportation , securities , automobile safety , and tobacco .

as a result , "[d]ebates over the federal government's preemption power rage in the courts , in congress , before agencies , and in the world of scholarship. .

these debates over federal preemption implicate many of the themes that recur throughout the federalism literature .

proponents of broad federal preemption often cite the benefits of uniform national regulations and the concentration of expertise in federal agencies .

in contrast , opponents of broad preemption often appeal to the importance of policy experimentation , the greater democratic accountability that they believe accompanies state and local regulation , and the "gap - filling" role of state common law in deterring harmful conduct and compensating injured plaintiffs .

these broad normative disputes occur throughout the supreme court's preemption case law .

however , the court has also identified different ways in which federal law can preempt state law , each of which raises a unique set of narrower interpretive issues .

as figure 1 illustrates , the court has identified two general ways in which federal law can preempt state law .

first , federal law can expressly preempt state law when a federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language .

second , federal law can impliedly preempt state law when its structure and purpose implicitly reflect congress's preemptive intent .

the court has also identified two subcategories of implied preemption: "field preemption" and "conflict preemption. .

field preemption occurs when a pervasive scheme of federal regulation implicitly precludes supplementary state regulation , or when states attempt to regulate a field where there is clearly a dominant federal interest .

in contrast , conflict preemption occurs when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility ( "impossibility preemption" ) , or when state law poses an "obstacle" to the accomplishment of the "full purposes and objectives" of congress ( "obstacle preemption" ) .

while the supreme court has repeatedly distinguished these preemption categories , it has also explained that the presence of an express preemption clause in a federal statute does not preclude implied preemption analysis .

in geier v. american honda motor co . , the court held that although a preemption clause in a federal automobile safety statute did not expressly displace state common law claims involving automobile safety , the federal statute and associated regulations nevertheless impliedly preempted those claims based on conflict preemption principles .

congress must therefore consider the possibility that the laws it enacts may be construed as impliedly preempting certain categories of state law even if those categories do not fall within the explicit terms of a preemption clause .

this report provides a general overview of federal preemption to inform congress as it crafts laws implicating overlapping federal and state interests .

the report begins by reviewing two general principles that have shaped the court's preemption jurisprudence: the primacy of congressional intent and the "presumption against preemption. .

the report then discusses how courts have interpreted certain language that is commonly used in express preemption clauses .

next , the report reviews judicial interpretations of statutory provisions designed to insulate certain categories of state law from federal preemption ( "savings clauses" ) .

finally , the report discusses the court's implied preemption case law by examining illustrative examples of its field preemption , impossibility preemption , and obstacle preemption decisions .

congress often relies on the language of existing preemption clauses in drafting new legislation .

moreover , when statutory language has a settled meaning , courts often look to that meaning to discern congress's intent .

this section of the report discusses how the supreme court has interpreted federal statutes that preempt ( 1 ) state laws "related to" certain subjects , ( 2 ) state laws concerning certain subjects "covered" by federal laws and regulations , ( 3 ) state requirements that are "in addition to , or different than" federal requirements , and ( 4 ) state "requirements," "laws," "regulations," and "standards. .

while preemption decisions depend heavily on the details of particular statutory schemes , the court has assigned some of these phrases specific meanings even when they have appeared in different statutory contexts .

many federal statutes contain provisions that purport to restrict their preemptive effect .

these "savings clauses" make clear that federal law does not preempt certain categories of state law , reflecting congress's recognition of the need for states to "fill a regulatory void" or "enhance protection for affected communities" through supplementary regulation .

the law regarding savings clauses "is not especially well developed," and cases involving such clauses "turn very much on the precise wording of the statutes at issue. .

with these caveats in mind , this section discusses three general categories of savings clauses: ( 1 ) "anti - preemption provisions," ( 2 ) "compliance savings clauses," and ( 3 ) "remedies savings clauses. .

as discussed , federal law can impliedly preempt state law even when it does not do so expressly .

like its express preemption decisions , the supreme court's implied preemption cases focus on congress's intent .

the supreme court has recognized two general forms of implied preemption .

first , "field preemption" occurs when a pervasive scheme of federal regulation implicitly precludes supplementary state regulation , or when states attempt to regulate a field where there is clearly a dominant federal interest .

second , "conflict preemption" occurs when state law interferes with federal goals .

the supreme court has held that federal law preempts state law where congress has manifested an intention that the federal government occupy an entire field of regulation .

federal law may reflect such an intent through a scheme of federal regulation that is "so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for states to supplement it," or where federal law concerns "a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject. .

applying these principles , the court has held that federal law occupies a variety of regulatory fields , including alien registration , nuclear safety , aircraft noise , the "design , construction , alteration , repair , maintenance , operation , equipping , personnel qualification , and manning" of tanker vessels , wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce , and locomotive equipment .

in its 1947 decision in rice v. santa fe elevator corp oration , the supreme court held that federal law preempted a number of fields related to grain warehousing , precluding even complementary state regulations of those fields .

in that case , the court held that the federal warehouse act and associated regulations preempted a variety of state law claims brought against a grain warehouse , including allegations that the warehouse had engaged in unfair pricing , maintained unsafe elevators , and impermissibly mixed different qualities of grain .

the court discerned congress's intent to occupy the relevant fields from an amendment to the warehouse act that made the secretary of agriculture's authorities "exclusive" vis - ã  - vis federally licensed warehouses .

because the text and legislative history of this amendment reflected congress's intent to eliminate overlapping federal and state warehouse regulations , the court held that federal law occupied a number of fields involving grain warehousing .

as a result , the court concluded that the warehouse act preempted certain state law claims that intruded into those federally regulated fields , even if federal law established standards that were "more modest" and "less pervasive" than those imposed by state law .

the court has also held that federal law preempts the field of alien registration .

in its 1941 decision in hines v. davidowitz , the court held that federal immigration lawâwhich required aliens to register with the federal governmentâpreempted a pennsylvania law that required aliens to register with the state , pay a registration fee , and carry an identification card .

in reaching this conclusion , the court explained that because alien regulation is "intimately blended and intertwined" with the federal government's core responsibilities and congress had enacted a "complete" regulatory scheme involving that field , federal law preempted the additional pennsylvania requirements .

the court reaffirmed these general principles from hines in its 2012 decision in arizona v. united states .

in arizona , the court held that the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , which requires aliens to carry an alien registration document , preempted an arizona statute that made violations of that federal requirement a crime under state law .

in holding that federal law preempted this arizona requirement , the court explained that like the statutory framework at issue in hines , the ina represented a "comprehensive" regulatory regime that "occupied the field of alien registration. .

specifically , the court inferred congress's intent to occupy this field from the ina's "full set of standards governing alien registration," which included specific penalties for noncompliance .

the court accordingly held that federal law preempted even "complementary" state laws regulating alien registration like the challenged arizona requirement .

however , the court has also made clear that other types of state laws concerning aliens do not necessarily fall within the preempted field of alien registration .

in its 1976 decision in de canas v. bica , the court held that federal law did not preempt a california law prohibiting the employment of aliens not entitled to lawful residence in the united states .

the court reached this conclusion on the grounds that nothing in the text or legislative history of the inaâwhich did not directly regulate the employment of such aliens at the timeâsuggested that congress intended to preempt all state regulations concerning the activities of aliens .

instead , the court reasoned that while the ina comprehensively regulated the immigration and naturalization processes , it did not address employment eligibility for aliens without legal immigration status .

as a result , the court held that the challenged california law fell outside the preempted field of alien registration .

the court has also upheld several state laws regulating the activities of aliens since de canas .

in chamber of commerce v. whiting , for example , the court held that federal law did not preempt an arizona statute allowing the state to revoke an employer's business license for hiring aliens who did not possess work authorization .

the court has accordingly made clear that the preempted field of alien registration does not encompass all state laws concerning aliens .

the supreme court has also held that federal law preempts the field of nuclear safety regulation .

however , the court has explained this field does not encompass all state laws that affect safety decisions made by nuclear power plants .

instead , the court has concluded that state laws fall within the preempted field of nuclear safety regulation if they ( 1 ) are motivated by safety concerns and implicate a "core federal power," or ( 2 ) have a "direct and substantial" effect on safety decisions made by nuclear facilities .

this division of authority is the result of a regulatory regime that has changed significantly over the course of the 20th century .

before 1954 , the federal government maintained a monopoly over the use , control , and ownership of nuclear technology .

however , in 1954 , the atomic energy act ( aea ) allowed private entities to own , construct , and operate nuclear power plants subject to a "strict" licensing and regulatory regime administered by the atomic energy commission ( aec ) .

in 1959 , congress amended the aea to give the states greater authority over nuclear energy regulation .

specifically , the 1959 amendments allowed states to assume responsibility over certain nuclear materials as long as their regulations were "coordinated and compatible" with federal requirements .

while the 1959 amendments reserved certain key authorities to the federal government , they also affirmed the states' ability to regulate "activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards. .

congress reorganized the administrative framework surrounding these regulations in 1974 , when it replaced the aec with the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) .

the supreme court has held that while this regulatory scheme preempts the field of nuclear safety regulation , certain state regulations of nuclear power plants that have a non - safety rationale fall outside this preempted field .

the court identified this distinction in pacific gas and electric company v. state energy resources conservation & development commission , where it held that federal law did not preempt a california statute regulating the construction of new nuclear power plants .

specifically , the california statute conditioned the construction of new nuclear power plants on a state agency's determination concerning the availability of adequate storage facilities and means of disposal for spent nuclear fuel .

in challenging this state statute , two public utilities contended that federal law made the federal government the "sole regulator of all things nuclear. .

however , the court rejected this argument , reasoning that while congress intended that the federal government regulate nuclear safety , the relevant statutes reflected congress's intent to allow states to regulate nuclear power plants for non - safety purposes .

the court then concluded that the california law survived preemption because it was motivated by concerns over electricity generation and the economic viability of new nuclear power plantsânot a desire to intrude into the preempted field of nuclear safety regulation .

in addition to holding that the aea does not preempt all state statutes and regulations concerning nuclear power plants , the court has upheld certain state tort claims related to injuries sustained by power plant employees .

in silkwood v. kerr - mcgee corp oration , the court upheld a punitive damages award against a nuclear laboratory arising from an employee's injuries from plutonium contamination .

in upholding the damages award , the court rejected the laboratory's argument that the award impermissibly punished and deterred conduct related to the preempted field of nuclear safety .

instead , the court concluded that federal law did not preempt such damages awards because it found "no indication" that congress had ever seriously considered such an outcome .

moreover , the court observed that congress had failed to provide alternative federal remedies for persons injured in nuclear accidents .

according to the court , this legislative silence was significant because it was "difficult to believe" that congress would have removed all judicial recourse from plaintiffs injured in nuclear accidents without an explicit statement to that effect .

the court also reasoned that congress had assumed the continued availability of state tort remedies when it adopted a 1957 amendment to the aea .

under the relevant amendment , the federal government partially indemnified power plants for certain liabilities for nuclear accidentsâa scheme that reflected an assumption that plaintiffs injured in such accidents retained the ability to bring tort claims against the power plants .

based on this evidence , the court rejected the argument that congress's occupation of the field of nuclear safety regulation preempted all state tort claims arising from nuclear incidents .

the court applied this reasoning from silkwood six years later in english v. general electric company , where it held that federal law did not preempt state tort claims alleging that a nuclear laboratory had retaliated against a whistleblower for reporting safety concerns .

in allowing the claims to proceed , the court rejected the argument that federal law preempts all state laws that affect plants' nuclear safety decisions .

rather , the court explained that in order to fall within the preempted field of nuclear safety regulation , a state law must have a "direct and substantial" effect on such decisions .

while the court acknowledged that the relevant tort claims may have had "some effect" on safety decisions by making retaliation against whistleblowers more costly than safety improvements , it concluded that such an effect was not sufficiently "direct and substantial" to bring the claims within the preempted field .

in making this assessment , the court relied on silkwood , where it held that the relevant punitive damages award fell outside the field of nuclear safety regulation despite its likely impact on safety decisions .

because the court concluded that the type of damages award at issue in silkwood affected safety decisions "more directly" and "far more substantially" than the whistleblower's retaliation claims , it held that the retaliation claims were not preempted .

a determination that federal law preempts a field has powerful consequences , displacing even state laws and regulations that are consistent with or complementary to federal law .

however , because of these effects , the court has cautioned against overly hasty inferences that congress has occupied a field .

specifically , the court has rejected the argument that the comprehensiveness of a federal regulatory scheme is sufficient to conclude that federal law occupies a field , explaining that congress and federal agencies often adopt "intricate and complex" laws and regulations without intending to assume exclusive regulatory authority over the relevant subjects .

the court has accordingly relied on legislative history and statutory structureâin addition to the comprehensiveness of federal regulationsâin assessing field preemption arguments .

the court has also adopted a narrow view of the scope of certain preempted fields .

for example , the court has rejected the proposition that federal nuclear energy regulations preempt all state laws that affect the preempted field of nuclear safety regulation , explaining that state laws fall within that field only if they have a "direct and substantial" effect on it .

as a corollary to this principle , the court has held that in certain contexts , generally applicable state laws are more likely to fall outside a federally preempted field than state laws that "target" entities or issues within the field .

in o neok , inc. v. learjet , inc. , for example , the court held that state antitrust claims against natural gas pipelines fell outside the preempted field of interstate natural gas wholesaling because the relevant state antitrust law was not "aimed" at natural gas companies and instead applied broadly to all businesses .

finally , the court's case law underscores that congress can narrow the scope of a preempted field with explicit statutory language .

in pacific gas , for example , the court held that the preempted field of nuclear safety regulation did not encompass state laws motivated by non - safety concerns based in part on a statutory provision disavowing such an intent .

while the court has subsequently narrowed the circumstances in which it will apply pacific gas 's purpose - centric inquiry to state laws affecting nuclear energy , it has reaffirmed the general principle that congress can circumscribe a preempted field's scope with such "non - preemption clauses. .

federal law also impliedly preempts conflicting state laws .

the supreme court has identified two subcategories of conflict preemption .

first , federal law impliedly preempts state law when it is impossible for regulated parties to comply with both sets of laws ( "impossibility preemption" ) .

second , federal law impliedly preempts state laws that pose an obstacle to the "full purposes and objectives" of congress ( "obstacle preemption" ) .

the two subsections below discuss these subcategories of conflict preemption .

the supreme court has held that federal law preempts state law when it is physically impossible to comply with both sets of laws .

to illustrate this principle , the court has explained that a hypothetical federal law forbidding the sale of avocados with more than 7% oil content would preempt a state law forbidding the sale of avocados with less than 8% oil content , because avocado sellers could not sell their products and comply with both laws .

the court has characterized impossibility preemption as a "demanding defense," and its case law on the issue is not as well - developed as other areas of its preemption jurisprudence .

however , the court extended impossibility preemption doctrine in two recent decisions concerning prescription drug labeling .

in pliva v. mensing and mutual pharmaceutical co. v. bartlett , the court held that federal regulations of generic drug labels preempted certain state law claims brought against generic drug manufacturers because it was impossible for the manufacturers to comply with both federal and state law .

in both cases , plaintiffs alleged that they suffered adverse effects from certain generic drugs and argued that the drugs' labels should have included additional warnings .

in response , the drug manufacturers argued that the hatch - waxman amendments ( hatch - waxman ) to the food , drug , and cosmetic act preempted the state law claims .

under hatch - waxman , drug manufacturers can secure food and drug administration ( fda ) approval for generic drugs by demonstrating that they are equivalent to a brand - name drug already approved by the fda .

in doing so , the generic drug manufacturers need not comply with the fda's standard preapproval process , which requires extensive clinical testing and the development of fda - approved labeling .

however , generic drug makers that use the streamlined hatch - waxman process must ensure that the labels for their drugs are the same as the labels for corresponding brand - name drugs , meaning that generic manufacturers cannot unilaterally change their labels .

in both pliva and bar t lett , the court held that the hatch - waxman amendments preempted the relevant state law claims because it was impossible for the generic drug manufacturers to comply with both federal and state law .

specifically , the court reasoned that it was impossible for the drug makers to comply with both sets of laws because federal law prohibited them from unilaterally altering their labels , while the state law claims depended on the existence of a duty to make such alterations .

in other words , the court reasoned that it was impossible for the manufacturers to comply with both their state law duty to change their labels and their federal duty to keep their labels the same .

in reaching this conclusion in pliva , the court rejected the argument that it was possible for manufacturers to comply with both federal and state law by petitioning the fda to impose new labeling requirements on the corresponding brand - name drugs .

the court rejected this argument on the grounds that impossibility preemption occurs whenever a party cannot independently comply with both federal and state law without seeking "special permission and assistance" from the federal government .

similarly , in bartlett , the court rejected the argument that it was possible for generic drug makers to comply with both federal and state law by refraining from selling the relevant drugs .

the court rejected this "stop - selling" argument on the grounds that it would render impossibility preemption "all but meaningless. .

as a result , an evaluation of whether it is "impossible" to comply with both federal and state law must presuppose some affirmative conduct by the regulated party .

despite its decisions in pliva and bartlett , the court has rejected impossibility preemption arguments made by brand - name drug manufacturers , who are entitled to unilaterally strengthen the warning labels for their drugs .

in wyeth v. levine , the court held that federal law did not preempt a state law failure - to - warn claim brought against the manufacturer of a brand - name drug , reasoning that it was possible for the manufacturer to strengthen its label for the drug without fda approval .

however , the wyeth court noted that an impossibility preemption defense may be available to brand - name drug manufacturers when there is "clear evidence" that the fda would have rejected a proposed change to a brand - name drug's label .

federal law also impliedly preempts state laws that pose an "obstacle" to the "full purposes and objectives" of congress .

in its obstacle preemption cases , the court has held that state law can interfere with federal goals by frustrating congress's intent to adopt a uniform system of federal regulation , conflicting with congress's goal of establishing a regulatory "ceiling" for certain products or activities , or by impeding the vindication of a federal right .

however , the court has also cautioned that obstacle preemption does not justify a "freewheeling judicial inquiry" into whether state laws are "in tension" with federal objectives , as such a standard would undermine the principle that "it is congress rather than the courts that preempts state law. .

the subsections below discuss a number of cases in which the court has held that state law poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of federal goals .

the supreme court has concluded that state laws can pose an obstacle to the accomplishment of federal objectives by interfering with congress's choice to concentrate decisionmaking in federal authorities .

the court's decision in crosby v. national foreign trade council illustrates this type of conflict between state law and federal policy goals .

in crosby , the court held that a federal statute imposing sanctions on burma preempted a massachusetts statute that restricted state agencies' ability to purchase goods or services from companies doing business with burma .

the court identified several ways in which the massachusetts law interfered with the federal statute's objectives .

first , the court reasoned that the massachusetts law interfered with congress's decision to provide the president with the flexibility to add or waive sanctions in response to ongoing developments by "imposing a different , state system of economic pressure against the burmese political regime. .

second , the court explained that because the massachusetts statute penalized certain individuals and conduct that congress explicitly excluded from federal sanctions , it interfered with the federal statute's goal of limiting the economic pressure imposed by the sanctions to "a specific range. .

in identifying this conflict , the court rejected the state's argument that its law "share[d] the same goals" as the federal act , reasoning that the additional sanctions imposed by the state law would still undermine congress's intended "calibration of force. .

finally , the court concluded that the massachusetts law undermined the president's capacity for effective diplomacy by compromising his ability "to speak for the nation with one voice. .

the court has concluded that some federal laws and regulations evince an intent to establish both a regulatory "floor" and "ceiling" for certain products and activities .

the court has interpreted certain federal automobile safety regulations , for example , as not only imposing minimum safety standards on carmakers , but as insulating manufacturers from certain forms of stricter state regulation as well .

in geier v. american honda motor co. , the court held that the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act ( ntmvsa ) and associated regulations impliedly preempted state tort claims alleging that an automobile manufacturer had negligently designed a car without a driver's side airbag .

while the court rejected the argument that the ntmvsa expressly preempted the state law claims , it reasoned that the claims interfered with the federal objective of giving car manufacturers the option of installing a "variety and mix" of passive restraints .

the court discerned this goal from , among other things , the history of the relevant regulations and department of transportation ( dot ) comments indicating that the regulations were intended to lower costs , incentivize technological development , and encourage gradual consumer acceptance of airbags rather than impose an immediate requirement .

the court accordingly held that the ntmvsa impliedly preempted the state law claims because they conflicted with these federal goals .

however , the court has rejected the argument that federal automobile safety standards impliedly preempt all state tort claims concerning automobile safety .

in williamson v. mazda motor of america , inc. , the court held that a different federal safety standard did not preempt a state law claim alleging that a carmaker should have installed a certain type of seatbelt in a car's rear seat .

while the regulation at issue in williamson allowed manufacturers to choose between a variety of seatbelt options , the court distinguished the case from geier on the grounds that the dot's decision to offer carmakers a range of choices was not a "significant" regulatory objective .

specifically , the court reasoned that because the dot's decision to offer manufacturers a range of options was based on relatively minor design and cost - effectiveness concerns , the state tort action did not conflict with the purpose of the relevant federal regulation .

the court has also held that state law can pose an obstacle to federal goals where it impedes the vindication of federal rights .

in felder v. casey , the court held that 42 u.s.c .

â§ 1983 ( section 1983 ) âwhich provides individuals with the right to sue state officials for federal civil rights violationsâpreempted a state statute adopting certain procedural rules for bringing section 1983 claims in state court .

specifically , the state statute required section 1983 plaintiffs to provide government defendants 120 days' written notice of ( 1 ) the circumstances giving rise to their claims , ( 2 ) the amount of their claims , and ( 3 ) their intent to bring suit .

the court held that federal law preempted these requirements because the "purpose" and "effect" of the requirements conflicted with section 1983's remedial objectives .

specifically , the court reasoned that the requirements' purpose of minimizing the state's liability conflicted with section 1983's goal of providing relief to individuals whose constitutional rights are violated by state officials .

moreover , the court concluded that the state statute's effects interfered with federal objectives because its enforcement would result in different outcomes in section 1983 litigation based solely on whether a claim was brought in state or federal court .

the supreme court has held that state law can conflict with federal law in a number of ways .

first , state law can conflict with federal law when it is physically impossible to comply with both sets of laws .

while the court has characterized this type of impossibility preemption argument as a "demanding defense," its decisions in pliva and bartlett arguably extended the doctrine's scope .

in those cases , the court made clear that impossibility preemption remains a viable defense even in instances in which a regulated party can petition the federal government for permission to comply with state law or stop selling a regulated product altogether .

state law can also conflict with federal law when it poses an "obstacle" to federal goals .

in evaluating congressional intent in obstacle preemption cases , the court has relied upon statutory text , structure , and legislative history to determine the scope of a statute's preemptive effect .

relying on these indicia of legislative purpose , the court has held that state laws can pose an obstacle to federal goals by interfering with a uniform system of federal regulation , imposing stricter requirements than federal law ( where federal law evinces an intent to establish a regulatory "ceiling" ) , or by impeding the vindication of a federal right .

while obstacle preemption has played an important role in the court's preemption jurisprudence since the mid - 20th century , recent developments may result in a narrowing of the doctrine .

indeed , commentators have noted the tension between increasingly popular textualist theories of statutory interpretationâwhich reject extra - textual evidence as a possible source of statutory meaningâand obstacle preemption doctrine , which arguably allows courts to consult such evidence .

identifying this alleged inconsistency , justice thomas has categorically rejected the court's obstacle preemption jurisprudence , criticizing the court for "routinely invalidat[ing] state laws based on perceived conflicts with broad federal policy objectives , legislative history , or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not embodied within the text of federal law. .

the court's recent additions may also presage a narrowing of obstacle preemption doctrine , as some commentators have characterized justices gorsuch and kavanaugh as committed textualists .

indeed , the court's 2019 decision in virginia uranium , inc. v. warren suggests that justices gorsuch and kavanaugh may share justice thomas's skepticism toward obstacle preemption arguments .

in that case , justice gorsuch authored an opinion joined by justices thomas and kavanaugh in which he rejected the proposition that implied preemption analysis should appeal to "abstract and unenacted legislative desires" not reflected in a statute's text .

while justice gorsuch did not explicitly endorse a wholesale repudiation of what he characterized as the "purposes - and - objectives branch of conflict preemption," he emphasized that any evidence of congress's preemptive purpose must be sought in a statute's text and structure .
