on february 10 , 2020 , the trump administration proposed its fy2021 budget for the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) accounts , totaling $44.12 billion ( including $158.90 million in mandatory retirement funds ) .

sfops funding typically represents about 1% of the annual federal budget and supports a wide range of u.s. activities around the world , including the operations of u.s. embassies , diplomatic activities , educational and cultural exchanges , development , security , and humanitarian assistance , and u.s. participation in multilateral organizations .

figure 1 shows funding for different sfops components based on fy2020 budget authority estimates , relative to each other and to the broader federal budget .

the administration's request is about 3% higher than the fy2020 request for sfops accounts but nearly 23% below the fy2020 sfops funding level enacted by congress , including supplemental funds to help combat the covid - 19 epidemic globally .

the trump administration has consistently requested far less sfops funding than congress has appropriated .

this is a reversal from the obama administration , when congress typically provided less total sfops funding than was requested , though the gap narrowed over time during obama's terms ( table 1 ) .

if enacted , the requested sfops funding level would be the lowest in over a decade ( figure 2 ) .

congressional action on sfops and other fy2021 appropriations has been delayed to an uncertain degree by disruption of congressional activity related to the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic .

congress held some hearings on the fy2021 budget request before all hearings were postponed in march 2020 .

subcommittee allocations have not been formally established , nor has sfops legislation been introduced for fy2021 .

the fy2021 request would cut funding for the department of state and related agency appropriations accounts to $14.03 billion , down 18.9% from an enacted fy2020 level of $17.31 billion ( including $588 million in covid - 19 supplemental funds ) .

the administration's request does not include funds to support the state department's response to the covid - 19 pandemic .

to date , congress has provided all state department operations funding for covid - 19-related matters through two fy2020 supplemental appropriations acts ( p.l .

116-123 and p.l .

116-136 ) .

the administration's stated priorities for funding provided via department of state and related agency accounts in fy2021 include supporting the indo - pacific strategy ; countering chinese , russian , and iranian malign influence ; protecting u.s. government personnel , facilities , and data assets ; and maintaining american leadership in international organizations while asking other nations to increase their support .

table 2 provides a comparative breakout of the administration's state department and related agency request , by account .

the foreign operations accounts in the sfops appropriation compose the majority of u.s. foreign assistance included in the international affairs budget ; the remainder is enacted in the agriculture appropriation , which provides funding for the food for peace act , title ii and mcgovern - dole international food for education and child nutrition programs .

the administration's fy2021 foreign operations request totals $30.09 billion , representing a 3.7% increase from the administration's fy2020 request and a 25.7% decrease from fy2020-enacted levels .

total foreign assistance requested for fy2021 , including the food assistance funds provided in the agriculture appropriation , would represent a 29.1% reduction from fy2020-enacted levels .

the administration's budget request articulates five primary goals for u.s. foreign assistance that are meant to align with both the national security strategy and the state - usaid joint strategic plan: prioritize global strategic challenges , including countering chinese , russian , and iranian influence ; support strategic partners and allies , including israel , egypt , jordan , colombia , and venezuela ; enhance commitment to long - term development ; strengthen key areas of u.s. leadership , to include global health and humanitarian assistance ; and advance u.s. national security and economic interests .

these goals are also meant to guide the administration's regional thematic priorities ( see " country and regional assistance " ) , as well as how funds are allocated across assistance types .

the administration's fy2021 budget request proposes cuts in nearly all assistance types ( table 5 ) .

the only exception is export promotion assistance , which would see a significant increase .

this increase is largely due to proposed funding for the new u.s. development finance corporation ( dfc ) , which the administration states represents an "expansion of the role of development finance in advancing u.s. interests around the world," and an estimated increase in offsetting collections from the export - import bank .

consistent with prior year funding and the fy2020 enacted levels , proposed funding for global health programs , humanitarian assistance , and security assistance comprises approximately two - thirds of the $30.09 billion fy2021 foreign operations budget request ( figure 3 ) .

the total fy2021 request for the global health programs ( ghp ) account is nearly $6.00 billion , representing a 5.4% reduction from the fy2020 budget request and a 37.5% reduction from the fy2020-enacted level , including supplemental appropriations .

when compared with fy2020-enacted levels before enactment of supplemental funding for covid - 19 , all but one ghp subaccount would be reduced under the budget proposal ( table 6 ) .

budget documents indicate that the increase to pandemic influenza funding ( when compared with fy2020-enacted appropriations prior to the covid - 19 supplemental funding ) would include a $25.00 million deposit of nonexpiring funds to replenish the emergency reserve fund for rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks .

observers have expressed concern about the potential cessation of usaid's predict - ii pandemic preparedness program in march 2020 .

the administration does not indicate in the budget request , nor has it specified in any public fora , whether predict - ii will be continued .

however , the university of california , davisâone of predict - ii's implementing organizationsâhas reportedly received additional funding from usaid to extend predict - ii and continue related work through the "one health workforceânext generation" project .

requested cuts to ghp subaccounts range from 8.0% for malaria programs to 100% for usaid's hiv / aids and vulnerable children subaccounts .

the administration asserts that despite its proposed reduction to hiv / aids funding , the requested level would be sufficient to maintain treatment for all current recipients .

the proposal also reflects the administration's effort to limit u.s. contributions to the global fundâan international financing mechanism for efforts to combat aids , tuberculosis , and malariaâto 25% of all donations , rather than the 33% limit that the united states has provided since the george w. bush administration .

as noted above , the administration's fy2021 request does not include funds for covid - 19 , because the request was prepared prior to the outbreak .

congress enacted , and the president signed into law , three supplemental appropriations acts for covid - 19 preparedness and response in march ( p.l .

116-123 , p.l .

116-127 , and p.l .

116-136 ) .

as of this report's publishing , the administration has not submitted a request for additional fy2021 funds to combat the virus .

the fy2021 budget request for humanitarian assistance is nearly $6.27 billion , roughly equivalent to the fy2020 request but down 40.1% from the fy2020-enacted level of $10.46 billion .

in successive years , the administration has requested levels of humanitarian assistance far lower than those enacted the prior year , at times reflecting the fact that humanitarian assistance funds may be carried over from year to year and unobligated balances from prior years may still be available .

on a bipartisan basis , for many years , congress has consistently supported global humanitarian efforts through appropriation levels well above the budget request ( figure 4 ) .

in addition to the proposed $6.27 billion in new funding for humanitarian assistance , the administration's request assumes $2.80 billion in carryover funding from past - year humanitarian assistance .

the administration asserts that the fy2021 request , combined with the estimated carryover , totals close to $9.00 billion , which would allow the united states "to program well above the second highest level ever , and is sufficient to address the needs for syria , yemen , and other crisis areas. .

for fy2021 , as in fy2020 , the trump administration proposes to fund all humanitarian assistance through a single international humanitarian assistance ( iha ) account managed through usaid's new bureau for humanitarian assistance ( bha ) .

the administration has justified the restructuring as necessary "to optimize humanitarian assistance , prioritize funding , and use funding as effectively and efficiently as possible. .

the proposal would effectively move the administration of overseas refugee and migration assistance fundingâcurrently funded through the migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) and emergency refugee and migration assistance ( erma ) accountsâfrom the state department to usaid .

in fy2020 , enacted funding for these accounts totaled $3.78 billion .

the budget request would eliminate the erma account and significantly reduce funding to mra , with none for overseas needs .

within usaid , the bha is in the process of combining the functions of the offices of u.s. foreign disaster assistance and food for peace .

the budget request would eliminate the international disaster assistance ( ida ) account ( fy2020-enacted funding totaled $4.95 billion ) , as well as food for peace act , title ii emergency food assistance funding , the latter of which is currently appropriated through the agriculture appropriation but administered by usaid ( fy2020-enacted funding totaled $1.73 billion ) .

funds previously requested in these accounts would be consolidated into the iha account .

the administration is requesting $7.73 billion in international security assistance for fy2021 , an increase of 4.3% from the fy2020 request and 14.3% below the fy2020-enacted level .

the greatest cuts to security assistance accounts would be to peacekeeping operations ( pko , - 36.6% ) and international military education and training ( imet , - 27.4% ) ( figure 5 ) .

consistent with prior year requests and appropriations , the majority of security assistance ( $5.19 billion ) would be for foreign military financing ( fmf ) to the middle east , including $3.30 billion in grants to israel .

as in the trump administration's past three budget proposals , the fy2021 request seeks flexibility to provide fmf assistance through a combination of grants and loans , including loan guarantees , rather than the current use of fmf on an almost exclusive grant basis .

the administration asserts that this authority would both "expand the tools available to the united states to help nato and major - non nato allies purchase more american - made defense equipment and related services" and "increase burden sharing by asking these partners to contribute more national funds to foreign military sales cases. .

the remaining third of the fy2021 foreign operations request proposes to allocate funds to development sectors other than those related to global health , independent agencies , multilateral assistance , and export promotion agencies .

the fy2021 budget request would reduce funding from fy2020-enacted levels in a number of development sectors ( table 7 ) .

environment - focused aid , for example , would be cut by 86.3% , while funding for education and water and sanitation would fall by 61.2% .

as with the fy2020 request , the fy2021 request includes a significant increase from prior year - enacted levels to programming that seeks to promote women in developing economies , largely due to a proposed $200.00 million for the women's global development and prosperity initiative ( w - gdp ) .

under the fy2021 request , most development accountsâdevelopment assistance ( da ) ; economic support fund ( esf ) ; assistance to europe , eurasia and central asia ( aeeca ) ; and the democracy fund ( df ) âwould be combined into a single new economic support and development fund ( esdf ) .

the administration asserts that this consolidated account would streamline the deployment of resources , increasing efficiency in foreign assistance .

because the consolidated account would incorporate what are now both core and shared usaid accounts , it remains unclear what portion of the new account usaid would manage or implement .

the administration made a similar request in the fy2018 , fy2019 , and fy2020 budget requests , but congress did not enact the proposals .

the fy2021 budget request nestles the relief and recovery fund ( rrf ) and a proposed new diplomatic progress fund ( dpf ) âboth previously requested as separate budget itemsâunder the proposed esdf account .

according to the justification , the dpf would "allow the state department and usaid to respond to new opportunities arising from progress in diplomatic and peace efforts around the world. .

while congress provided funds for the rrf in previous fiscal years , congress has not accepted the administration's proposal for the dpf .

the administration's fy2021 request would reduce funding to the peace corps ( - 19.5% ) and the millennium challenge corporation ( - 11.6% ) .

the request also proposes eliminating the inter - american foundation ( iaf ) and the u.s african development foundation ( usadf ) , and incorporating staff and small grant activities of the two foundations into usaid's new bureau for development , democracy , and innovation .

the administration maintains that this consolidation would allow usaid to "capitalize on the existing expertise , capacity , relationships , and tools that usadf and iaf provide , including their regional and market segment emphases , in order to reinforce u.s. government bilateral development efforts. .

to implement the shuttering of the iaf and usadf , the administration requests $3.85 million and $4.66 million , respectively .

sfops multilateral assistance accounts provide for u.s. payments to multilateral development banks and international organizations that pool funding from multiple donors to finance development activities .

the administration's fy2021 request would reduce these accounts by 28.9% from fy2020-enacted levels .

as in the trump administration's three previous requests , the proposal would eliminate funding for the international organizations and programs ( io&p ) account , which funds u.s. voluntary contributions to international organizations , primarily united nations entities such as unicef .

congress appropriated $390.50 million for io&p in fy2020 .

the administration also proposes eliminating funds for the global environment facility ( gef ) and the international fund for agricultural development ( ifad ) .

for the gef , the administration asserts that carryover funds from fy2019 and fy2020 appropriations are sufficient to meet the u.s. pledge to the gef's seventh replenishment .

the fy2021 request includes an increased investment in the u.s. development finance corporation ( dfc ) , established in 2019 to implement the build act .

however , the administration would eliminate funding for the u.s. trade and development agencyâthe request includes $12.11 million for the agency's "orderly closeout"âand an 8.3% reduction from fy2020-enacted levels for the export - import bank of the united states' operations account .

as in previous years , the administration assumes that all export promotion expenditures would be offset by collections .

in the fy2021 request , the administration assumes $711.20 million and $496.00 million in offsetting collections from the export - import bank and the dfc , respectively .

the administration organizes much of its country and regional assistance into six thematic priorities ( figure 6 ) .

these priorities are also meant to reflect the broader foreign operations goals outlined in " foreign operations highlights . .

top country recipients under the fy2021 request remain consistent with prior year funding allocations .

israel , egypt , and jordan would remain the top three recipients of foreign assistanceâthough egypt would move ahead of jordan when compared with fy2019 actual fundingâlargely due to the proposed levels of military aid for those three countries .

other countries that the administration maintains are strategically significant , including afghanistan and ukraine , also remain top country recipients in the fy2021 request , as do several african countries that would receive high levels of global health and development aid ( table 8 ) .

regionally , the middle east and africa would receive the largest shares of aid in the fy2021 requestâtogether comprising about 71.5% of total aid allocated by country or regionâconsistent with fy2019 year actuals ( figure 7 ) .

proposed funding for europe and eurasia and , separately , the indo - pacific , come to 3.9% and 9.2% , respectively .

notably , the distribution of assistance within regions vary significantly .

for example , africa receives a majority of ghp funding ( 58.1% in fy2019 and a proposed 66.7% for fy2021 ) , but accounts for a small proportion of incle funding ( 5.2% in fy2019 and a proposed 4.1% for fy2021 ) .

in comparison , the western hemisphere region accounts for a small percentage of ghp ( 2.5% in fy2019 and a proposed 2.2% for fy2021 ) and a large proportion of incle funds ( 37.7% in fy2019 and a proposed 44.8% for fy2021 ) .

international affairs budget the international affairs budget , or function 150 , includes funding that is not in the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) appropriation ; in particular , international food assistance programs ( food for peace act ( ffpa ) , title ii and mcgovern - dole international food for education and child nutrition programs ) are in the agriculture appropriations , and the foreign claim settlement commission and the international trade commission are in the commerce , justice , science appropriations .

in addition , the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriation measure includes funding for certain international commissions that are not part of the international affairs function 150 account .
