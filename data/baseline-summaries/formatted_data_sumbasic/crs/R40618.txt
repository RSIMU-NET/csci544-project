in 2009 , teen births ( for women ages 15 through 19 ) accounted for 10.1% of all births in the united states and 21.4% of all nonmarital births .

the birth rate for u.s. teenagers increased in 2006 and 2007 after a steady decline since 1991 .

recent data indicate that the teen birth rate dropped in 2008 and 2009 , reversing the two - year increase .

although the birth rate for u.s. teens has dropped in 16 of the last 18 years ( for which data are available ) , it remains higher than the teenage birth rate of most industrialized nations .

in recognition of the negative , long - term consequences associated with teenage pregnancy and births , the prevention of pregnancy among teenagers is a major public policy goal of this nation .

although there are many federally funded programs that provide pregnancy prevention information and / or services to teens , from 1981 to 1996 , the adolescent family life ( afl ) program was the only federal program that was required to use all of its funding directly ( and exclusively ) on the issues of adolescent sexuality , pregnancy , and parenting .

from 1996 to 2009 , federal teen pregnancy prevention efforts relied heavily on using abstinence - only education as its primary tool ; and several programs received federal funding that was to be used solely for teaching and promoting an abstinence - only approach .

president obama's fy2010 budget proposed a new teen pregnancy prevention program and also proposed to eliminate both mandatory and discretionary funding for the abstinence - only education programs .

for fy2009 , abstinence - only education funding totaled $149.7 million .

the administration's fy2010 budget proposal would have replaced that spending in fy2010 with $177.6 million in combined mandatory and discretionary funding for comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention programs .

p.l .

111-117 , the consolidated appropriations for fy2010 ( enacted december 16 , 2009 ) , included a new discretionary teenage pregnancy prevention program , identical to the one proposed in the president's fy2010 budget , that provides grants and contracts , on a competitive basis , to public and private entities to fund "medically accurate and age appropriate" programs that reduce teen pregnancy .

p.l .

111-117 appropriated funding of $110 million for fy2010 for the new teen pregnancy prevention ( tpp ) program , from a discretionary funding account , and an additional $4.5 million for program evaluations for fy2010 .

p.l .

111-117 does not provide for a $50 million per year mandatory teen pregnancy prevention block grant to states nor does it stipulate that a certain amount ( $13.1 million ) of that adolescent family life ( afl ) funding must be used for new teen pregnancy prevention activities .

president obama's fy2011 budget proposed to increase funding for the new discretionary teen pregnancy prevention ( tpp ) program to $129 million for fy2011 ( from $110 million for fy2010 enacted by p.l .

111-117 ) .

after several temporary funding measures were enacted , p.l .

112-10 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( enacted april 15 , 2011 ) included funding of $109.5 million for the tpp program for fy2011 ( $105 million for the grant program plus $4.455 million for program evaluation ) .

p.l .

112-10 also included a 0.2% across - the - board rescission that is not reflected in the $109.5 million funding total .

although mandatory block grant funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs was not included in p.l .

111-117 , such funding was included in the health care reform bills .

both the house and senate health care reform bills ( h.r .

3962 and h.r .

3590 , respectively ) included a provision that would have established a mandatory block grant to states for teen pregnancy prevention activities .

in the house bill ( h.r .

3962 ) , it was funded at $50 million per year for five years and was called the healthy teen initiative to prevent teen pregnancy .

in the senate bill ( h.r .

3590 ) , it was funded at $75 million per year for five years and was called the personal responsibility education program .

the senate bill ( h.r .

3590 ) also included a provision that would have appropriated $50 million annually for five years for the previously authorized title v abstinence education block grant .

p.l .

111-148 ( the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) ) , signed into law on march 23 , 2010 , includes the teen pregnancy prevention provisions that were included in the senate version of the bill ( h.r .

3590 ) .

this report provides a brief discussion of the debate on comprehensive sex education and abstinence education , highlights evaluations of both types of programs , describes youth programs that address teen pregnancy , and examines the new teen pregnancy prevention program established by p.l .

111-117 ( which was first proposed in the obama administration's fy2010 budget and then again in its fy2011 budget ) .

it also describes the teen pregnancy prevention programs authorized and established in ppaca ( p.l .

111-148 ) .

in addition , it identifies teen pregnancy prevention legislation that was introduced in the 111 th congress .

when the idea of abstinence - only education was being discussed during the 1994-1996 welfare reform debate it was in the context of providing equal funding for abstinence education as was then provided for teen sexual education programs that included information about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases .

it appears that a consensus is now growing around the viewpoint that success in the teen pregnancy prevention arena does not necessarily have to be an "either or" proposition in which abstinence - only education programs are pitted against comprehensive sex education programs .

this section discusses three approaches to reducing teen pregnancy: comprehensive sex education , abstinence - only education , and youth programs that address teen pregnancy .

although the birth rate for u.s. teens has dropped in 16 of the last 18 years ( for which program data are available ) , it remains higher than the teenage birth rate of most industrialized nations .

as mentioned earlier , the birth rate for u.s. teenagers increased in 2006 and 2007 , but dropped in 2008 and 2009 .

according to a recent report on children and youth , in 2007 , one - third of 9 th graders reported having experienced sexual intercourse .

the corresponding figures for older teens were 44% of 10 th graders , 56% of 11 th graders , and 65% of 12 th graders .

researchers and analysts are still trying to figure out why teen birth rates increased in 2006 and 2007 ( after 14 years of decline ) .

they contend that it is not a statistical anomaly , and that , in fact , the rise in 2006 was not a sudden reversal of the teen birth rate , but rather was preceded by a slowing of the decline .

they maintain that a myriad of factors have resulted in the increase in teen birth rates .

they note that hispanics ( who are a subgroup of the population that has a high fertility rate ) comprise a growing share of the teen population , sexual activity among high school - age children has increased , and contraceptive use among teenagers has dropped .

they also acknowledge that the following factors are all significant contributors to the reasons why teenagers get pregnant: ( 1 ) social and economic changes ; ( 2 ) teens' relationships with parents , other adults , and other teens ; and ( 3 ) the attitudes and values of the teens themselves .

some commentators suggest that the 14-year reduction in teen birth rates brought on a mild complacency among policymakers and that the recent upswing in teen births has renewed public attention to the need to implement proven strategies and find new ways to reduce teen pregnancy .

according to recent data , the birth rate for u.s. teenagers dropped in 2008 and 2009 .

this decline reverses two consecutive years of increase , as mentioned above .

the obama administration switched the focus of teen pregnancy prevention from using abstinence - only education as its primary tool to using approaches that rely on teaching abstinence along with information on contraception .

according to hhs budget documents for fy2010 , funds from the discretionary cbae program , the mandatory title v abstinence education block grant , and the "prevention" component of the afl program would be redirected in fy2010 to the proposed teen pregnancy prevention programs because the hhs - sponsored scientific evaluation of abstinence - only education programs indicated that such programs were not effective in reducing teenagers' likelihood of engaging in sexual activity .

as mentioned earlier , although many federal programs allow their funds to be used for teen pregnancy prevention , until enactment of p.l .

111-117 , there was not a separate funding source specifically for the purpose of providing comprehensive sex education in schools .

president obama's fy2010 budget included funding for a new teen pregnancy prevention initiative .

the president's proposed teen pregnancy prevention initiative would fund programs based on successful models that provide medically accurate and age - appropriate resources to reduce the risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases .

these funds would be used to support both the replication of evidence - based models and demonstration programs to identify new effective approaches to reduce teenage pregnancy .

the proposed teen pregnancy initiative has multiple components , and would total $164.5 million in fy2010 .

in addition , the fy2010 budget proposed that $13.1 million that is to be expended on the "prevention" component of the afl demonstration program be redirected from funding abstinence - only education demonstration programs to funding broader teen pregnancy prevention programs that replicate successful program models or develop , replicate , refine , or test promising approaches and innovative strategies for preventing teen pregnancy .

according to budget documents , approximately 20 curriculum - based models have been evaluated using a rigorous experimental design and were shown to reduce teen pregnancy rates , increase contraception use , or delay the onset of sexual activity .

many of these programs have a strong emphasis on abstinence and encourage teens to wait to have sex , but also provide information on contraception and comprehensive sex education .

although some of the most successful programs usually include a youth development component , such as service learning ( eg , volunteering , community service ) , academic support , or opportunities to participate in sports and the arts , research on teen pregnancy prevention is still emerging .

the proposed fy2010 budget provided $110 million in discretionary funds for a competitive teen pregnancy prevention grant program for community and faith - based organizations as well as outreach , training , technical assistance , and evaluation .

the proposed teen pregnancy prevention budget initiative would direct most of its funds towards programs that have been shown to be effective , but also provides some funding for grantees to identify new approaches for reducing teen pregnancy .

the hhs secretary would be authorized to award grants to non - profit faith - based and community organizations for teen pregnancy prevention programs for youth ages 12 to 19 .

grants would last three to five years and provide an average of $350,000 to the grantee with a 25% match requirement .

all applicants for teen pregnancy prevention grants would have to agree to randomly assign participants to control and experimental groups if selected for a national evaluation .

according to hhs budget documents , not less than $75 million of the proposed $110 million in discretionary funds would be used to fund grants for programs to replicate curriculum - based models that have been shown through strong evaluation ( defined as an experimental or quasi - experimental study ) to be effective in reducing teen pregnancy , delaying sexual activity , or improving contraception use ( without increasing sexual activity ) .

moreover , not less than $25 million ( of the proposed discretionary $110 million ) would be used to fund grants for demonstration programs to develop , replicate , refine , and test additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teen pregnancy .

all grantees would be required to use a curriculum that is both age appropriate and medically accurate .

in addition , the obama administration's fy2010 budget would fund activities to support parents in communicating with their children about teen pregnancy and other high - risk behaviors .

these funds would be used for an interactive website and other outreach activities for parents , youth , teachers , and community members ( the budget documents do not specify a specific dollar amount for these activities ) .

the administration's fy2010 budget also provided $4.5 million in public health service act evaluation funds for a rigorous evaluation of the proposed pregnancy prevention initiatives .

in addition , the obama administration's fy2010 budget sought authorization for a new $50 million mandatory teen pregnancy prevention grant to states , tribes , and territories .

budget documents indicated that funding for the mandatory title v abstinence education block grant program would not be requested ; instead , $50 million in mandatory funds would be used to fund a broader teen pregnancy prevention initiative using scientifically based models and promising practices .

moreover , the obama administration's fy2010 budget sought to redirect in fy2010 $13.1 million in funds from the "prevention" component of the afl program that were previously used exclusively for abstinence - only education program to the proposed teen pregnancy initiative .

according to the fy2010 budget appendix , of the proposed $13,120,000 to be set aside to prevent adolescent sexual relations pursuant to the afl program ( i.e. , the prevention component ) , $9,840,000 would be for programs that replicate the elements of one or more teenage pregnancy prevention programs that have been proven through rigorous evaluation to delay sexual activity , increase contraceptive use ( without increasing sexual activity ) , or reduce teenage pregnancy ; and $3,280,000 would be available for research and demonstration grants to develop , replicate , refine , and test additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teen pregnancy .

to summarize , under the obama administration's fy2010 budget , the proposed teen pregnancy prevention initiative would have received funding totaling $177.6 million for fy2010 .

that total includes $110 million to fund approximately 275 discretionary grants ; $50 million in mandatory funds for states , tribes , and territories ; $13.1 million for the "prevention" component of the afl program ( which was being used to exclusively fund abstinence - only education programs ) , and $4.5 million in public health service act evaluation funds for a rigorous evaluation of the pregnancy prevention initiatives .

as noted earlier , the $110 million discretionary tpp program and its evaluation ( $4.5 million ) were included in p.l .

111-117 .

president obama's fy2011 budget proposed to increase funding for the new discretionary teen pregnancy prevention ( tpp ) program to $129 million for fy2011 ( from $110 million for fy2010 enacted by p.l .

111-117 ) .

the funding for the tpp program would include ( 1 ) $85 million to replicate teen pregnancy prevention approaches that have been proven ( through rigorous evaluation ) to be effective ; ( 2 ) $28 million for research and demonstration grants to develop , replicate , refine , and test additional strategies for reducing and preventing teenage pregnancy ; ( 3 ) $4 million for program evaluation ; and ( 4 ) $12 million for training and technical assistance , outreach , and other program support .

the obama administration has also requested an additional $50 million in mandatory funds for a new formula grant to support teen pregnancy prevention efforts by states , tribes , and the territories .

also , the fy2011 budget documents indicate that funding of $17 million is to be used to support afl "care" demonstration projects and research .

further , according to budget documents , an additional $4 million from public health service ( phs ) evaluation funds is to be used for evaluating tpp programs .

to summarize , funding for teen pregnancy prevention initiatives included in the administration's fy2011 budget request would have totaled $200 million in fy2011 .
