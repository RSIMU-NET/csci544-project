during the 105th congress , the proposed "omnibus crime control act of 1997" containedprovisions designed to overrule miranda .

this is a review of the controversy sparked by this as wellas other proposals governing the use of a defendant's confession against him at his criminal trial .

this report reviews the development of the law regarding pretrial interrogation and self - incrimination from the late nineteenth century to the time of the miranda decision and the periodcovering the aftermath .

the topics covered include an historical overview of the case law of pretrialinterrogation prior to miranda , that barred use of a confession during a defendant's criminal trial ifhe had not been given certain warnings before confessing ; the miranda decision and related supremecourt cases ; the mcnabb / mallory rule , that barred certain confessions made while the defendant wasbeing illegally held in custody ; 18 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 3501 , that addressed the issues raised by miranda andthe mcnabb / mallory rule ; proposals to replace miranda with a further amended versionsection3501 ; and the court's decision in dickerson , which appears to have left the miranda rulestrongerthan at any time in its controversial history .

in spite of the fifth amendment's limitation on the use of coerced confessions , ( 1 ) the supremecourt's early decisions on the admissibility of confessions in federal courts relied upon the commonlaw rule .

 ( 2 ) in the 1897 case of bram v. unitedstates , ( 3 ) the court attempted to define the fifthamendment concept of voluntariness and to base exclusion upon violation of the privilege againstself - incrimination , but the court in a subsequent decision appeared to withdraw from thatviewpoint .

 ( 4 ) nonetheless , the bram "voluntariness" approach was affirmed in zhang sung wan v.united states , ( 5 ) and it influenced the court tostate the rule of exclusion more broadly , so that it wasnot merely a matter of whether the confession was reliable or whether a forbidden inducement hadbeen used , but rather whether the confession "was in fact , voluntarily made. .

 ( 6 ) according to thisdoctrine , confessions were admitted only if they had been given voluntarily ; confessions wereexcluded if the suspect's will was subject to police duress .

it was not until brown v. mississippi ( 7 ) that the supreme court applied the due process standardfor use of a confession in state criminal proceedings .

prior to that time , the court had consistentlyheld that the fifth amendment did not apply to the states , and considered the admissibility ofincriminating statements in state proceedings as a issue of fourteenth amendment due processrelative to those standards regarding the conventional rule of evidence which prohibits involuntaryconfessions .

 ( 8 ) in brown , three blackdefendants were beaten by sheriff's deputies investigating themurder of a white male .

the deputies hung one of the suspects from a tree , let him up and downseveral times and then beat him twice ( while tied to a tree and subsequently on the roadside ) untilhe confessed .

 ( 9 ) the deputies arrested the other twosuspects , stripped and placed them over chairs,and then beat both suspects with buckled leather straps until they confessed .

 ( 10 ) since the fifthamendment privilege was then not deemed applicable to the states , the court struck down theconfessions based on the theory that interrogation is part of the process by which a state acquires aconviction and thus is subject to the requirements of the fourteenth amendment due processclause .

 ( 11 ) the court unanimously reversed theconvictions of all three suspects , deciding that thepolice tactics violated the due process clause of fourteenth amendment .

 ( 12 ) having established in brown that due process was violated when a conviction rested exclusively upon a confession which was obtained in this manner , later cases made it clear that the admissionat trial of such a confession was unconstitutional .

 ( 13 ) in brown , the court held that although a statemight be able to do away with the privilege against self incrimination completely , a state could notexact a confession by torture .

 ( 14 ) subsequently,this was commonly referred to as the "fourteenthamendment due process voluntariness test" requirement , and it was the standard used by the courtin articulating the due process requisites for its admissibility .

 ( 15 ) under this standard , the admissibilityof a confession was evaluated on a case by case basis according to the "totality of thecircumstances," ( 16 ) surrounding each confession .

four years after brown , the court in chambers v. florida , ( 17 ) reversed a state conviction basedon confessions obtained after five days of interrogation , during which the suspects had no contactwith their friends , advisers or counselors .

 ( 18 ) thecourt went further than brown and held that evenwhere there was no physical violence , ( 19 ) continuous questioning and "other ingenious forms ofentrapment of the helpless" could constitute compulsion .

 ( 20 ) justice black noted that it has beensuggested that the use of these coercive tactics "has lowered the esteem in which [the] administrationof justice is held by the public and has engendered an attitude of hostility to unwillingness tocooperate with the police...." ( 21 ) two years later , in ward v. texas , where the defendant , an afro - american , under interrogation had been threatened with mob violence , taken by night and day to strange towns in several counties,incarcerated in several jails , and by persistent questioning , coerced to confess , the supreme courtagain ruled for reversal .

 ( 22 ) in these and othersimilar cases , ( 23 ) where the convictions werereversed,the court indicated its concern for the integrity of the process used for extracting the confession andnoted that there was almost no evidence against the defendants .

the court therefore relied on thefourteenth amendment to reverse the convictions of what it believed were innocent men .

the courtwas also protecting minorities from brutality which was being tolerated by the states .

 ( 24 ) between the time of brown v. mississippi ( 25 ) and miranda v. arizona , ( 26 ) the due process standardwas applied in dozens of cases .

during these years , the court designated certain police practiceswhich weighed the "totality of the circumstances" against a finding of voluntariness andadmissibility - - including physical force , threats of harm or punishment , lengthy periods of unlawfuldetention , solitary confinement , denial of food or sleep , and promises of leniency - - and thereforewere constitutionally impermissible .

 ( 27 ) typicalcharacteristics of the accused that were also takeninto consideration included youth , lack of education or intelligence , member of a racial minoritygroup , poverty , and mental or intellectual disabilities .

 ( 28 ) .

miranda wove together threads from the case law regarding confessions beginning in the late1940's that provided the basis for significant changes in criminal law investigations and adjudicationup to the present time .

these changes were designed to impose , among other things , uniform federalstandards upon the states which up to that time had many variations in their pretrial procedures .

 ( 29 ) .

together with four cases , the title case in miranda v. arizona , ( 70 ) arose from ernesto miranda'skidnapping and rape of an eighteen - year - old woman .

miranda confessed to the crime shortly afterbeing taken into custody .

he made no request to consult with an attorney while being interrogatedbut neither was he advised by the police that he had a right to have an attorney present .

at his trial,the written confession was admitted in evidence .

 ( 71 ) the court reversed miranda's conviction basedupon the failure of the police to comply with the new rules that were announced in the miranda decision .

before the court explained its holding , it discussed "... the nature and setting of ... in - custody ( 72 ) interrogation[s] ...." ( 73 ) the court was cognizantof the police violence which could occur at that timeduring custodial interrogations because of the "incommunicado" nature of the proceedings .

 ( 74 ) thecourt noted that , while police brutality of the early 1900s ( 75 ) was no longer the standard practice , thecommunity still needed protection against the "psychological rather than physically oriented"interrogation .

 ( 76 ) the court believed that it wasnecessary to give this protection to suspects becauseall police interrogation manuals emphasized the need for privacy during the interrogation so that ineffect , "[t]he subject ... [was] deprived of every psychological advantage. .

 ( 77 ) the court referred totechniques and psychological tactics interrogators are instructed to use during an interrogation toobtain evidence from the suspect .

 ( 78 ) the courtreasoned that the suspects needed the safeguardsbecause "[t]he circumstance surrounding in - custody interrogation can operate very quickly tooverbear the will of [the suspect] ..." ( 79 ) and withoutthem no statement can be considered the productof his / her free will .

the rules are designed to safeguard the privilege against self - incrimination , and must be followed in the absence of "other procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accusedpersons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it ...." ( 80 ) theserules apply "[a]t the outset" , when the person is first subjected to interrogation while in custody atthe station or otherwise restricted in the freedom of his / her actions in any meaningful way .

 ( 81 ) the specific rules ( safeguards ) enunciated by the court were as follows: ( 1 ) regardless of his prior awareness of his rights , if the accused in custody is to be subjected to questioning , "he must first be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he has the right toremain silent" , so that those unaware may learn of this right and so that they will be able to overcomethe inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere .

 ( 82 ) ( 2 ) the warning regarding the right to remain silent "... must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court" so as to makesure that the suspect will be aware of the consequences of forgoing it .

 ( 83 ) ( 3 ) because this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation , the suspect "must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him duringinterrogation" regardless of the circumstances which may indicate "that the person may have[already] been aware of this right ...." ( 84 ) ( 4 ) the individual must be warned "that if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him," otherwise , "the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood asmeaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has ... the funds to obtain one. .

 ( 85 ) ( 5 ) if the "individual indicates in any manner , at any time prior to or during questioning , that he wishes to remain silent , the interrogation must cease" ; and if he "states that he wants an attorney,the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. .

 ( 86 ) ( 6 ) if during an interrogation , a statement is taken without the presence of an attorney , a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waivedhis privilege against self - incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel" ; and "... avalid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are givenor simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained. .

 ( 87 ) ( 7 ) any statement obtained in violation of these guidelines may not be admitted into evidence inasmuch as the rules do not distinguish degrees of incrimination and it is without regard as towhether it is only an admission of part of an offense or whether the statements are "inculpatory" or"exculpatory. .

 ( 88 ) ( 8 ) it is impermissible for one to be penalized for exercising his fifth amendment privilege , and therefore the prosecution may not "use at trial the fact that [the accused] stood mute or claimedhis privilege in the face of accusation. .

 ( 89 ) subsequently , the court made two things very clear in miranda which made it unique: ( 1 ) based upon the court's interpretation , there is a requirement under the fifth amendment thatsuspects must knowingly and voluntarily waive their rights which in effect places an affirmative dutyon police officers to inform the accused of his / her rights .

 ( 90 ) ( 2 ) no decision prior to miranda inconstruing the fifth amendment had stated that any of the rules imposed by miranda were required for compliance with the amendment .

 ( 91 ) .

1 .

the right to counsel .

in 1975 , the court seemed to take a more limited view of the miranda safeguards in michiganv .

mosely .

 ( 92 ) the court in rejecting thestrict application of the miranda safeguards to bar newinterrogations , reviewed the circumstances leading to the incriminating statements to determine whena suspect waives his rights .

 ( 93 ) the court "...concluded that the admissibility of statements obtainedafter the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under miranda on whether his 'rightto cut off questioning' was 'scrupulously honored.' .

 ( 94 ) as for the application of the "scrupulouslyhonored" test , the majority concluded it was met on the facts of the case because "... the police hereimmediately ceased the interrogation , resumed questioning only after the passage of a significantperiod of time and the provision of a fresh set of warnings , and restricted the second interrogationto a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation. .

 ( 95 ) hence , the court appeared tomove towards a less rigid approach , permitting limited renewed interrogations rather than an allinclusive miranda coverage .

in 1977 , the court appeared to extend the miranda rights in brewer v. williams .

 ( 96 ) in decidingthat the police violated the suspect's rights to counsel under miranda , the court stated that "... courts[should] indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver...." ( 97 ) the court noted that "... theright to counsel granted by the sixth and fourteenth amendments means at least that a person isentitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiatedagainst him - 'whether by way of formal charge , preliminary hearing , indictment , information , orarraignment.' .

 ( 98 ) being aware that a warrant hadbeen issued for his arrest , he had been arraignedon that warrant before a judge , and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail , thecourt concluded "[t]here can be no doubt in the present case that judicial proceedings had beeninitiated ...." ( 99 ) the state has the burden ofproving that a suspect actually relinquished his rights,and not merely that he comprehended them .

 ( 100 ) hence , the court appeared to be giving expanded miranda protection by making waiver of the right to counsel more difficult .

in 1979 , the court appeared to change its position again in north carolina v. butler .

 ( 101 ) ratherthan making waiver more difficult , the court appeared to make it easier by allowing implicitwaivers .

 ( 102 ) disregarding the rule that onlyexplicit waivers , either written or oral , are effective , thecourt placed emphasis on whether the accused waived his rights "knowingly and voluntarily" ratherthan the form of the accused's waiver .

 ( 103 ) therefore , according to butler , words and action may besufficient to waive a suspect's rights but the presumption by the courts must still be against waiver .

 ( 104 ) however , the court ultimately decided that all the circumstances will be reviewed in order todetermine if the waiver was voluntary .

 ( 105 ) in 1981 , the court once more in edwards v. arizona , ( 106 ) redefined the requirements for aneffective waiver .

the arizona supreme court , in deciding the issue of voluntariness , applied thetotality of the circumstances test in finding that edwards waived his rights when he voluntarily spokewith police after he had invoked his right to counsel during an interrogation the day before .

 ( 107 ) thecourt reversed , holding "... that an accused , ... having expressed his desire to deal with police onlythrough counsel , is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been madeavailable to him , unless the accused himself initiates further communication , exchanges orconversations with the police. .

 ( 108 ) the courtfurther stated that police cannot "... reinterrogate anaccused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel. .

 ( 109 ) it would appear as if the "clearlyasserted" language was an indication that there will be a requirement for a clear and precisestatement in order to invoke the right to counsel , which has the effect of overruling the "in anymanner" guidelines in miranda .

it also reveals the significance that the court attaches to protectingthe right to counsel by requiring more than an incognizant waiver of that right ; "... the accusedhimself [must] initiate[] further communication. .

 ( 110 ) opting for the stricter knowing and intelligentwaiver over the broader totality of circumstances test , the court appeared to be seeking a way toaffirmatively protect the accused's right to have counsel during the interrogation .

 ( 111 ) in 1983 , the court had another opportunity to review the edwards test in oregon v. bradshaw .

 ( 112 ) the court agreed in bradshaw that the admissibility of a confession given by adefendant who earlier invoked his miranda right to counsel is to be determined by a two - part test .

it first must be determined whether the defendant "initiated" further conversation as required by edwards .

 ( 113 ) this means that theimpetus must come from the accused , and not the officers .

 ( 114 ) underthis test , any previous police - initiated interrogation must have ended prior to the suspect's allegedinitial remarks , since he / she cannot "initiate" an ongoing interrogation .

 ( 115 ) second , if it is found thatthe defendant "initiated" further conversation , it must then be determined if the accused waived hisright to counsel and silence , "... that is , whether the purported waiver was knowing and intelligentand found to be so under the totality of the circumstances , including the necessary fact that theaccused , not the police , reopened the dialogue with the authorities. .

 ( 116 ) in 1984 , in smith v. illinois , ( 117 ) the supreme court was presented with its first opportunity toaddress an equivocal request for counsel .

the court noted that the issue was whether the accusedhad invoked his right to counsel so as to come within the edwards test .

 ( 118 ) the court recognized thethree approaches for determining the consequences of such ambiguities but declined to adopt one .

 ( 119 ) the court stated that "where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading upto the request would render it ambiguous , all questioning must cease. .

 ( 120 ) hence , there appears tobe the implication that only unambiguous requests will be sufficient for the recognition of the rightto counsel .

 ( 121 ) however , the court did notanswer the question .

in 1986 , the court in michigan v. jackson , ( 122 ) held that when the sixth amendment right tocounsel has attached , "... if police initiate interrogation after a defendant's assertion , at anarraignment or similar proceeding of his right to counsel , any waiver of the defendant's right tocounsel for that police - initiated interrogation is invalid. .

 ( 123 ) the court appeared to move toward alower limit for invoking the right to counsel .

 ( 124 ) the court stressed the need for protecting asuspect's rights , stating that "... we presume that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at everycritical stage of the prosecution. .

 ( 125 ) thecourt's opinion that "... questions of waiver requires us togive a broad , rather than a narrow , interpretation to a defendant's request for counsel..." ( 126 ) appearsto have been an additional indication of the court's willingness to accept ambiguous requests forcounsel .

in 1987 , the court in connecticut v. barrett , ( 127 ) acknowledged for the first time the issue of theambiguous request for counsel .

 ( 128 ) though theconnecticut supreme court ruled that the ambiguousrequest for counsel amounted to an invocation to counsel for all purposes , the supreme courtconcluded otherwise stating: "barrett's limited requests for counsel ... were accompanied byaffirmative announcements of his willingness to speak with the authorities .

the fact that officialstook the opportunity provided by barrett to obtain an oral confession is quite consistent with thefifth amendment .

miranda gives the defendant a right to choose between speech and silence , andbarrett chose to speak. .

 ( 129 ) inasmuch as barrettrefused to provide a written statement but would talkto the police , the court said he only invoked a limited right to counsel .

 ( 130 ) the court further statedthat "... barrett made clear his intentions," he invoked his right to have counsel present during awritten statement , but waived his right to have counsel present while speaking with the authorities .

 ( 131 ) in 1988 , the court in arizona v. roberson , ( 132 ) provided what appears to be its current approachto the issue of ambiguous request for counsel .

the holding in this case suggests that the approachtaken in edwards v. arizona ( 133 ) rather than michigan v. mosely ( 134 ) governs even when a subsequentinterrogation deals with a different and unrelated crime .

 ( 135 ) in holding that once a suspect invokesthe right to counsel , the police cannot initiate questioning , although the officers were not aware ofthe previous invocation ( 136 ) or if the questioningrelates to another crime , ( 137 ) the court's objectivewasto protect the suspect's right to counsel .

 ( 138 ) in 1990 , in minnick v. mississippi , ( 139 ) the court clarified the "available to him" language in edwards which means "... that when counsel is requested , interrogation must cease , and officialsmay not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present , whether or not the accused has consultedwith his attorney. .

 ( 140 ) in 1994 , the court held in davis v. united states , ( 141 ) that the privilege against furtherquestioning does not extend to a suspect whose request for counsel is ambiguous .

 ( 142 ) before davis , the court had not decided what police officers should do when the initial request for an attorney is ambiguous .

 ( 143 ) the lowercourts developed and followed one of threeapproaches .

 ( 144 ) regarding thethreshold - of - clarity standard , "... an attempted invocation of the rightto counsel [would have to] satisfy a certain threshold of clarity before it [could] be consideredeffective. .

 ( 145 ) the other standard , was the" per se invocation standard. .

 ( 146 ) under this standard , eachpost - warning reference to an attorney by the suspect was considered a per se invocation of the rightto counsel , and any questioning initiated by the police had to cease .

 ( 147 ) the third approach was theclarification standard .

 ( 148 ) here , the courtspermitted the police to pursue the interrogation for thepurpose of clarifying the accused's intent following an ambiguous invocation of the right tocounsel .

 ( 149 ) 2 .

the miranda rules ( non - constitutional status ) .

although the miranda rules appear to be inflexible and unyielding , neither the court nor the lower courts appear to have applied a strict approach in their application .

while compliance with miranda is constitutionally required under all circumstances , the court stated in michigan v.tucker ( 150 ) that: "the [ miranda decision] recognized that these procedural safeguards were not themselves rights protected by the constitution but were insteadmeasures to insure that the right against compulsory self - incrimination was protected .

... thesuggested safeguards were not intended to 'create a constitutional straightjacket,' ... but rather toprovide practical reinforcement for the right against compulsory self - incrimination. .

 ( 151 ) miranda tucker miranda ( 152 ) tucker miranda miranda in new york v. quarles , ( 153 ) police officers were approached by a woman who informed themthat she had been raped by an armed man , who had gone into a nearby supermarket .

the policelocated the suspect in the supermarket where they arrested him ; a frisk uncovered an empty shoulderholster , and the arresting officer asked him , "where is the gun ? .

the suspect gestured toward astack of soap cartons and said , "the gun is over there," and the police found the revolver behind thecartons .

the state courts excluded quarles' response identifying the location of the gun he haddiscarded because he had not been given the miranda warnings .

 ( 154 ) the court reversed andconcluded that "... on these facts there is a 'public safety' exception to the requirement that miranda warnings be given ...." ( 155 ) similar to michigan v. tucker , the court rejected the notion that the lackof miranda warnings implied that a violation of the fifth amendment had occurred .

 ( 156 ) the courtdescribed miranda as a majority which was willing to impose procedural safeguards "... when theprimary social cost of those added protections is the possibility of fewer convictions," which shouldbe distinguished from the quarles case whereby the harm would be the incapability "... to insure thatfurther danger to the public did not result from the concealment of the gun in a public area. .

 ( 157 ) thusthe court concluded "... that the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to thepublic safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the fifth amendment'sprivilege against self - incrimination. .

 ( 158 ) tohold otherwise , the court in quarles said police officerswould be "... in the untenable position of having to consider , often in a matter of seconds , whetherit best serves society for them to ask the necessary questions without the miranda warnings andrender whatever probative evidence they uncover inadmissible , or for them to give the warnings inorder to preserve the admissibility of evidence they might uncover but possibly damage or destroytheir ability to obtain that and neutralize the volatile situation confronting them. .

 ( 159 ) in oregon v. elstad , ( 160 ) the court rejected the narrow interpretation of the tucker case and heldthat tucker's "... reasoning applies with equal force when the alleged 'fruit' of a noncoercive miranda violation is neither a witness nor an article of evidence but the accused's own voluntarytestimony. .

 ( 161 ) in arriving at this conclusion,the court once more rejected the concept that aviolation of miranda necessarily involves a violation of the fifth amendment .

 ( 162 ) as in michigan v. tucker , the court in new york v. quarles rejected the contention that theabsence of warnings implied that compulsion in violation of the fifth amendment had taken place .

hence , these cases suggest that circumstances may exist such as "public safety" which may justifyan exception or repudiation of the doctrinal basis of the miranda decision .

3 .

pretrial silence .

in harris v. new york , ( 163 ) the defendant upon direct examination denied having made thecharged sale of heroin to the undercover agent .

he countered the officer's testimony as to the salewith testimony that he had sold the officer what appeared to be heroin , but the bags contained onlybaking powder .

the prosecutor was allowed to impeach the defendant's credibility by referring toa statement made by him to the police which concededly made that statement inadmissible under miranda .

the court held that the pretrial statements obtained in violation of miranda canbe usedat trial for impeachment regardless of the contrary dictum in the miranda case .

 ( 164 ) this raised theissue of whether a defendant's silence during custodial interrogation can be used for impeachmentpurposes , in view of the dictum in miranda ( 165 ) advancing the concept that the prosecution cannot usethis silence at trial .

in doyle v. ohio , ( 166 ) the court held that impeachment by the defendant's post - arrest silence afterhe had received the miranda warnings was impermissible .

the court said not only is "... everypost - arrest silence ... insolubly ambiguous because [it] ... may be nothing more than the arrestee'sexercise of [his / her] miranda rights," ( 167 ) but also , use of the silence to impeach "... would befundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process...." considering the fact that the warnings carrythe implicit "... assurance that silence will carry no penalty ...." ( 168 ) the court distinguished doyle v. ohio in three subsequent cases .

in anderson v. charles , ( 169 ) the court allowed impeachment by prior inconsistent statements which were given after the miranda warnings .

the court said , doyle bars the use against a criminal defendant of his silence after receiptof governmental assurances that he will suffer no adverse consequences of any sort for remainingsilent .

 ( 170 ) however , "... doyle doesnot apply to cross - examination that merely inquires into priorinconsistent statements. .

 ( 171 ) this "questioning[process] makes no unfair use of silence , because adefendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving miranda warnings has not been induced to remainsilent. .

 ( 172 ) in jenkins v. anderson , ( 173 ) where at his murder trial , the defendant claimed self defense , thecourt decided that it was permissible to impeach that story by the defendant's prearrest silence innot reporting the murder to the police for at least two weeks .

likewise , in fletcher v. weir , ( 174 ) thecourt followed the rationale of jenkins and made a distinction between doyle in allowingimpeachment by the use of post - arrest silence which was not proceeded by miranda warnings,reasoning that this was not "... a case where the government had induced silence by implicitlyassuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him. .

 ( 175 ) in effect , the court heldthat the silence of a suspect in custody prior to his receipt of miranda warnings can be admitted forimpeachment based upon the following reasoning: "the significant difference between the present case and doyle is that the record does not indicate that respondent weir received any miranda warningsduring the period in which he remained silent immediately after hisarrest.... ( 176 ) in jenkins , as in other post - doyle cases , we haveconsistently explained doyle as a case where the government had induced silence by implicitlyassuring the defendant that his silence would not be used againsthim.... ( 177 ) in the absence of the sort of affirmative assurancesembodied in the miranda warnings , we do not believe that it violates due process of law for a stateto permit cross - examination as to postarrest silence when a defendant chooses to take thestand. .

 ( 178 ) .

18 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 3501 ( 179 ) was meant to overrulethe exclusion of voluntary confessions due to thecourt's ruling in mcnabb v. united states , ( 180 ) and mallory v. united states .

 ( 181 ) the senate judiciarycommittee conducted extensive hearings on the effect of the court's rulings in mcnabb and mallory on crime and concluded that they constituted the basis for "[t]he rigid , mechanicalexclusion of an otherwise voluntary and competent confession [and it] is a very high price to pay fora 'constable's blunder'. .

 ( 182 ) the rationale of 18 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 3501 was stated as follows in the senate committee report: [c]rime will not be effectively abated so long as criminals who have voluntarily confessed their crimes are released on mere technicalities .

thetraditional right of the people to have their prosecuting attorneys place in evidence before juries thevoluntary confessions and incriminating statements made by defendants simply must berestored .

 ( 183 ) the case of escobedo v. illinois ... set the stage for another most disastrous blow to the cause of law enforcement... .

this case... formed the basis for... miranda v. arizona .. .

in miranda , the supreme court held that an otherwise voluntaryconfession... could not be used in evidence unless a fourfold warning had beengiven.... ( 184 ) the committee is convinced ... that the rigid and inflexible requirements of the majority opinion in the miranda case are unreasonable , unrealistic,and extremely harmful to law enforcement .

.. .

the unsoundness of the majority opinion wasforcefully shown by the four dissenting justices , who also predicted the dire consequences ofoverruling what theretofore had been the law of the land.... ( 185 ) [the miranda ] decision was an abrupt departure from precedent extending back at least to the earliest days of the republic .

up to the time of the renditionof this 5-to - 4 opinion , the "totality of circumstances" had been the test in our state and federalcourts in determining the admissibility of incriminating statements.... mr. justice white's dissent...demonstrates beyond question that ... warnings as to constitutional rights were not required by theconstitution , and that the sole test of admissibility should be "totality of circumstances" as bearingon voluntariness .

 ( 186 ) the committee is of the view that the [proposed] legislation ... would be an effective way of protecting the rights of the individual and would promoteefficient enforcement of our criminal laws .

by the express provisions the proposed legislation thetrial judge must take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances in determining the issueof voluntariness , including specifically enumerated factors which historically enter into such adetermination .

whether or not the arrested person was informed of or knew his rights beforequestioning is but one of the factors .

 ( 187 ) the committee is aware that a few have expressed the view that legislation by congress restoring the voluntariness test to the admissibility of confessionsand incriminating statements would be declared unconstitutional , on the ground that the provisionsdo not measure up to the rigid standards set forth in miranda .

the committee is also aware that theopinions of the four dissenting justices clearly indicate that neither of them would consider theseprovisions unconstitutional .

 ( 188 ) the committee feels that it is obvious from the opinion of justice harlan and other dissenting justices... that the overwhelming weight of judicial opinionin this country is that the voluntariness test does not offend the constitution or deprive a defendantof any constitutional right .

no one can predict with any assurance what the supreme court mightat some future date decide if these provisions are enacted .

the committee has concluded that thisapproach to the balancing of the rights of society and the rights of the individual served us well overthe years , that it is constitutional and that congress should adopt it , after all , the miranda decisionitself was by a bare majority of one , and with increasing frequency the supreme court has reverseditself .

the committee feels that by the time the issue of constitutionality would reach the supremecourt , the probability rather is that this legislation would beupheld .

 ( 189 ) by replacing the mcnabb / mallory rule , congress did not completely eliminate the exclusion of confessions obtained during a delay in presentment .

instead , congress provided for a six - hourperiod in which the confession must be made or given following the arrest or other detention .

 ( 190 ) confessions which have been obtained up to six hours after arrest and before presentment are notto be considered inadmissible by a delay in presentment .

 ( 191 ) it should also be noted that whencongress enacted the statute , it did not intend for every confession made after the six - hour periodto be inadmissible .

 ( 192 ) therefore , it wouldappear that 18 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 3501 ( c ) has in effect rejected the mcnabb / mallory rule for confessions obtained within six hours of arrest or detention .

however , thiswill not be definitively determined until a case comes before the court which involves a confessionmade more than six hours after arrest during a delay in presentment .

in addition to the mcnabb and mallory line of decisions which subsection ( c ) overrules , section3501 also stemmed from congressional reaction to miranda .

 ( 193 ) it was stated that "[t]he legislationwas designed to overrule miranda v. arizona and certain other decisions that were perceived to bedetrimental to law enforcement. .

 ( 194 ) the senatereport provided that "... crime will not beeffectively abated so long as criminals who have voluntarily confessed their crimes are released onmere technicalities. .

 ( 195 ) it also viewed therequirements of miranda as "... rigid and inflexiblerequirements [and they were] unreasonable , unrealistic , and extremely harmful to lawenforcement. .

 ( 196 ) not only was there tension between congress and the court over the miranda decision , there was also the lack of a warm reception for section 3501 , following its enactment , by the incumbentadministration .

upon signing the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 , presidentjohnson indicated in his statement that he did not believe section 3501 was constitutional as it wasintended and stated that it was ambiguous .

 ( 197 ) excerpts from his signing statement are as follows: "title ii of the legislation deals with certain rules of evidence only in federal criminaltrials - - which account for only 7 percent of the criminal felony prosecutions in this country .

theprovisions of title ii , vague and ambiguous as they are , can , i am advised by the attorney general,be interpreted in harmony with the constitution and federal practices in this field will continue toconform to the constitution .

under long - standing policies , for example , the federal bureau of investigation and other federal law enforcement agencies have consistently given suspectsfull and fair warning of their constitutional rights .

i have asked the attorney general and thedirector of the federal bureau of investigation to assure that these policies willcontinue. .

 ( 198 ) pursuant to this directive , the attorney general informed the u.s .

attorneys to submit for evidence only those confessions which complied with miranda .

 ( 199 ) as a result of the effect whichsection 3501 had on the administration , this probably provided the basis for it not being usedimmediately following its enactment .

 ( 200 ) in united states v. leong , ( 201 ) the department of justice , in response to an order from the u.s.court of appeals for the 4th circuit , ( 202 ) directing it to state its views regarding the effect of 18 u.s.c.ï¿½3501 on the admissibility of leong's confession , its constitutionality , and its possible effects on miranda , ( 203 ) said that miranda is the law and it would not be appropriate for a lower court to applythe statute in lieu of miranda's requirements without the supreme court first reconsidering miranda .

 ( 204 ) the department alsosaid that "[t]he supreme court ... is the final authority on thescope and interpretation of constitutional provisions , and when ... the court has announced aconstitutional rule based on its authority to explicate the constitution , the executive cannot properlyurge lower courts to disregard that rule in favor of a contrary rule established by congress .

 ( 205 ) two years after leong , the same court in united states v. dickerson ( 206 ) decided that a confessionis voluntary under the criteria set forth in 18 u.s.c .

ï¿½3501 and it is admissible in evidence in federalcriminal trials even if the requirements of miranda are not satisfied .

in the 2-1 ruling , the paneldecided that the statute superseded the landmark ruling in miranda .

the fourth circuit identifiedthe principal issue as whether the miranda warnings are required by the fifth amendment .

if theyare not according to the panel , they would be more like federal rules of evidence or "prophylactic"warnings which are not protected by the constitution for which congress can modify or eliminateas it sees fit .

 ( 207 ) if on the other hand , the fifthamendment mandates the warnings , congress can'tmodify it through the enactment of 18 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 3501 .

the panel held that miranda is a rule of law,and not an explicit constitutional requirement that defendants be told of their right to counsel andto remain silent .

 ( 208 ) it also decided that section3501 was enacted under congress' "... legislativeauthority ... to prescribe the rules of procedure and evidence in the federal courts. .

 ( 209 ) the fourthcircuit , sitting en banc , could vacate the panel's decision or it may be appealed to the supremecourt .

until such time , federal law enforcement officials in the fourth circuit who fail to advisedefendants of their miranda rights may still be able to use their voluntary statements .

state officials,however , remain bound by miranda , because the statute only applies to federal prosecutions .

on december 6 , 1999 , the supreme court granted certiorari in dickerson v. united states .

 ( 210 ) although the justice department prosecuted dickerson , it took his side in the case despite oppositionfrom federal prosecutors around the nation .

in urging the court to hear the case , attorney generaljanet reno and solicitor general seth waxman recommended that the court reaffirm miranda forthe sake of precedent and public confidence in the fairness of the legal system .

 ( 211 ) on june 26 , 2000,the supreme court , in a 7-2 ruling , said in dickerson v united states ( 212 ) that the police are stillrequired to give the miranda warnings .

the court said that the miranda warnings are morethanprophylactic ; the decision in itself represents rights which are protected from unwarrantedinterrogation under the fifth amendment in state and federal courts .

 ( 213 ) writing for the court , chiefjustice rehnquist stated that " miranda announced a constitutional rule that congress may notsupersede legislatively" ( 214 ) by enacting a longignored 1968 law know as section 3501 .

in conformitywith the rule of stare decisis , the court said "we decline to overrule miranda...." ( 215 ) justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas dissented .

writing for the two , justice scalia stated that the decision "... converts miranda from a milestone of judicial overreaching into ... [one]of judicial arrogance. .

 ( 216 ) .

since the fifth amendment right against self - incrimination did not apply to the states until1964 , ( 257 ) its relevance to the admissibility ofpretrial statements was limited to federal proceedings .

in the earliest cases , beginning in the late nineteenth century , issues of admissibility were decidedon the basis of the rule excluding involuntary confessions .

during the early 1940s to the late 1950s,these issues were viewed in terms of an exclusionary rule that the court created to enforce therequirements of federal statutory law that the accused be brought promptly before a magistrate .

the inapplicability of the fifth amendment to the states prior to 1964 did not mean that the interrogation process was free of federal judicial scrutiny .

those coercive practices that wereconsidered extreme were held to be inadmissible pursuant to the fourteenth amendment due processclause .

the germinal case , brown v. mississippi , in which the court overturned a murder convictionbased upon a confession that had been obtained through torture ( hanging and whipping ) wasconsidered a violation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause .

in the area of police procedures , two decisions had a very close and significant relationship to the miranda decision ( massiah v. united states and escobedo v. illinois ) .

the massiah decisionwas notable for the extension of the right to counsel to police interrogation .

the escobedo case,while grounded upon the sixth amendment right to counsel , spoke without reservation of "the rightof the accused to be advised by his lawyer of his privilege against self - incrimination. .

two of the most famous elements of miranda are the court's creation of a per se right toconsult with counsel during interrogation , and its creation of a per se right to be informed that theprivilege applies at the police station .

the third most famous element of miranda is the court'sdetermination that "prophylactic" rules are necessary to reduce the inherent coercion which isprevalent in a majority of the custodial interrogations .

since the miranda decision set forth the right to counsel in 1966 , the court had not defined with sufficient clarity what was required in order to invoke the right to counsel .

the lower courtshave adopted one of three approaches: the threshold - of - clarity standard , the " per se invocationstandard," and the clarification standard .

 ( 258 ) when the court addressed the issue in davis v. unitedstates , many observers were surprised when it chose the clarification standard which allowed thepolice to ignore an ambiguous request for counsel and continue their interrogation .

section 3501 of 18 u.s.c .

was enacted as a result of the congressional reaction to miranda .

the legislation was designed to overrule miranda and certain other decisions that were perceivedto be detrimental to law enforcement .

the court's decision in michigan v. tucker appeared to declare that the miranda safeguardsare no longer viewed as rights protected by the constitution ; they were considered as court imposedprocedural rules .

in view of the court's decisions in dickerson v. united states , which held that miranda announced a constitutional rule that congress may not supersede legislatively nor may"strategists" drain the substance out of the warnings by training instructors , ( 259 ) the miranda warningsappeared to be stronger than at any time in their controversial history .

however , considering thedecisions in the four cases ( seibert , patane , fellers , and alvarado ) which were decided during the2003-2004 term of the court ( with two favoring law enforcement and the other two placingadditional restrictions on the police ) , it is difficult to determine what the current limits are withregards to the guarantees under the miranda decision .
