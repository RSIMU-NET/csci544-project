this report describes the president's proposal for fy2007 appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs , as submitted to congress on february 6 , 2006 , and the congressional response to that proposal .

it compares the president's fy2007 request to the fy2006 l - hhs - ed amounts .

it tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the l - hhs - ed appropriations bill , with particular attention paid to discretionary programs .

however , the report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory l - hhs - ed programs — such as medicare or social security — nor does it follow any authorizing legislation that may be needed prior to funding some of the president's budget initiatives .

for a glossary of budget terms and relevant websites , see appendix a , "terminology and web resources. .

for funding sources for l - hhs - ed agencies , see appendix b , "context of l - hhs - ed appropriations. .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills , not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion , stem cell research , and human cloning .

this bill provides discretionary funds for three federal departments and 14 related agencies including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

among the various appropriations bills , l - hhs - ed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs ; the department of defense ( dod ) bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs .

according to the budget of the united states government fiscal year 2007 , table s - 4 , the fy2006 l - hhs - ed bill accounted for $141.8 billion ( 16.8% ) and the dod bill accounted for $399.2 billion ( 47.3% ) of the estimated $843.3 billion total for all federal discretionary budget authority in fy2006 , excluding supplemental and emergency funding .

context of l - hhs - ed appropriations budget authority for all federal programs was estimated at $2,757.8 billion for fy2006 .

budget authority for all l - hhs - ed departments and related agencies was estimated at $1,413.8 billion , or slightly more than half — 51.3% — of the federal total .

table b - 1 shows budget authority by agency for l - hhs - ed agencies ; table b - 2 shows sources of budget authority for l - hhs - ed agencies , as discussed below .

the l - hhs - ed appropriations subcommittees generally had effective control over only the $147.2 billion in fy2006 current year discretionary funds ( 10.4% of the l - hhs - ed agency total , 5.3% of the federal total ) , as indicated in table b - 2 .

what accounts for the remaining $1,266.6 billion of l - hhs - ed agency funds ( 89.6% of the l - hhs - ed agency total , 45.9% of the federal total ) ? .

first , entitlements and other mandatory programs account for three - quarters of the l - hhs - ed bill total — $460.3 billion ( 32.6% of the l - hhs - ed agency total , 16.7% of the federal total ) .

appropriations are enacted for these mandatory activities annually — they are sometimes called "appropriated entitlements" — but the amounts provided generally must be sufficient to cover entitlements to beneficiaries and other mandatory obligations .

federal administrative costs for these programs are , however , subject to annual discretionary appropriations .

the major l - hhs - ed programs in this category include supplemental security income , black lung disability payments , foster care and adoption , the social services block grant , vocational rehabilitation , and general fund support for medicare and medicaid .

second , other appropriations bills account for a small portion of l - hhs - ed agency funding — $4.7 billion ( 0.3% of the l - hhs - ed agency total , 0.2% of the federal total ) .

two hhs agencies are fully funded through other appropriations bills , and two hhs programs are partially funded by bills other than l - hhs - ed , as described below .

prior to fy2006 , the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) was partially funded outside of the l - hhs - ed bill .

the hhs food and drug administration ( fda ) is funded by agriculture appropriations ( $1.5 billion in fy2006 ) .

the hhs indian health service ( ihs ) is funded by interior appropriations ( $3.0 billion in fy2006 ) .

the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) is primarily funded under l - hhs - ed ( $6.1 billion in fy2006 ) ; it also receives funds from interior appropriations for the agency for toxic substances and disease registry ( atsdr ) ( $75 million in fy2006 ) .

the national institutes of health ( nih ) is primarily funded under l - hhs - ed ( $28.3 billion in fy2006 ) ; it also receives funds from interior appropriations for the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) ( $79 million in fy2006 ) .

third , remaining l - hhs - ed agency funds are provided without additional legislative action and provided automatically outside of the annual appropriations process — $801.6 billion ( 56.7% of the l - hhs - ed agency total , 29.1% of the federal total ) .

these funds are provided through trust funds and other mandatory authorities .

the major l - hhs - ed programs in this category include unemployment compensation , medicare , railroad retirement , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf , the welfare assistance program ) , student loans , state children's health insurance , and social security benefits .

funding levels for these programs , as well as for the appropriated entitlements discussed above , generally are not changed through appropriations committees or legislation .

rather , funding is modified by amending authorization statutes ; such changes typically are made through authorizing committees and the budget reconciliation process .
