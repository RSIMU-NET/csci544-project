logcap was established by the u.s. army on december 6 , 1985 , with the publication of army regulation 700-137 .

logcap is an initiative to manage the use of civilian contractors who perform services in support of dod missions during times of war and other military mobilizations .

the use of logcap contracts augments combat support and combat service support to military forces .

in september 2006 the army sustainment command ( asc ) was created to serve as the "logistics integrator" for the contingency contracting and sustainment needs of the military worldwide .

asc oversees about 65,000 contractors and manages about $25 billion in contracts .

the defense contract management agency ( dcma ) manages the task orders issued under the logcap contract .

in a may 2009 hearing before the senate commission on wartime contracting , the executive director for the u.s. army contracting command , army material command , testified on the status of the logcap iv contract .

excerpts of his remarks appear below: eight task orders have been awarded to date , including five task orders for performance and three task orders for project management offices ( one for each contractor ) .

services are transitioned from logcap iii to logcap iv as task orders are awarded .

in addition to protests against the award of the basic contracts , nearly all the task orders issued or awarded to date under logcap iv have been protested .

in testimony before the senate homeland security and governmental affairs subcommittee , u.s. army officials discussed the status of combat support operations under the logcap program , as described in excerpts taken from the hearing transcript: all logcap requirements in kuwait have successfully transitioned from logcap iii to logcap iv and logcap requirements are in the process of transitioning in afghanistan .

the current logcap iii contractor supports the responsible drawdown in iraq through base closure and de - scoping of logcap services which began in may 2009 and continues through august 2010 .

the two contractors that were awarded the logcap iv afghanistan task orders , fluor and dyncorp will increase their support as troops transition to the afghanistan theater .

the competitively bid pricing matrixes for the afghanistan task orders will be used to adjust the cost estimate for the increased support associated with the president's decision .

we are currently conducting a fair opportunity competition for transportation and corps logistics support services requirements in iraq that will result in requirements transitioning from logcap iii to logcap iv .

the next anticipated action involves base life support .

we are in the presolicitation phase for that acquisition with a draft request for proposal issued the week of december 7 , 2009 .

the army anticipates that the logcap iii contractor will provide logistics services in support of the iraq drawdown with theater transportation assets , augmentation of maintenance services , and support for the supply support activities in the retrograde of supplies and equipment from theater .

the logcap iii contractor also possesses other capabilities in support of the responsible drawdown of forces , such as packaging , blocking , bracing , and crating of equipment for shipment , wash rack operations , and cleaning of equipment for agriculture and customs .

these services are available to the supported unit upon request .

we expect the logcap iv contractor to provide the same level of services in support of the responsible drawdown but only for those bases that will remain after august 2010 .

as of march 29 , 2010 , 12 task orders have been awarded under logcap iv , as revealed in recent testimony before the senate commission on wartime contracting in iraq and afghanistan: twelve task orders have been awarded to date , including nine task orders for performance and three task orders for project management offices ( one for each contractor. ) .

to date , $1.8 billion has been obligated under the logcap iv contracts .

with inclusion of the core logistics support , theater transportation , and postal operations services ( cpt ) , 76 percent of logcap work has been competitively awarded under logcap iv .

services are transitioned from logcap iii to logcap iv as task orders are awarded .

potential contract oversight issues that congress may choose to examine include various aspects of contract administration , such as contract costs ; development of contract requirements ; costs - reimbursement and sole - source contracts ; transparency ; and the size , shape , and skill diversity of the acquisition workforce .

congress may choose to consider the following options when examining dod contracts for troop support: ( 1 ) implementing of the gansler commission's recommendations ; ( 2 ) broadening of the jurisdiction of the sigir to include dod contracts for troop support services ( like logcap contracts ) ; ( 3 ) convening of a study of the federal employee and contractor workforce ; ( 4 ) requiring more detail to give congress better information to perform its oversight role ; and ( 5 ) establishing a dedicated office to conduct audits and investigation of dod contracts .

perhaps the most significant recommendation of the gansler commission is that the army address some institutional and cultural issues that may provide an obstacle to moving forward .

the commission interviewed a number of knowledgeable army officials and concluded with the following observations about the challenges that the army will face in making significant improvements in its business operations , as described here in the report: those charged with getting the job done have provided valuable insight into the doctrine , policies , tools , and resources needed for success .

clearly , the army must address the repeated and alarming testimony that detailed the failure of the institution ( both the institutional army and the department of defense ) to anticipate , plan for , adapt , and adjust acquisition and program management to the needs of the operational army as it has been transformed , since the end of the cold war , into an expeditionary force .

the institutional army has not adjusted to the challenges of providing timely , efficient , and effective contracting support to the force in operation iraqi freedom ( more than half of which is contractor personnel ) .

essentially , the army sent a skeleton contracting force into theater without the tools or resources necessary to adequately support our war fighters .

the personnel placed in that untenable position focused on getting the job done , as best they could under the circumstances â€” where support is needed in a matter of hours , or , at best , days .

they used their knowledge , skill , limited resources , and extraordinary dedication to get contracts awarded .

alarmingly , most of the institutional deficiencies remain four - and - a - half - years after the world's best army rolled triumphantly into baghdad .

another option is to give the sigir the authority to audit and investigate dod logistical support contracts in iraq .

the sigir has already established a presence in iraq , and has issued more than 150 reports , including audits and investigations .

his efforts have largely resulted in the arrest of five people , and the convictions of four of them , with more than $17 million in assets seized .

the sigir has made several recommendations related to his audit and investigation of contracts under his jurisdiction .

his observations and insights may be relevant and appropriate for the contract administration and oversight of dod contracts for troop support services .

congress may want to convene a study of the federal employee and contractor workforce .

the study could examine three important questions: ( 1 ) is there an appropriate balance of federal employee and contractor roles ? .

 ( 2 ) is there an appropriate federal role and presence in the oversight area ? .

and ( 3 ) is the federal government attracting the right types of acquisition professionals ? .

congress could require a separate report , from each military service , on the size , scope , costs , and structure of its acquisition workforce ( including military , civilian , and contractor personnel ) .

congress could require dod to provide more details for better congressional oversight .

there are five questions that congress could consider: ( 1 ) should dod move to limit sole - source or limited competition for iraq contracts ? .

 ( 2 ) should dod use more fixed - priced contracting in iraq ? .

 ( 3 ) should task and delivery orders have certain dollar constraints ? .

 ( 4 ) should task orders be subject to public notice ? .

and ( 5 ) should larger contracts be divided into smaller contracts , with better - defined , discrete tasks ? .

to create more transparency and openness in defense acquisitions regarding contract administration , costs , and performance , congress could require a separate report from each military service .

each report could include data on the size , scope , costs , and structure of all contracts , particularly no - bid , sole - source , and costs - reimbursement contracts .

congress also could require that specific criteria be met before certain contract arrangements can be approved by dod or by congress .

in addition , congress could require a periodic re - competition of certain types of contracts , like logcap , that have the potential of spanning for many years .

congress could also require , for example , that task orders beyond a certain size be treated as a separate contract , and thus subject to competition among multiple contractors .

and finally , congress could require that large defense contracts be subject to competition and that a minimum of three contractors be selected for contracts beyond a certain size .

some have suggested based on available press accounts that some contracts for services in iraq might have been segregated ( into smaller contracts ) and opened for competitive bidding .

financial oversight might be more manageable in administering smaller contracts .

small businesses may have more of an ability to compete for contracts .

one of the recommendations of the sigir is to "designate a single , unified contracting entity to coordinate all contracting in theater. .

one way to accomplish this is to establish a contingency contracting corp ( a dod initiative currently underway is studying the issue ) that will deploy to iraq and establish a standing presence .

however , what additional resources might be necessary in order to provide better contract management and oversight of dod - appropriated funds ? .

given that the mission of the dod inspector general's office is to promote "integrity , accountability , and improvement of department of defense personnel , programs and operations to support the department's mission and to serve the public interest" , should the dod inspector general have a stronger presence in iraq ? .

given the many problems associated with logcap contracts , oversight agencies like the dod ig could have a pivotal role in preventing future contractor waste , fraud , or mismanagement .

congress may want to consider creating a singularly dedicated office for the audit and investigation of dod contracts for troop support services .
