this report provides background on the department of defense ( dod ) acquisition workforce .

specifically , the report addresses the following questions: 1 .

what is the acquisition workforce ? .

2 .

what is the current size of the acquisition workforce ? .

3 .

how has congress sought to improve the acquisition workforce in the past ? .

4 .

what are some potential questions for congress to explore in the area of acquisition workforce management to improve acquisitions ? .

congress and the executive branch have long been frustrated with perceived waste , mismanagement , and fraud in defense acquisitions and have spent significant resources attempting to reform and improve the process .

these frustrations have led to numerous efforts to improve defense acquisitions .

despite these efforts , cost overruns , schedule delays , and performance shortfalls in acquisition programs persist .

a number of analysts have argued that the successive waves of acquisition reform have generally yielded limited results , due in large part to poor management by the acquisition workforce .

in recent years , a renewed consensus seems to have emerged around the importance of improving the acquisition workforce as a critical part of any comprehensive acquisition reform effort .

a 2014 compilation of expert views on acquisition reform published by the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs ( permanent subcommittee on investigations ) identified four themes , two of which deal exclusively with the acquisition workforce: while the experts who participated in this project offered a variety of views , a few common themes emerged ... the subcommittee notes the following 1 .

nearly half of the experts feel that cultural change is required while over two - thirds believe improving incentives for the acquisition workforce is necessary for reform .

2 .

two - thirds of the contributors feel that training and recruiting of the acquisition workforce must be improved .

3 .

nearly half believe that dod needs to attain realistic requirements at the start of a major acquisition program that includes budget - informed decisions .

4 .

more than half of the submissions noted the need for strong accountability and leadership throughout the life - cycle of a weapon system... .

recent legislation has also emphasized the importance of a robust and effective acquisition workforce .

the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2016 included more than 10 provisions specifically geared to the acquisition workforce .

given the current focus on acquisition reform and the role of the workforce in the success of the acquisition system , it is useful to explore exactly who is in ( and who is not in ) this workforce , and recent efforts by congress to improve its performance .

despite recent efforts , many observers believe that dod still faces significant challenges in improving the performance of the workforce responsible for defense acquisitions .

the extent to which dod is successful in improving the workforce may depend , in part , on congressional action .

answering the following questions could help congress determine what , if any , further actions it deems necessary to try to improve the performance of the workforce responsible for acquisitions .

just as the total force of the department of defense consists of active and reserve military , civilian personnel , and contractor support , so too the acquisition workforce relies on active and reserve military , civilian , and contractor personnel to manage acquisitions .

dod instruction 1100.22 , policy and procedures for determining workforce mix , lays out the policies and procedures for determining the appropriate mix of military , civilian , and contractor personnel ( including inherently governmental activities ) .

guidance generally requires the use of cost as a deciding factor in determining the workforce mix and mandates the default use of dod civilian personnel , when consistent with statute and dod regulations .

developing an appropriate workforce mix can be difficult due to budgetary , statutory , and regulatory constraints .

potential oversight questions for congress may include the following: 1 .

what is the appropriate size of the acquisition workforce ? .

2 .

does the acquisition workforce have the right mix of military , civilian , and contractor personnel ? .

3 .

what is the proper role of contractors in supporting program management offices ? .

4 .

what is the proper role and use of hiring and pay flexibilities to recruit and retain qualified acquisition professionals ? .

are the flexibilities achieving the desired results ? .

5 .

in what ways is dau fulfilling , or not fulfilling , the mission and functions that congress established with its creation ? .

6 .

what , if any , gaps in dau's ability to keep its staff and curriculum current with , and adaptive to , ever changing subject specialties could be remedied by amendments to the university's authorizing statute ? .

7 .

are dawia certifications creating a well - qualified , appropriately balanced , and professional workforce ? .

a number of the activities critical to successful acquisitions — such as requirements development and budgeting — are beyond the authority or control of the acquisition workforce .

potential oversight questions for congress may include the following: 1 .

to what extent should efforts to improve acquisitions focus on the training and development of non - acquisition personnel who play critical roles in the acquisition process ? .

2 .

to what extent are the incentives of the acquisition workforce and the broader workforce responsible for successful acquisitions sufficiently aligned ? .

3 .

to what extent are the acquisition - related duties of the non - acquisition workforce sufficiently prioritized as core responsibilities ? .

a 2015 gao report on strategic planning for the acquisition workforce found that , in the absence of an updated workforce strategy , dod may "not be positioned to meet future workforce needs. .

potential oversight questions for congress may include the following: 1 .

to what extent is dod taking a strategic approach to developing and managing the acquisition workforce ? .

2 .

to what extent are the military departments taking a strategic approach to developing and managing the acquisition workforce ? .

3 .

for which acquisition career fields is dod having the most difficulty in recruiting and / or retaining federal employees ? .

4 .

are there any gaps in the appropriate skills , competencies , and experiences of senior acquisition professionals to direct , and exercise oversight of , the work of both defense acquisition personnel and contract acquisition workers , and what activities are underway within dod to remedy any such deficiencies ? .

5 .

to what extent , if any , should the under secretary for at&l have authority over the acquisition workforce ? .
