although party divisions sprang up almost from the first congress , the formally structured party leadership organizations now taken for granted are a relatively modern development .

constitutionally specified leaders , namely the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate , can be identified since the first congress .

other leadership posts , however , were not officially recognized until about the middle of the 19 th century , and some are 20 th century creations .

the following tables identify 15 different party leadership posts beginning with the year when each is generally regarded to have been formally established .

the tables herein present data on service dates , party affiliation , and other information for the following house and senate party leadership posts: house positions 1 .

speakers of the house of representatives , 1789-2017 2 .

house republican floor leaders , 1899-2017 3 .

house democratic floor leaders , 1899-2017 4 .

house democratic whips , 1901-2017 5 .

house republican whips , 1897-2017 6 .

house republican conference chairs , 1863-2017 7 .

house democratic caucus chairs , 1849-2017 senate positions 8 .

presidents pro tempore of the senate , 1789-2017 9 .

deputy presidents pro tempore of the senate , 1977-2017 10 .

permanent acting president pro tempore of the senate , 1964-2017 11 .

senate republican floor leaders , 1919-2017 12 .

senate democratic floor leaders and conference chairs , 1893-2017 13 .

senate republican conference chairs , 1893-2017 14 .

senate democratic whips , 1913-2017 15 .

senate republican whips , 1915-2017 this information reflects the leadership elections and appointments at the start of the 115 th congress .

included for each post are leaders' names , party and state affiliations , and dates and congresses of service .

for most congresses , the report indicates years of service only , except in the tables for the house speaker and the senate president pro tempore , both of which include specific dates of service .

when a member died while holding a leadership office , however , the date of death is included as the end - of - service date ( except in table 13 ) .

in cases where a leadership change occurs during the course of a congress , exact dates of service are indicated where possible .

with respect to length of service , the report includes all instances in which a member held a particular leadership post , regardless of whether the member held the post for the entire congress or only a portion of it .

official congressional documents ( house journal and senate journal , congressional record , and predecessor publications ) can be used to document the tenure of the constitutionally specified leaders ( i.e. , speaker and president pro tempore ) .

the actions of the party organizations in choosing other leaders , such as floor leaders or caucus or conference chairs , frequently went unacknowledged in these sources , however .

in the frequent absence of party caucus records in the latter half of the 19 th century , scholars have had to rely on secondary sources , such as memoirs and correspondence , for evidence of party leadership position - holding .

the concluding portion of this report , " source notes and bibliography ," provides more information about sources and the reliability of leadership lists .

this report relies heavily on primary congressional sources and authoritative documents such as the privately printed biographical directory of the american congress , 1774 to 1996 , and a similar online adaptation , the biographical directory of the united states congress , 1774 to the present .

in addition , over the years , individual members of congress , legislative aides , and scholars have gained limited access to party conference journals .

reliable leadership lists have been compiled from these sources .

where these have been published , they have been used as a source in this report .

this report also relies on secondary sources developed by scholars .

the congressional research service made no attempt to gain access to caucus or conference minutes in collecting data for this report .

inevitably , conflicting interpretations occur in these data , even among sources generally accepted as reliable .

for example , there are disparities on the dates of elections and tenure of senate presidents pro tempore among byrd's history , the 1911 senate document , and gamm and smith's research .

the report attempts to footnote these divergences where they occur .

unless otherwise noted , the following sources were used to compile the tables in this report: berdahl , clarence .
