the department of energy's office of science conducts basic research in six overarching program areas: advanced scientific computing research , basic energy sciences , biological and environmental research , fusion energy sciences , high - energy physics , and nuclear physics .

through primarily these programs , the department of energy was the third - largest federal funder of basic research and the largest federal funder of research in the physical sciences in fy2014 .

this budget and appropriations tracking report describes selected major items from the administration's fy2016 budget request for the science account , which funds the office of science , and tracks legislative action on fy2016 appropriations .

it also provides selected historical funding data .

table 1 shows fy2014 current , fy2015 enacted , and fy2016 requested funding levels ; as well as fy2016 house - passed and senate committee recommended funding levels for office of science programs .

table 2 shows similar data for certain domestic scientific user facilities within the fusion energy sciences program .

these tables will be updated to include senate - passed ( if available ) and final enacted fy2016 appropriations .

for a longer perspective , table 3 provides office of science funding data for fy2010 through the fy2016 request .

figure 1 shows total science funding in current and constant ( fy2015 ) dollars between fy1998 and fy2015 .

these trends do not adjust for policy changes or changes in the character of activities funded under the science line .

table 4 and table 5 summarize authorized funding levels for the office of science under certain proposed , but not yet enacted , reauthorization measures under consideration in the 114th congress .

science appropriations are typically included in annual energy and water development and related agencies appropriations acts .

 ( crs tracks these acts each fiscal year .

see the "appropriations status table" on crs.gov , at http: / / www.crs.gov / pages / appropriationsstatustable.aspx . ) .

science budget requests are published on the office of science website at http: / / science.energy.gov / budget / .

the obama administration has requested $5.340 billion for science in fy2016 , a $272 million ( 5% ) increase over the fy2015 enacted level of $5.068 billion .

by dollar amount , the largest increase in the fy2016 science budget request is for basic energy sciences ( bes ) , which would gain $116 million ( 7% ) .

the largest decrease is for fusion energy sciences ( fes ) , which would decline by $48 million ( - 10% ) .

by percentage , the largest increase among science's research programs would go to advanced scientific computing research ( ascr ) , which would receive $80 million ( 15% ) more in fy2016 .

the house - passed energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act , 2016 ( h.r .

2028 ) would provide $5.100 billion for science in fy2016 .

this amount is $29 million ( 1% ) more than the fy2015 enacted funding level and $240 million ( - 4% ) less than the administration's request .

h.rept .

114-91 ( hereinafter referred to as the "house report" or "house recommendation" ) accompanied h.r .

2028 when it was reported by the house committee on appropriations .

h.rept .

114-91 specifies funding for certain science programs and activities .

by dollar amount , the largest increase ( over fy2015 ) in the house recommendation is for basic energy sciences ( $37 million ) .

the largest percentage increase in the house recommendation is for nuclear physics ( 3% ) .

biological and environmental research would be reduced the most , measured by both amount and percentage change ( - $54 million or - 9% ) .

the white house office of management and budget issued a "statement of administration policy" opposing h.r .

2028 as passed by the house .

funding levels for the office of science were among several factors cited in the statement .

as amended and reported by the senate committee on appropriations , h.r .

2028 would provide $5.144 billion for the science account in fy2016 .

this amount is $73 million ( 1% ) more than the fy2015 enacted funding level , $196 million ( - 4% ) less than the fy2016 administration request , and $44 million ( 1% ) more than the house - passed funding level .

s.rept .

114-54 ( herein referred to as the "senate report" or "senate recommendation" ) accompanied h.r .

2028 when it was reported from the senate committee on appropriations .

s.rept .

114-54 specifies funding for certain science programs and activities .

by dollar amount , the largest increase ( over fy2015 ) in the senate recommendation is for basic energy sciences ( $111 million ) ; by percentage , the largest increase is for advanced scientific computing research ( 15% ) .

the largest decrease — by both amount and percentage — would go to fusion energy sciences ( $197 million , - 42% ) .

the senate appropriations committee recommends u.s. withdrawal from the international fusion energy project known as iter .

the following sections highlight selected fy2016 initiatives , programs , and activities within science research programs , as well as their fy2016 budget and appropriations status .

these sections are not intended to provide a comprehensive view of each account , but rather focus mostly on large changes or on activities emphasized in house and senate appropriations committee reports .

 table 3 shows office of science current dollar appropriations from fy2010 to fy2014 , as well as fy2015 enacted appropriations and the fy2016 request .

the office of science subtotal ( not including transfers from other accounts , or the use or rescission of prior - year balances ) increased by $241 million ( 5% ) between fy2010 and fy2014 .

most of the increase — $222 million or 92% — went to ascr , bes , and fes .

funding for high energy physics was reduced by about - 2% during this period .

appropriations authorizations to the office of science , which were last enacted in the america competes reauthorization act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-358 ) , expired in fy2013 .

members of the 114th congress have introduced measures to reauthorize provisions from p.l .

111-358 , including provisions that authorize appropriations to the office of science .

an analysis of these bills may be found in crs report r43880 , the america competes acts: an overview , by [author name scrubbed] .

table 4 summarizes funding levels for the office of science under selected proposed reauthorization measures from the 114 th congress .

unlike h.r .

1898 and s. 1398 , h.r .

1806 specifies funding levels for major science research programs ( such as ascr and fes ) .

these amounts are included in table 5 , along with fy2015 enacted and fy2016 requested funding levels ( for comparison ) .
