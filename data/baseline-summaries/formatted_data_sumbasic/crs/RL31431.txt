the united states territoriesâamerican samoa , guam , northern mariana islands , and the u. s. virgin islandsâall receive federal funding for their roads and highways .

the territories' treatment under the federal - aid highway program ( fahp ) , however , differs significantly from that of the 50 states and the district of columbia .

after a brief background discussion this report examines the legislative and program history of federal - aid highway assistance to the territories .

it then discusses the funding history of federal highway assistance to the territories since 1970 .

finally the report reviews the overall arguments for and against federal assistance and sets forth related issues and options which may emerge during the upcoming reauthorization of the surface transportation programs .

prior to 1970 most road construction and maintenance was financed and carried out by the territorial governments .

locally levied fuel taxes supported road projects .

the most significant federal involvement in road construction in the territories was limited to the construction of military roads ( especially significant for guam ) and provision of disaster relief .

during the 1960s , rapid growth in population and motor vehicle use led to increasing traffic congestion which in turn led to interest in establishing a federally financed territorial road program .

the federal aid highway act of 1968 ( p.l .

90-495 ) directed the department of transportation ( dot ) to carry out a highway study of guam , american samoa , and the virgin islands .

the report , territorial highway study: guam , american samoa , virgin islands , released january 7 , 1970 , revealed that "concentrations of people and motor vehicles within the compact areas of these island territories produce large volumes of traffic compelled to move over substandard highways at slower speeds and at greater hazard than drivers ordinarily encounter in the states .

traffic growth is currently several times more rapid than the national average. .

the study , however , recommended against any new federal highway grant programs for the three territories .

instead , the report recommended that the territorial governments should themselves finance an expanded highway development program by raising the territorial gasoline tax rates by five cents .

it recommended that additional studies be conducted over the following years in order to develop a suitable highway improvement program for each territory , based on its individual needs .

the report also recommended that dot provide technical guidance for each territorial government .

part of the report authors' reluctance to recommend spending significant amounts of federal funds on territorial roads grew out of the constrained fiscal environment of the time .

the most significant restraint , however , had to do with the nature of the financing of the federal highway trust fund ( htf ) that supports spending on highways in the united states .

the htf is supported by excise tax revenues ( mostly from excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel ) paid by highway users in the states .

the territories , however , do not pay these federal taxes and therefore do not provide revenues to the highway trust fund .

federal funding of transportation projects under the thp has changed over the years in accordance with the relevant provisions of the surface transportation authorization acts discussed in the previous section .

table 1 sets forth the actual amounts distributed to the territories under the thp .

other than the founding year , the years which initiated significant thp funding increases were fy1974 , fy1977 , and fy1992 .

in fy1974 , funding for american samoa doubled and funding for the virgin islands more than doubled .

guam's funding was increased to $5 million for fy1977 which brought guam into parity with the virgin islands .

this rough parity continues to this day .

the drop in funding in fy1983 reflects the shift to â½ % of federal aid primary contract authority and also the impact of thp being made subject to obligation limitation .

the next major increase in funding occurred during fy1992-fy1993 under istea .

by fy1993 the funding for american samoa and the northern marianas had more than tripled ( due in part to the change in the distribution formula in 1993 , mentioned earlier ) .

funding for guam and the virgin islands more than doubled .

under tea - 21 funding for thp has remained at roughly the istea level .

the territories may receive highway funding from sources other than the thp , including the emergency relief program , the high priority projects program , and certain highway safety programs .

the territories are not , however , eligible for federal highway administration discretionary programs .

the eligibility for these programs is limited by statute to the states and the district of columbia , usually with puerto rico as the only exception .

the arguments for and against federal - aid highway assistance to the territories have changed little since the debate of the 1960s that culminated in the founding of the thp .

with the approaching reauthorization of tea - 21 the overall arguments are worth reviewing .

safetea , which was introduced by request on may 14 , 2003 , would make a number of changes to the thp .

section 1808 proposes a number of changes to the various parts of title 23 of the u.s. code that are relevant to the thp .

some of the changes are technical and can be seen as adding clarity to the statute , while other changes have significant program effects .

overall the bill could be seen as broadening the project eligibility for thp road projects .

it does this specifying the eligibility of "collector roads," by allowing the secretary of transportation to apply any federal - aid highway eligibility provision to thp projects , and by allowing thp participation in ferry and ferry facility projects .

the bill also ends the existing prohibition on tolls on territorial roads .

on the other hand the bill does add some limitations including dropping the tea21 eligibility language that made seaports and airports eligible , as well as specifically prohibiting thp spending on local roads and for routine maintenance .

funding for thp is held at the annual tea21 level of $36.4 million for the life of the reauthorization and the federal share is maintained at 100% .

the bill also requires each of the territories to negotiate a new thp agreement with the secretary of transportation within 12 months of enactment .
