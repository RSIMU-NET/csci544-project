the joint federal - state unemployment compensation ( uc ) program , created by the social security act of 1935 , provides unemployment benefits to eligible individuals who become involuntarily unemployed and meet state - established eligibility rules .

federal laws and regulations provide some broad guidelines on uc benefit coverage , eligibility , and benefit determination .

however , state laws determine the specific parameters , resulting in essentially 53 different uc programs .

states administer uc benefits with oversight from the u.s. department of labor ( dol ) .

the main objectives of uc are to ( 1 ) offer workers income maintenance during periods of unemployment due to lack of work , providing partial wage replacement as an entitlement ; ( 2 ) help maintain purchasing power and to stabilize the economy ; and ( 3 ) help prevent dispersal of the employer's trained labor force , skill loss , and the breakdown of labor standards during temporary high levels of unemployment .

the uc program attempts to meet these objectives in a number of ways .

for example , individuals who receive uc are required to register with the employment service and to be able , available and searching for suitable work .

under federal law , all states currently have the option to disqualify individuals for uc benefits if they lost their job because of illegal drug use .

in addition , there has been recent and sustained congressional interest in prohibiting individuals who are engaged in unlawful use of controlled substances ( whether or not such use was the cause of unemployment ) from receiving uc benefits .

in the 112 th congress , states were given the option to require drug testing for uc applicants under specific and limited circumstances .

a portion of these circumstances required that dol issue a rule listing occupations that regularly require drug testing .

on october 4 , 2019 , the new rule was finalized after a previous , promulgated rule was repealed using the congressional review act .

this new final rule is effective november 4 , 2019 .

thus , after this date , nothing in federal uc law would prohibit states from drug testing uc applicants who are searching for employment solely in those occupations listed in this final rule .

the issue of drug testing in the uc program may be viewed in the context of two larger policy trends .

first , some state legislatures have expressed interest in drug testing individuals receiving public assistance benefits .

although uc is generally considered to be social insurance ( rather than public assistance ) , drug testing uc beneficiaries could be interpreted as a potential extension of this state - level interest .

second , there has been sustained congressional interest in uc program integrity generally , and this has included drug testing certain applicants or beneficiaries .

for instance , during the period from 2011 to 2015 congress passed three laws ( p.l .

112-40 , p.l .

112-96 , â andâ  p.l .

113-67 ) that either added or clarified state administrative responsibilities to decrease uc benefit overpayments , and one of those laws ( p.l .

112-96 ) also imposed new restrictions on uc eligibility .

furthermore , p.l .

112-96 clarified that drug testing may be included among uc program integrity measures to ensure that benefits are not distributed to individuals who are involved in illegal drug use , presuming that this behavior may impede prospects for future employment .

this report provides general background on issues related to uc benefits and illegal drug use ; discusses recent developments related to the expansion of uc drug testing under state and federal laws as well as federal regulation ; and analyzes selected policy considerations relevant to uc drug testing , including arguments for and against expanded drug testing , potential legal concerns , and administrative considerations .

dol's current interpretation of federal law requires states to determine uc entitlement based only on facts or causes related to the individual's unemployment status , subject to specific exceptions .

current state laws and regulations that disqualify individuals based upon illegal drug use ( as discussed above ) have been tailored to fit this dol interpretation .

recent federal legislative and regulatory developments , however , have expanded states' authority to prospectively drug test uc applicants and beneficiaries .

these recent developments include the enactment of a federal law permitting two new types of drug testing , the issuance of guidance and regulations to support the implementation of the law , the overturning of these regulations , and the issuing of a new final rule .

in the context of recent legislative and regulatory developments , stakeholders have made a number of arguments in support of and in opposition to expanded uc drug testing .

this section provides a discussion of these arguments , including comments on the proposed 2018 uc drug testing rule , which contribute additional context for this issue .

policymakers may also consider several types of administrative issues raised by expanded uc drug testing , including program establishment , funding considerations , and the provision of drug treatment services .

these are discussed in this section as well .

in addition to the expanded uc drug testing authorized under p.l .

112-96 , recent congresses have considered two alternative approaches to the drug testing of uc applicants and beneficiaries: adding a new federal uc drug testing requirement ( i.e. , rather than a state option to drug test ) or using some type of risk - assessment tool to guide the drug testing of uc claimants .

appendix a provides a discussion of legislation introduced in recent congresses that would have used these alternative approaches to expanding uc drug testing .

none of these bills advanced out of the committees to which they were referred .

stakeholders have also raised at least two legal concerns with dol's 2019 final rule .

first , some commenters have argued that uc drug testing programs implemented in accordance with the final rule may violate the fourth amendment of the u.s. constitution .

second , some commenters argue that the rule improperly delegates authority to the states to identify occupations that regularly conduct drug testing .

these issues are analyzed in turn .

in order for a state to begin actively drug testing individuals applying for uc benefits under the authority provided by p.l .

112-96 and the newly reissued final dol rule required by section 2105 , it must consider several policy issues related to designing , financing , and implementing a program .

states must establish drug testing programsâand , according to dol , three states ( mississippi , texas , and wisconsin ) have already enacted laws to do so .

states may also consider the issue of providing and funding drug treatment services for uc claimants .

states that enact laws to drug test uc applicants under the authority provided them by p.l .

112-96 must establish their own drug testing programs .

according to dol guidance , states may enter into a contract with an entity to conduct the drug tests on behalf of the state .

when conducting tests for illegal use of controlled substances , the state must use a test that meets or exceeds the standards of the mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs , published by the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , or the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) procedures .

tests that do not meet or exceed ( i.e. , have more rigorous standards for sample collection , chain of custody , and other procedural requirements ) samhsa guidelines or dot procedures may not be used to determine an individual's eligibility for uc .

funding for the additional costs associated with dol - approved drug testing programs would come from the same state administrative grants that states use to run their uc programs generally ; states would be prohibited from requiring uc claimants to pay for any drug testing costs .

administrative costs for state uc programs are financed through the federal unemployment tax act ( futa ) , one of two types of payroll taxes on employers .

the 0.6% effective net futa tax paid by employers on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings ( no more than $42 per worker per year ) funds federal and state administrative costs , loans to insolvent state uc accounts , the federal share ( 50% ) of extended benefit ( eb ) payments , and state employment services .

in fy2018 , an estimated $6.3 billion was collected in federal futa taxes , whereas an estimated $37.1 billion was collected in state unemployment tax acts ( suta ) taxes to finance uc benefits .

as discussed above in the section on " arguments against expanded uc drug testing ," some opponents of expanded uc drug testing are concerned about the adequacy of the existing stream of futa revenue for the new administrative function of drug testing uc applicants .

according to dol , three statesâmississippi , texas , and wisconsinâhave enacted laws under the uc drug testing authority provided by p.l .

112-96 .

for summary information on these state laws , see appendix b .

the implementation of these laws is subject to applicable federal law , including the final dol rule required by section 2105 of p.l .

112-96 .

thus , in the absence of a final rule and until the issuance of the new rule , the three states had not implemented their programs .

one of the underlying goals of the uc program is to provide income security after an individual becomes unemployed so that she or he may find suitable work .

at least one state ( wisconsin ) has a program addressing the underlying barriers of illicit drug use preventing work - readiness .

in this program , if an employer voluntarily reports that a claimant failed a pre - employment drug test ( without a valid prescription ) and the claimant has not established that she or he had good cause , the claimant is to be offered the option to attend a drug treatment program and complete a skills assessment .

if the claimant agrees to undergo drug treatment and complete a skills assessment , and does so in the required timeframe , the individual may continue to collect uc benefits .

the wisconsin uc program is to furnish the claimant with referrals and instructions in order to complete the assessment and access treatment directly .

the claimant must also continue to meet all other uc program requirements .

the program includes a budget of $500,000 to fund and administer a statewide substance abuse program .

currently , no funding streams exist within the uc program dedicated to financing drug treatment services .

federal law sets limits on the permissible uses of suta funds .

section 3304 ( a ) ( 4 ) of the internal revenue codeâ  ( irc ) â and section 303 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the ssa set out the "withdrawal standard" for how states may use suta funds deposited within their state account in the unemployment trust fund ( utf ) .

neither section 3304 ( a ) of the irc nor section 303 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the ssa includes drug treatment services as a permissible use of suta funds .

additionally , grants to states for administrative expenses , which are financed by futa revenue , are limited under current law .

section 901 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( a ) of the ssa sets out the authorized uses of these futa funds , which do not include drug treatment services .

nothing in federal uc law , however , prohibits states from using funding from non - futa or non - suta sources to finance drug treatment services for uc claimants .

for instance , many states collect additional taxes for administrative purposes , including job training , employment service administration , or technology improvements .

according to dol , in 2019 there were 30 states with additional taxes for administrative purposes .

it appears that none of these taxes have been collected for the purposes of funding drug treatment services .

appendix a .

additional recent legislative approaches to uc drug testing in addition to the recent statutory and regulatory developments in uc drug testing related to p.l .

112-96 , legislation introduced in recent congresses has proposed using other approaches to drug test uc applicants and beneficiaries .

these approaches have generally either proposed a new federal uc drug testing requirement or some type of risk - assessment tool to guide the drug testing of uc claimants .

new federal requirement to drug test one legislative option would be to add a new federal requirement to drug test uc applicants and beneficiaries .

this type of approach differs from allowing states to expand uc drug testing ( as under p.l .

112-96 ) .

there have been some proposals calling for this approach in recent congresses .

for example , h.r .

2001 ( 112 th congress ) â would have created a new federal requirement that individuals be deemed ineligible for uc benefits based on previous employment from which they were separated due to an employment - related drug or alcohol offense .

this proposal would have required states to amend their state uc laws .

h.r .

1172 â  ( 113 th congress ) also would have created a new federal requirement that individuals be deemed ineligible for uc benefits based on previous employment from which they were separated due to an employment - related drug or alcohol offense .

it would have denied benefits to anyone who ( 1 ) was discharged from employment for alcohol or drug use , ( 2 ) was in possession of controlled substance at a place of employment , ( 3 ) refused the employer's drug test , or ( 4 ) tested positive on the employer's drug test for illegal or controlled substances .

this proposal would have required states to amend their state uc laws .

another proposal , the accountability in unemployment act ( h.r .

3615 in the 112 th congress , h.r .

1277 in the 113 th congress , and h.r .

1136 in the 114 th congress ) ,â would have created a new federal requirement for states to drug test all uc claimants as a condition of benefit eligibility .

under this proposal , if an individual tested positive for certain controlled substances ( in the absence of a valid prescription or other authorization under a state's laws ) , he or she would have been required to retake a drug test after a 30-day period and test negative in order to be eligible for uc benefits .

this proposal would have made individuals ineligible for uc benefits for five years after a third positive drug test .

risk assessment - based drug testing another policy approach toward uc drug testing proposed in recent congresses involves using a substance abuse risk assessment tool to screen uc applicants and beneficiaries and then drug test those individuals determined likely to be engaged in the unlawful use of controlled substances .

in this way , such an approach attempts to avoid suspicionless drug testing .

this type of proposal was introduced in the ensuring quality in the unemployment insurance program ( equip ) act in the 112 th congress ( h.r .

3601 ) , 113 th congress ( h.r .

3454 ) , 114 th congress ( h.r .

2148 ) , 115 th congress ( h.r .

3330 ) , and the 116 th congress ( h.r .

1121 ) .

the equip act would have added a new federal requirement that individuals undergo a substance abuse risk assessment for each benefit year as a condition of eligibility for uc in all states .

this new federal requirement would also have required individuals deemed to be at high risk for substance abuseâbased on the assessment resultsâto test negative for controlled substances within one week after the assessment to qualify for uc benefits .

under this proposal , the screening assessment tool would have had to have been approved by the director of the national institutes of health and been "designed to determine whether an individuals has a high risk of substance abuse. .

appendix b .

enacted state uc laws subsequent to p.l .

112-96 according to dol's 2018 comparison of state unemployment compensation laws , three states have enacted laws under the authority provided by p.l .

112-96 ( with "implementation subject to applicable federal law" ) : mississippi , texas , and wisconsin .

mississippi section 40 of sb2604 , regular session 2012 ( chapter 515 ; signed by governor on may 1 , 2012 ) added drug testing provisions to state uc eligibility requirements under mississippi state law .

this 2012 mississippi law permits drug testing on individuals as a condition of eligibility for benefits if the individual was discharged because of unlawful drug use or if s / he is seeking suitable work only in an occupation that requires drug testing .

individuals may be denied benefits based on the results of these drug tests , but may end the disqualification period early by submitting acceptable proof of a negative drug test from an approved testing facility .

texas in texas , sb21 ( chapter 1141 , enacted july 14 , 2013 ; effective september 1 , 2013 ) added drug testing provisions to state uc eligibility requirements under state law .

this 2013 texas law permits drug testing , as a condition of eligibility of benefits , on individuals for whom suitable work is available only in an occupation that regularly conducts pre - employment drug testing .

wisconsin section 3115 of 2015 wisconsin act 55 ( 2015 senate bill 21 , enacted july 12 , 2015 ) added drug testing provisions to state uc eligibility requirements under wisconsin state law .

this 2015 wisconsin law require[s] the establishment of rules for a drug testing program for controlled substances , including rules identifying occupations for which drug testing is regularly conducted in the state .
