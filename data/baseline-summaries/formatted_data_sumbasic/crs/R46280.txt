the national cemetery administration ( nca ) is responsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries ; providing grants to states for establishing , expanding , or improving state veterans cemeteries ; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons , among other things .

in addition to providing health care services to veterans and certain eligible dependents , the vha is statutorily required to serve as a contingency backup to the department of defense ( dod ) medical system during a national security emergency and to provide support to the national disaster medical system and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) as necessary in response to national crises .

the department is also required to take appropriate actions to ensure va medical centers are prepared to protect veteran patients and staff during a public health emergency .

on december 31 , 2019 , the world health organization ( who ) was informed of a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan city , hubei province of china .

illnesses have since been linked to a disease caused by a previously unidentified strain of coronavirus , designated coronavirus disease 2019 , or covid - 19 .

on january 30 , 2020 , an emergency committee convened by the who director - general declared the covid - 19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) .

on january 31 , the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) declared a public health emergency under section 319 of the public health service act ( 42 u.s.c .

247d ) .

on march 11 , 2020 , the who characterized the covid - 19 outbreak as a pandemic .

two days later , on march 13 , the president declared the covid - 19 outbreak a national emergency , beginning march 1 , 2020 .

the vha plays a significant role in the domestic response to a pandemic .

it is one of the largest integrated direct health care delivery systems in the nation , caring for more than 7.1 million patients in fy2020 and providing 123.8 million outpatient visits at approximately 1,450 va sites of care .

the vha employs a workforce of 337,908 full - time equivalent employees ( ftes ) , largely composed of health care professionals .

in addition , the vha has a statutory mission to contribute to the overall federal emergency response capabilities .

vha's provision of medical care to veterans in response to the covid - 19 outbreak includes implementing mitigation strategies at vha facilities , as well as testing and treating veterans diagnosed with or suspected of having covid - 19 .

 ( a general description of medical care to veterans is provided in other crs reports. ) .

in late february 2020 , va provided information to congressional oversight committees on the number of positive and presumptive positive cases of covid - 19 .

on march 13 , 2020 , the department began publishing this information publicly on its website , which it updates on a regular basis .

the number of positive diagnoses is likely to grow as testing for covid - 19 becomes more widespread .

va has reported on the measures it has taken to contain and mitigate further exposure .

it has issued guidance for patients , implemented mitigation strategies at vha facilities , and begun testing patients who present symptoms consistent with covid - 19 .

veterans experiencing homelessness live in conditions that could make them particularly vulnerable to covid - 19 .

those who are unsheltered lack access to sanitary facilities .

for those sleeping in emergency shelters , conditions may be crowded , with short distances between beds , and there may be limited facilities for washing and keeping clean .

while va itself administers programs to assist veterans experiencing homelessness , there are several grants for nonprofit and public entities to provide housing and services to homeless veterans .

these include the homeless providers grant and per diem program ( transitional housing and services ) , the supportive services for veteran families ( short - to medium - term rental assistance and services ) , and contract residential services ( housing for veterans participating in va's health care for homeless veterans program ) .

va released guidance on march 13 , 2020 , for its grantees that administer programs for veterans who are homeless .

the guidance suggests grantees take a number of actions: develop a response plan , or review an existing plan , and coordinate response planning with local entities , including health departments , local va medical providers , and continuums of care .

plans should address staff health , potential staff shortages , and acquisition of food and other supplies , as well as how to assist veteran clients .

prevent infection through methods recommended by the cdc , such as frequent handwashing , wiping down surfaces , and informing clients about prevention techniques .

in congregate living facilities , such as those provided through va's grant and per diem program , keep beds at least three feet apart ( preferably six , if space permits ) , sleep head - to - toe , or place barriers between beds , if possible .

develop questions to ask clients about their health to determine their needs and how best to serve them .

for new clients , interviews should occur prior to entry into a facility ( such as over the phone ) , if possible , or in a place separate from other clients .

if a client' answers to questions indicate risk of covid - 19 , separate them from other program participants ( have an isolation area , if possible ) , clean surfaces , and reach out to medical professionals .

if isolation is not practical , reach out to other providers who might be able to isolate .

on march 18 , 2020 , the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) announced via facebook and twitter that all regional offices will be closed to the public starting march 19 .

while the regional offices are to remain open to ensure the continuity of benefits , the offices are to no longer accept walk - ins for claims assistance , scheduled appointments , counseling , or other in - person services .

vba is directing veterans who have claims - specific questions or any questions to use the inquiry routing & information system ( iris ) or to call 1-800-827-1000 .

a march 16 , 2020 , government executive news article explained that vba is facing "network operationality" issues after several regional offices told their employees to telework full time .

vba headquarters , in washington , dc , then rescinded the telework directives due to the information technology issues .

vba is to continue performing tests on the network throughout the week .

according to the article , a va spokesperson said that regional office directors are to make decisions on work flexibility based on "the circumstances in their communities" but must discuss all plans with "central office leadership. .

the national cemetery administration ( nca ) has provided limited information for the survivors and dependents of veterans who have passed away and are scheduled to be buried in national cemetery .

as of march 18 , 2020 , nca has provided some guidance for both families and funeral directors regarding interments and services for veterans .

for f amilies and v isitors .

va national cemeteries remain open to visitors and for interments , but visitors should follow their local communities' restrictions on visitations and travel .

for families who prefer to inter now but hold the committal service at a later date , nca says it will work to accommodate those requests .

for families who prefer to have the committal service now , nca asks them to adhere to cdc recommendations for group gatherings .

for f uneral d irectors .

nca is asking funeral directors to follow the cdc guidelines and recommendations on group gatherings for families who proceed with full committal services .

in addition , nca informed organizers that it has discouraged all cemetery personnel from handshaking and any unnecessary physical contact with family members and funeral organizers .

nca is to work with the funeral directors and families to accommodate future committal services for those who decide to postpone .

nca has set up an "alerts" web page for the public to check cemetery operating status and is directing the public to its facebook and twitter pages for the most recent operating information .

in 1982 , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) - department of defense ( dod ) health resources sharing and emergency operations act ( p.l .

97-174 ) was enacted to serve as the primary health care backup to the military health care system during and immediately following an outbreak of war or national emergency .

since then , congress has provided additional authorities to va to "use its vast infrastructure and resources , geographic reach , deployable assets , and health care expertise , to make significant contributions to the federal emergency response effort in times of emergencies and disasters. .

among other authorities , vha may care for nonveterans , as well as veterans not enrolled in the va health care system .

this applies in situations where the president has declared a major disaster or emergency under the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( 42 u.s.c .

â§5121 et seq. ) .

 ( the stafford act ) , or where the hhs secretary has declared a disaster or emergency activating the national disaster medical system established pursuant to section 2811 ( b ) of the public health service act ( 42 u.s.c .

â§300hh - 11 ( b ) ) .

the president's march 13 , 2020 , declaration of a national emergency under section 501 ( b ) of the stafford act allows va to use this authority .

according to va , during declared major disasters and emergencies , service - connected veterans receive the highest priority for va care and services , followed by members of the armed forces receiving care under 38 u.s.c .

section 8111a , and then by individuals affected by a disaster or emergency described in 38 u.s.c .

section 1785 ( i.e. , individuals requiring care during a declared disaster or emergency or during activation of the national disaster medical system [ndms] ) .

in general , care is prioritized based on clinical needâthat is , urgent , life - threating medical conditions are treated before routine medical conditions ( see the appendix ) .

during a disaster or emergency , va can support hhs by providing resources to civilian health care systems .

furthermore , va's national acquisition center can assist with acquisition and logistical support , such as by providing ventilators , medical equipment and supplies , and pharmaceuticals .

generally , if a state , tribal , or territorial government needs resources , they can request assistance from the federal government through their local hhs regional emergency coordinator ( rec ) .

the hhs rec is to then submit a task order to the hhs secretary's operations center ( soc ) to be fulfilled by hhs , va , or another federal agency .

va cannot receive direct requests for assistance from state and local governments .

on march 14 , 2020 , the house passed the families first coronavirus response act ( h.r .

6201 ) .

the senate passed the measure on march 18 , and the president signed it into law the same day as p.l .

116-127 .

the act provides $30 million for vha's medical services account to fund health services and related items pertaining to covid - 19 .

in addition , the act provides $30 million for vha's medical community care account .

these funds are available until september 30 , 2022 .

among other things , the act allows va to waive any copayment or other cost - sharing requirements for covid - 19 testing or medical visits during any period of this public health emergency .

s. 3503 , as passed by the senate on march 16 , 2020 , and then passed by the house on march 19 , 2020 , allows va to continue to provide gi bill benefits from march 1 , 2020 , through december 21 , 2020 , for courses at educational institutions that are converted from in - residence to distance learning by reason of an emergency or health - related situation .

s. 3503 further permits va to pay the post - 9 / 11 gi bill housing allowance as if the courses were not offered through distance learning throughout the same period .

with the exception of those covered under this s. 3503 exemption , post - 9 / 11 gi bill participants enrolled exclusively in distance education are eligible for no more than one - half the national average of the housing allowance .

on march 17 , 2020 , the administration submitted to congress a supplemental appropriations request .

the administration seeks $16.6 billion for fy2020 for va's response to the covid - 19 outbreak .

this includes $13.1 billion for the medical services account .

according to the request , this additional amount would provide funding for "healthcare treatment costs , testing kits , temporary intensive care unit bed conversion and expansion , and personal protective equipment. .

the request also includes $2.1 billion for the medical community care account to provide three months of health care treatment provided in the community in response to covid - 19 .

va assumes that about 20% of care for eligible veterans will be provided in the community , since community care facilities would be at full capacity with nonveteran patients .

furthermore , the request includes $100 million for the medical support and compliance account for the provision of 24-hour emergency management coordination overtime payments ; for costs associated with travel and transport of materials ; and to enable vha' s office of emergency management to manage its response to covid - 19 .

the emergency supplemental appropriations request also includes $175 million for the medical facilities account to upgrade va medical facilities to respond to the virus .

the request also includes $1.2 billion for the information technology systems account to upgrade telehealth and related internet technology to deliver more health care services remotely .
