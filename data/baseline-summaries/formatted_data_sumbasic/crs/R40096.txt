under sections 108-109 of the clean air act ( caa ) , congress mandated that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) set national ambient ( outdoor ) air quality standards ( or naaqs ) for pollutants whose emissions ( 1 ) "may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare" ; and ( 2 ) "the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources. .

the statute further requires that epa review the latest scientific studies and either reaffirm or modify previously established naaqs every five years .

epa has identified and promulgated naaqs for six principal pollutants commonly referred to as "criteria pollutants": particulate matter ( pm ) , ozone ( o 3 , a key measure of smog ) , nitrogen dioxide ( no 2 , or , inclusively , nitrogen oxides , or nox ) , sulfur oxides ( sox , or , specifically , so 2 ) , carbon monoxide ( co ) , and lead ( pb ) .

on october 17 , 2006 , epa published its revisions to the naaqs for particulate matter ( pm ) to provide protection against potential health effects associated with short - and long - term exposure to particulates ( including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality ) .

the 2006 particulates naaqs primarily tightened the pre - existing ( 1997 ) standard for "fine" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ( pm 2.5 ) .

the standard for slightly larger , but still inhalable , particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers ( pm 10 ) established in 1987 was not similarly changed .

establishing naaqs does not directly limit emissions ; rather , it represents the epa administrator's formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution that will protect public health with an adequate margin of safety .

promulgation of naaqs sets in motion a process under which the states and epa first identify geographic nonattainment areas , those areas failing to meet the naaqs based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data .

states then have three years from the date of epa's final designations to submit nonattainment area state implementation plans ( sips ) , which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that will bring an area into compliance .

epa published the final designations for the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs on november 13 , 2009 .

the final designation rule became effective december 14 , 2009 ( 30 days from the date of publication ) .

the epa final designations reflected a change from those announced by the agency in december 22 , 2008 .

the publication of final designations — and thus the effective date of the final designations — had been delayed since january 2009 pending review by the incoming administration .

epa initiated review of several previous agency decisions , including those covered by the white house january 20 , 2009 , memorandum , and the office of management and budget's subsequent january 21 , 2009 , memorandum , on regulatory review .

the 2006 particulates naaqs generated national interest and debate , and oversight in congress .

additionally , several states and industry , agriculture , business , and public advocacy groups petitioned the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , challenging certain aspects of epa's 2006 revisions .

a february 24 , 2009 , decision by the d.c .

circuit granted the petitions in part , denying other challenges , and remanded the standards to epa for further consideration .

while the court did not specifically vacate the 2006 pm standards , and their implementation proceeded , the decision and epa's ongoing actions have prompted renewed interest in pm naaqs among members of congress .

simultaneously with the ongoing implementation of the 2006 pm naaqs , epa initiated its next round of statutorily required periodic review of the pm naaqs not long after the october 2006 promulgation of the standards , in part in response to the d.c .

circuit court's decision .

on january 15 , 2013 , epa published a final rule further revising the pm naaqs .

the january 2013 revisions changed the existing ( 2006 ) annual health - based ( "primary" ) standard for "fine" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ( or pm 2.5 ) , lowering the allowable average concentration of pm 2.5 in the air from the current level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter ( µg / m 3 ) to a limit of 12 µg / m 3 .

the existing primary daily ( 24-hour ) standard for pm 2.5 that was reduced from 65 µg / m 3 to 35 µg / m 3 in 2006 was retained , as was the existing standard for larger , but still inhalable , "coarse" particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter , or pm 10 .

"secondary" standards that provide protection against "welfare" ( non - health ) effects , such as ecological effects and material deterioration , are identical to the primary standards and the same as in 2006 .

the proposed rule regarding the pm naaqs published june 29 , 2012 , solicited comments on two options for a 24-hour pm 2.5 standard to improve visibility that were not adopted in the final rule .

for an overview of the revisions to the pm naaqs published january 15 , 2013 , see crs report r42934 , air quality: epa's 2013 changes to the particulate matter ( pm ) standard , by [author name scrubbed] .

the following sections of this report focus primarily on the naaqs implementation process for designating geographical nonattainment areas with respect to the revisions to the pm 2.5 standards under the 2006 particulates naaqs , including comparisons with the final designations under the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs .

epa did not require new nonattainment designations for pm 10 based on the 2006 revisions to the standard .

also included is a brief overview of states' subsequent obligations for developing and submitting implementation plans ( sips ) for attaining or maintaining compliance with the naaqs .

appendix a contains a comparative time line for implementing the 2006 and 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs .

appendix b provides a state and county breakdown of epa's november 13 , 2009 , final designated nonattainment areas and areas identified by epa on december 22 , 2008 , areas proposed by the states for the 2006 24-hour pm 2.5 naaqs , as well as the final epa nonattainment designations for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs .

appendix c identifies tribes included in epa's final nonattainment designations 2006 24-hour pm 2.5 naaqs .

the clean air act ( caa ) provides for two types of naaqs: primary standards , "the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the [epa] administrator ... are requisite to protect the public health," with "an adequate margin of safety" ; and secondary standards , necessary to protect public welfare , a broad term that includes visibility impairment as well as damage to crops , vegetation , property , building materials , etc .

the primary naaqs include a daily ( 24-hour ) limit for both pm 2.5 and pm 10 , and an annual limit for pm 2.5 ( the previous annual limit for pm 10 was revoked ) .

to attain the annual standard , the three - year average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean pm concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency .

the 24-hour standards are a concentration - based percentile form , indicating the percentage of the time that a monitoring station can exceed the standard .

for example , a 98 th percentile 24-hour standard indicates that a monitoring station can exceed the standard 2% of the days during the year .

for pm 2.5 and pm 10 , the secondary ( welfare ) naaqs are the same as the primary standards .

as modified and published in the october 17 , 2006 , federal register notice , the primary pm 2.5 and pm 10 standards are as follows: pm 2.5 : tightened the daily ( 24-hour ) standard , which had allowed no more than 65 micrograms per cubic meter ( µg / m 3 ) under the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs , by setting a new limit of 35 µg / m 3 , based on the three - year average of the 98 th percentile of 24-hour pm 2.5 concentrations ; retained the annual standard at 15 µg / m 3 .

pm 10 : retained the daily standard at 150 µg / m 3 set in 1987 but changed from the 99 th percentile to no more than one exceedance per year on average over three years ; eliminated the annual maximum concentration ( 50 µg / m 3 ) standard for pm 10 .

as discussed in more detail in the following section , strengthening the daily ( 24-hour ) standard for pm 2.5 had implications for those counties and partial counties designated nonattainment for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs .

with only a few exceptions , most of the designated nonattainment areas for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs were not meeting the annual standard , but were meeting the daily ( 24-hour ) standard .

epa is not requiring new nonattainment designations for pm 10 since the standards were not strengthened .

to the contrary , a number of counties previously designated nonattainment for pm 10 have been determined by epa to be in attainment since the 2006 revisions of the particulates naaqs were promulgated .

designating geographical areas not achieving the established naaqs based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data is a critical step in naaqs implementation .

section 107 ( d ) of the caa ( 42 u.s.c .

7407 ) establishes the process for designating "attainment" and "nonattainment" areas and setting their boundaries , but allows the epa administrator some discretion in determining what the final boundaries of the areas will be .

areas are identified as nonattainment when they violate or contribute to the violation of naaqs .

under the caa , epa sets the nationwide standard for criteria pollutants , and epa and states are responsible for placing limits on emissions that contribute to criteria pollution and for regulating entities emitting criteria pollutants .

within three years of issuance of a naaqs , all states are required to submit "infrastructure" plans demonstrating that they have the basic air quality management components necessary to implement the naaqs .

areas designated attainment / unclassifiable will not have to take steps to improve air quality but under the statute they must take steps to prevent air quality from deteriorating to unhealthy levels .

for those areas designated nonattainment , state , local , and tribal governments must outline detailed control requirements in plans demonstrating how they will meet the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs .

these plans , defined as state implementation plans and referred to as sips ( tips for tribal implementation plans ) , were to be submitted to epa by december 2012 , three years after the effective date of the agency's final designations of december 14 , 2009 .

if states fail to develop an adequate implementation plan , epa can impose one .

under caa , states are required to meet the 2006 pm 2.5 standard "as expeditiously as practicable," but no later than five years from the effective date of designation , which would be december 2014 , unless an extension allowed under the caa is granted .

the designation of geographical areas unable to meet the naaqs is a critical step in naaqs implementation , and historically has been an issue of concern and debate among epa , states and tribes , various stakeholders , and some members of congress .

epa's 2006 revisions of the pm 2.5 standards increased the number of areas ( typically defined by counties or portions of counties ) in nonattainment , and subsequently will potentially result in an encumbrance on states to achieve compliance .

a february 24 , 2009 , decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit did not vacate the 2006 standards but granted petitions in part , denying other challenges , and remanded the standards to epa for further consideration .

although epa and states continue the implementation of the 2006 revised pm 2.5 standards , the epa recently completed the next round of periodic review of the particulates naaqs , and on january 15 , 2013 , epa published a final rule further revising the pm 2.5 standards .

on november 13 , 2009 , epa published its final designations of areas as nonattainment and unclassifiable / attainment for the 2006 24-hour pm 2.5 naaqs .

publication of a final designation rule for the 2006 24-hour pm 2.5 naaqs was delayed pending review by the agency as part of the administration's review of several proposed and final actions introduced toward the end of the previous administration .

delaying publication of the final designation rule resulted in the delay of the expected effective date of april 2009 to december 14 , 2009 ( 30 days from the date of publication ) .

the november 2009 final designations , based on more current monitoring data ( calendar years 2006-2008 ) , differed from those areas epa had included in its december 22 , 2008 , notifications to governors and tribal leaders and from epa's august 2008 proposed modifications to nonattainment designation recommendations submitted by states .

historically , there have been disagreements between epa and states , and other stakeholders , with regard to final naaqs nonattainment designations , and questions have been raised with regard to the final designations for the 2006 24-hour pm 2.5 naaqs .

within three years of promulgation of the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs , all states were required to demonstrate that they have the basic infrastructure and capacity necessary to implement the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs .

by december 19 , 2012 , three years following the publication of the final designations , state , local , and tribal governments were to submit detailed control requirements in plans ( or nonattainment sips ) demonstrating how areas designated nonattainment will meet the 2006 standards .

although a large portion of the nonattainment areas for the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs designated by epa in november 2009 overlap with those areas previously designated nonattainment for 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs , these new designations are based on the 24-hour standard , whereas the majority of the previous designations were based on the annual standard .

epa anticipated that in many cases emission reductions from implementing national regulations and strategies would provide a framework for helping states achieve attainment with the pm 2.5 naaqs .

however , decisions by the d.c .

circuit to vacate two key federal regulations designed to control emissions of air pollution that causes air quality problems in downwind states , epa's may 2005 cair and its replacement csapr published in 2011 , have elicited concerns with regard to the implications this may have on the implementation of the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs .

nevertheless , recent air quality trends suggest that several factors , including national pollution control regulations , appear to be contributing to improved air quality .

in a february 2012 report , "our nation's air — status and trends through 2010," epa reported that nationally , annual and 24-hour pm 2.5 concentrations were 24% and 28% lower , respectively , in 2010 compared to 2001 .

in its february 2012 report , epa indicated that nationally , annual mean concentrations of so 2 and nox ( both pm 2.5 precursors ) decreased 33% and 50% , respectively , between 2001 and 2010 .

epa expects air quality to continue to improve with implementation of more recently adopted regulations and states' work to meet current and recently revised national air quality standards .

key regulations include the locomotive engines and marine compression - ignition engines rule , the tier 2 vehicle and gasoline sulfur rule , the heavy - duty highway diesel rule , the clean air non - road diesel rule , and the mobile source air toxics rule .

ultimately , the continued implementation of these national regulations and associated air quality improvements should help nonattainment areas in achieving compliance with the tighter 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs .

the d.c .

circuit's february 2009 decision regarding challenges to the 2006 pm naaqs , delays in designating nonattainment areas and implementing the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs , impacts of the d.c .

circuit's decisions regarding the 2005 cair and 2011 csapr transport regulations , and potential implications of epa's january 2013 revisions to the pm 2.5 naaqs have prompted increased interest in the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs revisions .

implications of the various issues could vary significantly from area to area based on numerous factors .

the associated impacts on specific geographical nonattainment areas would be speculative at best .

implementation milestones and attainment deadlines for the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs remain an area of concern for many stakeholders and interest groups , as well as congress .

appendix a .

comparative time line for implementing the 1997 and 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs the time line presented in table a - 1 reflects the most recent key milestone dates for implementing the 1997 and the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs , including actual completions .

these milestones are driven primarily by statutory requirements .

the table follows an epa milestone schedule outlined in an april 1 , 2003 , memorandum to epa regional administrators that also provided the nonbinding guidance for implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 area designations , and the agency's previous and current projected time lines for the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs .
