on november 27 , 2002 , congress created a commission charged with investigating theseptember 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the united states .

the national commission on terroristattacks upon the united states , also known as the 9 / 11 commission , was to make a full and complete accounting of thecircumstances surrounding the attacks , and the extent of the united states' preparedness for , andimmediate response to , the attacks ; andâ¦investigate and report to the president and congress on itsfindings , conclusions , and recommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent actsof terrorism .

 ( 3 ) the panel's july 22 report was the culmination of a series of hearings and investigations by the paneland its staff into the terrorist attacks .

the report included a wide - ranging series of proposals tochange intelligence agencies of the executive branch and some committee structures within thelegislative branch .

the 9 / 11 commission's recommendations on the appointment process are designed to makeit quicker and more predictable for a relatively small group of nominees .

the proposal is relativelysparse on details , and implementing it would require the senate to flesh out the plan substantially ; however , it is clear that the recommended changes in the senate's confirmation process wouldprovide a certain up - or - down vote by the full chamber on all national security team nomineeswithin a definitive time frame ( 30 days ) after a nomination is made at the start of an administration .

the recommendation of the 9 / 11 commission would deal with only a small subset of thepresidential nominations considered by the senate .

with respect to the offices included in thenational security team , however , it would place substantial new conditions on how the senatecarries out its role in confirming presidential nominees .

while the constitution includes the senatein the confirmation process , it does not spell out how the chamber should fulfill its role of providingadvice and consent to a nomination .

the extent of legislative and executive control of the processhas in many respects remained undetermined .

in response to this constitutional indeterminancy , some have asserted that the senate shouldhave a co - equal role with the president in the process .

the senate's responsibility for confirming presidentialnominees , although fixed firmly in the constitution , remains unsettled in its application .

the senatewas not meant to be a passive participant .

delegates to the philadelphia convention believed thatthe senate would be knowledgeable about nominees and capable of voting wisely .

yet , for the mostpart , it has acted cautiously , uncertain of the scope of its own constitutional power .

the source ofthis uncertainty is not the constitution .

nowhere in that document , or in its history , is there anobligation on the part of the senate to approve a nomination .

on the contrary , the burden should beon the president to select and submit a nominee with acceptable credentials .

 ( 13 ) others have said the senate should play a lesser role , allowing the president greater leewayin his choices for office than is currently the case .

law professor john c. eastman told the senaterules committee on june 5 , 2003 , that ... the appointment power is located in article ii of theconstitution , which defines the powers of the president , not in article i , which defines the powersof the legislature .

as the supreme court itself has noted , by vesting appointment power in articleii , the framers of our constitution intended to place primary responsibility for appointments in thepresident .

the "advice and consent" role for the senate , then , was to be narrowly construed .

 ( 14 ) the practice of the senate , however , has not systematically reflected either of theseperspectives .

historically , much of the regular order of business on the nomination and confirmationof presidential appointments has been regulated not by strict , formal rules , but rather by informalcustoms that can change ( and have changed ) over the years , as the relative balance of power betweenthe president and the senate ebbs and flows .

it is these traditions which form the process , accordingto appointments expert michael j. gerhardt .

these informal arrangements - - those not clearlyrequired or clearly prohibited by the constitution - - have come to define the dynamic in the federalappointments process .

the informal arrangements through which the system operates - - includingsenatorial courtesy ; logrolling ; individual holds , "blue slips" ; consultation between presidents,members of congress , and other interested parties , including judges ; interest group lobbying ; strategic leaking by administrations , senators and interest groups ; manipulation of the press ; themedia's effort to influence the news ; and nominees' campaigning - - are the sum and substance of thefederal appointments process .

studying these arrangements provide even greater illumination thanstudying supreme court decisions or the constitution itself of how the different branches of thefederal government interact on matters of mutual concern .

 ( 15 ) under these informal customs , individual senators have , historically , been deeply involvedin the nomination and confirmation process .

the procedures and traditions that have developed havetended to protect the autonomy of individual senators to choose how to fulfill the advice and consentrole , rather than to dictate the process for all senators .

 ( 16 ) it is this combination - - unwritten senate traditions and the protection of each senator's rights - - that has led critics of the process to call for changes similar to those proposed by the 9 / 11commission .

"[t]he senate's confirmation process is entirely consistent with all of its other norms,traditions and rules .

concern for the rights and prerogatives of individual senators gives rise tonumerous opportunities for obstruction and delay," argued political scientists nolan mccarty androse razaghian .

 ( 17 ) .

one impact of the ability of a senator to filibuster a nominee has been that negotiations overother matters , both with the executive branch and among fellow senators , have been broadened toinclude all matter of senate business , a concept known as linkage .

for example , a senator'sobjections to a particular nominee might be disposed of by permitting that senator to offer anamendment to a bill that is soon to be considered on the senate floor .

taking nominations out ofthis equation could shift the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches .

"the appointments process is deeply contentious , and as legislative policymaking has grownmore difficult in recent decades , the process has increasingly become a venue for pitched battles overthe shape of public policy," wrote appointments expert mackenzie .

he continued: more and more , the contentiousness in the appointmentsprocess is driven not by questions of the fitness of nominees but by policy disagreements .

senatorsvote against nominees , and nominations fail , because the appointments process has become a policybattlegroundâ¦ this is not a new phenomenon , this use of the appointments process to wage policybattles .

in fact , it has always been a characteristic of the appointments process .

 ( 35 ) mackenzie noted that president andrew johnson fought with the senate over several of his nomineesto head the national bank and of roger taney to be secretary of the treasury .

what is different now,he said , is the extent to which those connections are made .

political scientists nolan mccarty and rose razaghian studied more than 100 years ofsenate action on nominations .

they said: "the thrust of our theory is that the supermajoritarianismof the senate in general and the confirmation process in particular gives partisan and ideologicalminorities a strategic opportunity to have an impact on public policy by delaying nominations thatwould pass on a simple majority vote. .

 ( 36 ) for some , the ability to engage in extended debate on ( and effectively block ) measures ormatters is what empowers the senate to deal on equal footing with the president in their fights overboth nominations and legislation .

political scientist rogers argued that "for the fact of the matteris , as i hope to show , that , as the much vaunted separation of powers now exists , unrestricted debatein the senate is the only check upon presidential and party autocracy .

the devices that the framersof the constitution so meticulously set up would be ineffective without the safeguard of senatorialminority action. .

 ( 37 ) some also believe that the senate's opportunity to play a vigorous role in the nomination andconfirmation process is essential to the public's trust in the process .

"nonetheless , the process ofvetting and voting on the president's candidates for high position is an essential balance wheel in ourcomplicated form of government .

it lends legitimacy to the whole structure , and it is worth theoccasional loss of a good person," wrote former judge , and former member of congress , abnermikva .

 ( 38 ) hecontinued: neither branch always chooses good people , as historyshows , and frequently the best people don't get appointed .

learned hand never made it to thesupreme court .

nonetheless , political involvement , including confirmation by the very politicalsenate , offers a reality check on who gets the power to make very important judicial decisions forlife .

the case is a little less compelling for appointments to the executive branch , but it still can bemade .

most of the federal work force come into their positions and are protected in them , by a civilservice system based on meritocracy .

for those relatively few policy makers whose appointmentsrequire senate confirmation , an extra "look see" is justified .

 ( 39 ) others believe that the delaying strategies being employed by some in the senate detract fromthat legitimacy .

 ( 40 ) and some contend that it is not right to use nominations as bargaining chips in legislativenegotiations .

"the senate's constitutional and institutional role of advice and consent is beingsupplanted by informal , extra - constitutional customs that allow individual senators to effectivelyveto the president's nominees - - even if only to gain leverage with the executive branch on anunrelated matter," wrote denning .

 ( 41 ) .

any change to the confirmation process of the kind proposed by the 9 / 11 commission wouldalmost certainly also influence the balance of power between the executive and the legislativebranches .

the ability to block a final vote on a nomination has become a critical element in thesenate's power relationship with the president , both for its action , or inaction , on the nominationitself and , frequently , for a senator or group of senators to gain leverage in negotiations on othermatters .

a vote deadline , for example , could still lead to a defeat , so requiring a vote could lead tomore presidential defeats or to pressure to go along with the president so as to not hand him a defeat .

political scientist burdett loomis observed that trying to change the senate's rules may notbe an effective plan .

"is there any indication that the senate might smooth the way for futurenominees ? .

given the profound changes in the chamber over the past twenty - five years - - the greaterlatitude allowed individual members and the intense partisanship that dominates muchdecision - making - - it seems unlikely that reformers would profit much from attempting to reshapesenate procedures. .

 ( 42 ) instead , he argued , "striving to "govern together" by bridging the separate institutions may bevaluable than seeking to change an institution that has proved highly resistant to structuralreforms. .

 ( 43 ) if the history of the confirmation process is more about practices than rules , perhaps it wouldbe useful to consider informal changes in the dynamics that undergird the process .

instead of settingup timetables for action , this approach would build upon a view that the problem is not procedural,but political .

political scientist christopher j. deering wrote that politics has always been a part of theprocess .

"the relationship between the executive and legislative branches has been and remainsessentially political .

that should not change .

the senate's role in the review of executive personnelis but one example of that political relationship .

the senate's role in the confirmation process wasdesigned not to eliminate politics but to make possible the use of politics as a safeguard .

from theoutset the political motivations of the two branches were to be a protection against tyranny. .

 ( 44 ) "the one enduring characteristic of the process is that it is as deeply and intensely politicalnow as it has always been," ( 45 ) agreed mackenzie .

the process is political , he asserted , becauseits results can have a major impact on policy - making , and therefore , politics .

conflict occurs in the appointment process for a verysimple reason .

appointments matter .

were that not the case , presidential administrations would nothave several dozen white house aides devoting full time to appointment decisions ; senatecommittees would not hold hundreds of hours of confirmation hearings ; interest groups , agencies,political parties and members of the house would not spend their time and resources trying to shapeappointments decisions .

yet they do all these things , and they do them because they think it makesa difference who gets appointed to serve in particular federal offices .

 ( 46 ) as a result , when the process has worked , it frequently was because the two branches ofgovernment found a way to make it work .

"the appointment power operates in a framework ofstudied ambiguity , its limits established for the most part not by court decisions but by imaginativeaccommodations between the executive and legislative branches," wrote separation - of - powersscholar fisher .

 ( 47 ) .

the 9 / 11 commission's proposal provides an occasion for the senate to evaluate the largerquestion of its confirmation process and its role in the presidential appointment process .

adoptionof the recommendation , for example , could open the door to consideration of ever more nominationsthrough expedited procedures .

what would a new process mean for other presidential nominations,particularly those to the judiciary ? .

for several years , the senate has been debating the proper role of the president and senatorsin the nomination and confirmation of the nation's federal judges .

during the clintonadministration , critics charged that the judiciary committee was not acting on all the nominationsit needed to .

during the bush administration , the controversy has been over the use of the filibusterto block a final vote on a judicial nominee .

 ( 48 ) before the 9 / 11 commission released its recommendations , senator arlen specter hadintroduced a resolution that would establish a "protocol" for the confirmation of federal judges .

hisplan ( s.res .

327 ) would establish timetables for action at both the committee andsenate floor stages , and it would effectively prohibit filibusters of judicial nominations .

presidentgeorge w. bush on october 30 , 2002 , proposed a similar plan for the senate's confirmationprocess .

 ( 49 ) s.res .

138 , introduced by senate majority leader bill frist on june 26 , 2003 , would set up a diminishing threshold for invoking cloture on presidential nominations that aresubject to senate approval .

the threshold necessary for invoking cloture would drop each time thesenate voted on a cloture motion on a particular nominee until it reached 51 senators , a majority ofthe chamber .

given the interest already expressed , some senators might want to expand the 9 / 11commission's recommendations to include a broader number of presidential nominees .

the 30-daytimetable would likely have to be adjusted to allow the senate to complete its work on a largernumber of nominations .

on the one hand , this action could put in place a definitive system for the consideration ofpresidential nominees - - it could bring order and predictability to the entire process .

on the otherhand , it might rush the process for some nominees and make it more difficult for senators to defeata nomination they oppose .

existing rules .

instead of , or in addition to,instituting new procedures to expedite action , the senate might exercise more control over threatenedfilibusters against nominations by enforcing more stringently its existing rules .

under currentprocedures , debate on nominations and treaties is in some respects easier to limit than on legislativematters .

first , the motion to proceed to consider a nomination may be offered in a non - debatableform , whereas the motion to proceed to consider legislation is usually debatable .

second , the "twospeech rule" of the senate limits each senator to two speeches per day on any given question .

withrespect to legislative matters , this rule is not a viable deterrent to extended debate , for each newamendment is viewed as a new question on which each senator may speak two more times .

onun - amendable matters , such as nominations , the two speech rule could more effectively be usedas a procedure to limit debate indirectly .

under current interpretations , however , the two - speech rule has proved to be an ineffectivedeterrent against extended debates on nominations because it has been interpreted to apply to thecalendar day .

on each new calendar day every senator is able once again to make two speeches onthe pending nominee .

as a result , since the late 1980's , the senate has rarely sought to enforce thisrule .

a reinterpretation of the rule in its application to nominations could make it more effective .

given such an interpretation , it would be easier for senate leaders to overcome filibustersagainst a nominee by forcing opposing senators to speak at length .

in modern practice , mostfilibusters feature delay by means other than debate ( quorum calls or agreements to turn to otheritems of business ) .

in effect , the threat of a filibuster is treated as though the senate is beingprevented , through extended debate , from reaching a final conclusion on the measure or matter athand .

keeping the senate in continuous executive business session for consideration of anomination could make it more difficult for senators to sustain a true filibuster , and , perhaps , reducethe incidence of filibuster threats .

expiring nominations .

another approach mightbe to place a time limit on a presidential nomination .

while such a requirement might seemcounterintuitive , it would prevent an endless delay in filling the position in question .

if the senatedid not act on a nomination after a defined period of time , say 60 days , it would automatically bereturned to the president .

while the president would have the ability to renominate the individualin question , if he so chose , he could also take the opportunity to reconsider his choice without thepolitically sensitive problem of asking a nominee to step aside .
