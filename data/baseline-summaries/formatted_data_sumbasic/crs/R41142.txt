according to the u.s. department of education ( ed ) data for fy2012 , the most recent data available , public elementary and secondary education and other related programs spent $36.8 billion on construction and $3.3 billion on land and existing structures .

according to college planning & management , u.s. colleges and universities completed $12.0 billion worth of new construction , additions , and retrofits in 2014 .

school construction and renovation have traditionally been considered to be state and local responsibilities .

nonetheless , the federal government has established a role in financing school construction and renovation .

the federal government provides both indirect support for school construction ( mainly by exempting from federal income taxation the interest on state and local government bonds used to finance school construction and renovation ) and direct support via grants and loans for unique schools and populations .

this report examines estimates of school infrastructure needs and discusses the federal role in financing both k - 12 public school infrastructure and public and private higher education facilities .

national data on the condition of school infrastructure and the need for infrastructure investment are extremely limited , outdated , and difficult to assess in part because of the wide variation of potential assumptions and definitions regarding both conditions and needs .

in addition , there is substantial complexity associated with gathering and compiling data for which there is currently no central repository .

this section describes the historical role of the federal government in the renovation and construction of school facilities .

federal support for school construction and renovation is provided through various allowances and programs .

most allowances and programs provide categorical aid for targeted policy objectives .

several allowances provide federal tax exemptions or credits on state and local government bonds .

several programs provide support through grants , loans , or loan guarantees .

eligible entities may be states , local governments , local educational agencies , postsecondary institutions , or other entities .

the programs described below , although not an exhaustive list of all programs that may support construction or renovation of educational facilities , are organized by federal agency .

the appropriations described reflect total program appropriations , and therefore , may not reflect expenditures for school facilities depending on the other uses of program funds .

the alaska native educational equity , support , and assistance act ( title vii - c of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 ( esea ) , as amended ) provides competitive grants to alaska native and other organizations to meet the unique educational needs of alaska natives and to support supplemental education programs to benefit alaska natives .

the appropriations acts of fy2010-fy2015 authorized construction as an allowable use of funds .

the fy2014 and fy2015 appropriations are each $31 million .

ed administers two programs that provide facilities support to elementary and secondary charter schools .

the state charter schools facilities incentive grants ( title v , part b , subpart 1 of the esea ) , also known as the per - pupil facilities aid programs , are competitive grants awarded to states that have per - pupil charter school facilities aid programs specified in state law , and that annually provide financing on a per - pupil basis for charter school facilities .

the program assists charter schools in meeting school facility costs .

since fy2006 , california , the district of columbia , indiana , minnesota , and utah have variously received per - pupil facilities aid .

the second program , credit enhancement for charter school facilities ( title v , part b , subpart 2 of the esea ) , is intended to improve access to capital markets for the financing of charter school facilities .

funds are awarded on a competitive basis to public and nonprofit entities to leverage nonfederal funds that help charter schools obtain school facilities through purchase , lease , renovation , or construction .

funds are allocated to the state charter schools facilities incentive grants program and the credit enhancement for charter school facilities program from the charter schools program according to appropriations acts .

the charter schools program supports planning , design , and initial implementation of charter schools .

the charter schools' appropriation for fy2014 was $248 million , and for fy2015 it was $253 million .

in fy2014 , ed allocated $11 million to the incentive grants program and $12 million to the credit enhancement program .

in fy2015 , ed allocated $9 million to the incentive grants program and $14 million to the credit enhancement program .

the child care means parents in school program ( 20 u.s.c .

ยง1070e ) supports the participation of low - income parents in postsecondary education through the provision of campus - based child care services .

the dba uses the majority of the bond proceeds to issue loans to hbcus .

hbcus may use the loans to finance or refinance the repair , renovation , and construction of classrooms , libraries , laboratories , dormitories , instructional equipment , and research instrumentation .

the loan and interest volume cap is $1.1 billion according to statutory provisions ; however , the appropriations acts of fy2012-fy2015 allow the secretary to disregard the limitation .

the appropriations acts permit the secretary to guarantee loans of up to $304 million in each of fy2014 and fy2015 .

the new loan subsidy costs appropriations for fy2014 and fy2015 are both $19 million .

howard university is a private doctorate - granting , research university .

although institutional eligibility criteria differ for each of the nine programs , eligible ihes must generally enroll a high proportion of needy students and have lower than average educational and general expenditures .

many of the programs also require eligible ihes to enroll a higher than average proportion of minority students .

to varying extents , the nine programs allow construction , maintenance , renovation , improvement of instructional facilities , or the acquisition of land on which to construct instructional or campus facilities .

the appropriations for all of the programs were $521 million for fy2014 and $530 million for fy2015 .

the federal government exempts interest income earned on bonds issued by state , local , and tribal governments for a "public" purpose from federal income tax ( 26 u.s.c .

ยง103 ) .

bonds are considered to be for a public purpose if they satisfy either of two criteria: less than 10% of the proceeds are used directly or indirectly by a non - governmental entity , or less than 10% of the bond proceeds are secured directly or indirectly by property used in a trade or business .

examples of public projects include elementary , secondary , and postsecondary schools ; public buildings ; and roads .

the tax exemption lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments .

there is no bond volume cap on state and local government bonds .

tax credit bonds ( tcbs ) are a type of bond that offers the investor a federal tax credit or the issuer a direct payment .

congress has authorized various tax credit bonds that , among other purposes , may be used for the construction or modernization of school facilities .

eligible entities could issue bonds under two authorities in 2012 and 2013 .

qualified energy conservation bonds ( qecbs ; 26 u.s.c .

ยง54d ) may be used to reduce energy consumption at least 20% in publicly owned buildings , including k - 12 schools and ihes , or to support research in specific areas through expenditures on research facilities and research grants .

there is no statutory deadline for eligible public entities to issue the national bond volume cap for qecbs of $3.2 billion .

the u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) allocated the funds to states , the district of columbia , and u.s. possessions .

states are required to reallocate a portion of their allocation to large local governments , including indian tribal governments .

qualified zone academy debt instruments , also referred to as qualified zone academy bonds ( qzabs ; 26 u.s.c .

qualified school construction bonds ( qscbs ; 26 u.s.c .

ยง54f ) made bond proceeds available for the construction , rehabilitation , or repair of , or the acquisition of land for , a public school facility , including charter schools but excluding postsecondary facilities , but the authority to issue qscbs expired at the end of calendar year 2010 .

however , treasury also allocated $200 million in each of 2009 and 2010 to the u.s. department of the interior for indian tribal governments to construct or repair bie - funded schools .

these allocations remain available for issuance .

state and local governments may issue bonds that are exempt from federal taxation to finance certain qualified private activities , including qualified public educational facilities ( 26 u.s.c .

ยง142 ) .

indian tribal governments generally cannot issue tax - exempt private activity bonds .

private activity bonds benefit state and local governments because the bond buyer is willing to accept a lower interest rate because the interest income is not subject to federal income taxes .

a qualified public educational facility is a public elementary or secondary school facility ( including a stadium ) constructed , rehabilitated , refurbished , or equipped through a public - private partnership agreement .

bonds issued for qualified educational facilities are not counted against a state's private - activity volume cap .
