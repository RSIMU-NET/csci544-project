the united states has recently completed , or has in progress or intends to enter into,negotiations with foreign countries of a number of bilateral or multilateral trade agreementsestablishing free - trade areas ( ftas ) ; since they contain modifications of nontariff as well as tarifftrade barriers , they require changes in u.s. trade legislation .

 ( 1 ) for the enactment of suchlegislation and its implementation , specific procedures are set out in trade law , which provide forexpedited congressional consideration of the relevant measure if specified conditions required by laware complied with .

the expedited consideration , originally called "fast track" procedure , but recentlyalso named "trade authorities procedures ( taps ) ," provides for mandatory consideration of themeasure once introduced , with specific deadlines for each legislative phase ; allows no amendments ; and requires a final up - or - down vote .

the statutory authority and requirements ( 2 ) for the enactment and implementation of such trade agreements thathave recently been concluded or are in the process of negotiation or in the planning stage arecontained in the provisions of the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 ( tpa act ) ( title xxi of the trade act of 2002 , as amended by section 2004 ( a ) ( 17 ) of the miscellaneous tradeand technical corrections act of 2004 ; p.l .

108-429 ) .

the legislative procedure for theirimplementation is set out in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 ; p.l .

93-618 ) .

the tpa act authorizes the use of the trade authorities procedures for the enactment of billsimplementing agreements regarding tariff - and - nontariff barriers ( including free - trade agreements ) entered into with foreign countries by the president before july 1 , 2005 ( or july 1 , 2007 , if thepresident requests such extension before april 1 , 2005 , and either house of congress does not adoptan "extension disapproval resolution ; " see appendix item ( 1 ) ) .

the expedited legislative procedures ( "trade authorities procedures" - - taps ) by which suchagreements would be implemented are set out principally in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 ( p.l .

93-618 ) , as amended ( 19 u.s.c .

2191 ) .

although this statute is permanent law , it has beenenacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house and can be changed by either house,with respect to its own procedure , at any time , in the same manner and to the same extent as anyother rule of that house .

it applies only to the procedure specifically covered by it ( eg , approvalof trade agreements ) , but in that context supersedes any other rules to the extent that they areinconsistent with it ( section 151 ( a ) ; 19 u.s.c .

2191 ( a ) ) .

these permanent procedural provisions areoccasionally supplemented by additional , temporary ones , contained in the legislative authority forthe negotiation of the agreements , such as various disapproval or other resolutions presented in theappendix .

they , too , are considered an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house ofcongress .

since the expedited procedures do not permit any amendments to the legislation once it hasbeen introduced , the final language of the implementing bill is fashioned through advance "mock"or "nonmark" markups by the relevant committees in order to arrive at legislative language thatreflects the provisions of the agreement as well as congressional concerns regarding itsimplementation .

the version "marked up" in this manner is then transmitted , together with therequired statement of administrative action and other supporting documents , by the president tocongress for legislative action .

the steps in the expedited procedure for the legislative consideration and enactment of animplementing bill , and the implementation of the underlying trade agreement are described belowin their functional time sequence .

while care has been taken to reflect accurately the meaning of therelevant , more extensively worded , statutes , consulting the actual language of any statute isrecommended in case of any ambiguity or need for greater detail .

moreover , because theseprovisions are rulemaking statutes , questions concerning the interpretation of these procedures andpossible parliamentary rulings pursuant to them should be referred to the house and senateparliamentarians' offices .

in this description , the provisions of section 151 of the trade act of 1974 are not specificallyidentified in their alphanumerical designation as contained in that act ; provisions contained in thetrade act of 2002 , however , are identified with the addition of the abbreviation "ta02. .
