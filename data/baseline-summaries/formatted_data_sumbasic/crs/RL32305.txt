early in the morning on october 7 , 2004 , a conference agreement on the fy2005 defenseauthorization bill ( h.r .

4200 ) was announced .

the house approved the conferencereport ( by a vote of 359-14 ) on october 8 , and the senate approved it ( by unanimous consent ) onoctober 9 .

the president signed the bill into law ( p.l .

108-375 ) on october 28 .

on the key issues,conferees rejected a house provision to delay military base closures ; authorized purchases , but notleasing , of boeing kc - 767 or other refueling aircraft ; increased statutory caps on army and marinecorps active duty end - strength in fy2005 by 23,000 ; rejected a house provision that would limitpurchases of defense goods from nations that require offsets for purchases of u.s. weapons ; andincreased benefits for 62-and - older survivors of military retirees .

earlier , on july 22 , 2004 , both thehouse ( by a vote of 410-12 ) and the senate ( by a vote of 96-0 ) approved a conference agreement onthe fy2005 defense appropriations bill ( h.r .

4613 ) .

the president signed the bill intolaw on august 5 , 2004 ( p.l .

108-287 ) .

the conference appropriations agreement provides $416.9billion in new budget authority , including $391.2 billion for regular department of defense programsand $28.2 billion in emergency funding , of which $25 billion is for operations in iraq andafghanistan .

the $391.2 billion in regular defense appropriations is about $1.7 billion below theadministration request .

the energy and water appropriations bill , included in the consolidatedappropriations bill approved in november ( h.r .

4818 ) , however , rescinded $300million of regular fy2005 defense appropriations .

congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriationsmeasures , the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill .

congress also acts every year ona national defense authorization bill , which authorizes programs funded in several regularappropriations measures .

the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely thesame level of detail as the defense - related appropriations , and congressional debate about majordefense policy and funding issues often occurs mainly in action on the authorization .

because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related , thisreport tracks congressional action on both measures .

the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of thedepartment of defense ( dod ) , including pay and benefits of military personnel , operation andmaintenance of weapons and facilities , weapons procurement , and research and development , as wellas for other purposes .

most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by thedepartment of defense , though the bill also provides ( 1 ) relatively small , unclassified amounts forthe central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management , ( 2 ) classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by otheragencies as well as by dod , and ( 3 ) very small amounts for some other agencies .

several other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dodand other agencies - - see table a - 2 in the appendix for a list and for budget amounts .

this reportdoes not generally track congressional action on defense - related programs in these otherappropriations bills , except for a discussion of action on some department of energy nuclearweapons programs in the energy and water appropriations bill .

one issue was paramount in congressional debate about the fy2005 defensebudget - - whether congress should provide funding for operations in iraq andafghanistan before early 2005 , when the bush administration initially said it plannedto request supplemental appropriations .

in may , the administration requested anadditional $25 billion for iraq and afghanistan , which congress subsequentlyapproved in all versions of the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills .

congress did not , however , agreed to provide the administration with the extensiveflexibility it wanted to allocate the money among accounts .

a number of other issues were also on the agenda , including some that werepolitically contentious this year and some with significant long - term defense policyimplications .

among the key issues for congress were to what extent budget deficits over the next few years mightconstrain defense spending ; whether congress should require a substantial , temporaryincrease in active duty end - strength , particularly in the army , to ease pressures on theforce caused by operations in iraq and afghanistan ; whether the planned deployment of a missile defense test bedwith a limited operational capability in september or october was scheduledprimarily for political rather than for sound technical reasons ; to what extent major weapons programs in all of the servicesmay need to be reined in , both because of limits on overall defense spending andbecause of rapid cost growth in several big projects ; how the defense department's change in longstandingregulations governing weapons acquisition procedures to permit what dod calls"evolutionary acquisition" is affecting managerial controls and congressionaloversight over major weapons programs ; whether congress should provide additional military personnelbenefits , including ( 1 ) access to dod - provided health insurance for non - deployedmilitary reservists and their dependents and ( 2 ) increased military retiree survivorbenefits ; whether congress should delay or restrict a new round of baseclosures planned in calendar year 2005 ; the status of pentagon plans to redeploy u.s. military forcesstationed abroad and the implications for congressional oversight and defensebudgets ; how the army plans to manage and to finance a far - reachingreorganization of its combat forces to increase the number of deployable combatbrigades and to turn brigades , rather than divisions , into the major unit of action infuture operations ; how the defense department is restructuring its civilianpersonnel system following congress's approval last year of the pentagon's requestfor broad authority to reform civil service pay and performancerules ; whether congress should approve the defense department'srequest for changes in environmental laws and regulations governing military trainingin addition to changes congress approved last year ; whether department of energy plans to investigate new nuclearweapons - - including low and variable yield weapons and earth penetration weapons - - are strategically sound and in line with authority congress provided last year ; whether congress should require the defense department tobegin acquiring boeing kc - 767 tanker aircraft ; and whether congress should take steps to limit foreign militarysales offsets or to strengthen "buy american" requirements .

the following discussion provides brief background information on each of theseissues and discusses congressional action to date .

on february 2 , 2004 , the administration released its fy2005 federal budgetrequest .

the request includes $423.1 billion in new budget authority for nationaldefense , of which $402.6 billion is for military activities of the department ofdefense , $17.2 billion for atomic energy defense activities of the department ofenergy , and $3.2 billion for defense - related activities of other agencies .

the requestdoes not include funding for ongoing military operations in iraq , afghanistan , andelsewhere , for which administration officials have said they expect to submit asupplemental appropriations request early in calendar year 2005 .

table b - 1 shows the administration projection of funding for the nationaldefense budget function from fy2005 through fy2009 , including requested fundingfor department of defense military activities and for defense - related activities of thedepartment of energy and other agencies .

it also shows the administration'sestimate of fy2004 funding .

the fy2004 amounts are not directly comparable to figures for later years,because they include supplemental appropriations for operations in iraq , afghanistan,and elsewhere , while the administration projections for fy2005 and beyond do not .

table b - 2 shows department of defense funding for fy2004 with and withoutsupplemental appropriations compared to the fy2005 request .

with one exception , the administration's fy2005 defense request does notmark a dramatic departure from plans officials have presented to congress over thepast couple of years .

the exception is the army's decision to terminate the comanche helicopterprogram .

otherwise , the administration's request mainly reflects ongoing trends inthe defense budget , including continued growth in operation and maintenance and in militarypersonnel costs ; and continued growth in a few very large weapons programs,including the air force f - 22 fighter , the multi - service f - 35 joint strike fighter ( jsf ) , the navy's dd ( x ) destroyer and littoral combat ship ( lcs ) programs , thearmy's future combat system , and , largest of all , missiledefense .

department of defense budget,fy2004-fy2005 , with and without fy2004 supplementalfunding ( budget authority in billions of dollars ) sources: department of defense , financial summary tables , fy2005 budget ,february 2004 .

*note: the fy2004 total shown for operation and maintenance ( o&m ) includes anoffsetting rescission of $3.5 billion .

without the rescission , the total for o&m , notincluding supplemental funding , is $131.7 billion , which is the total of programmaticfunding available to dod , and which is most comparable to the $141.2 billionrequested for o&m in fy2005 .

the fy2004 figures shown include total offsettingrescissions of $6.1 billion .

even without supplemental funding for iraq and afghanistan , the fy2005bush administration defense request represents a substantial increase from theamounts provided in the final years of the clinton administration .

table c - 1 compares the fy2000 defense plan , which was the last full budget year of theprevious administration with the fy2005 request .

adjusted for inflation , theoverall fy2005 request is about 23% higher , with the largest increases inprocurement , +28% , and , most strikingly , in r&d , +66% .

this represents anaverage annual growth rate of 3.7% above inflation over the five - year period .

table c - 1 .

change in national defense budgetfunction by appropriations title , fy2000-fy2005 ( budget authority in billions of constant fy2005dollars ) sources: crs calculations based on amounts from the office of management andbudget and fy2005 base year deflators from the department of defense .

notes a. fy2005 amounts do not include anticipated supplemental appropriations for iraqand afghanistan .

b .

the fy2000 military personnel total is inflated to fy2005 prices usingdepartment of defense "deflators," which count military pay raises asinflation .

a calculation using different deflators , such as the consumer priceindex , would show a different amount: see figure 2 above .

though substantial , these increases are not as large those in the first five yearsof the reagan administration .

between fy1980 and fy1985 , the defense budgetgrew by 48% , an average annual increase of 8.1% .

moreover , even when funding foroperations in iraq and afghanistan is included , military spending remains relativelylow as a percentage of gdp .

the fy2004 budget , including costs of iraq andafghanistan is about 4% of gdp , substantially higher than in fy2000 , but wellbelow what it was in the mid - 1980s , when the cold war was still going on ( see figure c - 1 ) .

figure c - 1 .

national defense outlays % of gdp , fy1947-fy2009 advocates of higher military spending sometimes point to the long - termdecline in defense as a share of the economy to argue that the nation can easily affordmore .

one counter - argument , or at least part of a counter - argument , is that the trendin defense spending is part of a broader long - term trend in the federal budget , inwhich both defense and non - defense discretionary spending have declined whilemandatory programs have grown .

as figure c - 2 shows , total federal spending hasbeen remarkably stable at about 20% of gdp over the past 40 years .

so to increasedefense substantially as a share of the economy would require either an increase intotal federal spending as a share of gdp or offsetting reductions elsewhere .

figure c - 2 .

federal outlays % of gdp , fy1962-fy2009 after fy2005 , the administration defense plan , again not includingwar - related supplementals , calls for fairly modest increases in the defense budgetaveraging a bit over 2% per year above inflation .
