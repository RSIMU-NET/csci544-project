the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) authorizesâand in some cases requiresâthe department of homeland security ( dhs ) to detain non - u.s. nationals ( aliens ) arrested for immigration violations that render them removable from the united states .

the immigration detention regime serves two primary purposes .

first , detention may ensure an apprehended alien's presence at his or her removal hearing and , if the alien is ultimately ordered removed , makes it easier for removal to be quickly effectuated .

second , in some cases detention may serve the additional purpose of alleviating any threat posed by the alien to the safety of the community while the removal process is under way .

the ina's detention framework , however , is multifaceted , with different rules turning on whether the alien is seeking initial admission into the united states or was lawfully admitted into the country ; whether the alien has committed certain criminal offenses or other conduct rendering him or her a security risk ; and whether the alien is being held pending removal proceedings or has been issued a final order of removal .

in many cases detention is discretionary , and dhs may release an alien placed in formal removal proceedings on bond , on his or her own recognizance , or under an order of supervision pending the outcome of those proceedings .

but in other instances , such as those involving aliens who have committed specified crimes , there are only limited circumstances when the alien may be released from custody .

this report outlines the statutory and regulatory framework governing the detention of aliens , from an alien's initial arrest and placement in removal proceedings to the alien's removal from the united states .

in particular , the report examines the key statutory provisions that specify when an alien may or must be detained by immigration authorities and the circumstances when an alien may be released from custody .

the report also discusses the various legal challenges to dhs's detention power and some of the judicially imposed restrictions on that authority .

finally , the report examines how these legal developments may inform congress as it considers legislation that may modify the immigration detention framework .

since iirira's enactment , the statutory framework governing detention has largely remained constant .

this detention framework is multifaceted , with different rules turning on whether the alien is seeking admission into the united states or was lawfully admitted within the country ; whether the alien has committed certain enumerated criminal or terrorist acts ; and whether the alien has been issued a final administrative order of removal .

four provisions largely govern the current immigration detention scheme: 1 .

ina section 236 ( a ) generally authorizes the detention of aliens pending formal removal proceedings and permits ( but does not require ) aliens who are not subject to mandatory detention to be released on bond or their own recognizance ; 2 .

ina section 236 ( c ) generally requires the detention of aliens who are removable because of specified criminal activity or terrorist - related grounds ; 3 .

ina section 235 ( b ) generally requires the detention of applicants for admission ( eg , aliens arriving at a designated port of entry ) who appear subject to removal ; and 4 .

ina section 241 ( a ) generally mandates the detention of aliens during a 90-day period after formal removal proceedings , and authorizes ( but does not require ) the continued detention of certain aliens after that period .

while these statutes apply to distinct classes of aliens at different phases of the removal process , the statutory detention framework "is not static," and dhs's detention authority "shifts as the alien moves through different phases of administrative and judicial review. .

this section explores these detention statutes and their implementing regulations , including administrative and judicial rulings that inform their scope and application .

 ( other detention provisions in the ina that apply to small subsets of non - u.s. nationals , such as alien crewmen , or arriving aliens inadmissible for health - related reasons , are not addressed in this report. ) .

a table providing a comparison of these major ina detention statutes can be found in table a - 2 .

as the above discussion reflects , dhs has broad authority to detain aliens who are subject to removal , and for certain classes of aliens ( eg , those with specified criminal convictions ) detention is mandatory with no possibility of release except in limited circumstances .

further , while the supreme court has recognized limits to dhs's ability to detain aliens after removal proceedings , the court has recognized that the governing ina provisions appear to allow the agency to detain aliens potentially indefinitely pending those proceedings .

but some have argued that the prolonged detention of aliens during their removal proceedings without bond hearings is unconstitutional .

moreover , the government's ability to detain alien minors , including those accompanied by adults in family units , is currently limited by a binding settlement agreement known as theâ  flores settlement , which generally requires the release of minors in immigration custody .

apart from concerns raised by prolonged detention , there has been criticism over the lack of regulations governing the conditions of confinement .

additionally , for aliens detained by criminal law enforcement authorities , dhs's authority to take custody of such aliens for immigration enforcement purposes through "immigration detainers" has been subject to legal challenge .

the following sections provide more discussion of these developing issues .

dhs generally has substantial authority to detain aliens who are subject to removal .

but the governing laws on detention may differ depending on the circumstances , including ( 1 ) whether the alien is seeking initial admission into the united states or had been lawfully admitted into the country ; ( 2 ) the type of removal proceedings in which the alien is placed ; ( 3 ) whether the alien has committed specified criminal or terrorist - related activity ; ( 4 ) whether the alien is a uac or falls within some other category subject to special rules for detention ; and ( 5 ) whether the alien is being held for formal removal proceedings or has been ordered removed and is awaiting effectuation of the removal order .

typically , dhs may detain aliens who are placed in formal removal proceedings , but may release the alien on bond , on his or her own recognizance , or under an order of supervision pending the outcome of those proceedings .

in some cases , such as those involving aliens who have committed specified crimes , or aliens arriving in the united states who are placed in expedited removal proceedings , detention is mandatory and the alien may not be released from custody except in limited circumstances .

furthermore , dhs generally must detain aliens who have received final orders of removal for up to 90 days while their removal is effectuated , and the agency retains the discretion to detain certain classes of aliens after that 90-day period has lapsed .

however , there are some constraints on dhs's detention power .

the supreme court has determined that the indefinite detention of aliens after formal removal proceedings would raise "serious constitutional concerns," at least for those who were lawfully admitted into the united states and became subject to removal .

and while the court has recognized that governing statutes confer broad authority to dhs to detain aliens without bond pending their removal proceedings , some lower courts have held that due process requires the government to provide detained aliens with bond hearings after prolonged periods of detention and to prove that any continued detention is justified .

furthermore , dhs's ability to detain family units pending their proceedings remains constrained by the flores settlement , which limits the length of detention of alien minors .

in addition , while detention litigation has largely centered on the duration of detention , detained aliens have also sometimes brought challenges to the conditions of their confinement .

and more recently , some courts have imposed restrictions on dhs's ability to take custody of aliens in state or local law enforcement custody through immigration detainers .

as courts continue to grapple over the scope of dhs's detention power , congress may consider legislative proposals that would either limit or expand that authority .

for instance , some recent bills would end mandatory detention entirely , afford all aliens the opportunity to be released on bond pending removal proceedings , and require dhs to prove that any continued detention is warranted .

certain bills would also require dhs to promulgate regulations for detention facilities ; require the periodic inspection of those facilities ; or impose standards governing the conditions of detention , such as requiring medical screenings and access to food , water , shelter , and hygiene .

as for custody determinations , some bills would require dhs to consider atd programs instead of bond or conditional parole , and require placing some aliens in such programs ( eg , asylum applicants ) .

other bills would generally require the release of aliens considered "vulnerable," such as those who are detained with children , and limit the amount of any bond .

in addition , some bills would create time limitations for an ij to conduct bond hearings , and require periodic bond hearings while an alien remains in custody .

conversely , some bills would specify that an alien may be detained for an indefinite period pending removal proceedings , and require the alien to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is not a flight or escape risk in order to be released .

some bills would also expand the classes of aliens subject to mandatory detention to include aliens present in the united states without inspection , criminal gang members , and aliens arrested for ( but not yet convicted of ) specified crimes .

other bills would override the flores settlement effectively to extend ina section 235 ( b ) ( 1 ) 's mandatory detention scheme governing applicants for admission to family units .

finally , some bills would clarify dhs's detainer authority to provide that ice may issue detainers so long as there is probable cause that an alien is removable .

in short , as reviewing courts continue to test the outer limits to dhs's detention authority , congress may consider additional legislative options that inform the scope of that authority .

the following tables provide ( 1 ) an overview of the development of u.s. immigration detention laws , and ( 2 ) a comparison of the various detention regimes under current law .
