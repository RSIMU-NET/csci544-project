in the past , congress has regularly acted to extend expired or expiring temporary tax provisions .

collectively , these temporary tax provisions are often referred to as "tax extenders. .

this report briefly summarizes and discusses the economic impact of the 17 business - related tax provisions that are scheduled to expire before 2025 .

there are 13 business - related temporary tax provisions scheduled to expire at the end of 2020 .

most of these business - related provisions were included in past extenders legislation .

the business tax extenders are diverse in purpose , providing various types of tax relief to businesses in different industries .

most recently , congress extended expiring provisions in the taxpayer certainty and disaster tax relief act of 2019 , enacted as division q of the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) .

this law retroactively extended , through 2020 , eight temporary tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2017 ; it also extended five provisions scheduled to expire in 2019 .

the estimated cost of the 13 temporary business tax provision extensions enacted in the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) is provided in table 1 .

the most costly of these provisions are the employer credit for paid family and medical leave ( $2.2 billion ) , the work opportunity tax credit ( $2.0 billion ) , and the new markets tax credit ( $1.5 billion ) .

note that all three of these provisions were scheduled to expire at the end of 2019 , and thus were extended for one year .

in contrast , the eight other provisions that had expired at the end of 2017 and were extended through 2020 were effectively extended for three years .

four other business - related provisions are scheduled to expire in 2021 or 2022: ( 1 ) the 12.5% increase in the annual low - income housing tax credit ( lihtc ) authority for four years ( 2018-2021 ) , enacted as part of the 2018 consolidated appropriations act , with a cost of $2.7 billion ; ( 2 ) the computation of adjusted taxable income without regard to any deduction allowable for depreciation , amortization , or depletion for purposes of the interest deduction limit , set to expire by the 2017 tax revision ( the tax cuts and jobs act , p.l .

115-97 ) , with no separate cost estimate for this feature ; ( 3 ) the five - year extension of the rum cover over , last extended retroactively for 2017 and forward through 2021 as part of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) , with a cost of $0.6 billion ; and ( 4 ) the credit for certain expenditures for maintaining railroad tracks , extended through 2022 in the taxpayer certainty and disaster tax relief act of 2019 , with a cost of $1.1 billion .

there are several options for congress to consider regarding temporary provisions .

provisions that are scheduled to expire or have expired could be extended , and the extension could be short term , long term , or permanent .

alternatively , congress could allow the provisions to expire and remain expired .

there are 13 business - related provisions scheduled to expire in 2020 .

all 13 of these provisions were extended in the taxpayer certainty and disaster tax relief act of 2019 , enacted as division q of the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) .

the low - income housing tax credit ( lihtc ) program , which was created by the tax reform act of 1986 ( p.l .

99-514 ) , is the federal government's primary policy tool for the development of affordable rental housing .

lihtcs are awarded to developers to offset the cost of constructing rental housing in exchange for agreeing to reserve a fraction of rent - restricted units for lower - income households .

although it is a federal tax incentive , the program is primarily administered by state housing finance agencies ( hfas ) that award tax credits to developers .

authority for states to award tax credit is determined according to each state's population .

in 2020 , the amount of tax credits a state can award is equal to $2.8125 per person , with a minimum small population state authority of $3,217,500 .

these figures reflect a temporary increase in the amount of credits each state received for 2018-2021 as a result of the 2018 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

115-141 ) .

the increase is equal to 12.5% above what states would have received absent p.l .

115-141 , and is in effect through 2021 .

for more information on the lihtc , see crs report rs22389 , an introduction to the low - income housing tax credit , by mark p. keightley .

prior to the 2017 tax revision ( the tax cuts and jobs act , p.l .

115-97 ) , the deduction for net interest was limited to 50% of adjusted taxable income ( income before taxes ; interest deductions ; and depreciation , amortization , or depletion deductions ) for firms with a debt - equity ratio above 1.5 .

interest above the limitation could be carried forward indefinitely .

the revision limited deductible interest to 30% of adjusted taxable income for businesses with gross receipts greater than $25 million .

the provision also has an exception for floor plan financing for motor vehicles .

businesses providing services as an employee and certain regulated utilities are excepted from this new limit .

also , certain real property and farming businesses can elect out of this limit but must adopt a slower depreciation method for real property or farming assets .

the restrictions on interest , called thin capitalization rules , were partially enacted to address concerns about large multinational businesses locating borrowing in the united states to shift profits out of the united states and to foreign , lower - tax , jurisdictions .

under prior law and the temporary provisions of the 2017 tax revision , this interest limit applies to earnings ( income ) before interest , taxes , depreciation , amortization , or depletion ( referred to as ebitda ) .

after 2021 , the 2017 tax revision changes the measure of income to earnings ( income ) before interest and taxes ( referred to as ebit ) .

because ebit is after the deduction of depreciation , amortization , and depletion , it results in a smaller base and thus a smaller amount of eligible interest deductions .

the temporary broader base ( ebitda ) , which expires in 2021 , allows more interest deductions .

the current , more generous rules for measuring the adjusted taxable income base are more beneficial to businesses with depreciable assets , although affected businesses might be able to avoid some of the change in the deduction rules by leasing assets from financial institutions , such as banks , that generally have interest income .

this change in base is projected to have a significant revenue consequence: the joint committee on taxation estimated the revenue gain from the provision to increase from $19.2 billion in fy2021 to $30.2 billion in fy2023 , when the change is fully in effect , an increase of more than $10 billion .

this revenue change suggests the cost of allowing the broader measure of income ( ebitda ) through 2021 is around $10 billion annually .

under permanent law , the excise tax on rum is $13.50 per proof gallon and is collected on rum produced in or imported into the united states .

under permanent law , $10.50 per proof gallon of imported rum is transferred or "covered over" to the treasuries of puerto rico ( pr ) and the united states virgin islands ( usvi ) .

temporary provisions have increased the transfer amount to $13.25 .

the law does not impose any restrictions on how pr and usvi can use the transferred revenues .

both territories use some portion of the revenue to promote and assist the rum industry .

the cover - over provisions for rum extend as far back as 1917 for pr and 1954 for usvi .

originally , the full amount of the tax was covered over ; however , the deficit reduction act of 1984 ( p.l .

98-369 ) limited the cover over to $10.50 when the federal tax rates were increased to $12.50 .

the cap was intended to address the question of whether the rebates were proper given the lack of rebates to the states .

the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 ( obra93 ; p.l .

103-66 ) temporarily increased the cap to $11.30 for five years , in a law that also reduced another benefit to the possessions ( the possessions tax credit ) .

when this increase expired , the cap was increased to $13.25 , and it has subsequently been extended , most recently through 2021 by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) .

qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures paid or incurred in a taxable year by eligible taxpayers qualify for a 50% business tax credit .

the credit is limited to $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by an eligible taxpayer .

qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures are amounts , which may be either repairs or capitalized costs , spent to maintain railroad track ( including roadbed , bridges , and related track structures ) owned or leased as of january 1 , 2005 , by a class ii or class iii ( regional or local ) railroad .

eligible taxpayers are smaller ( class ii or class iii ) railroads and any person who transports property using these rail facilities or furnishes property or services to such a person .

the taxpayer's basis in railroad track is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed ( so that any deduction of cost or depreciation is only on the cost net of the credit ) .

the credit cannot be carried back to years before 2005 .

the credit is allowed against the alternative minimum tax .

the amount eligible is the gross expenditures , not accounting for reductions such as discounts or loan forgiveness .

the provision was enacted in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-357 ) and extended numerous times .

the provision relating to discounts was added by the tax relief and health care act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-432 ) .

the credit was allowed against the alternative minimum tax by the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-343 ) .

it was most recently extended through 2022 by the further consolidated appropriations act of 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) .

this provision substantially lowers the cost of track maintenance for the qualifying short - line ( regional and local ) railroads , with tax credits covering half the costs for those firms and individuals with sufficient tax liability .

class ii and iii railroads account for 32% of the nation's freight rail miles .

these regional railroads are particularly important in providing transportation of agricultural products .

although no rationale was provided when the credit was introduced , sponsors of earlier freestanding legislation and industry advocates indicated that the purpose was to encourage the rehabilitation , rather than the abandonment , of short - line railroads .

these railroads were spun off in the deregulation of railroads in the early 1980s .

advocates also indicated that this service is threatened by heavier 286,000-pound cars that must be used to connect with longer rail lines .

they also suggested that preserving these local lines would reduce local truck traffic .

there was also some indication that a tax credit was thought to be more likely to be achieved than grants .

the arguments stated by industry advocates and sponsors of the legislation are also echoed in assessments by the federal railroad administration ( fra ) , which indicated the need for rehabilitation and improvement , especially to deal with heavier cars .

the fra also suggested that these firms have limited access to bank loans .
