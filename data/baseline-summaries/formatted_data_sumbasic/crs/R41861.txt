on december 23 , 2011 , president obama signed h.r .

2055 , the consolidated appropriations act for 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ) , providing for the department of defense ( dod ) $646.3 billion in new discretionary budget authority , which is $25.3 billion less than the administration requested .

of that overall reduction , $22.5 billion is taken from dod's so - called "base budget," which pays for all dod operations other than military operations in iraq and afghanistan and associated activities .

 ( see table 1 . ) .

this 3.8% reduction imposed on the base budget request is intended to meet the caps on non - emergency discretionary spending in fy2012 set by the budget control act ( bca ) , which was enacted on august 2 , 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 ) .

the bca required an overall reduction of $35.7 billion from the total amount the administration had requested for fy2012 to fund the government's so - called "security agencies. .

that category was defined to include the dod base budget ( i.e. , non - war costs ) , the departments of veterans affairs and homeland security , and the energy department's national nuclear security agency , as well as the department of state and various international activities funded by other federal agencies .

the bca did not specify how much of the required reduction in the security agencies' budget requests should come from dod .

the first formal legislative action taken to comply with the bca was the senate appropriations committee's adoption , on september 7 , 2011 , of discretionary spending ceilings for each of its 12 subcommittees .

this action required the panels to cut $25.9 billion from the president's request for programs funded by the defense appropriations bill and an additional $1.3 billion from the request for the bill that funds military construction programs as well as the department of veterans affairs and other agencies .

although congress had begun action on the fy2012 defense authorization and appropriations bills before the senate appropriations committee acted , congress treated that committee's response to the bca requirement as the de facto fy2012 spending ceiling on dod funding .

president obama's fy2012 budget request for the department of defense ( dod ) , which totaled $670.9 billion , was nearly 5.3% less than the amount he had requested for dod in fy2011 and nearly 2.5% lower than the amount congress approved for that year , after cutting more than $20 billion from the fy2011 dod request .

the bulk of the reduction in the fy2012 request reflected the administration's plan to reduce dod funding for combat operations in iraq and afghanistan by 26% as the tempo of u.s. military activity in iraq continues to decline and the planned drawdown of u.s. troops in afghanistan gets underway .

the administration's fy2012 request assumes that all u.s. troops will be out of iraq by the end of the first quarter of fy2012 and that the average number in afghanistan will decline from 102,000 during fy2011 to 98,000 , as the administration begins its planned drawdown in u.s. troop levels .

the fy2012 request , sent to congress on february 7 , 2011 , included $553.7 billion for dod's base budget , which includes all routine activities other than ongoing war costs .

compared with the fy2011 dod base budget set by the fy2011 department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act ( h.r .

1473 , p.l .

112-10 ) , this amounts to a 3% real increase in purchasing power , taking account of inflation .

on the other hand , the fy2012 request for so - called overseas contingency operations ( oco , i.e. , operations in iraq and afghanistan ) , which is $117.8 billion , would have amounted to an inflation - adjusted decrease of 27% .

of the fy2012 base budget request , $528.7 billion is for programs funded by the annual defense appropriations bill ; $14.8 billion is for military construction and family housing programs funded by the annual appropriations bill for those activities , the department of veterans affairs and other agencies .

the remaining $10.7 billion requested in the fy2012 base budget funds the so - called tricare - for - life program , which provides medical benefits to medicare - eligible military retirees .

funding for tricare - for - life is a permanent appropriation made automatically under a provision of standing law .

the fy2012 budget request would have reduced military construction funding for the third year in a row , largely for three reasons: the budget to build facilities for units that are moving to new sites as a result of the fy2005 base realignment and closure ( brac ) process is down sharply because most brac - related construction was funded in earlier budgets , in order to meet a september 15 , 2011 , deadline for completing the moves ; the budget for construction projects in iraq and afghanistan , which was $1.3 billion in fy2011 , is $80 million in fy2012 ; and the request for family housing - related accounts continues to decline as a result of a policy , begun in the late 1990s , of privatizing military housing .

congress weighed the fy2012 dod budget request in the context of intense pressure across a wide band of the political spectrum to reduce the federal budget deficit .

in january 2011 , a few weeks before dod published its fy2012 request , the defense department announced $78 billion of savings in the fy2012-fy2016 five - year defense plan that was submitted with the fy2012 budget request , compared with the spending plan for the same period that accompanied the fy2011 dod budget request ( see figure 5 ) .

but even before the president released his fy2012 proposal , there had been calls for more substantial retrenchment in dod spending .

in december 2010 , former senator alan simpson and former white house staff director erskine bowles , the co - chairs of the presidentially appointed national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform ( generally referred to as the "fiscal commission" ) , recommended cuts in security - related spending that , if applied proportionally to defense , would have entailed a reduction of as much as $100 billion a year in national defense funding by the middle of the decade compared to administration projections at the time of the commission report .

the fiscal commission plan also contemplated substantial additional cuts in later years .

in november 2010 , the independent , bipartisan domenici - rivlin debt reduction task force recommended a comparable cut in defense by the middle of the decade , though it would have allowed growth in spending to resume thereafter .

on april 13 , 2011 , the president outlined a long - term budget proposal that would reduce funding for security - related programs , of which defense is the largest part , by an additional $400 billion ( beyond the reductions embodied in the fy2012 dod request ) over the 12 years from fy2012-fy2023 .

the defense department is now working on adjusting its long - term plans to absorb an as - yet - undetermined share of the cuts ( see figure 6 ) .

some defense advocates have opposed the president's plan for additional reductions in projected dod budgets , including the house armed services committee chairman , representative howard p. "buck" mckeon , who called the proposal to take $400 billion from security - related budgets "jawdropping… .

there appears to have been no consideration of threats , of deterrence , of logistics , or capabilities — or even the effect such cuts would have on our three wars , our troops , or our national security," he said in an op - ed column published in usa today .

however , in april 2011 the house incorporated the administration's february 2011 defense projections , extended through fy2021 , in its fy2012 budget resolution .

the house appropriations committee went further , setting a funding target for the defense subcommittee requiring congress to cut $8.9 billion from the president's fy2012 request for dod base budget , as the subcommittee subsequently did in a draft fy2012 defense appropriations bill it marked up june 1 .

in a speech to the american enterprise institute on may 24 defense secretary robert gates said that , as a practical matter , it was inevitable that projected future defense budgets would be scaled back as part of the deficit reduction effort .

he said that the president's proposed reductions were not unprecedented: what's being proposed by the president is nothing close to the dramatic cuts of the past .

for example , defense spending in constant dollars declined by roughly a third between 1985 and 1998 .

what's being considered today , assuming all $400 billion comes from dod over 12 years , corresponds to a projected reduction of about 5% in constant dollars — or slightly less than keeping pace with inflation .

however , secretary gates also emphasized that the proposed reductions would require tough decisions about such hitherto untouchable issues as the pay , pensions , and medical care of military personnel and their families , and the type and number of missions u.s. forces could be ready to handle .

if we are going to reduce the resources and the size of the u.s. military , people need to make conscious choices about what the implications are for the security of the country , as well as for the variety of military operations we have around the world if lower priority missions are scaled back or eliminated .

on may 26 , 2011 , by a vote of 322-96 , the house passed its version of the fy2012 national defense authorization act , h.r .

1540 .

earlier , the house armed services committee completed its markup of the bill on may 11 and issued a report on may 17 ( h.rept .

112-78 ) .

overall , the house bill would have authorized $690.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for programs covered by that bill .

this includes $553.0 billion for dod's base budget and an additional $118.9 billion for oco .

the remaining $18.1 billion the bill would have authorized is for defense - related nuclear activities carried out by the department of energy .

viewed in the aggregate , the house version of the bill would have made only minor changes to president obama's funding request for programs covered by the authorization bill: the dod base budget request would have been trimmed by $1.7 million , while the $1.1 billion the bill would have added to the request for war costs was accounted for almost entirely by the house committee's addition to the dod budget of $1.1 billion for the pakistan counterinsurgency fund , a program which the administration's budget had funded through the state department .

the senate armed services committee's initial version of the fy2012 authorization bill ( s. 1253 ) , reported on june 22 , 2011 , would have authorized $6.4 billion less that the administration requested for fy2012 , of which $5.9 billion would have been cut from the base budget .

on november 15 , 2011 , to match the bca - mandated fy2012 spending cuts for dod and other security agencies , the committee reported a second version of the bill , s. 1867 , that would have cut $27.3 billion from the president's request , and would have authorized $28.4 billion less than the house - passed bill ( see table 4 ) .

after debating and amending s. 1867 over the course of several days , the senate substituted the text of that bill for the house - passed text of h.r .

1540 , and passed the amended version of h.r .

1540 on december 1 , 2011 , by a vote of 93-7 .

the conference report on h.r .

1540 , which cuts the administration's authorization request by a total of $26.6 billion , was adopted by the house december 14 , 2011 , by a vote of 283-136 .

the part of the compromise bill that covers the dod base budget would cut $23.1 billion from the administration's $553.0 request .

however , that reduction includes $6.9 billion requested for activities which the conferees authorized , instead , in the part of the bill that authorizes costs associated with operations in iraq and afghanistan ( including $1.4 billion for procurement of predator and reaper drone aircraft ) .

despite that shift of funds from the base budget to the war budget , the conference report authorizes a total of $2.3 billion less than was requested for war costs because the conferees' additions to the war costs section are more than offset by large reductions to the administration's war cost request .

for example , the conferees cut $4.0 billion from the war cost request on the grounds that , after the budget request was submitted , the president announced a more rapid reduction in the number of u.s. troops deployed in afghanistan than the budget had assumed .

on july 8 , 2011 , the house passed h.r .

2219 which would appropriate $638.3 billion for dod's discretionary spending in fy2012 , a reduction of $8.1 billion from the president's request .

that net reduction reflected cuts in the base budget request totaling $8.9 billion that were partly offset by a net increase of $842 million in funds for war costs , compared with the president's request .

the largest component of that net increase in war costs is $1.5 billion added to the bill for unspecified equipment for national guard and reserve units .

the house appropriations committee had reported the bill on june 16 , 2011 ( h.rept .

112-110 ) .

two - thirds of the house bill's net reduction to the president's request — $5.4 billion — would come from changes which , according to the appropriations committee , would have no adverse impact on dod operations .

among these were reductions of: $1.7 billion in new budget authority that would be offset by rescissions totaling that amount of unspent funds appropriated in prior budgets ; $1.3 billion on the basis of more optimistic assumptions about inflation and other economic factors than had been incorporated into the budget request ; $959 million from delays in two acquisition programs ; $899 million accounts which , the committee says , historically have had large "unexpended balances" at the end of the fiscal year ; and $500 million from "unjustified supply increases," in the army's budget request .

the house - passed bill also would cut $1.2 billion from the amounts requested for classified procurement and research and development programs .

in its report , the house committee said the army's budget request for operations in afghanistan and iraq was overstated because of certain erroneous assumptions .

for example , the budget assumed that all supplies shipped to afghanistan would be moved by air , whereas 80% of them are moved by cheaper surface transport , the committee said .

based on this analysis , the committee cut a total of $5 billion from the amounts requested in various army o&m accounts in the overseas contingency operations ( oco ) part of the bill ( title ix ) and transferred that sum to a so - called overseas contingency operation transfer fund from which the secretary of defense could draw funds to cover unforeseen expenses in afghanistan and iraq .

during house debate on the bill , an amendment that would have eliminated the oco transfer fund was rejected by a vote of 118-295 .

the house bill would add to the bill $884.7 million to restore funds dod had cut on the basis of "efficiency" but which the committee , in its report on the bill ( h.rept .

112-110 ) , dubbed "valid requirements" many of which involved funding for maintenance and repair of facilities .

on the other hand the committee made some reductions of its own to the president's request on the basis of anticipated efficiencies .

as passed , the house bill would cut: $400.0 million from the amount requested for contractor - provided logistic support of weapons , such as the performance of overhauls on aircraft and engines and the management of supply chains ; $124.0 million ( from the $300.6 million requested ) for "information operations" which activities , the committee said , were not traditional or appropriate for the military services ; $30.0 million from the budget for telecommunications services ; and $315.0 million from the amounts requested for overhead costs at three of the navy's shipyards ( at pearl harbor , hi ; bremerton , wa ; and portsmouth , nh ) , in order to bring those costs in line with the less expensive navy yard at norfolk , va .

the senate appropriations committee reported on september 15 , 2011 , an amended version of h.r .

2219 that would cut a total of $26.2 billion from the fy2012 dod budget request , a reduction large enough to meet the fy2012 spending caps set by the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 ) , enacted august 2 , 2011 .

the full senate took no action on the bill .

a compromise , final version of the fy2012 defense appropriations bill , which incorporated many of the reductions in the senate committee's bill , was enacted as division a of h.r .

2219 , the consolidated appropriations act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ) .

in summary terms , the senate committee's version of h.r .

2219 would have cut a total of $25.9 billion from the $528.7 billion requested for dod's fy2012 base budget and an additional $268 million from the $117.7 billion requested for war costs in title ix of the bill .

but nearly 40% of the amount cut from the base budget — $9.9 billion — would have been transferred to title ix , where it would have supplanted most of the $10.2 billion the committee would have cut from that part of the bill .

the largest part of the funds the senate committee shifted from the base budget to war costs ( $6.2 billion ) came from the o&m accounts , including $4.3 billion for major overhauls of ships , planes , combat vehicles , and other weapons .

also shifted into title ix was a total of $2.9 billion from procurement and r&d accounts , 60% of which is for three unmanned aerial vehicle programs .

most of the $10.2 billion the senate committee bill would have cut from the title ix request ( to be back - filled by the $9.9 billion moved from other parts of the budget ) would have had no adverse impact on dod operations , according to the senate committee .

this includes reductions of: $5 billion to take account of president obama's decision in june to reduce the number of troops in afghanistan ; and $2 billion from the army's o&m request which , the committee said , the service had identified as unnecessary .

the senate appropriations committee also maintained that an additional $8.6 billion that its version of the defense bill would cut from the budget request would have had no adverse impact on dod .

this includes reductions totaling $5.6 billion from programs the committee said did not need the funds during fy2012 for reasons such as contract delays and the availability of funds left over from prior budgets to cover some fy2012 costs .

the senate committee bill also would have rescinded $2.7 billion appropriated in prior budgets , allowing those funds to be used instead of new budget authority to cover a share of fy2012 costs .

the senate committee bill also would have cut $1.57 billion from the $12.8 billion requested to assist the military and police forces of afghanistan .

the final version of the fy2012 defense appropriations bill , enacted as division a of h.r .

2055 , the consolidated appropriations act of fy2012 , provides a total of $633.3 billion in discretionary fy2012 spending for dod , a $23.6 billion reduction from the amount requested for programs covered by this bill .

this version of the dod bill incorporated many of the reductions that the senate committee had made in its version of h.r .

2219 in order to reach the spending ceiling set by the budget control act .

as in the senate committee's bill , a significant portion of the amount that the conference report removed from the base budget was transferred to the part of the bill ( title ix ) that funds war costs , which are not constrained by the bca spending caps .

in the final bill , of the $22.5 billion cut from the base budget , $6.0 billion was shifted war costs .

including a total of $1.4 billion for predator and reaper unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) used for reconnaissance and ground attack .

the final bill cuts an additional $3 billion from the base budget request in ways that , in principle , need not affect dod programs .

this includes $2.5 billion worth of rescissions of prior - year appropriations ( making those funds available to cover fy2012 costs in lieu of new budget authority ) and $515 million cut from dod's working capital funds to reduce what the house - senate conferees deemed to be unnecessarily large cash balances .

despite the conference report's transfer of $6.0 billion from the base budget to the title ix of h.r .

2250 , that part of the bill incorporated a net reduction of $2.8 billion to the administration's request for war costs .

the amount transferred into the title was largely offset by several reductions , including: $4.0 billion to reflect president obama's decision to reduce the number of u.s. troops in afghanistan ; $419.3 million cut from the $1.6 billion requested for support of the afghan army and national police ; $595 million cut from the $3.2 million requested for mine - resistant , ambush - protected ( mrap ) armored troop carriers ; and $380.1 million in rescissions from prior - year war - cost appropriations .

following are further highlights of the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

2219 and the conference report on the bill , which is division a of h.r .

2055 ( p.l .

112-74 ) .

the house - passed bill would have provided $32.3 billion — $118.7 million more than requested — for the defense health program ( dhp ) , which serves 9.6 million beneficiaries , including service members and military retirees , their survivors and their dependents .

the committee cut $394 million from the request for operating accounts that , historically , have not spent their entire annual allocation .

the bulk of that reduction — $330 million — came from the tricare health insurance program for active and retired service members and their dependents .

but the house bill also added to the budget request $523.5 million for research and development programs focused on specific diseases and treatments including $120 million for research on breast cancer , $64.0 million for research on prostate cancer , and $125.0 million for research on traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) and psychological health .

the senate committee bill would have added $337.3 million to the dhp budget request , cutting $16.7 million from the operating accounts but adding $354 million to various r&d programs including $120 million for breast cancer , $64.0 million for prostate cancer , and $60.0 million for tbi and psychological health .

the final version of the bill provided $32.5 billion for dhp , an increase of $283.3 million over the request .

it incorporated the $330 million reduction in tricare made by the house bill , but it also added a total of $603.6 million to the $663.7 million requested for medical r&d including $120 million for breast cancer , $80 million for prostate cancer , and $135.5 million for tbi and psychological health .

funding that would be provided for selected major army and marine corps weapons programs by the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

2219 and by h.r .

2055 as enacted is summarized in the appendix ( table a - 4 ) .

following are some highlights .

all three versions of the bill added funds to the budget to continue upgrading most of the army's m - 1 tanks with the so - called system enhancement package ( sep ) , which includes improved night vision equipment , digital communication links , and armor .

dod plans to install the sep upgrades in 1,547 tanks — about two - thirds of the m - 1 fleet — and then to shut down the tank production line in mid - 2013 and restart it three years later for a new round of tank modifications .

meanwhile , most national guard combat units would be equipped with the one - third of the tank fleet that would not have the sep improvements .

as enacted , the bill adds $255.0 million to the $181.3 million requested for sep upgrades in fy2012 .

citing in its report the frequency with which national guard units have been deployed in recent years , the house appropriations committee urged dod to consider the advantages of having all combat units , regular army and national guard alike , equipped with the same version of the tank .

in its report on the bill , the senate committee questioned the cost of the army's plan to develop a new armored troop carrier and then purchase 1,874 of those vehicles to replace half its current fleet of bradley fighting vehicles .

noting that the program currently is behind schedule and in a state of flux , the senate committee cut $644.0 million from the $884.4 million requested .

the house - passed bill would have provided $768.1 million for the program .

the final bill provides $435.0 million for the program , a reduction of more than 50% which the conferees justified on grounds that the army was moving too quickly to develop the new vehicle before fully taking into account a formal analysis of alternative designs .

the senate committee's version of the bill would have denied the $243.9 million requested for the joint light tactical vehicle ( jltv ) , thus terminating the program which was intended to develop a replacement for some of the roughly 170,000 humvees used by the army and marine corps .

the committee said that , although the new vehicle had been intended as a replacement for the entire humvee fleet , the planned purchase had been greatly cut back because of the growing cost of the program which , in part , was the result of the services' desire to buy several versions of the new vehicle .

the committee added to its version of the bill $20 million for the army to use in finding a cheaper alternative to replace existing humvees .

the house - passed bill would have cut $25 million from the jltv request , with the house armed services committee citing delays in the program as the reason .

the house bill also would have added $25 million to the budget to develop improved armor for humvees .

the final bill provides $134 million to continue jltv and $20 million for improved humvee armor .

in their report on the bill , conferees praised the two services for setting less demanding specifications for the new vehicle and agreeing to buy a single version .

funding for selected aircraft programs provided by the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

2219 and by h.r .

2055 as enacted is summarized in the appendix .

 ( see table a - 8 . ) .

following are some highlights .

the senate appropriations committee cited experience with the f - 22 fighter program as grounds for slicing $695.1 million from the $9.51 billion requested for procurement of f - 35 joint strike fighters .

the committee argued that , because so many f - 22s had been manufactured while the plane still was undergoing flight tests , the air force had to budget hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit modifications to deal with problems that surfaced later in the test program .

noting that the f - 35 , which is being produced in three versions , had completed only about 10% of its flight test program , the committee recommended deferring dod's plan to accelerate the f - 35 production rate .

accordingly , the senate committee bill would have cut $695.1 million from the $5.4 billion requested , funding 23 of the requested 26 planes requested for the air force and navy .

the senate committee approved without change the requests for $1.14 billion to buy for the marine corps six f - 35bs equipped for vertical takeoffs and landings , and $117.2 million for long lead - time components for that version of the plane .

the house - passed bill would have trimmed $55 million from the total f - 35 procurement request to reduce the amount spent on various overhead costs .

as enacted , the bill cut $354.5 million ( including one plane ) from the request for the navy and air force versions of the f - 35 , and approved without change the $1.3 billion requested for the marines' vertical takeoff version .

it also added to the program $100 million to deal with some of the costs resulting from the high level of concurrency in the program .

although the administration requested no additional c - 17 cargo planes , the house - passed bill includes $225 million to buy one plane as a replacement for a c - 17 that crashed during a demonstration flight .

the senate committee bill would deny the $108.6 million requested to shut down the c - 17 production line on grounds that recent sales of the plane to other countries will extend production into mid - 2014 .

the final version of the bill incorporates both those changes to the request .

none of the three versions of the bill would fund production of an army reconnaissance system designated the enhanced , medium - altitude reconnaissance and surveillance system ( emarss ) , a package of cameras and electronic eavesdropping gear installed in a small , twin - engine beechcraft airplane .

noting that the contract that would obligate the funds is scheduled to be awarded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and that program has experienced delays , the house bill would have provided $15.7 million of the $539.6 million requested for the program .

the senate committee bill and the enacted version of h.r .

2055 denied the entire request .

funding for selected shipbuilding programs provided by the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

2219 and by h.r .

2055 as enacted is summarized in the appendix ( table a - 6 ) .

for the navy's main shipbuilding account , the house bill would have provide $14.7 billion — all but $203.4 million of the amount requested — for purchases including two submarines , a destroyer , four littoral combat ships ( lcss ) , and lpd - 17-class amphibious landing transport , a small , high - speed ship ( designated a jhsv ) to carry troops or cargo , and an oceanographic research vessel .

the house bill also would have provided , as requested , $223.8 million for a second jhsv funded in the army budget as well as $400.0 million of the $425.9 million requested for a ship ( designated an mlp ) designed to serve as a floating pier over which large combat vehicles can be transferred from large cargo ships to amphibious landing craft .

the senate committee - reported version of the bill would have denied the entire amount requested for the mlp ( $425.9 million ) .

it also would have cut $38.7 million from the $223.8 million requested for the army - funded jhsv and would transfer that ship to the navy's shipbuilding account , pursuant to an agreement between the army and navy .

otherwise , the senate committee bill would have made no change to the shipbuilding request .

h.r .

2055 as enacted provides $14.9 billion for shipbuilding .

it fully funds the mlp and would transfer to the navy's account $187.2 million for the army - budgeted jhsv , as the services had agreed .

the only other changes to the request were relatively small reductions for what the conferees described as excessive price increases and overhead costs .

during two days of floor debate on h.r .

2219 , the house rejected several amendments that would have reduced the amount of budget authority provided by the bill .

following is a summary of house action on selected amendments to the bill .
