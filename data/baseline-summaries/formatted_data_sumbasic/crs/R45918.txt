t he statutory language governing patent - eligible subject matterâthat is , the types of inventions that may be patentedâhas remained remarkably constant over the nearly 250-year history of u.s. patent law .

under the patent act of 1793 , which thomas jefferson authored , "any new and useful art , mac hine , manufacture or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement [of the same]" was patentable .

current lawâsection 101 the patent act of 1952âpermits the patenting of "any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof. .

through these four expansive statutory categories , congress sought to ensure that nearly "anything under the sun made by man" is patentable if it meets all the requirements for patentability , such as novelty , enablement , and nonobviousness .

consistent with the broad statutory language , section 101 permits patenting in fields of applied technology such as pharmaceuticals , biotechnology , chemistry , computer hardware and software , electrical engineering , agriculture , mechanical engineering , and manufacturing processes .

however , the supreme court has long read section 101 to categorically prohibit patents on three types of discoveries: "laws of nature , natural phenomena , and abstract ideas. .

even if "not required by the statutory text" of section 101 , the court has held that these three judicial exceptions "define[] the reach of the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. .

in a recent series of decisions , the supreme court relied on section 101 to reject patent claims on a method for hedging price - fluctuation risks in commodity markets ; a method for measuring metabolites in human blood for the purpose of calibrating the dosage of particular drug ; isolated human dna segments ; and a method of mitigating settlement risk in financial transactions using a computer .

these decisions established a two - step test for patentable subject matter sometimes called the " alice / mayo test" or the " alice / mayo framework. .

these cases have been widely recognized to effect a significant change in the scope of patentable subject matter , restricting the sorts of inventions that are patentable in the united states .

the alice / mayo framework has thus shifted , for better or worse , the balance between providing incentives to innovate and the social costs of exclusive rights that is at the heart of patent law .

the effects of this change have been particularly pronounced in the fields of computer technology and biomedical technology .

as a result , there is a significant and ongoing debate about the effects of alice / mayo framework , with a number of patent law stakeholders raising concerns about recent patentable subject matter rulings .

critics argue that the alice / mayo framework is vague , unpredictable , and not administrable ; muddies patent law by confusing patent eligibility with distinct patent law concerns , such as nonobviousness ; reduces incentives to innovate and invest in particular industries , such as biotechnology ; or puts the u.s. industry at a disadvantage with respect to international competitors .

other stakeholders defend the alice / mayo framework , arguing that the court's recent decisions are a part of the ordinary common law development of section 101 ; an important tool for combating unmeritorious litigation or preventing overbroad or otherwise harmful patents ; or beneficial to american consumers by lowering prices .

in response to the concerns of some stakeholders , there have been several significant recent administrative and legislative developments that aim to clarify and / or reform the law of section 101 .

on january 7 , 2019 , the patent and trademark office ( pto ) issued revised patent subject matter eligibility guidance designed to assist pto patent examiners in determining patent eligibility with greater clarity and predictability .

on april 17 , 2019 , senators thom tillis and chris coons , along with representatives doug collins , hank johnson , and steve stivers , released a "bipartisan , bicameral framework" for legislative section 101 reform .

on may 22 , 2019 , following feedback on their first draft framework , the same group of members released a "bipartisan , bicameral draft bill" to reform section 101 .

after the release of the draft bill , the senate judiciary committee's intellectual property subcommittee held a series of three public hearings on section 101 reform , soliciting the views of 45 patent law stakeholders .

senators tillis and coons continue to seek input from stakeholders following the hearings , and are expected to make further changes before introducing a formal bill .

this report provides the necessary background and context to understand the legal and practical effects that these legislative reforms would have if enacted .

first , the report reviews the basic legal principles of the u.s. patent system .

second , it examines the historical development and current state of patentable subject matter law .

third , it reviews several articulated rationales for section 101 and theoretical options for section 101 reform .

finally , it examines the specifics of the pto guidance and proposed legislative reforms to section 101 .

congress's authority to grant patents derives from the intellectual property ( ip ) clause of the u.s. constitution , which grants congress the power "[t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to .

inventors the exclusive right to their .

 .

discoveries. .

patents are generally available to any person who "invents or discovers any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof. .

patent rights do not arise automatically .

rather , to obtain patent protection under the patent act , an inventor must formally apply for a patent with the pto , beginning a process called patent prosecution .

during prosecution , a patent examiner at the pto evaluates the patent application to ensure that it meets all the applicable legal requirements to merit the grant of a patent .

to be patentable , an invention must be ( 1 ) â directed at patent - eligible subject matter , ( 2 ) â useful , ( 3 ) new , ( 4 ) â nonobvious , and ( 5 ) adequately disclosed and claimed in the patent application .

if the pto finds these requirements met , it will issue ( i.e. , grant ) the patent .

patents typically expire 20 years after the date of the initial patent application .

the current law of patent - eligible subject matter will be discussed separately in detail below .

the remainder of this section briefly reviews the other requirements for patentability , the scope and effect of patent claims , and the legal rights granted to the holder of a valid patent .

at the most general level , there are two basic requirements for an invention to claim patent - eligible subject matter .

first , the invention must fit into one or more of the four statutory categories in section 101âthe claimed invention must be a ( 1 ) process , ( 2 ) machine , ( 3 ) â manufacture , or ( 4 ) composition of matter .

given the ( intentionally ) expansive nature of these terms , nearly all claimed inventions will satisfy this requirement .

nonetheless , exceptions to this rule do exist .

for example , in in re nuijt en , the federal circuit held that a transitory electromagnetic signal was neither a process , manufacture , machine , or composition of matter , and was therefore not patent - eligible subject matter .

because most claimed inventions fit into one of the four statutory categories , the second requirement tends to be more practically important , and receives most of the attention .

the second patentable subject matter requirement is that the invention cannot claim one of the judicially created categories of ineligible subject matterâthe claimed invention must not be a ( 1 ) â law of nature ; ( 2 ) natural phenomenon ; or ( 3 ) abstract idea .

as explained below , the modern supreme court has articulated a two - step test for this second requirement , known as the alice / mayo framework .

the supreme court has justified the three ineligible categories as necessary to prevent patent monopolies on the "'basic tools of scientific and technological work,'" which "might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it. .

thus , the court has explained that "a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not patentable subject matter .

likewise , einstein could not patent his celebrated law that e=mc 2 ; nor could newton have patented the law of gravity. .

at the same time , the court has said that even if a mathematical formula or law of nature is not patentable "in the abstract," a practical application of such a principle or law "to a new and useful end" is patent - eligible .

beyond such broad illustrations , it is not easy to precisely define what an "abstract idea," "law of nature," or "natural phenomenon" is .

because these exceptions to patent - eligible subject matter are judicially created , they have no formal statutory definition ; their meaning has instead been developed through two centuries of "common law" case - by - case adjudication in the federal courts .

as such , the scope of patentable subject matter has waxed and waned over time , depending on the trends of recent judicial decisions .

this section overviews the leading supreme court cases addressing patent - eligible subject matter , beginning with formative cases from the 19th century and culminating in the series of recent supreme court decisions that have led some to call for legislative reform of section 101 .

table 1 summarizes the facts and holdings of the major cases .

a substantial group of patent law stakeholders , including inventors , academics , industry representatives , patent attorneys , current and former federal circuit judges , and former pto officials , has criticized the alice / mayo framework on various grounds .

however , other patent law stakeholders defend the supreme court's recent section 101 decisions .

the supreme court's recent patentable subject matter jurisprudence has inspired a number of proposed section 101 reforms from academics , practitioners , and other stakeholders .

the specifics of many of these proposals have been reviewed elsewhere .

this section examines two major developments in this area in 2019 .

first , it reviews the pto's revised subject matter eligibility guidance , which seeks to offer clearer guidelines to pto patent examiners in making section 101 determinations .

second , this section examines a series of draft legislative proposals put forth by a bipartisan and bicameral group of legislators , which have been the subject of a series of roundtables and congressional hearings on patentable subject matter reform .

on january 7 , 2019 , the pto issued revised patent subject matter eligibility guidance ( the pto's revised guidance ) to assist pto patent examiners in determining subject matter eligibility for patent applications .

the pto noted that the "legal uncertainty" surrounding the alice / mayo framework "poses unique challenges" for the agency , which has thousands of patent examiners who must make patent - eligibility determinations on hundreds of thousands of applications each year .

accordingly , the pto issued revised guidance to its patent examiners to provide "more clarity and predictability" in their section 101 determinations .

the pto's revised guidance made two major changes to how patent examiners evaluate whether a patent application claims patent - ineligible subject matter .

first , the guidance attempts to provide a clearer definition of what constitutes an ineligible "abstract idea. .

previously , examiners would make that determination by comparing the patent claim at issue to those found to be ineligible "abstract ideas" in previous judicial cases .

the pto found that this approach had become "impractical" because of an expanding volume of sometimes contradictory section 101 case law .

the pto's revised guidance "synthesizes" the case law into three categories that examiners will treat as "abstract ideas": ( a ) mathematical conceptsâmathematical relationships , mathematical formulas or equations , mathematical calculations ; ( b ) certain methods of organizing human activityâfundamental economic principles or practices ( including hedging , insurance , mitigating risk ) ; commercial or legal interactions ( including agreements in the form of contracts ; legal obligations ; advertising , marketing or sales activities or behaviors ; business relations ) ; managing personal behavior or relationships or interactions between people ( including social activities , teaching , and following rules or instructions ) ; and ( c ) mental processesâconcepts performed in the human mind ( including an observation , evaluation , judgment , opinion ) .

under the revised guidance , patent claims that do not recite matter that falls into one of these three groupings should not be treated as an "abstract idea" except in "rare circumstance[s]. .

second , the pto's revised guidance clarifies when examiners will treat a patent claim as "directed to" an ineligible category ( abstract ideas , laws of nature , or natural phenomena ) under step one of the alice / mayo test .

in particular , the pto will not treat a claim as "directed to" an ineligible concept if "the claim as a whole integrates the recited judicial exception into a practical application of the exception . .

if the claim does integrate such a practical applicationâsuch as improving the functioning of a computer , effecting a particular treatment for a disease , or implementing the exception into a particular machine or manufactureâthen the pto will treat the claim as patent - eligible , without having to examine the patent application for an "inventive concept" under step two of the alice / mayo framework .

pto's revised guidance was generally perceived as lowering section 101 barriers to patentability , especially with respect to computer - related inventions .

some commentators praised the revised guidance for providing greater clarity to patent examiners , while other stakeholders criticized the guidance as inconsistent with the supreme court's section 101 decisions .

although the pto's revised guidance changes how pto examiners review new patent applications , it is important to note that the guidance , unlike judicial decisions or statutory reforms , lacks formal legal forceâthat is , the guidance is not binding on the courts when patents are challenged in litigation .

the pto lacks general substantive rulemaking authority , and revised guidance itself states that it is only a "tool for internal [pto] management" that lacks "the force and effect of law. .

although the federal circuit has issued somewhat contradictory signals on this point , the guidance would receive , at the most , "some deference" if a court found its reasoning to be persuasive .

on april 17 , 2019 , senators tillis and coons , along with representatives collins , johnson , and stivers , released a "bipartisan , bicameral framework" for legislative section 101 reform ( the first tillis - coons proposal ) .

the framework's release followed multiple roundtables with patent law stakeholders on section 101 and the impact of the alice / mayo framework on , for example , innovation in artificial intelligence , medical diagnostics , and personalized medicine .

the first tillis - coons proposal would have retained the four statutory categories of patentable inventions , but removed the requirement that the invention or discovery be "new and useful" from section 101 .

patent eligibility would have instead been determined "by considering each and every element of the claim as a whole and without regard for considerations properly addressed by [sections] 102 , 103 and 112 [of the patent act]. .

in place of the judicially created exceptions to patent eligibility , which the first tillis - coons proposal would have abrogated by statute , the proposal would have defined , "in a closed list," five "exclusive" categories of patent - ineligible subject matter: ( 1 ) fundamental scientific principles ; ( 2 ) products that exist solely and exclusively in nature ; ( 3 ) pure mathematical formulas ; ( 4 ) economic or commercial principles ; and ( 5 ) mental activities .

effectively , this would have codified the judicial exceptions in a narrower form , with the first two ineligible categories roughly corresponding to the "law of nature" and "natural product" judicial exceptions , and the final three to the types of "abstract ideas" identified by the pto in its 2019 guidance .

the proposal would have narrowed the construction of these ineligible categories by creating a "practical application" test , presumably along the lines of the aba proposal to expressly permit patenting of a practical application of ineligible subject matter .

however , "simply reciting generic technical language or generic functional language" would have been insufficient to "salvage an otherwise ineligible claim. .

the first tillis - coons proposal thus blended elements of the pto's 2019 revised guidance with a "laundry list" approach of specific ineligible categories , plus new statutory standards for how to apply the list of exceptions to patentable subject matter .

the overall effect would be to lower section 101 barriers to patentability , while still retaining more narrowly defined classes of ineligible subject matter .

reactions to the first tillis - coons proposal were mixed .

some argued that the draft proposal was a promising start for much - needed congressional intervention .

on the pro - alice side of the debate , the electronic frontier foundation , for example , criticized the first tillis - coons proposal as a "disaster" for innovation because it would eliminate a powerful tool to combat bad patents and patent troll litigation .

on the other side of the debate , critics of the alice / mayo framework argued that the first tillis - coons proposal did not go far enough , and urged elimination of any ineligible categories of patentable subject matter .

on may 22 , 2019 , following feedback on their first draft framework , the same group of members released a "draft bill" to reform section 101 ( the second tillis - coons proposal ) .

the second tillis - coons proposal was released in advance of a series of three hearings held in june before the senate judiciary committee's subcommittee on intellectual property , which were designed to solicit feedback on the draft legislative language .

in the subsequent hearings , 45 witnesses testified over three days , with representatives from industry , academia , bar associations , and trade groups ; former federal circuit judges and pto officers ; and other patent law stakeholders expressing various views on section 101 reform .

as compared to the first proposal , the second tillis - coons proposal , generally speaking , would make more sweeping changes to section 101 to expand patent eligibility .

like the first tillis - coons proposal , the draft bill has several provisions that would attempt to separate the section 101 inquiry from other patentability requirements .

specifically , the draft bill would strike the word "new" from section 101 and establish that patent subject matter eligibility must be determined "considering the claimed invention as a whole" and without regard to "considerations relating to section 102 , 103 , or 112 of [the patent act]. .

the second tillis - coons proposal would further provide that eligibility determinations shall not depend on the "manner in which the claimed invention was made ; whether individual limitations of a claim are well known , conventional or routine ; the state of the art at the time of the invention. .

the draft bill also explicitly provides that section 101 "shall be construed in favor of eligibility. .

instead of codifying and narrowing the judicial exceptions to patentability , the second tillis - coons proposal would eliminate them altogether .

the draft bill provides that no implicit or other judicially created exceptions to subject matter eligibility , including "abstract ideas," "laws of nature," or "natural phenomena," shall be used to determine patent eligibility under section 101 , and all cases establishing or interpreting those exceptions to eligibility are hereby abrogated .

this language would appear to overturn by statute not only the alice / mayo framework , but over two centuries of judicial decisions interpreting the "common law" exceptions to section 101 .

the second tillis - coons proposal would replace the judicial exceptions with a new statutory definition of utility that incorporates elements of various prior proposals for a new section 101 standard .

to be patent - eligible subject matter under the second tillis - coons proposal , the invention would need to fit into one of the four statutory categories of eligible subject matter ( which remain unchanged ) and be "useful. .

to be "useful," an invention or discovery would need to provide "specific and practical utility in any field of technology through human intervention. .

finally , to combat overbroad patent claims , the second tillis - coons proposal would alter the functional claiming rules under section 112 ( f ) , which permits patentees to claim their invention in functional terms as opposed to reciting specific physical structures .

in particular , the draft bill provides that if any patent claim element is "expressed as a specified function without the recital of structure , material , or acts in support thereof," then that claim element will be limited to the "corresponding structure , material , or acts described in the specification" and their equivalents .

consistent with a recent decision of the federal circuit , this language would clarify that section 112 ( f ) applies to any claim element that fails to sufficiently recite a structure for performing a function .

this change would arguably make it more difficult for a patentee to avoid the limiting effects of section 112 ( f ) , even if the words "means for" are not used in the claim language .

as with the first proposal , reactions to the second tillis - coons proposal from patent law stakeholders were mixed .

critics of the alice / mayo framework generally applauded the draft bill as bringing much needed clarity and certainty to the law of patent eligibility , particularly with respect to biotechnology innovation .

opponents of the draft bill expressed concern that changes to the alice / mayo framework would eliminate an important tool against unmeritorious patent litigation .

critics also questioned the necessity and advisability of such a sweeping change to section 101 law .

both supporters and opponents raised concerns about potential ambiguities in the proposed definition of "useful," particularly the terms "human intervention," "practical utility," and "field of technology. .

stakeholders also debated the specific practical effects of the legislative changes at the hearings , such as the effect of elimination of the judicial exceptions on basic scientific research .

one notable concern , raised by the american civil liberties union in opposition to the draft bill , was that the second tillis - coons proposal , by abrogating the myriad decision , would permit the patenting of human genes .

several witnesses denied that the draft bill would lead to that result because of the bill's "human intervention" requirement or other patent law principles .

for their part , senators tillis and coons made clear that they have "no intention" of overruling the holding of myriad that no one may patent "genes as they exist in the human body. .

following the hearings , senators tillis and coons indicated that what they heard reinforced their view that "patent eligibility is broken and desperately needs to be repaired," and that there is a "necessity for congress to intervene" to bring greater clarity to section 101 .

moving forward , they indicated they were "considering a provision that would exempt research and experimentation from infringement liability" in response to concerns about inhibiting scientific research .

the senators also indicated that they would continue to welcome input from all stakeholders and would seek to "clarify" the proposal regarding the eligibility of gene patents , and potentially "sharpen the 'field of technology' requirement to ensure that critical advances like artificial intelligence and medical diagnostics qualify [as patent - eligible]. .

at the same time , the senators expressed their view that certain concepts should remain patent - ineligible under a revised section 101 , such as "economic transactions or social interactions. .

observers expect a revised formal bill reflecting these provisions this fall .
