the bush administration's fy2007 budget request was released in february 2006 .

the request followed the reorganization of appropriations subcommittees in 2005 , in which the energy and water development appropriations bill acquired department of energy ( doe ) programs that previously had been included in the appropriations bill for interior and related agencies .

including these programs , the requested amount for fy2007 energy and water development totaled $29.45 billion .

for fy2006 , $36.73 billion was appropriated for comparable programs ( including $6.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the corps of engineers ) .

the house appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development marked up an fy2007 appropriations bill may 11 , and the full committee approved the bill ( h.r .

5427 , h.rept .

109-474 ) may 17 .

the house passed the measure may 24 .

the senate appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development approved its version of h.r .

5427 on june 27 , and the full committee reported it out june 29 ( s.rept .

109-274 ) .

the senate did not act on the bill in 2006 .

energy and water development programs were funded for fy2007 in the revised continuing appropriations resolution , 2007 ( h.j.res .

20 , p.l .

110-5 ) .

on march 16 , 2007 , doe submitted its "operating plan" to congress , detailing funding for individual programs not specifically identified in p.l .

110-5 .

the energy and water development bill has historically included funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , most of doe , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

with the reorganization of the appropriations subcommittees in 2005 , doe programs that had been funded in the interior and related agencies bill were transferred to the energy and water development bill .

the bush administration's fy2007 request was $29.455 billion for all of the programs now included in the energy and water bill , compared with $36.726 billion appropriated for fy2006 , including $6.6 billion in emergency funding for the corps of engineers following the katrina hurricane disaster .

h.r .

5427 , as passed by the house may 24 , 2006 , would have appropriated $30.017 billion for energy and water development programs , $546 million more than the requested amount .

the senate version of h.r .

5427 , as reported by the senate appropriations committee , would have appropriated $31.238 billion .

the continuing resolution ( p.l .

110-5 ) appropriated $30.265 billion .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2000 to fy2006 and the requested amount for fy2007 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the four titles .

it also lists several "scorekeeping" adjustments of accounts within the four titles , reflecting various expenditures or sources of revenue besides appropriated funds .

these adjustments affect the total amount appropriated in the bill but are not included in the totals of the individual titles .

amounts listed in this report are derived from the administration's fy2007 congressional budget requests , from h.rept .

109-474 , from s.rept .

109-274 , and from p.l .

110-5 .

for title iii , some figures from doe's fy2007 operating plan were used .

for the fy2007 corps of engineers budget , the administration requested $4.733 billion , a decrease of $0.595 billion from the enacted appropriation for fy2006 ( not including emergency supplementals ) .

the house - passed bill would have appropriated $4.984 billion .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $5.139 billion .

p.l .

110-5 appropriated $5.239 billion .

the administration asked for $923.8 million for fy2007 for the department of the interior ( doi ) programs included in the energy and water development bill: the bureau of reclamation and the central utah project .

this would be have been a decrease of $131 million from the fy2006 funding level .

the house bill would have appropriated $941.0 million .

the senate appropriations committee recommendation was $1.0673 billion .

p.l .

110-5 appropriated $1.011 billion .

the fy2007 request for doe programs was $24.075 billion , approximately the same amount appropriated for the previous year .

the major activities in the doe budget are energy research and development , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs .

also included in the doe total is funding of doe's programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , and energy statistics , which had historically been included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

the house bill would have funded these programs at $24.374 billion .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $24.725 billion .

p.l .

110-5 appropriated $23.617 billion .

the fy2007 request for funding of the independent agencies in title iv of the bill was $249 million , compared with $268 million appropriated for fy2006 .

the house bill would have appropriated $228 million .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $306 million .

p.l .

110-5 appropriated $306 million .

tables 4 through 15 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2005-fy2006 .

under p.l .

110-5 , the fy2007 energy and water development appropriations for the corps is $5,340.2 million , which is close to the enacted amount for fy2006 ( not including supplemental funds ) .

bill language specified the total amount for the corps' various civil works budget accounts .

guidelines to the agency for how to distribute each account's funds across the hundreds of corps projects usually are laid out in congressional reports accompanying appropriations bills , with funding for only 10 to 30 projects , on average , specified in bill language .

p.l .

110-5 eliminated the provisions in the fy2006 bill language related to funding of specific projects ; the reports accompanying p.l .

110-5 did not provide guidance on how to distribute each account's money across the portfolio of corps - authorized projects .

consequently , the administration had greater flexibility and discretion on how much to allocate to authorized projects in fy2007 than it has had in most fiscal years .

reprogramming and contracting restrictions enacted with the fy2006 appropriations , p.l .

109-103 , continue into fy2007 under p.l .

110-5 .

the corps reported its fy2007 work plan to the appropriations committees on march 19 , 2007 .

the work plan was developed so that generally only projects that received money in fy2006 were funded , and generally the administration's fy2007 budget request was the basis for the amounts allocated to projects .

the department of the interior initially requested that congress provide an increase in funding for the central utah project completion account and reduction for the bureau of reclamation ( bor ) for fy2007 ; however , the final fy2007 funding level is the same as that enacted for fy2006 .

until last year , the energy and water development bill included funding for most , but not all , of doe's programs ; other doe programs were funded in the interior and related agencies bill .

major doe activities historically funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs .

the subcommittee reorganization of the appropriations committees last year transferred doe's programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics , formerly included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill , to the energy and water development bill .

including the transferred programs , the total request for title iii for fy2007 was $24.0748 billion , slightly more than appropriated for fy2006 ( excluding the adjustments noted in table 3 ) .

the house - passed bill , h.r .

5427 , would have appropriated $24.3735 billion .

the senate appropriations committee version of h.r .

5427 recommended $24.7251 billion .

p.l .

110-5 appropriated $23.617 billion .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .
