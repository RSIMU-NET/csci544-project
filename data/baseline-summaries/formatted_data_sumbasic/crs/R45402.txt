a "lame duck" session of congress takes place whenever one congress meets after its successor is elected but before the term of the current congress ends .

from 1940 to 2016 , there were 21 lame duck sessions .

the most recent la me duck session , which commenced on november 13 , 2018 , is not included in the data presented in this report .

of the 21 lame duck sessions examined , seven followed an election that switched the majority party in one or both chambers .

that is , the party that controlled the house or senate during the lame duck session did not retain its majority into the next congress .

tab l e 1 displays these sessions , occurring in 1948 , 1954 , 1980 , 1994 , 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 .

like the 2018 lame duck session , three lame duck sessions ( 1940 to 2016 ) followed a majority - changing midterm election during a president's first term of office .

in each of these sessions ( 1954 , 1994 , 2010 ) , the same party had controlled the white house , house , and senate prior to the election .

this report provides additional information on the 1954 , 1994 , and 2010 lame duck sessions .

lame duck sessions have been held for a variety of reasons .

their primary purpose is to complete action on legislation .

they have also been used to prevent recess appointments and pocket vetoes , to consider motions of censure or impeachment , to keep congress assembled on a standby basis , or to approve nominations ( senate only ) .

in recent years , most lame duck sessions have focused on program authorizations , trade - related measures , appropriations , and the budget .

critics of lame duck sessions object to recently defeated members or parties managing and acting on the legislative agenda .

proponents consider these post - election sessions to be useful for lawmaking at the end of a congress .

in the last two decades , lame duck sessions have become a routine occurrence during even - numbered years , regardless of which party is in the majority before the election .

prior to 1933 , the last regular session of congress was always a lame duck session .

however , the 20 th amendment to the constitution changed the dates of the congressional term from beginning and ending on march 4 of odd - numbered years to january 3 of odd - numbered years .

as a result , lame duck sessions are no longer an automatic feature of congress .

today , lame duck sessions consist of any portion of a regular second session that falls after the november election in an even - numbered year and before the next congress commences on january 3 .

between 1935 and 1998 , one or both houses held a lame duck session in 12 of the 32 congresses ( 74 th - 105 th ) .

in contrast , both houses held a lame duck session in every congress from the 106 th through the 114 th ( 2000-2016 ) .

these sessions are now an anticipated — although not guaranteed — biennial event .

from 1935 to 2016 , seven lame duck sessions followed an election that changed the majority party in one or both chambers of congress .

two occurred during a presidential election year ( 1948 , 1980 ) , two followed a midterm election during the second term of a president ( 2006 and 2014 ) , and three followed a midterm election during the first term of a president ( 1954 , 1994 , 2010 ) .

tabl e 1 displays lame duck sessions that convened after an election that changed the majority party in either the house or the senate .

the table identifies the number of seats the majority party lost as well as the key measures approved during the post - election periods .

in each of the lame duck sessions that followed a midterm election in a president's first term in office , the same party controlled the white house , the house , and the senate .

below , more information is provided on the 1954 ( republican - controlled ) , 1994 ( democratic - controlled ) , and 2010 ( democratic - controlled ) lame duck sessions of congress .

in the 1954 midterm election , the republican party lost its majorities in both chambers during president eisenhower's first term in office .

after the election , the senate reconvened solely to consider disciplinary actions against republican senator joseph r. mccarthy .

 ( the house remained adjourned for the remainder of the 83 rd congress. ) .

on november 9 , a select investigative committee reported a resolution of censure , which was subsequently debated and amended on the senate floor .

on december 2 , the senate approved the two - count resolution censuring senator mccarthy for behavior related to his inquiry into alleged communist influence in the federal government .

two years into president clinton's presidency , the 1994 midterm gave republicans control of the house and senate for the next congress .

on november 29 , both houses reconvened in order to consider the general agreement on tariffs and trade .

the measure , which had stalled in the senate prior to the election , received bipartisan support in the lame duck .

the house passed the bill on the first day of the session , and the senate passed it on december 1 .
