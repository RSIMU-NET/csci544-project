action on fy2000 supplemental funding was pending as congress left for the memorial day break .

the president , through the office of management and budget ( omb ) isrequired to submit to congress , annually , the budget of the united statesgovernment .

on february 1 , 1999 , the budget for fy2000 was submitted .

 ( 1 ) congress has established a procedure under which it passes a concurrent resolution which establishes the congressional budget for the government and setsforth budgetary levels for several years in the future .

 ( 2 ) the house and senateappropriations committees then allocate the discretionary funding levels ( 302 ( b ) allocations ) to each of the subcommittees .

since passage of the fy2000 budgetresolution , the committees have changed the allocations several times .

 ( 3 ) thecongressional budget office has offered spending and revenue options in the contextof budgetary discipline .

 ( 4 ) appropriations for the department of the treasury , in addition to funding the operations of the department , fund the work of a group of law enforcementorganizations , which include the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms , thecustoms service , the secret service , the financial crimes enforcement network,and the federal law enforcement training center .

treasury appropriations alsocover the internal revenue service , the financial management service , and thebureau of public debt .

for the most part , the u.s .

postal service has become self - supporting .

federal contributions are limited to payments to the postal service fund to compensate forrevenues forgone ( eg , free postal service for the blind ) .

appropriations for the executive office of the president provide salaries and expenses for the white house offices , operation of the residences of the presidentand vice president , and most other agencies within the executive office of thepresident ( eop ) .

organizations such as the council of economic advisers , thenational security council , the office of management and budget , and the officeof national drug control policy ( ondcp ) are funded through these provisions .

specific funding for drug control initiatives is provided for distribution by ondcp .

among the independent agencies financed through p.l .

106-58 are the federal election commission , the general services administration , the national archivesand records administration , the office of personnel management , the office ofspecial counsel , and the u.s. tax court .

p.l .

106-58 provides funding for federal child care facilities .

that provision generated considerable concern among some members and was a point of contentionas the conference agreement was discussed .

the senate , in passing s. 1282 , addeda title to the bill for the purpose of ensuring "the safety and availability of child carecenters in federal facilities. .

according to the sponsors of the amendment , this amendment will require all child care services located in federal facilities to meet , at the very least , the same level ofhealth and safety standards required of other child care centers in the samegeographical area .

 ( 5 ) the house bill , as passed , did not contain all of the child care provisions included in the senate amendment .

however , it did contain the same language addressing theissue of improving the affordability of child care for federal employees .

anamendment similar to this year's senate amendment was offered to the fy1999treasury bill , adopted in the senate , and fell in conference .

the issue is discussedfurther later in this report .

among other provisions adopted by the senate , july 1 , the following would convey federal land to the columbia hospital forwomen ; amend the social security act to require the secretary ofhealth and human services to provide bonus grants to high performance statesbased on certain criteria and collect data to evaluate the outcome of welfarereform ; prohibit the use of funds to pay for an abortion or to pay for theadministrative expenses in connection with certain health plans that provide coveragefor abortions ; provide additional funding to reduce methamphetamine usagein high intensity drug trafficking areas ; increase u.s. customs service funding to enable the hiring of500 new inspectors to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the u.s. and to facilitatelegitimate cross - border trade and commerce ; and require the secretary of the treasury to develop an internet sitewhere a taxpayer may generate a receipt for an income tax payment which itemizesthe portion of the payment which is allocable to various government spendingcategories .

the senate rejected the amendment which would have required the inclusion of alcohol abuse by minors in the ongoing national anti - drug media campaign foryouth .

the house narrowly passed h.r .

2490 ( 210-209 ) on july 15 , 1999 .

the house committee , in an effort to bring total spending down to fy1999's freeze level , hadreduced the subcommittee discretionary funding levels by $249 million .

that actioncontributed to many members withdrawing support of the bill .

the programs affected by that reduction are treasury - wide systems and capital improvements,internal revenue service ( irs ) processing , assistance , and management , irs tax lawenforcement , irs information systems , and general services administration repairsand alterations .

several amendments were offered during consideration of h.r .

2490 .

those subject to voice vote were an amendment to prohibit the import of any children'ssleepwear without the labels required by the flammability standards issued by theconsumer product safety commission was agreed to ; an amendment to change the language of the provisionrequiring contraceptive coverage in the fehbp was agreed to,amended ; an amendment to provide $3 million for grants to investigatemoney laundering and related financial crimes ; and an amendment to establish that no funds may be used toenforce any prohibition on women breastfeeding their children in federal buildingsor on federal property .

those subject to roll call votes were an amendment to strike language limiting funds availabilitythrough the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) - - failed ; an amendment to strike language increasing the president'ssalary - - failed ; an amendment to amend the amendment offered to change thelanguage of the provision requiring contraceptive coverage in the fehbp - - agreedto ; and an amendment to limit use of the exchange stabilizationfund - - failed .

several house members offered amendments and then subsequently withdrew them after receiving assurances from the managers of the bill that the issues wouldeither be addressed in conference or would be pursued with the appropriate executivebranch administrators .

among those were amendments to provide for the release offrozen assets of a foreign state to satisfy all pending court judgements ; to require anu.s .

customs service report on the conduct of strip searches , including data on theethnicity , gender , nationality , and race of the individuals subject to the searches ; torequire that any u.s. customs officer conducting a strip search be of the same genderas the subject of the search ; to study the safety of red - dye kerosene fuel available toelderly and low income individuals ; and to allow enrollees in the federal employeehealth benefits program the option of choosing dental , optometry , infertility , orprescription drug benefits in lieu of mandated contraceptive coverage .

an amendment to prevent members of congress from receiving a pay adjustment in january 2000 was not in order , under the rule ( h.res .

246 ) for h.r.2490 , and was not offered on the floor .

the act provides increase in the president'ssalary , to $400,000 , effective january 20 , 2001 .

compensation issues are discussedelsewhere in this report .

pursuant to the provisions of p.l .

106-113 ( 6 ) ,the consolidated appropriationsact for fy2000 , agencies must cut their fy2000 funding by 0.38% .

as part of thefy2001 budget submission , expected in early february , the office of managementand budget ( omb ) will report on the specific reductions in the accounts .

omb issued a fact sheet ( 2000-01-10 omb fact sheet , january 10 , 2000 ) in which the administration stated that the law stipulated that 0.38 percent in savingsneeded to come from each and every department .

however , within each department,it provided latitude to protect high - priority programs as long as the dollar figureamounting to 0.38 percent was achieved provided certain other conditions were met .

omb provided guidance regarding general principles the agencies should use toidentify cuts: the 0.38 cut must not be imposed across the board , but targeted to reflect areas of higher and lower priority ; reductions need to come from least criticalfunding ; reductions should be considered from funding that congressenacted above the president's request , wherever possible , no reductions in force frompersonnel .

according to omb , the law also imposed the condition that no reduction in any single program could exceed 15% of its total .

in other words , the law did not permitan entire program to be eliminated in order to count toward the savings necessary fora given department .

at least 85% of the funding total for the program had to remainintact .

among those accounts identified as being fully protected are the atf youthgun initiatives and secret service salaries and expenses .

 ( 20 ) for the purposes of legislative history on the fy1999 omnibus funding act , the reader is reminded that p.l .

105-277 ( 21 ) was aproduct of using the transportationappropriation bill ( h.r .

4328 ) as the vehicle for creating the larger bill .

the treasury and general government appropriation was subject to congressionalaction as h.r .

4104 ( 105th congress ) prior to being included in theomnibus measure .

table 1 .

status of fy2000 appropriations for the treasury , postal service , executive office of the president and generalgovernmen .

p.l .

106-58 permits the use of executive branch agency funds ( otherwiseavailable for salaries ) to provide child care services for low - income federalemployees ( section 643 ) .

the senate , in passing s. 1282 , added a title to the bill ( amendment no .

1197 ) that would have established new requirements for child care facilities operated byfederal agencies , including legislative and judicial branch agencies , for theiremployees .

the provision would require that executive facilities meet state or locallicensing standards within six months of the legislation's enactment , and comply with ( or have made substantial progress towards complying with ) standards set by a stateor nationally recognized accreditation entity within three years of enactment .

the senate bill also would have required regulations , set by the administrator of general services , establishing health and safety standards for federal agency childcare programs .

legislative agency facilities would be required to meet a state ornationally recognized accreditation entity's standards within one year of the bill'senactment .

if the legislative facility does not maintain accreditation , it must followregulations no less stringent than those of executive agency facilities .

judicialbranch facilities would also be required to meet regulations ( issued by theadministrative office of the united states courts ) pertaining to licensing andaccreditation that are no less stringent than those of executive branch agencies .

executive branch agencies would be authorized to use agency funds to provide childcare for employees and to improve the affordability of such care for low - incomeemployees .

the amendment would also authorize $900,000 in fiscal year 2000 , andsuch sums thereafter , for an interagency council of federal agencies to share bestpractices and coordinate policy with regard to child care .

a similar amendment wasoffered to the fy1999 treasury bill , adopted in the senate , and fell in conference .

h.r .

2490 , as passed by the house , july 15 , 1999 , included the provision ( also included in s. 1282 ) allowing executive branch federal agencies ( not including thegeneral accounting office ) to use agency funds to provide child care services , in afacility owned or leased by the agency , for employees of the agency , provided thesefunds are used to improve the affordability of child care for low - income federalemployees .

it did not contain the other child care provisions included in the senatebill .

however , on july 19 , 1999 , the senate incorporated the provisions of s. 1282 as an amendment ( title vii ) to h.r .

2490 , and passed this companion measure,numbered h.r .

2490 , in lieu of s. 1282 .

in conference , the conferees agreed to delete title vii of h.r .

2490 .

the conference report ( h.rept .

106-319 ) filed on september 14 , 1999 , and subsequentlyapproved by the house and senate , does not contain all of the federal child careprovisions originally proposed in the senate's bill , s. 1282 .

instead , the conferencereport includes only the provisions contained in the original house proposal,permitting the use of agency funds ( otherwise available for salaries ) to provide childcare services for low - income federal employees .

public law 106-58 , has some significant pay provisions and is gaining a gooddeal of attention by provisions that are absent .

specific rates for all affected paysystems will be promulgated in late december or early january through an executiveorder .

in summary and prior to scorekeeping adjustments by the congressional budgetoffice ( cbo ) , the administration has requested a total of $27,997,054,000 foraccounts within this appropriation .

the funding enacted for fy2000 under p.l.106-58 totals $27,972,418,000 .

the house and senate data for fy1999 enacted are different .

the house shows $27,922,712,000 as a grand total in budget authority and the senate shows$27,915,604,000 .

using either figure , the fy2000 levels approved by the housesubcommittee and the senate committee represent an increase over the fy1999enacted level of $26,978,249,000 .

the house treasury appropriationssubcommittee recommended a fy2000 funding level of $28,095,811,000 .

and thesenate committee on appropriations reported a funding level of $27,737,971,000 .

 ( 37 ) fy2000 enacted mandatory funding is $14,533,811,000 , according to house documents , using cbo scorekeeping data .

that figure corresponds to the fy2000request for mandatories , compared to $13,656,152,000 enacted for fy1999. .

according to the house documents , the fy2000 request for discretionary funding is $13,926,438,000 , an increase over $13,465,985,000 , fy1999 enacted .

the fy2000 enacted is $13,706,000 .

the house committee mark for discretionaryfunding was $13,466,056,000 and the senate would have provided $13,434,138,000in discretionary funding .

the administration is shown to have requested$132,127,000 for the crime trust fund as compared to the fy1999 enacted level of$132,000,000 .

the fy2000 enacted level is $132,000,000 .

the house committeerecommended that funding level .

the senate , however , would have increased theamount to $194,000,000 in this account .
