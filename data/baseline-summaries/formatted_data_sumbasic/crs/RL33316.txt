since the early 1990s , u.s. - vietnam relations have gradually been normalizing , as the end of the cold war erased the need for the united states to attempt to isolate the communist government that defeated the u.s. - backed south vietnam in 1975 .

currently , factors generating interest in the relationship include growing trade and investment flows , the large ethnic vietnamese community in the united states , the legacy of the vietnam war , increasing interaction through multilateral institutions , and shared concern over the rising strength of china .

u.s. goals with respect to vietnam include developing more amicable relations , bringing the country more into the mainstream of nations , opening markets for u.s. trade and investment , furthering human rights and democracy within the country , and maintaining u.s. influence in southeast asia .

the array of policy instruments the united states employs in relations with vietnam includes trade incentives , foreign assistance , cooperation in international organizations , diplomatic pressures , and educational outreach .

for vietnam's part , since the mid - 1980s , hanoi essentially has pursued a three - pronged national strategy , in which the united states has loomed large: ( 1 ) prioritize economic development through market - oriented reforms ; ( 2 ) pursue good relations with southeast asian neighbors that provide vietnam with economic partners and diplomatic friends ; and ( 3 ) repair and deepen its relationship with china , while simultaneously buttressing this by seeking a great power counterweight to chinese ambition .

there are a number of strategic and tactical reasons behind vietnam's efforts to upgrade its relationship with the united states .

some speculate that vietnamese policymakers seek counterweights to chinese ambitions in southeast asia .

vietnam also needs a favorable international economic environment — for which it sees u.s. support as critical — to enable the country's economy to continue to expand .

additionally , the vietnamese undoubtedly hoped to smooth the way for president bush's trip to hanoi in 2006 , when vietnam hosted the asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) forum summit .

finally , vietnam had an interest in facilitating its application to join the world trade organization ( wto ) , a move that required u.s. approval .

vietnam joined the wto in january 2007 .

the 2005-2006 period also marked a time of positive bilateral discussions of human rights issues .

ultimately , the pace and extent of the improvement in bilateral relations likely is limited by several factors , including hanoi's concerns about upsetting beijing , u.s. scrutiny of vietnam's human rights record , vietnamese conservatives' historical wariness of working with the united states , and vietnamese suspicions that the united states' long - term goal is to end the vietnamese communist party's ( vcp ) monopoly on power through a "peaceful evolution" strategy .

throughout the process of normalizing relations with vietnam , congress has played a significant role .

not only has congress provided oversight and guidance , but it has shaped the interaction by imposing constraints , providing relevant funding , or by its approval process for agreements .

this report provides an overview of u.s. relations with vietnam , including policy issues , the economic and political situation in vietnam , and a list of pertinent legislation .

the key issues in the relationship include how far to pursue strategic and military - to - military ties ; whether to impose curbs on surges in imports of certain items from vietnam ; how much and what types of bilateral economic assistance to provide ; whether and how to try to improve the human rights situation in vietnam ; and how to clear up legacy issues from the vietnam war .

u.s. - vietnam diplomatic and economic relations were virtually nonexistent for more than 15 years following communist north vietnam's victory in 1975 over u.s. ally south vietnam .

during that time , the united states maintained a trade embargo and suspended foreign assistance to unified vietnam .

ever since communist north vietnamese forces defeated u.s. - backed south vietnam in 1975 , reunified vietnam has been struggling with how to maintain a balance between two often contradictory goals — maintaining ideological purity and promoting economic development .

for the first decade after reunification , the emphasis was on the former .

by the mid - 1980s , disastrous economic conditions and diplomatic isolation led the country to adopt a more pragmatic line , enshrined in the doi moi ( renovation ) economic reforms of 1986 .

under doi moi , the government gave farmers greater control over what they produce , abandoned central state planning , cut subsidies to state enterprises , reformed the price system , and opened the country to foreign direct investment ( fdi ) .
