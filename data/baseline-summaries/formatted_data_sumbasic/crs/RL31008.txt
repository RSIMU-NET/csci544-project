on december 18 , 2001 , president bush signed the fy2002 department of transportation andrelated agencies conference agreement ( h.rept .

107-308 ; p.l .

107-87 ) appropriating a total of$59.588 billion ( a 2.5% increase above the fy2001 enacted level ) .

the enacted bill provides $507million more than in the house bill and $391 million less than the senate bill .

at $32.895 billion,the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) receives slightly less than in fy 2001 .

the federalrailroad administration ( fra ) is funded at $734 million , $21 million less than enacted in fy2001 .

the other major agencies all get increases .

the federal aviation administration ( faa ) budgetincreases roughly 6% to $13.295 billion ; the federal transit administration ( fta ) budget increases8% to $6.747 billion ; and the coast guard budget receives an increase of 12% to $5.031 billion .

the september 11 , 2001 , simultaneous hijacking of four airliners from three different airports and the enormous loss of life that resulted from the terrorists' suicide - bomber tactics had a quickimpact on transportation appropriations .

congress responded to the terrorist attacks by passingthe 2001 emergency supplemental appropriations act for recovery from and response to terroristattacks on the united states ( p.l .

107-38 ) .

the bill provides $40 billion to pay the costs of a varietyof responses including "providing increased transportation security. .

the funds may be transferredto any authorized federal activity to meet the purposes of the act .

as of this writing , roughly $1.9billion has been approved for transfer to the department of transportation ( dot ) .

the length ofavailability of these funds varies depending on the purpose of the spending .

transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget .

it is also consideredpart of the discretionary budget .

funding for the dot budget is derived from a number of sources.the majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds .

the remainder of dotfunding is from federal treasury general funds .

the transportation trust funds include: the highwaytrust fund , the transit account of the highway trust fund , the airport and airway trust fund , and theinland waterways trust fund .

all of these accounts derive their respective funding from specificexcise and other taxes .

in fy2002 trust funds accounted for well over two - thirds of total federal transportation spending .

together , highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dotappropriations .

most highway and the majority of transit programs are funded with contract authorityderived by the link to the highway trust fund .

this is very significant from a budgeting standpoint .

contract authority is tantamount to , but does not actually involve , entering into a contract to pay fora project at some future date .

under this arrangement , specified in title 23 u.s.c. , authorized fundsare automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated withoutappropriations legislation ; although appropriations are required to make outlays at some future dateto cover these obligations .

where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process , transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation .

that is , the authority tospend for the largest programs under their control already exists , and the mechanism to obligatefunds for these programs also is in place .

prior to the fy1999 dot appropriations act , changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes inbudget / contract authority and by placing limitations on obligations .

the principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds to congressional budgetagreements .
