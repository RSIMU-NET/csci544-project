the annual cjs appropriations act provides funding for the departments of commerce and justice , the science agencies , and several related agencies .

appropriations for the department of commerce include funding for agencies such as the census bureau , the u.s. patent and trademark office , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , and the national institute of standards and technology .

appropriations for the department of justice provide funding for agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation , the bureau of prisons , the u.s .

marshals , the drug enforcement administration , and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives , along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state , local , and tribal governments .

the vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .

the annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the legal services corporation and the equal employment opportunity commission .

 figure 1 shows the total appropriations , in both nominal and inflation - adjusted dollars , for cjs for fy2006-fy2015 ( more detailed historical appropriations data can be found in table 2 ) .

the data show that nominal appropriations for cjs increased starting with fy2006 .

appropriations for cjs peaked in fy2009 at $76.782 billion if emergency supplemental appropriations from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) are included .

if arra funding is not considered , appropriations peaked in fy2010 at $69.146 billion .

arra provided a substantial increase in appropriations for fy2009 .

the $15.992 billion congress appropriated for cjs under arra was equal to approximately 25% of the amount congress provided for it through regular appropriations .

appropriations for cjs decreased in each of the three fiscal years after fy2010 .

nominal appropriations for cjs were relatively flat in fy2014 and fy2015 , though appropriations in both fy2014 and fy2015 were higher than they were in fy2013 .

if not for sequestration , which cut nearly $4 billion out of the total amount congress appropriated for cjs for fy2013 , funding for cjs would have held steady at approximately $61 billion between fy2011 and fy2015 .

after adjusting for inflation , appropriations for cjs for fy2013-fy2015 were generally at the same level they were in fy2006 .

figure 2 shows total appropriations for cjs for fy2006-fy2015 by major component ( i.e. , the departments of commerce and justice , the national aeronautics and space administration , and the national science foundation ) .

the data show that the increases in cjs appropriations in fy2009 ( not including arra funding ) , fy2010 , and fy2011 resulted from congress appropriating more funding for the department of commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census .

while decreased appropriations for the department of commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in cjs appropriations since fy2010 , there have also been cuts in funding for doj and nasa .

doj's fy2015 appropriation is 4.4% below its fy2010 appropriation , and nasa's fy2014 appropriation was 3.8% below its fy2010 appropriation .

however , even though nasa received less in fy2015 than it did in fy2010 , nasa's fy2015 appropriation is $1.379 billion more than its fy2006 appropriation .

in addition , even with cuts to doj's appropriation since fy2010 , congress still appropriated $5.316 billion more for doj in fy2015 than it did in fy2006 .

appropriations for doj increased because congress appropriated increasing amounts for federal law enforcement and counter - terrorism efforts ( eg , the federal bureau of investigation ) , and for the office of the federal detention trustee and the bureau of prisons to cover expenses associated with a rising number of federal detainees and prisoners .

funding for the nsf has , for the most part , steadily increased over the past 10 fiscal years .

the nsf's appropriation increased in 8 of the 10 fiscal years between fy2006 and fy2015 , and the decrease in the nsf's funding for fy2013 was the result of sequestration .

increased funding for the nsf has mostly resulted from congress increasing funding for the nsf's research and related activities account .
