this report discusses the fy2017 budget request for the u.s. department of energy's ( doe's ) office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) as proposed by the obama administration in february 2016 , the amended fy2017 appropriations request proposed by the trump administration in march 2017 , and the status of fy2017 congressional appropriations for eere .

it also discusses the trump administration's fy2018 budget blueprint released in march 2017 with regard to eere .

on march 16 , 2017 , the trump administration requested an $18 billion decrease in nondefense appropriations for fy2017 .

it is not clear how such a cut would apply to eere .

additionally , the administration released a budget blueprint for fy2018 .

the blueprint states that funding for eere would focus on "limited , early - stage applied energy research and development activities where the federal role is stronger. .

the blueprint requests $28.0 billion for doe , a decrease of $1.7 billion , or 5.6% , from the fy2017 annualized continuing resolution level .

the blueprint does not specify how much of the proposed $1.7 billion cut would apply to eere programs .

the blueprint specifies two program eliminations: the weatherization assistance program and the state energy program , which received fy2016 appropriations of $211.6 million and $50.0 million , respectively ( see table 1 ) .

in february 2016 , the obama administration requested both discretionary funding ( $2.9 billion ) and mandatory funding ( $1.3 billion ) for eere for fy2017 , for a total of $4.2 billion .

the total $4.2 billion request is an increase of $2.2 billion ( 104% ) from the enacted fy2016 level of $2.1 billion .

the obama administration's discretionary portion of the fy2017 request was 40% higher than the fy2016 enacted level ( $2.1 billion ) .

the senate - passed energy and water appropriations bill for fy2017 included $2.1 billion for eere .

the funding level congress decides to provide could impact goals set by eere , including sustainable transportation goals ( eg , vehicle electrification and biofuels ) , renewable energy goals ( eg , grid modernization for solar energy , enhanced geothermal technologies ) , and energy efficiency goals ( eg , establishment of one additional clean energy manufacturing innovation institute ) .

it also could affect eere's involvement in the proposed 21 st century clean transportation plan and eere assistance with industry competitiveness .

this report does not discuss the opportunities , challenges , economic value , or commercial status of the various renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives selected by eere , nor does it delve into the goals of the individual eere programs or congressional oversight of certain eere issues .

eere receives its appropriations from the annual energy and water development ( e&w ) appropriations bill .

during the last several years of the obama administration , the budget request was to increase funding to support eere programs and objectives .

congress's response has been to provide funding at levels lower than what was requested .

appropriations for eere have averaged $1.86 billion annually for the last six years in current dollars ( see table 1 ) .

the appropriations are split into four major categories: sustainable transportation , energy efficiency , renewable energy , and corporate support ( eg , program administration ) .

from fy2011 to fy2016 , approximately 65% of the appropriations were spent on sustainable transportation and energy efficiency , while approximately 25% of the appropriations were spent on renewable energy and approximately 12% was spent on corporate support .

the obama administration requested $4.2 billion to support eere programs and objectives for fy2017 ( $2.9 billion in discretionary funding and $1.3 billion in mandatory funding ) .

the total $4.2 billion request would represent an increase of $2.2 billion ( 104% ) from the enacted fy2016 level of $2.1 billion .

the obama administration requested significantly more funding for eere compared to the fy2016 enacted appropriations — at least an $829 million increase , and possibly a $2.1 billion increase if the mandatory funding request is taken into account .

the funding requested would support numerous programs and activities .

the $1.3 billion in mandatory funding requested to support the 21 st century clean transportation plan is part of a multiagency effort that depends on the enactment of a new revenue source .

it could be a significant undertaking for eere to implement the clean transportation plan's activities in addition to current responsibilities given that the funding requested for the plan would represent 64% of the fy2016 eere enacted appropriations .

in addition , it is possible that the plan may involve efforts previously dismissed by congress .

for instance , eere stated that it would use the mandatory funding , in part , to "establish regional fueling infrastructure to support the deployment of low - carbon fuels. .

it is not known if eere would consider blender pumps to be a part of this regional fueling infrastructure .

if so , congress rejected a related effort in the 2014 farm bill ( p.l .

113-79 ) by forbidding the use of renewable energy for america program ( reap ) funds to support blender pump installation .

congress may want to examine what impact such a program may have on clean transportation expansion , clean energy sources , or conventional energy sources ; how quickly such a program may be implemented ; and how effective such a program would be given its scope and that multiple participants — government and others , with various objectives — need to be involved to achieve the proposed outcomes .

the senate passed the energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 ( h.r .

2028 ) on may 12 , 2016 .

the bill would have provided $2.1 billion for eere , $825 million below the obama administration's fy2017 discretionary request and $3.8 million above the fy2016 enacted level .

on may 26 , 2016 , the house rejected an energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act for 2017 ( h.r .

5055 ) .

the bill would have provided $1.8 billion for eere , $1.1 billion below the obama administration's fy2017 discretionary request and $244 million below the fy2016 enacted level .

funding is currently being provided by a continuing resolution .
