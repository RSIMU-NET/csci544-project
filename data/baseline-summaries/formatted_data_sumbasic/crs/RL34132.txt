the fy2008 agriculture appropriations bill was combined with 10 other appropriations bills into the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

the consolidated bill passed the house on december 17 , 2007 , the senate on december 18 , 2007 , and was signed by the president on december 26 , 2007 .

the act provides $90.8 billion in total funds for agriculture and related agencies: $18.1 billion in official discretionary appropriations , and $72.7 billion in mandatory funds .

the discretionary amount is 1.6% greater than the amount in fy2007 ( +$281 million ) , although "gross" discretionary appropriations actually available to agencies grew 5.3% to $19.5 billion .

mandatory spending decreased about $7 billion overall from fy2007 .

mandatory transfers for the farm commodity programs decreased $10 billion because of less need for price - triggered income support , while food stamp benefits rose about $2.2 billion ( +4.2% ) .

the act also extends most provisions of the 2002 farm bill until march 15 , 2008 .

the extension is expected to be sufficient for conference negotiations to resolve differences between the house - and senate - passed farm bills .

the farm bill extension states that , unless otherwise excepted , 2002 farm bill provisions shall continue until march 15 , 2008 .

among the relatively short list of programs that are not extended are the farm commodity programs for the 2008 crop year .

the agriculture appropriations bill includes all of usda ( except the forest service ) , plus the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services , and the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) .

the appropriations bill for agriculture and related agencies covers all of usda except for the forest service .

this amounts to about 94% of usda's total appropriation .

the forest service is funded through the interior appropriations bill .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) regulates the safety of foods and the safety and effectiveness of drugs , biologics ( eg , vaccines ) , and medical devices .

now part of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , fda was originally housed in the department of agriculture .

the agriculture appropriation subcommittees still keep jurisdiction over the fda budget .

fda's budget has two components: direct appropriations and user fees .

for fy2008 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) provides a direct appropriation of $1.72 billion to fda , $142.5 million ( 9.1% ) more than the fy2007 enacted appropriation and $76 million ( 4.6% ) more than the president's request .

for the entire fda budget ( direct appropriations and user fees ) , consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) provides fda $2.27 billion , compared with $2.07 billion in the president's request and $2.01 billion in the fy2007 appropriation .

table 7 displays , by program area , the budget authority ( direct appropriations ) , user fees , and total program levels enacted for fy2007 , requested in the president's fy2008 budget , and enacted for fy2008 .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets .

the cftc's functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges , registration and supervision of futures industry personnel , prevention of fraud and price manipulation , and investor protection .

although most futures trading is now related to financial variables ( interest rates , currency prices , and stock indexes ) , congressional oversight remains vested in the agricultural committees because of the market's historical origins as an adjunct to agricultural trade .

for fy2008 , the administration has requested $116.0 million for the cftc , an increase of 18.4% over fy2007's appropriation under the continuing resolution of $98 million .

the administration's budget also proposes that a fee be imposed on users of the futures markets to pay for the cost of federal regulation .

to fund the cftc at the $116 million level , a fee of about 5¢ per transaction on the futures exchanges would be required .

every administration since ronald reagan's has proposed a similar fee , but congress has never enacted one .

 ( for more information on the futures transaction fee , see crs report rs22415 , proposed transaction fee on futures contracts , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

the enacted appropriation for fy2008 is $111.266 million ( after rescission ) , which is $13 million  ( +13.6% ) more than the appropriation in fy2007 .

the increase provides for an additional 17 ftes for more oversight of futures markets , and for information technology costs , both of which were in the administration's request .

it does not adopt the proposed user fees on futures transactions .

the enacted amount is between the amounts for cftc in the house and senate bills .

the house bill provided $102.6 million for the cftc as an appropriation from the general fund .

the senate amount was $116 million and was in h.r .

2829 , the financial services and general government appropriations act , 2008 .
