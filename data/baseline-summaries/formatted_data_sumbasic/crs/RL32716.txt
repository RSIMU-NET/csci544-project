the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea — 20 u.s.c .

§1400 et seq. ) .

is both a grants statute and a civil rights statute .

it provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires , as a condition for the receipt of such funds , the provision of a free appropriate public education ( fape ) .

the statute also contains detailed due process provisions to ensure the provision of fape .

originally enacted in 1975 , the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities , and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities .

idea has been amended several times , most comprehensively ( prior to the 108 th congress ) by the 1997 idea reauthorization , p.l .

105-17 , the individuals with disabilities education act amendments of 1997 .

the 108 th congress completed another wide - ranging reauthorization of idea .

the following is a brief legislative history: on april 30 , 2003 , house passed h.r .

1350 by a vote of 251 to 171 .

on may 13 , 2004 , the senate incorporated its bill ( s. 1248 ) in h.r .

1350 and passed h.r .

1350 in lieu of s. 1248 by a vote of 95 to 3 .

the conference committee filed its report on the bill ( h.rept .

108-779 ) on november 17 , 2004 .

the house agreed to the conference report on november 19 , 2004 , by a vote of 397 to 3 .

the senate approved the conference report on november 19 , 2004 , by unanimous consent .

president bush signed the bill on december 3 , 2004 ( p.l .

108-446 — the individuals with disabilities education improvement act of 2004 ) .

most provisions of p.l .

108-446 went into effect on july 1 , 2005 .

 ( see the discussion of title iii at the end of the report for certain exceptions. ) .

additional legislative action could result in connection with consideration of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) .

it is generally assumed that the 110 th congress will actively consider legislation to amend and extend the esea .

 ( the esea is authorized through fy2008. ) .

such legislation could affect idea — for example , regarding how adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) is assessed for children with disabilities and how special education teachers are determined to be highly qualified .

this report details the changes made by p.l .

108-446 covering all parts of idea but concentrates on part b , which authorizes grants for children with disabilities ages 3 to 21 and contains key provisions regarding the structure of special education and related services and the procedural safeguards that guarantee the provision of fape to children with disabilities .

section references , unless specified otherwise , refer to sections of p.l .

108-446 .

the prior version of idea is referenced with respect to p.l .

105-17 ( the 1997 reauthorization of idea ) .

the report follows the organization of p.l .

108-446 : title i , which amends idea , contains amendments to part a ( general provisions ) , part b ( which authorizes two state grants programs: the grants - to - states program serving mainly school - aged children with disabilities and the preschool state grants program , authorized in §619 ) , part c ( which authorizes the state grants program of infants and toddlers with disabilities ) , and part d ( which authorizes various national programs and grants ) ; title ii , which creates the national center for special education research within the national institute of education sciences ; and title iii , which contains miscellaneous provisions , such as the effective dates of the legislation .

part c of idea authorizes grants to states to develop and maintain early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities .

the idea infants and toddlers program has parallels with the provisions and requirements of part b ; however , these provisions and requirements differ in important respects from those of part b because this disabled population differs in significant ways from the mainly school - aged population served under part b .

for example , while part b eligibility is based on categories of disabilities ( §602 ( 3 ) ) , eligibility for part c programs is often based on a diagnosis of "development delay" that requires early intervention services ( §632 ( 5 ) .

instead of an iep , part c programs have individualized family service plans ( ifsps ) ( §636 ) , in recognition that services must be provided to the family as well as to the infant or toddler .

because infants and toddlers are served in a variety of locations ( including the home ) , part c services are to be provided in "natural environments in which children without disabilities participate" ( §632 ( 4 ) ( g ) ) "to the maximum extent appropriate" ( §635 ( a ) ( 16 ) ( a ) ) .

p.l .

108-446 maintains the overall purposes and structure of part c with some additions and revisions .

arguably the most extensive addition is the option for states to adopt policies that would permit parents of children receiving part c early intervention services to extend those services until they are eligible to enter kindergarten ( §635 ( c ) ) .

under previous law and in states that choose not to adopt such a policy , these children would likely transition into a preschool program under section 619 ( described above ) .

p.l .

108-446 has a series of requirements for a state policy to extend part c services ( §635 ( c ) ( 2 ) ) , including: informed written consent from parents that they choose this alternative ; annual notices to parents explaining the differences between the services received under the extended part c program and services that would be received under part b , and describing their rights under idea to move their child to a part b program ; and program educational components promoting school readiness and providing pre - literacy , language , and numeracy skills .

p.l .

108-446 clarifies that services provided under extended part c programs do not obligate the state to provide fape to children who are eligible for the preschool program under section 619 ( for whom states are obligated to provide fape ) ( §635 ( c ) ( 5 ) ) .

in addition , the act requires the secretary of education , once part c appropriations exceed $460 million , to reserve 15% of the appropriations for state incentive grants to states implementing extended part c services ( §643 ( e ) ) .

p.l .

108-446 makes other changes and additions to part c , including: the addition of registered dietitians and vision specialists to the list of qualified personnel to provide part c services ( §632 ( 4 ) ( f ) ( viii and x ) ) ; addition of references to homeless infants and toddlers with disabilities and infants and toddlers with disabilities who are wards of the state , for example regarding the state eligibility requirement that early intervention services be made available to all infants and toddlers with disabilities ( §634 ( 1 ) ) .

addition to the requirements for the state application requiring policies and procedures for referral for services for infants and toddlers "involved in a substantiated case of child abuse" or "affected by illegal substance abuse , or withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure" ( §637 ( a ) ( 6 ) ) and requiring state cooperation with early head start programs and other child care and early education programs ( §637 ( a ) ( 10 ) ) ; expansion of the requirement for an interagency agreement between the part c lead agency and other relevant public agencies to ensure financing and provision of part c services ( §640 ( b ) ) ; elimination of the federal interagency coordinating council ( p.l .

105-17 §644 ) ; and authorization of "such sums as may be necessary" for fy2005-fy2010 for carrying out part c .

part d authorizes various activities aimed at improving the education of children with disabilities , including improved professional development , research and evaluation , technical assistance , demonstrations , and dissemination of information .

p.l .

108-446 significantly changes and reorganizes part d. among other things , p.l .

108-446 eliminates the authorization for state program improvement grants under the prior law .

p.l .

108-446 now authorizes state personnel development grants aimed at assisting seas to reform and improve their personnel preparation and professional development systems ( subpart 1 ) .

these grants are currently authorized to be competitive .

once appropriation for the program reaches $100 million , a formula grant will be initiated ( §651 ( c ) and ( d ) ) .

subpart 2 of part d authorizes additional grant programs .

in addition to seas , other entities , such as leas , charter schools , and institutions of higher education , may apply for grants .

these grants deal with: personnel development ( §662 ) , technical assistance , demonstration projects , dissemination , and implementation of "scientifically based" research ( §663 ) , studies and evaluations ( §664 ) , and activities to "support safe learning environments" ( §665 ) .

subpart 3 continues to authorize parent training and information centers ( §671 ) , community parent resource centers ( §672 ) , and technical assistance for the parent centers ( §673 ) .

these programs help prepare parents to exercise their rights under idea .

section 674 deals with technology , media services , and instructional materials .

it authorizes projects for technology development , demonstration , and use ( §674 ( a ) ) .

p.l .

108-446 makes some changes in the secretary's authority to support educational media services .

under the prior law , these services were to be "designed to be of educational value to children with disabilities" ( p.l .

105-17 §687 ( c ) ( 1 ) ) .

p.l .

108-446 adds that these services are "designed to be of educational value in the classroom setting to children with disabilities" ( §674 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( a ) , emphasis added ) .

the prior law ( after fy2001 ) permitted captioning of educational , news , and informational television , videos , or materials ( p.l .

105-17 §687 ( c ) ( 2 ) ) .

p.l .

108-446 permits captioning of television , videos , and other materials that are "appropriate for use in the classroom setting" and permits such captioning for news only through september 30 , 2006" ( §674 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ) .

section 674 ( e ) requires the secretary of education to create and support a national instructional materials access center through the american printing house for the blind .

this center is to catalog "printed instructional material prepared in the national instructional materials accessibility standard" ( which the secretary is to establish ) , provide access to printed material for blind or other persons with print disabilities , and establish procedures to prevent against copyright infringement .

subpart 4 contains general provisions for part d. among these is the requirement that the secretary create a comprehensive plan for carrying out activities under subparts 2 and 3 ( §681 ) .

title ii of p.l .

108-446 amends the education sciences reform act of 2002 ( 20 u.s.c .

§9501 et seq. ) .

to establish the national center for special education research .

headed by a commissioner of special education research ( §176 ) , the center is to sponsor research on the needs of infants and toddlers with disabilities and on improving idea services as well as to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of idea ( §175 ) .

title iii of p.l .

108-446 contains miscellaneous provisions , such as the effective dates , provisions for an orderly transition from the previous law to the new law , technical amendments to other laws , and an amendment to copyright law with respect to the national instructional materials access center ( discussed above ) .

section 302 provides for the effective dates of the act .

most provisions of the act ( i.e. , parts a ( except for parts of the definition of "highly qualified" ) , b , c and subpart 1 of part d ) go into effect on july 1 , 2005 .

the remaining subparts of part d take effect on the date of enactment ( december 3 , 2004 ) .
