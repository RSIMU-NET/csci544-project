107-67 ( h.r .

2590 ) , department of the treasury , postal service , executiveoffice of the president , and general government appropriations for fy2002 , was approved by thepresident november 12 .

congress has received several messages from the president allocating funds from the emergency response fund by p.l .

107-38 , the emergency supplemental appropriations act forrecovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the united states , fy2001 .

p.l .

107-38 alsoauthorized additional emergency funding which was enacted under p.l .

107-117 , division b,fy2002 defense appropriation .

several accounts in the treasury and general government appropriation are affected .

 ( see terrorism section of this report for more details. ) .

on december 28 , the president signed executive order 13249 , establishing the federal pay schedules effective january 2002 .

the president , through the office of management and budget ( omb ) , is required to submit tocongress , annually , the budget of the united states government .

the fy2002 budget was submittedto congress on april 9 , 2001 .

 ( 1 ) in late february 2001,the president and the office of managementbudget released a blueprint for new beginnings , a responsible budget for america's priorities .

 ( 2 ) it is intended to present a 10-year budget plan and provides more of an overview than details onspecific accounts .

 ( 3 ) in summary , the proposed budgetwould fund the accounts in the treasury andgeneral government appropriations legislation at $16.6 billion ( discretionary ) .

 ( 4 ) this is more thana $1 billion over the estimated fy2001 funding levels , not taking into consideration thesupplemental funding subsequently enacted .

under the budget procedures , congress adopts a concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget for the government and setting forth budgetary levels for several years in thefuture .

the house and senate appropriations committees then allocate the discretionary fundinglevels ( 302 ( b ) ) allocations to each of the subcommittees .

those allocations are subject to change .

subsequent to the september 11 attacks and the need for reordering funding priorities , congress andthe white house negotiated and new allocations were developed .

for accounts covered in this billthe house allocated , on october 9 , $17.022 billion and the senate , on october 11 , allocated $17.118billion .

with the fy2001 supplemental ( 5 ) funding factored in , the total fy2001 estimated funding forthese accounts is $16.7 billion in discretionary funding .

the conference agreement would provide$17.069 billion in discretionary funding .

this falls between the house and senate allocations .

 ( 6 ) appropriations for the department of the treasury , in addition to funding the operations of the department , fund the work of a group of law enforcement organizations , which include the bureauof alcohol , tobacco , and firearms ; the customs service ; the secret service ; the financial crimesenforcement network ; and the federal law enforcement training center .

treasury appropriationsalso cover the internal revenue service , the financial management service , and the bureau of the public debt .

for the most part , the u. s. postal service has become self - supporting .

federal contributions are limited to payments to the postal service fund to compensate for revenues forgone ( e.g . , free postal service for the blind. ) .

appropriations for the executive office of the president provide salaries and expenses for the white house office , operations of the residences of the president and vice president , and most otheragencies within the executive office of the president ( eop ) .

organizations such as the council ofeconomic advisers , the national security council , the office of management and budget , and theoffice of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) are funded through these provisions .

specificfunding for drug control initiatives is appropriated for distribution to other entities by the ondcp .

among the independent agencies financed through this appropriation are the federal election commission , the general services administration , the national archives and recordsadministration , the office of personnel management , the office of special counsel , and the unitedstates tax court .

the treasury and general government appropriation always has at least two titles in addition to the four covering the funding for specific agencies .

these general titles apply restrictions or "rulesof the road" governmentwide and , quite often , contain authority for defined actions .

for example,each year , there is standard language which prohibits the use of any appropriated funds for thepurpose of employing individuals who are not u.s. citizens or citizens of nations either specified inthat section of the act or on the state department list of nations covered by treaties ; which requiresthat all agencies maintain drug - free workplaces ; and which authorizes the expenditure of fundsappropriated under any act to be used to pay the travel expenses of immediate family members if afederal employee serving overseas has died or has a life - threatening illness .

bills are introduced in the house and senate when the committees on appropriations havecompleted markup on the provisions .

usually the treasury , postal service , executive office of thepresident , and general government subcommittees draft legislation and the accompanying reports .

the full committees use these documents as a basis for discussion and mark up .

from the timelegislation is introduced , and through enactment , the status will be noted in table 1 .

2590 .

 ( 19 ) the senateversion of the bill was used as the basic vehicle for the conference .

directions to the agenciescontained in the house and senate reports are to be fulfilled .

 ( 22 ) presidential action .

 ( 23 ) table 1 .

status of fy2002 appropriations for the treasury , postal service , executive office of the president , and general government ( see table 7 for breakdown of accounts within bills. ) .

on september 28 , 2001 the president approved p.l .

107-44 ( 24 ) the continuing resolution fundedunappropriated accounts through october 16 .

the funding is available for programs in effect duringfy2001 and funded at the rates current as of the close of fy2001 .

on october 12 , p.l .

107-48 ( h.j.res .

68 ) was signed , extending the funding through october 23 .

p.l .

107-53 ( h.j.res .

69 , october 22 , 2001 ) further amended p.l .

107-44 to fund the accountsthrough october 31 .

p.l .

107-58 ( october 31 , h.j.res .

70 ) provided funding throughnovember 16 .

with the approval of p.l .

107-67 , the accounts in the treasury and generalgovernment appropriation were no longer subject to the continuing resolutions .

according to the office of management and budget , several accounts under this appropriation ( department of the treasury , bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms , u.s. customs service , u.s.secret service , and the general services administration ) receive funding for functions related tocountering terrorism .

with the exception of the counterterrorism fund account within thedepartment of the treasury , none of the agencies carry a line account specifically fundingcounterterrorism , or terrorism responses .

certain accounts have been allocated funds from theemergency response fund established through p.l .

107-38 .

also , under the provisions of p.l.107-38 , a further supplemental appropriation is authorized .

the administration submitted specificsfor the allocation of funds under such an emergency supplemental and p.l .

107-117 appropriatedfunds .

there has been established , within the executive office of the president and office ofhomeland security .

the role of the department of the treasury relates to both its statutory missions and the capabilities of its law enforcement groups .

although the federal bureau of investigation is the leadagency for several functions , the customs service has the lead in preventing terrorist from enteringthe united states , the secret service is responsible for protection of officials and facilities and hasthe lead in providing security plans to prevent terrorist incidents at national special security events,such as the 2002 olympics ; and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms is the lead on firearmsand explosives .

the department itself has a general responsibility for the support and security ofthe nation's financial structure .

the general services administration has the responsibility for the management and oversight of federal buildings and federal real property .

under the government information security reformact of 2000 , ( p.l .

106-398 ) the gsa is directed to assist agencies in fulling their responsibility tomaintain procedures for detecting , reporting , and responding to security incidents .

in this latterregard , gsa operates the federal computer incident response center ( fedcirc ) , whose purposeit is to ensure that the government has a central focal point for handling computer security relatedincidents , can withstand or quickly recover from attaches against its information systems , and hasa centralized computer security information - sharing program .

p.l .

107-67 retains ( section 639 ) provisions from the house - passed version ofthe bill ( section 638 ) continuing , in modified and expanded form , a limitation onfederal agency monitoring of personal information on use of the internet .

the initialversion of the prohibition appeared in the transportation appropriations bill ( section501 ) funding some treasury appropriations accounts for fy2001 ( p.l .

106-346 ) .

some confusion existed concerning the section's application to all executive agenciesor only those funded by the treasury appropriations bill .

the new language approvedby the conferees eliminates this confusion , saying , none of the funds "made availablein this or any other act may be used by any federal agency" for the followingpurposes: ( 1 ) to collect , review , or create any aggregate list , derived from any means , that includes the collection of any personallyidentifiable information relating to an individual's access to or use of any federalgovernment internet site of the agency ; or ( 2 ) to enter into any agreement with a third party ( including another government agency ) to collect , review , or obtain anyaggregate list , derived from any means , that includes the collection of any personallyidentifiable information relating to an individual's access to or use of anynongovernmental internet site .

specified exceptions to these limitations include: ( 1 ) any record of aggregate data that does not identify particular persons ; ( 2 ) any voluntary submission of personally identifiable information ; ( 3 ) any action taken for law enforcement , regulatory , or supervisory purposes , in accordance with applicable law ; or ( 4 ) any action described in subsection ... ( 1 ) that is a system security action taken by the operator of an internet site and isnecessarily incident to the rendition of the internet site services or to the protectionof the rights or property of the provider of the internetsite .

several of the agencies funded through the treasury and general government appropriations bill are providing support to the 2002 winter olympics andparalympics hosted by the united states in salt lake city , utah .

the total treasuryand general government funding , $137,680,000 ( fy2001 enacted ) and $59,956,000 ( fy2001supplemental , pl .

107-20 ) included only funding directly related to thegames .

it is noted that there are "many federal costs that indirectly assist theolympics and paralympics but whose primary purpose was not to assist the games. .

those costs are not included in this budget presentation .

on july 24 , the fy2001 funding supplemental ( 72 ) was signed by the president .

in the conference report it was stated that $59,956,000 was provided "to reimburseany agency of the department of the treasury or other federal agencies for costsassociated with providing operational and perimeter security at the 2002 winterolympics , as proposed by the senate .

the conferees expect that this funding will beprovided to the following agencies , as shown in the following table .

adjustments tothis funding can be made subject to the standard reprogramming and transferguidelines: no breakdown within treasury was provided with regard to which functions would be funded at which level .

the supplemental funds for fy2001 would be usedto reimburse department of the treasury's bureaus and other federal agenciesproviding operational and perimeter security support .

the funding was also forovertime , travel and other related costs such as lodging and equipment .

it should benoted that a recent general accounting office study stated that through fy1999 thetotal olympic support spending from all federal sources was $1.3 billion .

 ( 73 ) fy2001 treasury department and general government appropriations olympic support funding levels can be broken down in the following manner .

the treasurydepartment was funded at $10,122,000 in fy2001 , with $51,624,000 proposed forfy2002 ( fy2002 figures from president's budget ) .

the funding is designated forcounter terrorism and law enforcement activities .

specifically , with the fy2002proposal in parentheses , the agencies within the department responsible for olympicsupport are u.s. secret service ( $19,530,000 ) , u.s. customs service ( $18,745,000 ) ,bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms ( $10,523,000 ) , financial crimesenforcement network ( $58,000 ) , irs - criminal investigation ( $2,728,000 ) , anddepartmental offices ( $40,000 ) .

the office of national drug control policy received $3,000,000 for its anti - doping activity .

the general servicesadministration would receive $1,544,000 for security , housing , and drug testing ( $919,000 ) and housing and security for the paralympics ( $635,000 ) .

gsa wasfunded for fy2001 at $3,310,000 for olympic support .

 ( 74 ) the house committee on appropriations stated , in their report , the committee is also concerned that the president's initial request did not include the $60.6 million necessary to supporttreasury law enforcement's role in the upcoming 2002 winter olympics ; thecommittee is nonetheless pleased that the president submitted a request for thesefunds within the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations bill .

because thesefunds would not be spent until fiscal year 2001 had closed , the committee hasincluded funding for these efforts in fiscal year 2002 , which when they areneeded .

 ( 75 ) however , the house , in adopting the rule on , and passing , h.r .

2590 amended the reported version and struck the funding in support of security atthe olympics .

 ( note: the nearly 60 million dollars in funds provided for olympicsupport in the 2001 supplemental are available until september 30 , 2002 ) thesenate position was not discussed during the july 26 mark up of their appropriationsprovisions .

funds previously allocated for security at the olympics have beenreallocated as follows: $2.9 million for the customs air and marine interdictionprogram ; $2 million for the customs service for intellectual property rightsenforcement ; $4.7 million for the treasury's federal law enforcement trainingcenter ; $2.4 million for additional hidtas ; $20 million for gsa constructionactivities ; and $27.9 million for partial costs associated with pay parity for civilianemployees .

s. 1398 , as reported by the senate committee onappropriations , does not contain any new funding for security at the winter olympicgames in salt lake city .

as passed by the senate , h.r .

2590 is alsosilent on the issue .

the house conference report on h.r .

2590 ( h.rept.107-253 ) does not restore or include funding for the salt lake olympic games .

onfinal passage , no additional funds were provided for olympic security ( p.l .

107-67 ,115 stat .

514 ) .

it should be noted however , that an additional 20 million dollars havebeen added to olympic security efforts from the president's emergency responsefund .

while the house approved an amendment to ease the u.s. embargo on cuba byprohibiting spending for administering or enforcing treasury department regulationsrelated to cuba travel , ultimately congress did not include the provision in theconference report to h.r .

2590 ( h.rept .

107-253 ) .

during july 25 , 2001 , floor action on h.r .

2590 , the house debated two amendments that would ease u.s. sanctions on cuba , approving one that wouldprohibit spending for administering treasury department regulations restrictingtravel to cuba and rejecting the second that would prohibit treasury departmentfunds from administering the overall u.s. embargo on cuba .

the first amendment , ( h.amdt .

241 ) offered by representative flake ( which amended h.amdt .

240 offered by representative smith ) , would prohibit fundingto administer the cuban assets control regulations ( cacr ) with respect to anytravel or travel - related transaction .

the cacr are administered by the treasurydepartment's office of foreign assets control .

the flake amendment was approvedby a vote of 240 to 186 , compared to a vote of 232-186 for a similar amendment inlast year's treasury department appropriations bill .

the second amendment ( h.amdt .

242 ) , offered by representative rangel , would have prohibited the use of treasury department funds to implementor enforce the economic embargo of cuba .

this amendment failed by a vote of201-227 , a much narrower margin compared to a similar amendment to last year'streasury department appropriations bill that was rejected by a vote of 174-241 .

ultimately , the house provision regarding cuba travel restrictions was not included in the conference report to h.r .

2590 ( h.rept .

107-253 ) .

while the senate version of the bill , approved september 19 , 2001 , did not includesuch a provision , senator byron dorgan noted during floor debate that he hadintended to offer an amendment on the issue , but that he decided not to because hedid not want to slow passage of the bill .

senator dorgan had indicated that he wouldsupport the house provision when it came in conference , but ultimately thehouse - senate conference report on the bill did not include the cuba provision .

inlight of the changed congressional priorities in the aftermath of the september 11attacks on new york and washington , conference negotiators reportedly did notwant to slow passage of the bill with any controversial provisions .

moreover , thebush administration had threatened to veto the treasury bill if it included the cubatravel provision .

for fy2002 , the white house proposed that there be one account for the executive office of the president andthat the president then would have the latitude to disperse the funds to accounts within the eop .

in effect therequest and the house - passed totals for fy2002 would be zeroed out .

the data shown in parentheses in thesecolumns represent the funding levels reported by the house committee on appropriations as of september 6 , 2001 .

the budget is organized by broad functions .

the general government function ( often referred to as the 800 function because of its numerical designation ) encompasses the central management activities of the executive and legislativebranches .

several of the appropriations bills fund accounts which would fall withinthe general rubric of this function .

major activities identified with the generalgovernment function include federal financial management , such as tax collection,currency , and governmentwide accounting ; personnel management , and generaladministrative and property management .

in summary the discretionary budgetauthority for function 800 in fy2002 is proposed at $14,773 million , the mandatoryoutlays at $1,798 million , with an additional $7 million proposed .

 ( 89 ) the four executive branch agencies responsible for these activities are the department of the treasury , the general services administration , the office ofpersonnel management ; and the office of management and budget .

each of theseis discussed below with regard to the funding decisions during the course of theappropriations cycle .

however , in the context of the function as a whole , initiativesand expectations for the four agencies by the bush administration are set out here .
