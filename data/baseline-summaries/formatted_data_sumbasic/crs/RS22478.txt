the text of s.con.res .

10 as introduced was as follows: concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that the secretary of the navy should name the next nuclear powered submarine of the united states navy the "uss los alamos" .

whereas the people of los alamos and the navy have a 74-year relationship that continues from the manhattan project through the creation of a nuclear navy and into the current ocean - borne leg of the strategic nuclear triad of the united states ; whereas the contributions of the people of los alamos and surrounding communities allowed the navy to keep its offensive edge from world war ii , through the cold war , continuing to the emerging conflicts as of the date of adoption of this resolution ; whereas captain "deke" parsons was one of the first residents of los alamos and , along with laureate ramsey , oversaw the safe delivery , assembly and loading of the nuclear bomb that led to the surrender of japan in world war ii ; whereas the people of los alamos and surrounding communities played a critical role in designing the nuclear portion of the first nuclear weapon to enter the arsenal of the navy , known as the regulus , along with atomic depth bombs , torpedoes , rockets , and even next generation weapon systems like the b61 â€“ 12 precision - guided nuclear bomb ; whereas the people of los alamos designed the warheads that armed the first generation trident submarine - launched ballistic missiles of the navy and the follow - on trident ii missile warheads used by the navy ; whereas the research into nuclear energy conducted by los alamos during world war ii advanced the technical basis for the development of the nuclear propulsion systems of the navy used aboard los angeles , seawolf , ohio , and virginia class submarines along with multiple naval aircraft carriers today ; whereas the people of los alamos and los alamos national laboratory host united states naval academy midshipmen every year to provide hands - on scientific and engineering experience working to solve real world challenges in national security , thereby directly contributing to the development of future navy leadership ; whereas the people of los alamos carry the solemn responsibility to assess the sea - based nuclear deterrent carried aboard navy fleet ballistic missile submarines ; whereas naming a submarine los alamos will recognize and continue to forge the longstanding relationship between the navy and los alamos ; whereas the year 2018 will mark the 75th anniversary of los alamos national laboratory ; and whereas the distinctive service and contributions from the people of los alamos to the navy merits naming a vessel that embodies the heritage , service , fidelity , and achievements of the residents of los alamos and surrounding communities in partnership with the united states navy: now , therefore , be it resolved by the senate ( the house of representatives concurring ) , that it is the sense of the congress that the secretary of the navy should name the next nuclear powered submarine of the united states navy as the "uss los alamos" .

appendix a .

executive summary of july 2012 navy report to congress this appendix reprints the executive summary of the july 2012 navy report to congress on the navy's policies and practices for naming its ships .

the text of the executive summary is as follows: executive summary this report is submitted in accordance with section 1014 of p.l .

112-81 , national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2012 , dated 31 december 2011 , which directs the secretary of defense to submit a report on "policies and practices of the navy for naming vessels of the navy. .

as required by the ndaa , this report: includes a description of the current policies and practices of the navy for naming vessels of the navy , and a description of the extent to which theses policies and practices vary from historical policies and practices of the navy for naming vessels of the navy , and an explanation for such variances ; assesses the feasibility and advisability of establishing fixed policies for the naming of one or more classes of vessels of the navy , and a statement of the policies recommended to apply to each class of vessels recommended to be covered by such fixed policies if the establishment of such fixed policies is considered feasible and advisable ; and identifies any other matter relating to the policies and practices of the navy for naming vessels of the navy that the secretary of defense considers appropriate .

after examining the historical record in great detail , this report concludes: current ship naming policies and practices fall well within the historic spectrum of policies and practices for naming vessels of the navy , and are altogether consistent with ship naming customs and traditions .

the establishment of fixed policies for the naming of one or more classes of vessels of the navy would be highly inadvisable .

there is no objective evidence to suggest that fixed policies would improve navy ship naming policies and practices , which have worked well for over two centuries .

in addition , the department of the navy used to routinely publish lists of current type naming rules for battle force ships , and update it as changes were made to them .

at some point , this practice fell into disuse , leading to a general lack of knowledge about naming rules .

to remedy this problem , the naval history and heritage command will once again develop and publish a list of current type naming rules to help all americans better understand why secretaries of the navy choose the ship names they do .

this list will be updated as required .
