the sheer number of children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by parents or legal guardians has raised considerable concern .

overwhelmingly , the children are coming from el salvador , guatemala , and honduras .

this report focuses on the demographics of unaccompanied alien children while they are in removal proceedings .

it discusses the characteristics of these children by nationality , age , and sex and explores these trends over the past few years .

it further builds on a set of congressional research service ( crs ) reports examining the issues surrounding unaccompanied alien children .

much attention has been focused on the top countries of origin for the unaccompanied children .

over the past four years , orr had unaccompanied children in its custody from 87 different countries , ranging from 41 to 50 different countries each fiscal year .

nevertheless , el salvador , guatemala , and honduras have consistently accounted for the overwhelming majority of all unaccompanied children in orr custody ( table 1 ) .

while the most notable increase in unaccompanied children over the past three fiscal years and the first seven months of fy2014 was from honduras ( 980% ) — as it steadily increased in overall rank from fourth in fy2011 to first through the first seven months of fy2014 — even the smallest increase in unaccompanied children in orr custody of the three countries ( el salvador ) was notable: 463% from fy2011 through the first seven months of fy2014 ( figure 1 ) .

not all apprehended unaccompanied children are transferred to orr , as some are voluntarily returned to their home countries .

although mexican children generally make up a sizeable number of the unaccompanied alien children apprehended by cbp officers , only a portion of them end up in orr custody .

for example , cbp apprehended 11,577 mexican unaccompanied children in the first eight months of fy2014 , and only 494 mexican unaccompanied children were placed in orr custody during the first seven months of fy2014 .

age is a key factor to qualify as an unaccompanied alien child under the law .

the homeland security act of 2002 defines an unaccompanied alien child as an individual who has no lawful immigration status in the united states , has not yet reached the age of 18 , and has no parent or legal guardian in the united states or no parent or legal guardian in the united states who is available to provide care and physical custody .

those 18 and older in orr custody could have entered the united states shortly before turning 18 , could be awaiting transfer back to dhs custody , or could have special needs that have kept them in orr custody past the age of 18 .

the median age of unaccompanied children in orr custody was 17 years old in fy2011 and fy2012 , as table 2 presents .

the median age fell to 16 years old in fy2013 and has remained there in the first seven months of fy2014 .

the youngest three age groups ( 0-9 , 10-12 , and 13-15 years old ) experienced the most percentage growth compared to the oldest three age groups ( 16-17 , 18 , and 19+ years old ) , which have experienced a percentage decrease during the period examined ( figure 2 ) .

while there continued to be a greater overall number of older children in orr custody , there was also a noteworthy increase in younger children in orr custody , particularly in the 10-12 age group ( figure 2 ) over the period studied .

from october 1 , 2010 , through april 30 , 2014 , orr had a total of 8,879 unaccompanied children under the age of 13 in its custody .

from fy2011 through the first seven months of fy2014 , there was an increase in the number of children in each of the three youngest age brackets ( 0-9 , 10-12 , and 13-15 ) for honduras , guatemala , and el salvador .

most notably , in the first seven months of fy2014 , the youngest three age brackets for honduras made up over half of all honduran unaccompanied children ( 6,242 ) .

like honduras and el salvador , guatemala had an increase in the three youngest age brackets , however , it also had the greatest number of unaccompanied children in the oldest three age brackets ( 16-17 , 18 , and 19+ ) ( figure 3 ) .

traditionally there have been more male than female unaccompanied children in orr custody .

in 2002 , immigration officials testified that the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied alien children were male .

the number of unaccompanied females increased from 1,075 in fy2011 to 5,385 in fy2013 .

the number of unaccompanied girls reached 2,959 in the first seven months of fy2014 .

similarly , the percentage of females among unaccompanied children has grown .

the share of females was stable at about 22% in fy2011 and fy2012 and increased to about 27% in fy2013 and 33% in the first seven months of fy2014 ( figure 4 ) .

as previously shown in figure 1 , the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied children in orr custody from fy2011 through the first seven months of fy2014 originated from honduras , guatemala , and el salvador .

the sex distribution from the top countries of origin among children in orr custody was examined to provide a better understanding of the female population .

examining the male - to - female ratio for each specific top source country reveals that a greater proportion of females in orr custody originated from el salvador than from honduras , while a lower proportion of females originated from guatemala ( figure 5 ) .

honduras had the most females in orr custody and was also the country with the greatest number of minors in orr custody overall .

in absolute numbers , most males in orr custody were ages 16-17 in each of the three fiscal years and in the first seven months of fy2014 ; however , the number of males age 0-9 , 10-12 , and 13-15 steadily increased over the past three fiscal years and in the first seven months of fy2014 ( figure 6 ) .

similar patterns occurred for females .

in the first seven months of fy2014 , the number of females in the 16-17 age bracket increased , whereas the number of males decreased ( figure 7 ) .

the median age of unaccompanied children by year , sex , and top country ( table 3 ) present the age trends a bit more starkly .

the median age of females has dropped from 17 years in fy2011 — the year that was the median age across all groups of children — to 15 years in the first seven months of fy2014 .

the median age for females in fy2013 was 13 years .

when viewed by country , the median age decreased for all three and fell to 15 years for honduran children during the first seven months of fy2014 .
