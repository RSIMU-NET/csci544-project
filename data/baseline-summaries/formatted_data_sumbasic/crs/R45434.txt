over the past two years , congress has demonstrated significant interest in u.s. and international trade trends as part of its efforts to examine u.s. trade policy and key u.s. trading relationships .

congress's role in trade policy stems from a number of overlapping responsibilities , including its constitutional authority over regulating commerce with foreign countries and broad oversight responsibility over the performance of the economy .

in some areas , particularly in negotiating trade agreements , congress has opted to delegate certain authorities to the president .

interest in bilateral trade flows and balances has been heightened as the trump administration renegotiates existing u.s. free trade agreements ( ftas ) and pursues news ones , and takes a more forceful stance to reduce u.s. bilateral trade deficits , enforce u.s. trade laws and agreements , and promote what it considers to be "free," "fair," and "reciprocal" trade .

members of congress have long recognized that international trade is an important engine not only of the u.s. economy , but also of the global economy .

total trade ( exports plus imports ) as a share of global gross domestic product ( gdp ) has risen from 25% in 1960 to 56% in 2017 .

greater openness to trade and reforms worldwide have been linked to higher growth in productivity and real incomes , as well as to reduced poverty .

for decades since world war ii , annual real global trade growth outpaced gdp growth , growing on average 1.5 times faster .

this trend has not held in recent years as the global economy recovered from the global financial and economic crisis .

growth in the volume of world merchandise trade slowed to 2.0% in 2016 — the slowest pace of growth since 2009 .

trade growth has seen some rebound , increasing to 5.4% in 2017 — the strongest growth rate since 2011 , driven mainly by cyclical factors , particularly increased investment and consumption expenditure .

u.s. world trade has grown steadily over the past decade .

in 2017 , the united states exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion .

since 2009 , when trade flows declined sharply in the midst of the financial crisis , u.s. exports have grown 48.5% , while u.s. imports have grown 47.6% in nominal terms .

more broadly , since 1960 , trade relative to gdp has risen markedly .

u.s. exports as a share of gdp expanded from 5% in 1960 to over 12% of gdp in 2017 , while u.s. imports expanded from 4% to over 15% of gdp ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .

according to data from the u.s. department of commerce's bureau of economic analysis , china was the top u.s. trading partner in 2017 , with $711.7 billion in total goods and services trade , followed by canada ( $679.9 billion ) , mexico ( $622.1 billion ) , japan ( $286.1 billion ) , and germany ( $239.8 billion ) .

china was the largest source of u.s. imports , while canada was the largest destination for u.s. exports .

however , considering the 28 member states of the european union ( eu ) as a single trading partner , the eu is both the largest u.s. export destination ( $528.2 billion ) and the largest source of u.s. imports ( $629.4 billion ) .

the majority of u.s. global trade — approximately 65% — is with countries with which the united states does not have a free trade agreement ( fta ) .

moreover , while most of the united states' largest trading partners remain advanced economies , u.s. trade with emerging market and developing economies — although comparatively low — accounts for a growing share of total u.s. trade ( figure 3 and figure 4 ) .

the changes in u.s. trade patterns pose both opportunities and challenges for u.s. international trade relations .

these developments have intensified congressional interest in u.s. trade policy and heightened its demand for information and comparative analysis of bilateral u.s. trade flows .

in the coming months , congress may face issues such as shaping u.s. trade policy to reflect this changing composition of trade ; enhancing the competitive position of u.s. firms , workers , and industries ; promoting access to new foreign market opportunities for u.s. businesses ; and addressing tensions , trade barriers , and issues raised by the growing role of emerging economies in the global economy .

in addition , questions affecting u.s. trade trends could also arise as the trump administration renegotiates ftas and pursues new ones , and congress debates and ratifies them .

congress is expected to closely monitor negotiations on other trade agreements and on developments at the world trade organization ( wto ) .

the economic position of the united states is also an important factor to consider .

the agreements and negotiations raise several important policy questions: do the agreements and the ongoing negotiations serve u.s. interests ? .

is the administration fulfilling its obligations under trade promotion authority ( tpa ) ? .

are bilateral and regional ftas and negotiations , on the one hand , and the u.s. multilateral agenda at the wto , on the other hand , mutually supportive or in conflict ? .

in deciding whether to approve new bilateral ftas , or debate more generally on u.s. trade policy , members of congress may weigh potential costs and benefits to their constituents and to the u.s. economy as a whole .

this report provides a summary of the main economic developments in the trade activities of the united states with its major trading partners in 2017 — the most recent year for which yearly u.s. trade data are available .

it is intended primarily as a reference , and it focuses on what has happened with u.s. bilateral trade relations in recent years — not why or what the changes imply .

the main objective of this report is to present the current data and statistics in a way that is accessible and understandable to help inform policy discussions .

it is important to note that the growth in global production chains , intrafirm trade , and trade in intermediate goods means that traditional accounting methods may distort trade data and not fully reflect the source of resources that are used in producing goods and services ( see " limitations of trade data " ) .

this makes it increasingly difficult to understand and interpret the implications of trade data for the u.s. economy .
