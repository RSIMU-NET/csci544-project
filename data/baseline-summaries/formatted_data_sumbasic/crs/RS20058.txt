referred to as "legislative accountability and reform," title i establishes requirements for committees and the congressional budget office ( cbo ) to study and report on the magnitude and impact of mandates in proposed legislation .

title i also creates point - of - order procedures through which these requirements can be enforced and the consideration of measures containing unfunded intergovernmental mandates can be blocked .

title ii requires that federal agencies prepare written statements that identify costs and benefits of a federal mandate to be imposed through the rulemaking process .

the requirement applies to regulatory actions determined to result in costs of $117 million or more in any one year ( 2003 figure , as adjusted for inflation ) .

the written assessments to be prepared by federal agencies must identify the law authorizing the rule , anticipated costs and benefits , the share of costs to be borne by the federal government , and the disproportionate costs on individual regions or components of the private sector .

assessments must also include estimates of the effect on the national economy , descriptions of consultations with nonfederal government officials , and a summary of the evaluation of comments and concerns obtained throughout the promulgation process .

impacts of "any regulatory requirements" on small governments must be identified ; notice must be given to those governments ; and technical assistance must be provided .

also , umra requires that federal agencies consider "a reasonable number" of policy options and select the most cost - effective or least burdensome alternative .

the requirements in title ii pertaining to the preparation of a mandate assessment statement and notification of impact on small governments remain subject to judicial review .

a federal court may compel a federal agency to comply with these requirements , but such a court order cannot be used to stay or invalidate the rule .
