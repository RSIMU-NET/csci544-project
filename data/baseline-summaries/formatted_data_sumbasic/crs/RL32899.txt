two issues affecting housing were prominent in the 109 th congress: the annual budget process and the effects of hurricane katrina .

in addition to these overarching issues , other proposals addressed in the 109 th congress included legislation to create a stronger regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac , and revisions to the fha loan insurance program .

legislation was also introduced on behalf of the administration to replace the section 8 voucher program with a new block grant and to make major changes to the public housing program .

in the area of the budget generally , as of the date of this report , congress had not yet enacted an fy2007 spending bill for the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) .

the president submitted his budget request on february 6 , 2006 .

it included reductions for several programs , including the community development block grant ( cdbg ) program , and increases for other programs , such as the section 8 voucher program .

the appropriations committees in both houses held hearings on the budget in which members from both parties expressed concern about several proposed funding reductions .

the house of representatives passed its version of the funding bill ( h.r .

5576 ) on june 14 , 2006 , and the senate appropriations committee reported its version to the full senate on july 26 , 2006 .

both versions of h.r .

5576 restored some of the proposed reductions in the president's budget , including funds for the cdbg program , the section 202 housing for the elderly program , and the section 811 housing for the disabled program .

at the time of this update , congress has enacted three continuing resolutions that provide funding for hud ; the third of these expires on february 15 , 2007 .

after hurricane katrina , congress enacted two fy2006 funding bills that provided funds to hud for hurricane recovery and reconstruction ( p.l .

109-148 and p.l .

109-234 ) .

the majority of these funds was provided to the cdbg program in states affected by the hurricanes .
