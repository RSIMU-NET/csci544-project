the purpose of the act is to provide for,strengthen , andexpedite the national defense through protection to servicemembers , to enable them to "devote theirentire energy to the defense needs of the nation. .

the scra protects servicemembers bytemporarily suspending certain judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that mayadversely affect their civil rights during their military service .

sections 201 through 207 describe the general relief available to servicemembers in most kindsof court actions .

they serve to suspend civil liabilities of military personnel and preserve causes ofaction either for or against them .

protection against default judgments .

sec .

201 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 521 ) .

in a civil lawsuit , the failure of the defendant to appear in court may result in the award of a default judgment on behalf of the plaintiff .

this section protectsservicemembers from default judgments in civil actions while they are unable to appear in court dueto military service .

before a court can grant a default judgment , the plaintiff must file an affidavitstating that the defendant is not on active duty in military service showing necessary facts to supportthe affidavit ( 20 ) or that the plaintiff was unable todetermine whether or not the defendant is in militaryservice .

a false affidavit to that effect is punishable by imprisonment for up to one year , a fine ofup to $1,000 , or both .

the court , before entering a judgment , must also appoint an attorney torepresent the person on active duty in order to protect his or her legal rights and interests .

however,if the attorney appointed to the case cannot locate the servicemember , actions by the attorney wouldnot waive any defenses of or otherwise bind the servicemember .

additionally , if the court is unableto determine if a defendant is in military service , the court may require a bond which may later beused to indemnify the defendant if it is determined that he or she was in military service and thejudgment against the defendant is set aside or vacated in part .

moreover , if a court enters a defaultjudgment against a servicemember , the court may set aside its judgment if the servicemember filesa motion within 60 days after leaving active military service and can demonstrate that militaryservice prejudiced his or her availability to appear in court ( unless the default was based on a falseaffidavit by the plaintiff regarding military service of the defendant , in which case such a showingis unnecessary ) and that there are meritorious or legal defenses to the suit .

this is a change from theprevious sscra where the motion had to be filed within 30 days after leaving military service .

this section does not provide a means to challenge judgments resulting from cases in which the servicemember made an appearance before the court .

some courts have found that acommunication to the court regarding the servicemember's military status , and the resultingapplicability of the scra to the suit , constitutes an appearance and bars the servicemember fromasserting certain defenses , ( 21 ) such as a lack ofjurisdiction of the court over the servicemember , andnegates the servicemember's right to petition to have the judgment overturned .

an informalcommunication , such as a letter or a telegram to the court asking for protection under the scrashould not be counted as an appearance , ( 22 ) butsome courts have found that a letter from a legalassistance attorney constitutes an appearance , waiving the servicemember's protection against adefault judgment .

an appearance by defendant's counsel may also waive protection , unless thecounsel was appointed pursuant to this section .

subsection ( h ) contains a provision to protect the rights of a bona fide purchaser by stating that vacating , setting aside , or reversing any judgment under the act will not impair any right or titleacquired by any bona fide purchaser for value under the judgment .

therefore , it may be impossibleto recover property that had been attached to satisfy a default judgment , although the servicememberwould have the right to damages for the value of the property .

stays of proceedings when servicemember has notice .

sec .

202 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 522 ) .

a court must stay further proceedings in civil litigation wherethe servicemember's ability to participate in the litigation is materially affected by absence due tomilitary service .

it applies to servicemembers who are in military service or within 90 days aftertermination or release from military service .

the servicemembers must to set forth , in their application for a stay , facts stating the manner in which current military duty requirements materially affect their ability to appear and state a datewhen the servicemembers will be able to appear , and submit a letter from the servicemember'scommanding officer certifying that leave is not authorized for the servicemember to attendproceedings at that time .

courts have been divided as to how to allocate the burden of proofregarding the issue of whether the servicemember's ability to appear in court is "materially affected"by military duty .

courts must also take into account the interests of the opposing party .

while a stayis a reasonable imposition upon an individual citizen on behalf of those discharging their obligationsto the common defense , it is not available to shield wrongdoing or lack of diligence or to postponerelief indefinitely , or to be used to stay proceedings in matters where the interests or safety of thegeneral public may be at stake .

courts may deny a stay in cases involving purely legal issues orwhere the servicemember is not the true party in interest , in which the servicemember's presence isnot essential .

a request for a stay under this section does not constitute an appearance for jurisdictional purposes or a waiver of any substantive or procedural defense .

therefore , a servicemember mayapply for relief without waiving the right , for example , to assert that the court has no jurisdiction inthe case .

moreover , additional stays may be granted based on continuing material effect of militaryduty on the servicemember .

if additional stays are denied , the court must appoint counsel to representthe servicemember .

a servicemember who is unsuccessful in securing a stay under this section isprecluded from seeking the protections against default judgments granted under section 201 .

thissection is inapplicable to section 301 ( protection from eviction or distress ) .

fines and penalties under contracts .

sec .

203 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 523 ) .

whenever an action is stayed by the court pursuant to the scra , penalties that would otherwise accumulate against the person for failing to carry out theterms of the contract cannot be imposed during the period the stay remains in effect .

even if no stayis in effect , the court has the discretion to relieve an active duty servicemember of the obligationsto pay any fines or penalties for failing to carry out the terms of a contract if that person's ability topay the fines and penalties or to carry out the terms of the contract is impaired by active militaryservice .

stay of enforcement .

sec .

204 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 524 ) .

if a servicemember is materially affected by reason of militaryservice in complying with a court judgement or order , the court may , on its own motion , and will onthe application of the servicemember , stay the execution of any judgment or order against theservicemember and vacate or stay an attachment or a garnishment of property , money , or debts inthe possession of the person on active duty in military service for actions or proceedingscommenced against the servicemember .

this section applies to actions brought against theservicemember before the period military service or within 90 days after termination of theservicemember's .

duration and term of stays ; co - defendants not in service .

sec .

205 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 525 ) .

stays granted by courts under the scra can remain in effectfor the entire period of a servicemember's active duty military service plus 90 days , or any partthereof .

as a practical matter , however , courts do not look favorably on protracted stays , and expectmost military members to make themselves available to participate in proceedings within areasonable period of time , especially during peacetime if the servicemember is not stationedabroad .

 ( 23 ) suits against any co - defendants not inmilitary service may proceed even if the suit hasbeen stayed with respect to the person in the military .

this section does not apply to sections 202 ( stays for actions for which the defendant has notice ) and 701 ( anticipatory relief ) .

these sectionscontain their own rules for determining the maximum length of a stay granted under them .

statute of limitations .

sec .

206 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 526 ) .

in cases in which a statute of limitations would prohibit anycourt action with respect to a lawsuit brought after expiration of the time specified by law , thissection tolls ( extends ) the time period applicable to a covered servicemember by an amount of timeequal to the person's period of military service .

that time is not counted in determining theservicemember's deadline for exercising rights such as redeeming real estate that has been sold orforfeited or to pay any other obligation or assessment .

the section applies not just to courts but alsoto any other board , commission or agency , and may be exercised by the servicemember's heirs,executors , administrators , or assigns , regardless of whether the right or cause of action arose priorto or during the person's period of military service .

it does not , however , apply to federal tax laws .

maximum rate of interest .

sec .

207 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 527 ) .

this section caps the maximum interest charged on any debtincurred by a servicemember prior to entering active duty at a rate of interest no higher than sixpercent ( 6% ) a year , if that servicemember's ability to pay is materially affected by active duty status .

the interest above the 6% cap is to be forgiven by the creditor and does not accrue to be owed afterthe debtor's release from active duty .

the monthly payments of an obligation or liability coveredby this section is to be reduced by the amount in excess of the 6% , but the terms of the originalobligation are to remain the same .

a lender seeking to charge a higher rate must get a court orderto do so .

it is up to the lender to prove that the servicemember's ability to pay the higher rate is notaffected by military activation .

with regard to credit card debt , the 6% rate applies only to debtincurred prior to service .

therefore , any purchases charged to the same credit card after entry intomilitary service will be subject to the full interest rate charged by the credit card .

a servicemember who wrongly receives an adverse credit report or has his or her credit limit reduced or further credit denied after invoking the 6% interest cap provision may seek relief throughthe fair credit reporting act ( 24 ) ( fcra ) provisionsfor "adverse actions" and consumer remedies for"willful or negligent noncompliance by credit reporting agencies upon consumer showing of causalconnection between inaccurate credit report and denial of credit or other consumer benefit. .

 ( 25 ) .

sections 301 through 308 provide protections from eviction and loss of other benefits or rightsdue to the failure of a servicemember to meet payments on rent , loans , mortgages , or insurancepolicies .

unlike the other parts of the scra , the rights described in these sections can be assertedby a servicemember's dependents in their own right .

evictions and distress .

sec .

301 ( 50 u.s.c .

app .

ï¿½ 531 ) .

under this section , unless a court orders otherwise , a landlordor person with "paramount title" may not evict a servicemember in military service or his or herdependents from a rented home ( such as an apartment , a trailer , or a house ) if the rent is $2,400 permonth or less .

in a case where the landlord seeks a court order for the eviction of a servicememberor his or her dependents , the court is obligated to stay the proceedings for up to three months if theservicemember requests it .

in the alternative , the court may adjust the obligation under the lease topreserve the interests of all the parties .

the $2,400 rent ceiling will be adjusted for inflation .

section 202 ( stay of proceedings when servicemember has notice ) of the act is not applicable to thissection .

except by court order , no one who has collected a deposit aspartial payment for property , where the remainder of the price is to be paid in installments , canrepossess the property or cancel the sale , lease or bailment of the property because of the failure tomeet the terms of the contract , if the buyer enters active duty military service after paying the depositand subsequently breaches the terms of the contract .

a violation of this section is punishable byimprisonment for up to one year , a fine as provided in title 18 , u.s.code , or both .

a court mayorder the cancellation of the installment sale , mandating the return of the property to the seller aswell as the return of paid installments to the buyer , or the court may stay the proceedings .

this section does not prevent the partiesfrom entering into a written agreement with regard to repossession or forfeiture of the property afterthe servicemember's entry into active duty or receipt of notice of induction .

a sale , foreclosure , orseizure of property during a servicemember's period of military service is prohibited unless undera court order issued prior to foreclosure on the property , or if made pursuant to an agreement undersection 107 of the act .

at least one court had interpreted the wording of the sscra , which statesan action is forbidden "unless upon an order previously granted by the court" to mean that the ordermust have been issued prior to the servicemember's entry into active duty .

 ( 26 ) if the servicemember breaches the terms of a mortgage , trust deed , or other loan , the court may stay any proceedings brought by the lender to enforce the terms of the agreement .

the court mayalso order any other disposition of the property that it decides is fair to both the borrower and thelender .

 , malpractice ) insurance policy , maysuspend payment of premiums on their liability insurance while they serve on active duty withoutlosing any coverage .

professional liability insurance policies covered by this section are suspended from the time the insurer receives a request for protection until the insured requests in writing to have the policyreinstated .

in the case of a joint insurance policy , no suspension of coverage is required for thepolicyholders who are not called to active duty .

for example , if several physicians jointly purchasea group policy of malpractice insurance , and only one of them is called to active duty , the coverageof those not called to active duty need not be suspended by the insurer .

premiums .

the insurer may not charge premiums for coverage that is suspended .

the insurer must either refund any amount already paid for coverage that is suspended or , if the insured professional personchooses , apply the amount toward payment of any premium that comes due after coverage isreinstated .

in the case of claims involving obligationsimposed by state law on a professional person to assure that his or her patients or clients will receiveprofessional assistance in his or her absence to serve on active duty , the section clarifies that thefailure of the professional person to satisfy such an obligation will generally be considered to be abreach that occurred before the professional person began active duty .

in such a situation , the insurerwould be liable for the claim .

in the event a claim arises while the patient is receiving alternate careas arranged by the servicemember for patients during his or her absence , the insurer would not beliable for the claim .

actions against policy holder during suspension of coverage .

in the event a malpractice suit ( or administrative action ) is filed during the period when the insurance is suspended , the litigation will be stayed until the end of the suspension period .

the stayonly applies where the malpractice is alleged to have occurred before the suspension began , andwould thus be covered by the policy .

litigation stayed under this rule is deemed to be filed on thedate the suspended insurance is reinstated .

the period of any stay granted under this provision is notcounted when computing whether or not the relevant statute of limitations has run .

in the event that a professional person whose malpractice insurance coverage has been suspended under the section should die during the period of the suspension , any stay of litigation oradministrative action against the person under this section is lifted .

in addition , the insurer providingthe coverage that was suspended is to be liable under the policy just as if the deceased person haddied while covered by the policy but before the claim was filed .

the section also limitsthe premium that the insurer can charge for reinstated coverage to the rate that would have appliedif the servicemember had not been deployed .

the insurer is not allowed to recoup missing premiumsby charging higher rates for reinstated coverage , but it may charge higher rates for reinstatedcoverage if it raised the rates for all policyholders with similar coverage , if the servicemember wouldhave had to pay a higher premium even if he or she had not suspended coverage .
