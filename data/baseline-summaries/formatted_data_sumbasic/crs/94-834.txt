only federal employees hired before 1984 participate in the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) .

the csrs is closed to new entrants and will expire with the death of the last csrs annuitant sometime around the year 2075 .

civilian federal employees who were hired in 1984 or later participate in the federal employees retirement system ( fers ) , as do employees who voluntarily switched from csrs to fers during "open seasons" that were held in 1987 and 1998 .

the fers program began operating on january 1 , 1987 .

cost - of - living adjustments ( colas ) for csrs annuities are based on the average monthly percentage change in the cpi - w in the third quarter ( july to september ) of the current calendar year compared with the third quarter of the base year , which is the year in which the last cola was applied .

the base year for determining the cola effective in december 2018 ( paid out in 2019 ) is 2017 .

adjustments are effective on the first day of the month preceding the month in which they are first paid .

colas for benefits paid under fers also are based on the percentage change in the cpi - w from third quarter to third quarter , but payment of colas under fers is limited according to the eligibility category of the beneficiary and th e rate of inflation .

colas are not paid to nondisabled fers retirees as long as they are under the age of 62 .

colas are paid to survivors and disabled fers retirees of any age after the first year of disability .

all colas paid under fers are limited if the rate of inflation exceeds 2.0% , according to the following formula: from the third quarter of 2017 ( the current base year ) to the third quarter of 2018 , the cpi - w increased by 2.8% .

therefore , paid out beginning january 2019 , the csrs cola is 2.8% and the fers cola is 2.0% .

p.l .

87-793 ( enacted in 1962 ) was the first law that provided for automatic adjustments in civil service retirement and disability benefits whenever the cpi in the current year exceeded the cpi in the base year ( the year in which the last adjustment occurred ) by 3.0% or more .

in 1965 , this was changed to require an adjustment in benefits whenever the cpi for a given month was at least 3.0% higher than in the month when the last adjustment was made , and remained at that level or higher for three consecutive months .

p.l .

91-93 ( enacted in 1969 ) added one percentage point to colas in addition to the percentage change in the cpi to offset the erosion of benefits that had occurred as a result of the time lag in the adjustment formula .

 ( p.l .

91-179 did the same for colas paid to military retirees. ) .

p.l .

94-440 ( enacted in october 1976 ) repealed the one percentage point addition to colas .

in addition , this law provided for automatic semiannual adjustments in benefits based on the change in the cpi from june to december ( effective the following march 1 ) and december to june ( effective the following september 1 ) .

p.l .

97-35 ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 ) replaced semiannual colas with annual colas based on the december - to - december change in the cpi , payable in march of the following year .

p.l .

97-253 ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1982 ) delayed the implementation of colas by one month in fy1983 , fy1984 , and fy1985 .

the fy1983 cola was effective april 1 rather than march 1 .

the fy1984 cola was scheduled for may 1 and the fy1985 cola was scheduled for june 1 .

this law also mandated that nondisabled retirees under the age of 62 would receive 50% of the projected cpi plus the full difference in the actual cpi over these projections .

the law specified that the projected cpi was 6.6% for 1983 , 7.2% for 1984 , and 6.6% for 1985 .

this provision was repealed by the supplemental appropriations law that was passed in august 1984 .

colas for january 1985 and thereafter were to be the full amount for all retirees .

p.l .

97-253 limited colas in certain cases .

under the restriction , an annuity could not be increased by a cola to an amount that exceeded the greater of the maximum pay for a gs - 15 federal employee or the final pay of the employee ( or high - 3 average pay , if greater ) , increased by the average annual percentage change ( compounded ) in rates of pay of the general schedule for the period beginning on the retiree's annuity starting date and ending on the effective date of the adjustment .

p.l .

98-270 ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1983 , enacted april 1984 ) delayed the cola scheduled for may 1984 until december ( payable in january 1985 ) .

thereafter , all colas were to be effective in december and payable in january and were to be based on the change in the average monthly cpi - w from third - quarter to third - quarter .

this formula and schedule are the same as those used to calculate colas in the social security program , as required by p.l .

98-21 ( social security amendments of 1983 ) .

p.l .

98-369 ( deficit reduction act of 1984 ) specified that civilian and military retirement colas are to be paid in checks issued on the first business day of the month following the month in which they are effective .

 ( colas that are effective in december are to be paid in checks issued in january. ) .

p.l .

99-177 ( balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1981 [gramm - rudman - hollings] ) .

this law suspended all civil service retirement colas for fy1986 and for all subsequent years in which the specified deficit reduction targets for the year would not otherwise be met .

p.l .

99-509 ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 ) .

this law reinstated colas for programs in which they were subject to suspension under p.l .

99-177 for fy1987-fy1991 .

p.l .

100-119 ( balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 ) .
