funding for department of transportation programs was contained in thepresident's budget submission , issued in february , 1998 .

for fy1999 , the u.s.department of transportation ( dot ) requested total funding of $43.3 billion , a 1%increase over the fy1998 enacted level of $42.8 billion .

hearings on the budgetrequest were held in transportation subcommittees of the house and senateappropriations committees .

in a related development , many of dot's surfacetransportation programs were recently reauthorized by the transportation equityact for the 21st century , generally referred to as tea - 21 ( p.l .

105-178 , june 9,1998 ) .

both the house ( h.con.res .

284 ) and the senate ( s.con.res .

86 ) passed their respective versions of the budgetresolution and subsequently held a conference .

h.con.res .

284 provided the following amounts of budget authority and outlays for fy1999: $44.3billion ( ba ) and $42.1 billion ( bo ) .

s.con.res .

86 provided for thefollowing amounts during the same period: $51.5 ( ba ) and $42.8 ( bo ) .

in a related development , on june 9 , 1998 , president clinton signed the transportation equity act for the 21st century ( tea 21 ) into law ( p.l .

105-178 , h.r .

2400 ) .

the law provides authorization for appropriations fordot's agencies and programs for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 .

tea 21 affectsvirtually all of the department's surface transportation agencies , ranging from thenational highway traffic safety administration to the coast guard .

the impact ofits provisions have been addressed in other sections of this report .

on july 15 , 1998 , the senate committee on appropriations reported out s. 2307 , department of transportation and related agenciesappropriations bill for 1999 ( s.rept .

105-249 ) .

the report recommends$13,694,249,000 of new budget obligational authority for the department oftransportation .

this amount represents approximately $340,000,000 more than theadministration's request , and almost $1 billion more than the enacted amount forfy1998 .

in conjunction with $32,234,800,000 estimated obligation limitations ( generated from trust funds ) , the total obligational authority is approximately $45.9billion .

on july 24 , with few substantive floor amendments , the senate passed its version of the dot appropriations for fy1999 .

one provision , relativelycontroversial between the administration and congress , however , was dropped fromthe legislation .

that provision , which drew a veto warning from administrationofficials , would have barred the use of federal funds to impose "project laboragreements" on highway and transit fund projects .

a substitute amendment appearsto have served as a compromise , permitting passage .

on july 22 , 1998 , the house appropriations committee reported h.r .

4328 ( h.rept .

105-648 ) the bill provides for a total of$46.9billion ( new budget authoruty , guaranteed obligations contained in the tea - 21,limitation on obligations and exempt obligations ) for fy1999 .

this amount is $4.8billion greater than fy1998 enacted levels , and $3.9 billion greater than theadministration's fy1999 request .

on july 30 , 1998 , the house passed h.r .

4328 , also with few substantive amendments .

h.r .

4328 was referred to the senate , whichamended the bill by inserting s. 2307 after the enacting clause .

on september 17 , 1998 , the house and senate passed h.j.res .

128 , a continuing resolution to fund , until october 9 , 1998 , any government activitythat would have otherwise been funded by an annual appropriation .

following the enactment of five subsequent continuing resolutions , the house passed the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act,for fiscal year 1999 on october 19 , 1998 .

on october 21 , the senate passed thesame measure .

the conference agreement provided approximately $47 billion in fy1999 for federal transportation programs - - an amount 12% greater than the fy1998funding , 9% more than requested by the administration , and about$150 million morethan that included in the house bill .

the amount for some dot programs ( includingfederal highways and mass transit ) was virtually insured by funding "firewalls"that had been placed in the transportation equity act for the 21st century ( tea - 21 ) .

for the complete legislative text of the omnibus act as it appears in the october 19 , 1998 congressional record , members and staff should see the followinginternet web site: http: / / www.clerkweb.house.gov .

transportation budgeting uses a confusing lexicon ( for those unfamiliar with theprocess ) of budget authority and contract authority - - the latter , a form of budgetauthority .

 ( 1 ) contract authority , provides obligationalauthority for the funding of trustfund financed programs , such as the federal - aid highway program .

prior to tea - 21,changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had beenachieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budget / contractauthority and placing limitations on obligations .

the principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds tocongressional budget agreements .

contract authority is tantamount to , but does not actually involve , entering into a contract to pay for a project at some future date .

under this arrangement , specifiedin title 23 u.s.c. , which tea - 21 amends , authorized funds are automatically madeavailable to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligatedwithout appropriations legislation .

appropriations are required to make outlays atsome future date to cover these obligations .

as will be discussed , tea - 21 greatlylimits the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programsbecause the act sets the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999through fy2003 .

highway and transit grant programs work on a reimbursable basis: states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work iscompleted and vouchers are presented , perhaps months or even years after the projecthas begun .

work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligated funds andalthough they are considered "used" and remain as commitments against the trustfund balances , they are not subtracted from balances .

trust fund balances , therefore,appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected futurecommitments must remain available .

both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short - and long - term commitments .

these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal yearas projects are completed and , to a much greater extent , outstanding obligations tobe made at some unspecified future date .

additionally , there are unobligatedamounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects , but have not beencommitted to specific projects .

two terms are associated with the distribution of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs .

the first of these , apportionments , refers to fundsdistributed to the states for formula driven programs .

for example , all nationalhighway system ( nhs ) funds are apportioned to the states .

allocated funds , arefunds distributed on an administrative basis , typically to programs under directfederal control .

for example , federal lands highway program monies are allocated ; the allocation can be to another federal agency , to a state , to an indian tribe , or tosome other governmental entity .

these terms do not refer to the federal budgetprocess , but often provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients , whomay assume , albeit incorrectly , that a state apportionment is part of the federal budgetper se .

for fy1999 , the dot requested total funding of $43.259 billion , about a 1.0% increase from the fy1998 enactment of level $42.828 billion .

the department'sfy1999 budget request was similar in many respects to the fy1998 appropriation .

the agencies targeted for gains include ( in descending order ) : the maritimeadministration ( +35.3% ) ; the national highway traffic safety administration ( +21.92% ) ; research and special programs administration ( +16% ) ; federalaviation administration ( +7.0% ) ; federal railroad administration ( +2.6% ) ; officeof the secretary ( +2.4% ) ; and the u.s. coast guard ( +2% ) .

those whose budgetrequest were reduced for fy1999 included ( in descending order ) : st. lawrenceseaway development corporation ( - 100% ) ; federal transit administration ( - 1.38% ) .

the budgets for the office of the inspector general and the surfacetransportation board are set at the fy1998 level .

this report analyzes the fy1999 budget request and final action from a numberof perspectives .

first , funding proposals for several national transportation priorities,such as safety , national security , infrastructure needs , and technology development,are highlighted and selected policy issues associated with these are presented .

second , historical funding trends are analyzed .

third , highlights of the fy1999budget request for several key modal administrations , such as the federal highwayadministration , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , and the u.s. coastguard , are summarized .

 table 1 .

status of dot appropriations,fy199 .

one of the major challenges facing appropriators continues to be the allocationof funds for the u.s. department of transportation among numerous competingnational interests .

competition for these funds stems from various transportationinterests , and from the modal administrations themselves seeking portions of the"transportation pie. .

monies have been allocated for a diverse array of purposes , forexample , to pay for the expenses of the u.s. coast guard , to improve safety acrossthe transportation system , and to help finance various infrastructure needs .

in thedot and related agencies appropriations act , monies are also provided to supportthe national transportation safety board , and the surface transportation board ( stb ) , and several other transportation - related agencies .

 ( 2 ) the perennial question of priorities surrounds the appropriations process .

throughout its budget request , the dot continues to emphasize several prioritiesincluding: safety , infrastructure , innovative financing , environmental enhancement,technology , and national security .

much of the appropriations process must take place within the newly enacted framework of the transportation equity act for the 21st century ( tea - 21 ) , signedinto law on june 9 , 1998 ( p.l .

105-178 , h.r .

2400 ) .

the act , whichauthorizes appropriations for key transportation programs through the fiscal year2003 , emphasizes certain programs and de - emphasizes others .

the general sense ofcongress appears to be that , although transportation trust funds are not sacrosanct,proceeds from the gasoline tax must be targeted towards the maintenance of the vastu.s .

highway and transit network , and not viewed as a source of revenue for thegeneral treasury .

although attempts to move highway and transit programs"off - budget" were unsuccessful , congress did insert language within tea - 21toprotect specific funding by creating "fire walls" around programs .

in addition tospending ceilings , the fire walls effectively create floors .

the creation of thesedevices emerged as a point of contention between authorizers and appropriators .
