on august 2 , 2005 , the president signed the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations act for fy2006 ( p.l .

109-54 , h.r .

2361 ) .

title ii of p.l .

109-54 provided $7.73 billion for the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , subject to an across - the - board rescission of 0.476% .

the president signed the department of defense appropriations act for fy2006 ( p.l .

109-148 , h.r .

2863 ) on december 30 , 2005 , which included a 1% government - wide rescission , further reducing epa's final appropriation .

even after both rescissions , the fy2006 appropriation for epa is an increase above the administration's request of $7.52 billion , but a decrease below the fy2005 appropriation of $8.03 billion .

there were varying degrees of interest in specific programs and activities funded within epa's appropriation .

among the prominent issues in the debate over the interior bill were the adequacy of funding for wastewater infrastructure , cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the superfund program , cleanup of commercial and industrial sites referred to as brownfields , epa's homeland security activities , and "congressional project priorities" or earmarks .

in addition to funding , another issue receiving significant attention was epa's use and consideration of intentional human dosing studies for determining potential human health risks from exposure to pesticides .

the following sections explain the methodology used in this report for funding comparisons , provide background information on the history and mission of epa , include a brief overview of the president's fy2006 budget request for epa , discuss congressional action on appropriations in the first session of the 109 th congress , and examine funding levels and relevant issues for selected programs and activities by epa appropriations account .

 ( for a discussion of broader issues relevant to the statutes and programs that epa administers , see crs issue brief ib10146 , environmental protection issues in the 109 th congress .

for a discussion of fy2005 funding , see crs report rl32441 , environmental protection agency: appropriations for fy2005 ( pdf ) . ) .

in general , the term appropriations used in this report refers to total funds available , including regular annual and supplemental appropriations , as well as rescissions , transfers , and deferrals , but excludes permanent budget authorities .

fy2006 appropriations presented in this report have not been adjusted to account for the 0.476% rescission required in p.l .

109-54 , nor for the 1% government - wide rescission required in p.l .

109-148 .

the white house's office of management and budget ( omb ) is responsible for applying rescissions to the budgets of affected agencies , including epa , adjusting the amounts that congress indicates in final appropriations bills and accompanying reports .

funding increases and decreases noted in this report are generally calculated based on comparisons among final fy2006 funding levels prior to the two rescissions above , house and senate amounts prior to conference , the administration's fy2006 request , and appropriations enacted for fy2005 .

requested and appropriated funding amounts presented throughout this report have not been adjusted for inflation .

in some cases , small increases above the previous year funding may actually reflect a decrease when adjusted for inflation .

fy2006 appropriations amounts indicated in this report are from the final bill and conference report on h.r .

2361 and from the house - and senate - passed versions of this bill and their accompanying reports .

the house committee on appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout this report for fy2005 enacted amounts and the administration's fy2006 request .

other sources of information include the congressional record , the u.s. environmental protection agency fy2006 justification of appropriation estimates for the committee on appropriations ( referred to throughout this report as the epa fy2006 budget justification ) , and omb's budget of the u.s. government: fy2006 .

the nixon administration established epa in 1970 in response to growing public concern about environmental pollution , consolidating federal pollution control responsibilities that had been divided among several agencies .

epa's responsibilities have grown as congress has enacted an increasing number of environmental laws , as well as major amendments to these statutes , over three decades .

annual appropriations provide the funds necessary for epa to carry out its responsibilities under these laws , such as the regulation of air and water quality , use of pesticides and toxic substances , management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes , and cleanup of environmental contamination .

epa also awards grants to assist state , tribal , and local governments in controlling pollution in order to comply with federal laws .

 ( for discussion of these laws , see crs report rl30798 , environmental laws: summaries of major statutes administered by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) ) .

figure 1 , below , provides a history of discretionary budget authority for epa from fy1970 through fy2006 , both adjusted and not adjusted for inflation .

epa's funding trends over the history of the agency generally reflect the evolution of statutory responsibilities and authorities enacted by congress in response to a range of environmental concerns .

in terms of the overall federal budget , epa's annual appropriation has represented a relatively small portion of total discretionary budget authority ( just under 1% in recent years ) .

epa's funding has grown from $1.0 billion when epa was established in fy1970 to a high of $8.4 billion in fy2004 .

president bush submitted his initial fy2006 budget request to congress on february 7 , 2005 .

the request included $7.52 billion for epa , $506 million less than the $8.03 billion fy2005 appropriation .

as in past years , the total request was divided among eight different accounts to which congress traditionally allocates funding in the annual appropriations bills , listed in table 2 below .

epa also presented its budget request in the form of performance goals , as required by the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra , p.l .

103-62 ) .

epa reduced its number of goals from 10 to 5 in its fy2005 budget justification .

the agency presented its fy2006 justification according to these same five goals: goal 1: clean air and global climate change ; goal 2: clean and safe water ; goal 3: land preservation and restoration ; goal 4: healthy communities and ecosystems ; and goal 5: compliance and environmental stewardship .

related to these goals , the administration also uses omb's performance assessment rating tool ( part ) to measure the performance of federal programs .

omb issued part ratings for 32 epa programs , which were used in the formulation of the administration's fy2006 request .

 ( for further discussion of the part , see crs report rs21416 , the president ' s management agenda: a brief introduction . ) .

the largest proposed decrease in the president's initial request for epa was for grants to states for wastewater infrastructure projects .

the president submitted a subsequent request on october 28 , 2005 , to rescind $166 million from epa's fy2006 appropriation for wastewater infrastructure projects funded through the clean water state revolving fund ( srf ) .

as discussed later , the rescission would have taken away nearly all of the increase that congress provided for this purpose , reducing the appropriation close to what the administration requested in february .

in addition to proposed reductions for some ongoing programs , the president's fy2006 budget did not include funding designated by congress in fy2005 for individual projects , locations , or institutions ( often referred to as "earmarked funding" ) within epa's appropriations accounts .

this is consistent with past administrations' budget requests .

according to omb , the president's fy2006 budget did not include $489 million appropriated in fy2005 for "unrequested projects. .

more than half of these appropriated funds were for water infrastructure projects .

in the fy2006 appropriation , congress restored earmarked funding for many of these projects and designated new earmarked funding for others as well .

although the president's budget proposed decreases for some programs relative to fy2005 , it included steady or increased funding for other activities , such as cleanup of superfund sites , cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields , homeland security , and several grant programs for scientific research on human health effects .

the administration submitted a subsequent request on october 28 , 2005 , that would have increased overall funds available to epa by $15 million through a reallocation of emergency spending for disaster relief in gulf coast states affected by hurricanes katrina and rita , of which congress reallocated $8 million to epa in the fy2006 defense appropriations bill .

this reallocated funding was targeted for epa's response to leaking underground tanks in hurricane - affected areas .

early in the 109 th congress , the house appropriations committee reduced the number of its subcommittees from 13 to 10 .

the senate appropriations committee also approved the elimination of one of its subcommittees , leaving 12 .

both reorganizations eliminated the veterans affairs , housing and urban development ( va - hud ) , and independent agencies subcommittee , which historically had funding jurisdiction over epa .

as a result of this reorganization , the house and senate incorporated epa's funding within the jurisdiction of the department of the interior subcommittee , beginning with the fy2006 appropriation .

in the first session , the house and senate passed the conference agreement on the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill for fy2006 ( h.r .

2361 , hereafter referred to as the "interior bill" ) .

the president signed the final bill into law ( p.l .

109-54 ) on august 2 , 2005 .

funding for epa was included in title ii .

table 1 indicates floor action in both chambers followed by enactment .

title ii of p.l .

109-54 provided $7.73 billion for epa , subject to an across - the - board rescission of 0.476% .

the house had proposed $7.71 billion , and the senate had proposed $7.88 billion , neither of which included an across - the - board rescission .

p.l .

109-54 also "rescinded" $80.0 million from past fiscal year appropriations and treated these funds as an offset to increase epa's total appropriation to $7.81 billion , yielding the net amount of $7.73 billion in new appropriations .

the house - passed bill had included a $100-million rescission of prior year appropriations , and the senate - passed bill had included $58.0 million .

overall , epa's appropriation in p.l .

109-54 was an increase above the administrations' request of $7.52 billion , but a decrease below the fy2005 appropriation of $8.03 billion .

at the end of the first session , the 109 th congress passed the conference agreement on the department of defense appropriations act for fy2006 ( h.r .

2863 , h.rept .

109-359 ) , and the president signed the bill into law ( p.l .

109-148 ) on december 30 , 2005 .

it included a government - wide rescission that reduced fy2006 funding for epa and all other federal agencies by 1% , except for the department of veterans affairs and excluded spending designated as an "emergency" requirement .

p.l .

109-148 also reallocated $8 million in emergency funds to epa for responding to leaking underground tanks in gulf coast states affected by hurricanes katrina and rita .

as noted above , the administration had recommended a $15 million reallocation for this purpose on october 28 , 2005 .

this recommendation was part of a proposal to reallocate $17.1 billion among numerous federal agencies , which was provided in two supplemental appropriations acts ( p.l .

109-61 and p.l .

109-62 ) for disaster relief in gulf coast states affected by the hurricanes .

p.l .

109-148 did not include a $166 million rescission for epa's clean water state revolving fund ( srf ) .

this fund provides federal assistance to states for issuing loans to communities for constructing and upgrading wastewater infrastructure to meet federal requirements , discussed later in this report .

as indicated above , the administration had requested this rescission on october 28 , 2005 , as part of a separate proposal to rescind $2.3 billion in funding from "lower - priority federal programs and excess funds. .

the administration indicated that the rescission was intended to help offset the "unprecedented cost" of disaster relief in hurricane - affected areas and to "control growth in discretionary spending. .

earlier in the first session , on april 28 , 2005 , the house and senate had passed the conference agreement on the fy2006 budget resolution ( h.con.res .

95 , h.rept .

109-62 ) , including budget authority ( ba ) for the natural resource and environment function ( 300 ) .

this function includes several federal land management agencies and epa .

this resolution provided the framework for the consideration of appropriations , and its amounts were nonbinding .

the resolution included $30.02 billion ( ba ) for function 300 , but as in past years , it did not specify funding among individual agencies .

rather , funding levels for epa and other federal agencies were determined in the appropriations process .

for additional information on the fy2006 federal budget process , see crs report rl32791 , congressional budget actions in 2005 , and crs report rl32812 , the budget for fiscal year 2006 .

as in recent years , epa's fy2006 appropriation is allocated among eight line - item accounts .

table 2 identifies each account , the amounts proposed and enacted for fy2006 , and the funding levels enacted for fy2005 .

figure 2 illustrates the portion of the enacted fy2006 appropriation allocated to each of the eight accounts .

a discussion of specific activities and programs funded within each account and relevant issues follow .

even after the 0.476% and 1% rescissions , p.l .

109-54 overall appropriated more funding for epa in fy2006 than the administration had requested , but provided less than congress appropriated the previous fiscal year .

as in past years , the largest portion of epa's appropriation for fy2006 was allocated to the state and tribal assistance grants ( stag ) account .

the adequacy of funding for this account was among the most prominent issues of congressional debate .

the administration's request to significantly reduce funding for the clean water state revolving fund ( srf ) within the stag account from $1.09 billion in fy2005 to $730 million in fy2006 was particularly contentious .

prior to the two above rescissions , p.l .

109-54 provided $900 million for the clean water srf , a $170 million increase above the $730 million request but nearly a $200 million decrease below the fy2005 appropriation of $1.09 billion .

most of the increase relative to the request was made available by reducing funding for other activities within epa's appropriation .

in passing its version of the fy2006 interior bill , the house had proposed $850 million for the clean water srf , including $100 million rescinded from prior year appropriations .

amendments during the house debate to increase fy2006 funding for the clean water srf closer to the fy2005 level were not adopted .

the senate had proposed $1.1 billion in passing its version of the interior bill , which was slightly above the fy2005 appropriation .

the extent to which congress should designate or "earmark" funds for individual projects , locations , or institutions continued to be an issue .

p.l .

109-54 provided less funding than congress appropriated in fy2005 for projects identified in the conference report as "congressional priorities" ( earmarks ) within the science and technology , environmental programs and management , and state and tribal assistance grants accounts .

congress has traditionally awarded funding for these types of projects noncompetitively .

the house appropriations committee had proposed a different approach for the earmarking of funds in the science and technology and environmental programs and management accounts , recommending epa award them competitively among past recipients of earmarked funds .

this approach was not adopted in the final bill .

the adequacy of funding for the superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites also continued to be a prominent issue in the debate over epa's appropriation .

p.l .

109-54 provided more funding for the superfund program than congress appropriated for fy2005 .

during the debate , some members questioned whether the increase was sufficient .

they , along with states , environmental organizations , and others , argued that higher funding is necessary to adequately address the risks to human health and the environment from hazardous waste sites .

other members and the administration asserted that the proposed funding would be sufficient to meet cleanup needs .

in addition to the adequacy of funding for superfund cleanup activities , the source of funds continued to be a point of contention in congress .

as the balance of the superfund trust fund has been expended , the program is now supported with general treasury revenues , leading some members of congress to advocate the reinstatement of the taxes on industry that once supported the trust fund .

the administration and other members assert that individual polluters continue to pay for site cleanups and that a tax on industry as a whole is therefore not needed .

several bills were introduced in the first session of the 109 th congress to reinstate superfund taxes , but did not receive further action .

p.l .

109-54 continued the use of general treasury revenues to support the superfund program in fy2006 .

epa's use and consideration of intentional human dosing studies , whether conducted by epa or others , for determining associated human health risks of pesticides were of interest to members during the appropriations debate .

of particular interest were concerns about the adequacy of health safety standards for human research subjects and general ethical questions with respect to epa's use of data from such studies .

p.l .

109-54 included provisions directing epa to complete relevant rulemaking according to specific congressional recommendations and banned the use of fy2006 funds to consider or to conduct human dosing studies in the agency's review of pesticides until a final rule is issued .

throughout the debate , there were varying levels of interest in specific funding for other epa activities as well .

the ability to increase funding for projects or add new projects in fy2006 ultimately was affected by competing priorities of congress to allocate limited funding to numerous federal agencies within the interior appropriations bill , where epa's funding now falls .

epa's funding was moved from the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations subcommittee on veterans affairs , housing and urban development ( va - hud ) , and independent agencies to that of the interior subcommittees beginning with the fy2006 appropriation .

this was the result of a reorganization during the first session of 109 th congress that included the elimination of the va - hud and independent agencies appropriations subcommittee .
