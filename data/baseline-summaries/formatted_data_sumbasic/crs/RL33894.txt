despite the passage of the help america vote act ( p.l .

107-252 ) in 2002 , many election - reform issues have continued to arise in conjunction with subsequent federal elections .

attempts to address those issues legislatively have taken form in many bills introduced in recent congresses .

some bills were introduced specifically in response to issues raised in consequence of the passage of hava .

others were introduced in response to events , especially problems that occurred during the 2004 federal election and as a result of hurricane katrina in august 2005 .

still others addressed longstanding election - reform issues .

some were very specifically targeted to a particular issue , whereas others were more comprehensive , focusing on several issues .

this report discusses the range of election issues covered by various legislative proposals in the 109 th congress , and the various approaches taken by those bills .

bills introduced in the 110 th congress will be covered elsewhere .

the purpose of this report is not only to provide a history of legislative activity on election reform , but more importantly , to provide information that may be useful in deliberations on those issues in the 110 th congress .

while hava appears generally to have been well - received by both election officials and the public , some provisions have been controversial , especially the following: accessibility of voting systems .

section 301 ( a ) ( 3 ) of hava requires that each polling place have at least one fully accessible voting system , beginning in 2006 .

some observers believe that this requirement is excessive and exceptions should be made for jurisdictions with low population , such as rural areas and small towns , where voters are well - known to election officials .

proponents counter that the high and increasing mobility of the u.s. population , and the problem of the "hidden" disabled , make accessibility essential for full enfranchisement .

no bills were introduced in the 109 th congress that addressed this issue .

that is not the case with the other major controversy relating to accessibility .

sec .

301 ( a ) ( 3 ) promotes the use of direct recording electronic ( dre ) voting machines .

they are widely recognized as the most accessible kind of voting system .

however , they have been criticized as being insufficiently secure in comparison to paper - based systems , and several bills would have required that they produce paper ballots .

provisional voting .

sec .

302 ( a ) requires that any person be permitted to fill out and submit a provisional ballot at a polling place , if the person claims to be a registered , eligible voter in the jurisdiction but is not so considered by election officials at the polling place .

it went into effect in 2004 .

while some concerns have been raised about difficulty of implementation , the major controversy with respect to this provision has been with respect to the criteria for counting provisional ballots — in particular , whether a ballot should be counted if cast in a polling place other than that at which the voter is registered .

several bills were introduced that would have addressed this controversy .

among other issues that arose in conjunction with recent federal elections and which were addressed by proposed legislation were concerns about political activity and conflict of interest among voting system vendors and among election officials , the use of deceptive practices relating to voting by political operatives or others , enforcement of hava requirements , access to polling places by observers , the provisioning of voting machines to polling places , the level of training given to pollworkers , voting rights of convicted persons , various aspects of voting - system security , voter identification , and voter - registration requirements .

other issues addressed by one or more bills included absentee and early voting , alternative language requirements , authorization of and budget submission by the election assistance commission ( eac ) , election crimes , the date on which elections are held and whether or not election day should be a holiday , the gathering and reporting of statistics relating to elections , the workings of the electoral college , extension of voting rights to residents in areas other than the 50 states , extension of hava deadlines , hava payments to states , proportional representation and instant - runoff voting , redistricting procedures , state laws on election administration , voter error , voter information , and voting leave for employees on election day .

unless otherwise indicated , provisions of bills discussed in this report refer only to federal elections .

unless otherwise indicated , bills introduced in the house were referred to the house committee on house administration and those in the senate to the senate committee on rules and administration .

similar bills that had been introduced by the same first sponsor in the 108 th congress are also noted .

108 th congress : s. 1986 .

required implementation of a voter - verification method that used "the most accurate technology," which would not necessarily be a paper ballot as required in s. 450 .

both bills contain similar provisions on security review reports and consultation services by nist .

s. 1986 required voting systems to meet federal computer - security requirements or more stringent ones if established by the eac , whereas s. 450 specifies several requirements and provides nist the authority to establish additional ones .

s. 1986 does not contain any of the other provisions in s. 450 .

s. 2313 .

this bill has voter - verification provisions similar to those in s. 450 , although the requirements for accessible voting systems are more detailed in the latter .

the bills also have similar provisions on ( 1 ) communications devices and open - source software , ( 2 ) certification of the security of state voter - registration lists , ( 3 ) security standards for manufacturers , except that the current bill adds the requirement for background checks , ( 4 ) provision of security consultation services to states by nist , ( 5 ) mandatory recounts , and ( 6 ) repeal of the eac's exemption from certain contracting requirements .

s. 2313 authorized $150 million rather than $500 million to meet the new verification requirements .

the current bill omits the provisions in s. 2313 that accelerated the deadlines for compliance with hava requirements and required deployment of an interim paper system by states unable to meet the verification requirements before the deadline .

other provisions in s. 450 are not contained in s. 2313 .
