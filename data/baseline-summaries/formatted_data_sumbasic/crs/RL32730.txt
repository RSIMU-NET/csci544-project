the two had been held in the detention center for 10 months after being picked up at sea in bahamian waters .

the dentists had received u.s. visas while in cuba , but the cuban government had denied them exit visas .

several members of congress had sought the release of the two cubans .

on february 3 , 2006 , the treasury department's office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) asked starwood hotels , the u.s. owner of the sheraton maria isabel hotel in mexico city , to expel a cuban delegation that was meeting with u.s. oil executives at a privately - sponsored u.s. - cuba energy conference .

the hotel complied , but mexican officials indicated that it could face fines under mexican legislation that permits the government to fine any company in mexico that complies with u.s. legislation governing economic sanctions imposed on cuba .

 ( ultimately , mexico announced on march 24 , 2006 , that it was fining the hotel $112,000. ) .

u.s. economic sanctions prohibit financial transactions with cuba , and this applies to u.s. companies and their subsidiaries anywhere in the world .

while these prohibitions extend to the provision of services to cuban nationals , this appears to be the first time that ofac has used its authority to block retail services such as a hotel stay from cuban nationals outside of the united states .

on january 9 , 2006 , the u.s. coast guard repatriated 15 cuban migrants that had landed on a piling of an old bridge in the florida keys that does not connect to land .

on february 28 , 2006 , a u.s. federal judge in miami ordered that the u.s. government make arrangements for the 15 cubans to be brought back to the united states .

on january 6 , 2006 , u.s. federal agents arrested a florida international university professor and his wife , carlos and elsa alvarez , for operating as covert agents for cuba for decades .

they pled not guilty at an arraignment in miami federal court on january 17 .

politically cuba remains a hard - line communist state .

until he recently stepped down temporarily while recuperating from surgery , fidel castro ruled as head of state and government since the 1959 cuban revolution , which ousted the corrupt government of fulgencio batista .

in april 1961 , castro stated that the cuban revolution was socialist , and in december 1961 , he proclaimed himself to be a marxist - leninist .

from 1959 until 1976 , castro ruled by decree .

a constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the communist party as the leading force in the state and in society ( with power centered in a political bureau headed by fidel castro ) .

the constitution also outlined national , provincial , and local governmental structures .

executive power has been vested in a council of ministers headed by fidel castro as president of the council .

legislative authority is vested in a national assembly of people's power , currently with 609 members , that meets twice annually for brief periods .

when the assembly is not in session , a council of state acts on its behalf .

as president of the council of state until recently , castro has served as head of state and head of government .

although assembly members were directly elected for the first time in february 1993 , only a single slate of candidates was offered .

in october 1997 , the cuban communist party held its 5 th congress ( the prior one was held in 1991 ) in which the party reaffirmed its commitment to a single party state and reelected fidel and raúl castro as the party's first and second secretaries .

direct elections for the national assembly were again held in january 1998 and january 2003 , but voters again were not offered a choice of candidates .

for a number of years , fidel's brother raúl , as first vice president of the council of state , has been the officially designated successor and was slated to become head of state and head of government with fidel's departure .

raúl — who turned 75 on june 3 , 2006 — also served as first vice president of the council of ministers , as minister of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) , and as second secretary of the communist party .

on july 31 , 2006 , fidel provisionally ceded political power to his brother raúl for several weeks in order to recover from intestinal surgery .

as a result , in a proclamation signed by fidel , raúl castro became first secretary of the communist party , commander in chief of the far , and president of the council of state and government .

at the same time , fidel tapped six other high - ranking government officials on a provisional basis for key roles in health , education , and energy projects .

he delegated the job of promoting public and international health projects to current minister of public health jose ramon balaguer cabrera .

on education , he designated jose ramon machado ventura and esteban lazo hernandez , both members of the political bureau ( politburo ) of the communist party and both vice presidents of the council of state .

on energy , he designated carlos lage , a vice president of the council of state and executive secretary of the council of ministers .

lage is known for orchestrating cuba's economic recovery in the 1990s .

fidel also directed lage , as well as foreign minister felipe perez roque and central bank president francisco soberon valdes , to form a commission to manage and prioritize funds for the health , education , and energy programs .

with the cutoff of assistance from the former soviet union , cuba experienced severe economic deterioration from 1989-1993 , with estimates of economic decline ranging from 35-50% , but there has been considerable improvement since 1994 .

from 1994-2000 , economic growth averaged 3.7% annually , with a high of 7.8% in 1996 .

in 2001 and 2002 , economic growth slowed in the aftermath of the effects of hurricane michelle and the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states .

the terrorist attacks severely affected cuba's tourist industry , with reports of some hotels closing and restaurants being empty .

hurricane michelle damaged some 45,000 homes and severely hurt the agricultural sector .

economic growth in 2004 measured 4.2% , and was affected negatively by a drought in eastern cuba , the worst in 40 years , that severely damaged agricultural crops .

hurricanes charley and ivan also caused significant damage and flooding in western cuba .

in 2005 , despite the widespread damage caused by hurricane dennis that struck in july and hurricane wilma that struck in october , economic growth still registered an impressive 9.5% .

hurricane dennis killed 16 people and resulted in $1.4 billion in damages to housing , infrastructure , and agriculture .

the storm damaged some 120,000 homes as well as cuba's national power grid causing significant electrical outages .

hurricane wilma caused significant flooding in havana , with more than $700 million in damage according to the cuban government .

on the positive side , economic growth benefitted from the growth of the tourism , nickel , and oil sectors .

cuba is also benefitting from a preferential oil agreement with venezuela , which provides cuba with 90,000 barrels of oil a day .

promises of substantial chinese investment could further boost cuba's nickel production .

economic growth for 2006 is forecast to be 7.5% .

cuba has expressed pride for the nation's accomplishments in health and education .

the world bank estimates that in 2004 , the adult literacy rate was 97% and life expectancy was 77 years .

the under - 5 years of age mortality rate was 9 per 1,000 , the lowest rate in latin america and comparable to the rate of the united states .

when cuba's economic slide began in 1989 , the government showed little willingness to adopt any significant market - oriented economic reforms , but in 1993 , faced with unprecedented economic decline , cuba began to change policy direction .

beginning in 1993 , cubans were allowed to own and use u.s. dollars and to shop at dollar - only shops previously limited to tourists and diplomats .

self - employment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993 , most in the service sector , and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations .

other cuban economic reforms included breaking up large state farms into smaller , more autonomous , agricultural cooperatives ( basic units of cooperative production , ubpcs ) in 1993 ; opening agricultural markets in september 1994 where farmers could sell part of their produce on the open market ; opening artisan markets in october 1994 for the sale of handicrafts ; allowing private food catering , including home restaurants ( paladares ) in june 1995 ( in effect legalizing activities that were already taking place ) ; approving a new foreign investment law in september 1995 that allows fully owned investments by foreigners in all sectors of the economy with the exception of defense , health , and education ; and authorizing the establishment of free trade zones with tariff reductions typical of such zones in june 1996 .

in may 1997 , the government enacted legislation to reform the banking system and established a new central bank ( bcc ) to operate as an autonomous and independent entity .

despite these measures , the quality of life for many cubans remains difficult — characterized by low wages , high prices for many basic goods , shortages of medicines , and power outages — and the government has backtracked on some of its reform efforts .

regulations and new taxes have made it extremely difficult for many of the nation's self - employed .

some home restaurants have been forced to close because of the regulations .

some foreign investors in cuba have also begun to complain that the government has backed out of deals or forced them out of business .

in april 2004 , the cuban government limited the use of dollars by state companies for any services or products not considered part of their core business .

some analysts viewed the measure as an effort to turn back the clock on economic reform measures .

on october 25 , 2004 , fidel castro announced that u.s. dollars no longer would be used in entities that currently accept dollars ( such as stores , restaurants , and hotels ) .

instead , cubans would need to exchange their dollars for "convertible pesos," with a 10% surcharge for the exchange .

cubans could exchange their dollars or deposit them in banks with the surcharge until november 14 .

dollar bank accounts will still be allowed , but cubans will not be able to deposit new dollars into the accounts .

beginning on april 9 , 2005 , convertible pesos were no longer on par with the u.s. dollar , but instead were linked to a basket of foreign currencies .

this reduced the value of dollar remittances sent to cuba and provides more hard currency to the cuban government .

in the early 1960s , u.s. - cuban relations deteriorated sharply when fidel castro began to build a repressive communist dictatorship and moved his country toward close relations with the soviet union .

the often tense and hostile nature of the u.s. - cuban relationship is illustrated by such events and actions as u.s. covert operations to overthrow the castro government culminating in the ill - fated april 1961 bay of pigs invasion ; the october 1962 missile crisis in which the united states confronted the soviet union over its attempt to place offensive nuclear missiles in cuba ; cuban support for guerrilla insurgencies and military support for revolutionary governments in africa and the western hemisphere ; the 1980 exodus of around 125,000 cubans to the united states in the so - called mariel boatlift ; the 1994 exodus of more than 30,000 cubans who were interdicted and housed at u.s. facilities in guantanamo and panama ; and the february 1996 shootdown by cuban fighter jets of two u.s. civilian planes operated by the cuban american group , brothers to the rescue , which resulted in the death of four u.s. crew members .

since the early 1960s , u.s. policy toward cuba has consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions .

these sanctions were made stronger with the cuban democracy act ( cda ) of 1992 ( p.l .

102-484 , title xvii ) and with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) , often referred to as the helms / burton legislation .

the cda prohibits u.s. subsidiaries from engaging in trade with cuba and prohibits entry into the united states for any vessel to load or unload freight if it has engaged in trade with cuba within the last 180 days .

the helms / burton legislation , enacted in the aftermath of cuba's shooting down of two u.s. civilian planes in february 1996 , combines a variety of measures to increase pressure on cuba and provides for a plan to assist cuba once it begins the transition to democracy .

among the law's sanctions is a provision in title iii that holds any person or government that traffics in u.s. property confiscated by the cuban government liable for monetary damages in u.s. federal court .

acting under provisions of the law , however , both president clinton and president bush have suspended the implementation of title iii at six - month intervals .

another component of u.s. policy , a so - called second track , consists of support measures for the cuban people .

this includes u.s. private humanitarian donations , medical exports to cuba under the terms of the cuban democracy act of 1992 , u.s. government support for democracy - building efforts , and u.s. - sponsored radio and television broadcasting to cuba .

in addition , the 106 th congress approved the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 ( p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) that allows for agricultural exports to cuba , albeit with restrictions on financing such exports .

the clinton administration made several changes to u.s. policy in the aftermath of the pope's january 1998 visit to cuba , which were intended to bolster u.s. support for the cuban people .

these included the resumption of direct flights to cuba ( which had been curtailed after the february 1996 shootdown of two u.s. civilian planes ) , the resumption of cash remittances for the support of close relatives in cuba ( which had been curtailed in august 1994 in response to the migration crisis with cuba ) , and the streamlining of procedures for the commercial sale of medicines and medical supplies and equipment to cuba .

in january 1999 , president clinton announced several additional measures to support the cuban people .

these included a broadening of cash remittances to cuba , so that all u.s. residents ( not just those with close relatives in cuba ) could send remittances to cuba ; an expansion of direct passenger charter flights to cuba from additional u.s. cities other than miami ( direct flights later in the year began from los angeles and new york ) ; and an expansion of people - to - people contact by loosening restrictions on travel to cuba for certain categories of travelers , such as professional researchers and those involved in a wide range of educational , religious , and sports activities .
