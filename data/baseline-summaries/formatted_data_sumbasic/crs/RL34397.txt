individual retirement accounts ( iras ) are tax - advantaged accounts that individuals ( or married couples ) can establish to accumulate funds for retirement .

depending on the type of ira , contributions may be made on a pretax or post - tax basis , and investment earnings are either tax - deferred or tax - free .

iras were first authorized by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ; p.l .

93 - 406 ) .

originally limited to workers without pension coverage , all workers and spouses were made eligible for iras by the economic recovery act of 1981 ( p.l .

97 - 34 ) .

the tax reform act of 1986 ( p.l .

99 - 514 ) limited the eligibility for tax - deductible contributions to individuals whose employers do not sponsor plans and to those whose employers sponsor plans but who have earnings below certain thresholds .

the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( p.l .

105 - 34 ) allowed for certain penalty - free withdrawals and authorized the roth ira , which provides tax - free growth from after - tax contributions .

the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 ( p.l .

107 - 16 ) significantly affected the contribution limits in these plans in three ways: ( 1 ) it increased the limits , ( 2 ) it indexed the limits to inflation , and ( 3 ) it allowed for individuals aged 50 and older to make additional "catch - up" contributions .

among other provisions , the pension protection act of 2006 ( p.l .

109 - 280 ) temporarily allowed for tax - free distributions for charitable contributions ; made permanent the indexing of contribution limits to inflation ; and allowed taxpayers to direct the internal revenue service ( irs ) to deposit tax refunds directly into an ira .

this report describes the two kinds of iras that individual workers can establish: traditional iras and roth iras .

it describes the rules regarding eligibility , contributions , and withdrawals .

it also describes a tax credit for retirement savings contributions .

an appendix explains rules related to penalty - free distributions for those affected by the 2005 gulf of mexico hurricanes and the 2008 midwestern floods .

the appendix also describes relief provided by the irs to those affected by hurricane sandy in 2012 and hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria in 2017 .

traditional iras are funded by workers' contributions , which may be tax - deductible .

the contributions accrue investment earnings in an account , and these earnings are used as a basis for retirement income .

among the benefits of traditional iras , two are ( 1 ) pretax contributions , which provide larger bases for accumulating investment earnings and , thus , provide larger account balances at retirement than if the money had been placed in taxable accounts ; and ( 2 ) taxes are paid when funds are distributed .

since income tax rates in retirement are often lower than during working life , traditional ira holders are likely to pay less in taxes when contributions are withdrawn than when the income was earned .

roth iras were authorized by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( p.l .

105 - 34 ) .

the key differences between traditional and roth iras are that contributions to roth iras are made with after - tax funds and qualified distributions are not included in taxable income ; investment earnings accrue free of taxes .

the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 ( p.l .

107 - 16 ) authorized a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for eligible individuals , or $2,000 if filing a joint return , who contribute to iras or employer - sponsored retirement plans .

the retirement savings contribution credit , also referred to as the saver's credit , is in addition to the tax deduction for contributions to traditional iras or other employer - sponsored pension plans .

to receive the credit , taxpayers must be at least 18 years old , not full - time students , not an exemption on someone else's tax return , and have agi less than certain limits .

the limits are in table 5 .

for example , individuals who make a $2,000 ira contribution in 2018 , have income of $15,000 , and list their filing status as single would be able to reduce their 2018 tax liability by up to $1,000 .

taxpayers must file form 1040 , 1040a , or 1040nr .

the saver's credit is not available on form 1040ez , which may limit the use of the credit .

 table 6 contains data on the end - of - year assets in traditional and roth iras from 2005 to 2016 .

according to the investment company institute , traditional iras held much more in assets than roth iras .

at the end of 2016 , there was $6.7 trillion held in traditional iras and $660 billion held in roth iras .

within traditional iras , more funds flowed from rollovers from employer - sponsored pensions compared with funds from regular contributions .

for example , in 2014 ( the latest year for which such data are available ) funds from rollovers were $423.9 billion , whereas funds from contributions were only $17.5 billion .

however , within roth iras in 2014 more funds flowed from contributions ( $21.9 billion in 2014 ) than from rollovers ( $5.7 billion in 2014 ) .

table 7 and table 8 provide additional data on ira ownership amounts among u.s. households .

the data are from crs analysis of the 2016 survey of consumer finances ( scf ) .

the scf is a triennial survey conducted on behalf of the board of governors of the federal reserve and contains detailed information on u.s. household finances , such as the amount and types of assets owned , the amount and types of debt owed , and detailed demographic information on the head of the household and spouse .

the scf is designed to be nationally representative of the 126.0 million u.s. households in 2016 .

table 7 categorizes iras by the amount in the account .

among households that have iras , 61.1% have account balances of less than $100,000 and 4.4% have account balances of $1 million or more .

table 8 provides data on ira ownership and account balances among households that owned iras in 2016 .

the following are some key points from table 8 regarding ownership of iras: in 2016 , 29.8% of u.s. households had an ira .

among households that owned iras , the median account balance ( $52,000 ) was smaller than the average account balance ( $201,240 ) , which indicates that some households likely had very large ira account balances .

households were more likely to own iras as the age of head of household increased .

the median and average account balances also increased as the head of the household increased .

the percentage of households with an ira and the median and average account balances increased with the income of the household .

among the explanations for this finding are that ( 1 ) households with more income are better able to save for retirement and ( 2 ) households with higher income are more likely to participate in a defined contribution ( dc ) plan ( like a 401 ( k ) ) and therefore have an account to roll over .

married households were more likely to have an ira than single households and their median and average account balances were also larger .

the explanations could include the following: both spouses in a married household might have work histories , enabling both to save for retirement or married household might need larger retirement savings because two people would be using the retirement savings for living expenses in retirement .

as part of the response to the 2005 hurricanes that affected the communities on and near the gulf of mexico , congress approved provisions that exempted individuals affected by the storms from the 10% early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals from ira .

in 2008 , congress approved similar provisions in response to the storms and flooding in certain midwestern states .

following hurricane sandy in october 2012 , the california wildfires in 2017 , and the hurricanes in 2017 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) eased certain requirements for hardship distributions from defined contribution plans .

however , the irs was unable to exempt distributions from retirement plans from the 10% early withdrawal penalty because such an exemption requires congressional authorization .

qualified distributions related to hurricanes katrina , rita , and wilma in response to hurricanes katrina , rita , and wilma , congress approved the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 ( p.l .

109 - 135 ) .

the act amended the internal revenue code to allow residents in areas affected by these storms who suffered economic losses to take penalty - free distributions up to $100,000 from their retirement plans , including traditional and roth iras .

the distributions must have been received after august 24 , 2005 ( katrina ) , september 22 , 2005 ( rita ) , or october 22 , 2005 ( wilma ) , and before january 1 , 2007 .

the distributions were taxable income and could be reported as income either in the year received or over three years ( eg , a $30,000 distribution made in may 2006 , could have been reported as $10,000 of income in 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 ) .

alternatively , part or all of the distribution could have been repaid to the retirement plan within three years of receiving the distribution without being considered taxable income .

qualified distributions related to the midwestern disaster relief area in response to severe storms , tornados , and flooding that occurred in certain midwestern states , the heartland disaster tax relief act of 2008 allowed residents of specified midwest areas to take penalty - free distributions up to $100,000 from their retirement plans , including traditional and roth iras .

this act was passed as division c of p.l .

110 - 343 , the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 .

the bill amended 26 u.s.c .

1400q , which was enacted as part of the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 ( p.l .

109 - 135 ) .

the distributions must have been received after the date on which the president declared an area to be a major disaster area and before january 1 , 2010 .

apart from the dates and the areas affected , the provisions were identical to the provisions for individuals who were affected by hurricanes katrina , rita , and wilma .

qualified distributions related to hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria in response to hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , congress approved the disaster tax relief and airport and airway extension act of 2017 ( p.l .

115-63 ) .

the act amended the internal revenue code to allow residents in areas affected by these storms who suffered economic losses to take penalty - free distributions up to $100,000 from their retirement plans , including traditional and roth iras .

the distributions must have been made on or after august 23 , 2017 ( harvey ) , september 4 , 2017 ( irma ) , or september 16 , 2017 ( maria ) , and before january 1 , 2019 .

the distributions are taxable income and can be reported either in the year received or over three years .

alternatively , part or all of the distribution may be repaid to the retirement plan within three years of receiving the distribution without being considered taxable income .

hurricane sandy and california wildfire relief in the cases of hurricane sandy in 2012 and the california wildfires in 2017 no legislation was passed that would have ( 1 ) exempted individuals in areas affected by these natural disasters from the 10% penalty for early withdrawals from iras or defined contribution retirement plans or ( 2 ) eased requirements for loans from defined contribution pensions for individuals affected by them .

the irs eased requirements for hardship distributions in areas affected by hurricane sandy in 2012 and the california wildfires in 2017 .

among the relief offered by the irs in announcement 2012-44 and 2017-15 respectively , "plan administrators may rely upon representations from the employee or former employee as to the need for and amount of a hardship distribution" rather than require documentation from the employee of the need .

the relief offered by the irs did not include an exemption from the 10% penalty for distributions before the age of 59½ .

exemptions from the 10% penalty require congressional authorization .

in addition , in the announcement , the irs suspended the provision that requires an individual to suspend contributions to 401 ( k ) and 403 ( b ) plans for the six months following a hardship distribution .
