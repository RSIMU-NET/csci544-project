since the novel coronavirusâdesignated coronavirus disease 2019 , or covid - 19âfirst appeared in the united states in mid - january , it has contributed to substantial economic upheaval across the u.s. economy , including the agricultural sector .

in response to the covid - 19 pandemic , congress has passed and the president has signed four supplemental appropriations acts ( p.l .

116-123 , p.l .

116-127 , p.l .

116-136 , and p.l .

116-139 ) that have included both direct and indirect funding for the u.s. agricultural sector .

using funds from these acts and from other authorities , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) announced , on april 17 , 2020 , the coronavirus food assistance program ( cfap ) , valued at $19 billion , to provide immediate financial relief to farmers , ranchers , and consumers in response to the covid - 19 national emergency .

usda could provide additional financial assistance for the u.s. agricultural sector beyond cfap later in the summer when a replenishment payment of $14 billion for the commodity credit corporation becomes available .

congress is also considering providing additional support .

this report describes some of the actions that usda has taken in response to the covid - 19 emergency , including cfapâin particular , how cfap is funded and how usda intends to use the funds .

the description of usda covid - 19 response efforts is preceded by: first , a brief review of food supply chain issues where the u.s. agricultural sector has experienced economic harm or is potentially vulnerable to the effects of the covid - 19 pandemic ; and second , a review of current assessments of the economic harm to u.s. farm income , as well as to individual commodity sectors , resulting from covid - 19 .

the report then describes the emergency funds that have been allocated to address the u.s. agricultural sector , and how usda plans on using those funds , including a detailed description of cfap producer payments , and usda's food purchase and distribution efforts .

this is followed by a review of the announced positions for selected u.s. agricultural stakeholders in regard to how the covid - 19 pandemic has affected their industries , what their anticipated losses might be , and what their expectations are vis - ã  - vis congressional funding and usda's announced program response .

finally , several issues related to cfap and the u.s. agricultural sector in a post - covid economy that could be of potential interest to congress are presented at the end of this report .

an appendix at the end of the report includes a table ( table a - 1 ) that summarizes estimatesâfrom selected studiesâof the economic damage to several major agricultural sectors of the united states due to the covid - 19 emergency .

as covid - 19 has spread throughout the united states , it has reduced domestic economic activity and disrupted domestic and international supply chains for goods and services , including food and agricultural products .

these disruptions have produced an immediate and very strong demand shock on the u.s. food supply chain .

in particular , the abrupt shutdown of much food service and institutional buying has affected commodity prices throughout the food supply chain .

on the supply side , there is no food shortage in the united states .

supplies for most commodities remain relatively abundant ; however , inflexibilities in the food supply chain ( from food product specialization targeting food service and institutional markets that have closed , to pandemic outbreaks at processing plants ) have resulted in bottlenecks that have left many farmers with unmarketable surpluses , while some retail outlets have experienced temporary shortages of various food and agricultural products .

u.s. policymakers and business interests are concerned that the covid - 19 pandemic will inflict widespread economic harm on the u.s. and global economies .

it is still too early to make any definitive statements about what the eventualâ economic impacts will be on the u.s. economy or the agricultural sector , since it is unknown how long the disease will persist and what shape the economic recovery might take .

for example , will the overall impact be v - shaped with a quick outbreak followed by a quick recovery , or will it be l - shaped with an elongated tail representing a slow recovery and a gradual reopening of businesses and retail outlets ? .

or be w - shaped if the virus recycles and re - emerges later in the summer or fall in a more virulent formâas did the h1n1 pandemic in 2009 , or the 1918 flu pandemicâthus , causing a new round of shutdowns and economic closures ? .

this section reviews federal supplementary funding appropriated for assistance to the u.s. agricultural sector in response to the covid emergency , and the usda programs that were initiated with that supplementary funding .

in addition to the supplementary funding , usda announced that it was increasing certain flexibilities and extensions in several of usda's farm programsâmany authorized by the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) âas part of its effort to support the food supply chain .

also , usda has established a "coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) " web page that assembles information from a broad range of agriculture - related topics and issues , including the expanded program flexibilities .

the website includes "frequently asked questions ( faqs ) " for several prominent issues and agencies , links to additional resources , and a usda covid - 19 federal rural resource guide .

in march and early april , prior to usda's announcement of cfap , many industry groups from the u.s. agricultural sector had written public letters to secretary perdue and usda detailing their concerns and the need for federal assistance in response to the economic damage that has hit their different industries as a result of the covid - 19-related emergency .

many of these letters included industry estimates of their sectoral economic losses due to covid - 19 ( several of these estimates have been compiled by crs and are presented in table a - 1 ) .

following the announcement of cfap , most industry groups that are targeted for cfap assistance have expressed appreciation for the aid that usda has announced .

at the same time , several agriculture - related industries do not appear to be eligible for support under the cfapâincluding ethanol , poultry , sheep and lamb , specialty livestock such as mink , or horticultural products .

also , agriculture industry groups almost universally note that cfap can be only the first step in the federal response , as the amounts provided fall well short of industry loss estimates for most sectors .

another industry concern involves the announced payment limits associated with cfap direct payments .

industry groups have stated that a $125,000 payment limit would severely restrict needed aid to individual producers .

some senators and representatives have followed up on industry concerns about payment limits by sending a letter to the administration asking that the limits be removed for livestock , dairy , and specialty crop producers .

the issue of payment limits may be addressed in the next round of usda covid - 19 assistance or related bills ( eg , h.r .

6611 ) .

immediate congressional concerns involve how to channel assistance to those industries affected by covid - 19 .

this involves identifying affected industries , as well as measuring the extent of their losses , and providing some measure of compensation to help foster survival and recovery .

another immediate concern may be monitoring and oversight of the large sums of taxpayer money that will be flowing out through the ccc .

producer self - certification of losses may create a moral hazard and an incentive to over - report losses .

congress may consider using its investigative authority to better understand the nature and institutional rigidities inherent in the current food supply chain , and to ascertain whether there is a role for the federal government to help facilitate food supply chain management .

such considerations may include an evaluation of whether there is a need to facilitate less reliance by the private sector on low - cost , just - in - time supply chains .

this model has proven to be inflexible in responding to the covid - 19 emergency , which requires rapid product transition from bulk institutional buyers to consumer - ready retail outlets , and greater regional storage capacity to hold temporary surges in unsold product .

the potential costs to taxpayers of supporting a more flexible supply chain could include expanded regional warehousing , cold storage , food bank storage , etc .

expediting the food assistance supply chain is also being proposed through "farm - to - food bank" programs ( s. 3605 ) .

these actions could be coupled with new federal programs designed to increase demand by temporarily expanding snap benefits and / or federal food purchases when certain market or economic conditions are triggered .

congress may also want to consider whether the current farm safety net programs authorized by the farm bill's title iâtargeting of program cropsâare sufficiently flexible and responsive when confronted with sudden , widespread price declines and an abrupt cessation of institutional purchases .

for example , payments under the current arc and plc programs are delayed nearly 13 months after the program crop's harvest and reflect a 12-month average price that may not fully capture the potential short - term price drop related to the covid outbreak.â program modificationsâsuch as the inclusion of an early partial payment for arc and plcâcould offer greater flexibility in responding to short - term cash flow problems for farm households .

as one alternative , arc and plc could be supplemented or replaced by a new payment program that would be: short - term in nature ; would better reflect local market conditions to capture disparities in regional economic harm ; and would rely on market conditions both to trigger payments and to determine the size of those payments .

the payment triggers could be set at catastrophic levels such that they would only be triggered under unique circumstances such as a major price plunge sparked by an event of the magnitude of covid - 19 .

the payment formula could be designed such that usda could make payments under such a program before or shortly after harvest .

in addition , congress may also consider the long - term effects that might result from the covid - 19 emergency , particularly if the economic recovery is slow and lengthy .

such long - term effects may include heightened indebtedness and potential bankruptcies by farm households across the agricultural sector , as well as accelerated industry consolidation and altered consumption patterns .

without robust agricultural production to serve as the engine of growth , rural america might experience a slower recovery than the rest of the country .

prolonged depressed market conditions due to widespread layoffs , limited employment opportunities , and sustained reductions to rural wages and incomes would provide a weak background to foster agriculture's eventual recovery .

congress may also consider that rural banks tend to be smaller and less well - capitalized than banks catering to urban and suburban markets .

farm loan debt forgiveness ( eg , s. 3602 ) and loan repayment flexibilities are also in discussion .

a slow rural economic recovery might reduce business and consumer confidence , leading to a reduction in spending and investment , and a tightening of financial conditions that could further slow the return to economic normalcy in rural areas .

studies project deep losses across major commodity sectors several universities , think tanks , and commodity groups have released early assessments of covid - 19's potential impact on selected commodity sectors ( table a - 1 ) .

most of these early assessments are limited to evaluating the effect of the price decline on any unsold production remaining under farmers' control , and the unexpected surplus of unsold products due to the shutdown of most institutional buying of agricultural products .
