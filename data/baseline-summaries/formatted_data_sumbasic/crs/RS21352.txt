qualifications for , and the amount of , the earned income tax credit ( eitc ) depend on the amount of earned income , adjusted gross income ( agi ) , and whether the tax filer has a qualified child .

for the eitc , a qualified child is determined by the definition of a qualified child for the personal exemption .

in general , for the personal exemption for a dependent , an individual is either a qualifying relative or a qualifying child .

a qualified child for the eitc must meet the following three criteria for the personal exemption: relationship — the child must be a son , daughter , stepson , stepdaughter , or descendent of such a relative ; a brother , sister , stepbrother , stepsister , or descendent of such a relative ; an adopted child ; or a foster child placed with the taxpayer ; residence — the child must live with the tax filer for more than half the year ; and age — the child must be under the age of 19 ( or age 24 , if a full - time student ) or be permanently and totally disabled .

for the eitc , a qualified child cannot be married and must have a principal place of abode ( where the child lives with the tax filer ) within the united states ( an exception exists for military personnel stationed overseas ) .

a custodial parent may have a qualified child for the eitc without using other tax benefits associated with the child ( such as the personal exemption ) because the eitc disregards a waiver of the personal exemption and the child tax credit to a noncustodial parent .

in general , the eitc amount increases with earnings up to a point ( the maximum earned income amount ) , then remains unchanged ( at the maximum credit ) for a certain bracket of income , and then , beginning at the phase - out income level , gradually decreases to zero as earnings continue to increase .

a family will be disqualified from receiving the earned income credit if investment income exceeds a specified level .

the maximum earned income amount , the phase - out income level , and the disqualifying investment income amount are indexed for inflation .

for married couples filing a joint tax return , in tax years 2002 through 2004 , the phase - out level was $1,000 higher than for other filers .

in tax years 2005 through 2007 , the phase - out level was $2,000 higher , and beginning in tax year 2008 , the phase - out level was $3,000 higher .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) increased this differential to $5,000 for tax year 2009 , and adjusted for inflation in 2010 .

the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) extended the arra provisions for marriage penalty relief through tax year 2012 .

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) extends the arra provisions for five years ( through tax year 2017 ) .

the phase - out level for married couples filing a joint tax return was $5,210 higher than for other tax filers in tax year 2012 , and will be $5,340 higher than for other tax filers in tax year 2013 .

to make it easier for tax filers to determine the correct amount of the credit , a table for the earned income credit is included in the income tax booklet based on $50 increments of income .

table 1 shows the parameters for the eitc ( credit rates , phase - out rates , maximum earned income amount , maximum credit , phase - out income level , and disqualifying investment income level ) for tax years 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 .

as shown in table 1 , between tax years 2011 and 2013 , there are increases in the maximum earned income , maximum credit , and phase - out income levels associated with indexing for inflation .

the effect of the indexing is that the largest percentage increases in eitc between 2011 and 2013 will be for higher - income eitc - eligible tax filers .

a limited number of taxpayers not eligible for the eitc in tax year 2011 will , because of indexing , be eligible for a small eitc in tax years 2012 and 2013 .

p.l .

111-5 ( arra ) created a new credit category , for families with three or more children , for tax years 2009 and 2010 only .

for families with three or more children , the credit rate in tax years 2009 and 2010 was 45% .

the arra also increased the phase - in amount for married couples filing joint tax returns so that it was $5,000 higher than for unmarried taxpayers in tax year 2009 .

in tax year 2010 , the differential was adjusted for inflation .

p.l .

111-226 , the faa air transportation modernization and safety improvement act , eliminated the option to receive the credit during the tax year ( the advance earned income credit ) , for tax years beginning after december 31 , 2010 .

p.l .

111-312 extended the arra provisions for marriage penalty relief and the category for three or more children through tax year 2012 .

p.l .

111-312 also extended through tax year 2012 , the changes to the credit made by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 ( egtrra ; p.l .

107-16 ) that were scheduled to expire after december 31 , 2010 .

the egtrra changes that were extended through tax year 2012 include ( 1 ) changing the definition of earned income for the eitc so that it does not include nontaxable employee compensation ; ( 2 ) eliminating the reduction in the eitc for the alternative minimum tax ; ( 3 ) simplifying the calculation of the credit through use of agi rather than modified adjusted gross income ; and ( 4 ) providing marriage penalty relief through a higher phase - out income level for taxpayers filing married joint tax returns .

p.l .

112-240 ( atra ) made the egtrra changes permanent and extended the arra provisions for families with three or more children and marriage penalty relief for five years ( through tax year 2017 ) .
