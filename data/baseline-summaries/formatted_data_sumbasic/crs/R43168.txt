beginning the summer 2013 through 2016 , there were numerous reports in the media on sexual assault incidents in the u.s. armed services .

in many cases , such reports were followed by questions on what actions were taken by the department of defense ( dod ) , the obama administration , and congress to address the issue .

this report lists a comprehensive chronology of official activities in response to incidents of military sexual assault , as well as legislative action on the issue .

the report is divided into three sections: the dod and the obama administration's actions , congressional action , and legislation in the 113 th ( 2013-2014 ) and 114 th ( 2015-2016 ) congresses .

also included is a resources section with related articles , hearings , and reports .

information in this report was compiled from the official government websites of dod , the obama white house and congress.gov for historical background and will not be updated .

june 13 , 2012 – dod announced army major general gary s. patton as the new director of the sexual assault prevention and response office ( sapro ) .

september 25 , 2012 – as part of the dod's efforts to confront the crime of sexual assault in the military , then secretary of defense leon panetta announced improvements to prospective commander and senior enlisted training and a review of the initial military training environment in every service .

december 21 , 2012 – dod released key findings from the academic program year ( apy ) 2011-2012 report on sexual harassment and violence at the united states military service academies .

according to this report , the overall prevalence rate of unwanted sexual contact increased in all three military academies .

from 2011 to 2012 , the air force academy in colorado showed the largest increase in reported sexual assaults from 33 to 52 incidents .

sexual assaults at the naval academy in annapolis , md , increased from 11 to 15 , and were up at the u.s. military academy in west point , ny , from 10 to 13 .

the following information was compiled using congress.gov , congressional quarterly ( cq.com ) , house.gov , senate.gov , and roll call .
