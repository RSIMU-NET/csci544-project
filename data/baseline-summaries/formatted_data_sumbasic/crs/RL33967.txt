the president signed the adam walsh child protection and safety act on july 27 , 2006 .

the act serves four basic purposes .

first , it reformulates the federal standards for sex offender registration in state , territorial and tribal sexual offender registries , and does so in a manner designed to make the system more uniform , more inclusive , more informative , and more readily available to the public online .

second , it introduces a fairly extensive and diverse set of amendments to federal criminal law and procedure , featuring , among other things , a federal procedure for the civil commitment of convicted sex offenders upon their release from prison , a random search authority over sex offenders on probation or supervised release , and a number of new mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for various new and existing federal sex offenses .

third , it creates , amends , or revives several grant programs designed to reinforce private , state , local , tribal and territorial prevention ; law enforcement ; and treatment efforts in the case of crimes committed against children .

finally , it calls for a variety of administrative or regulatory initiatives in the interest of child safety , such as the creation of the national child abuse registry .

the act arrived on the president's desk as h.r .

4472 having been approved by the house on march 8 , 2006 and by the senate on july 20 , 2006 .

each chamber had previously passed many of the same provisions in separate bills of their own .

in the case of the house , the predecessor was h.r .

3132 which the house endorsed on september 15 , 2005 ; in the case of the senate , it was s. 1086 , which the senate approved on may 4 , 2006 .

one of the center pieces of the adam walsh child protection and safety act is the revision of the nation - wide sex offender registration system .

the earlier statute , the jacob wetterling act , encouraged states to establish and maintain a registration system .

each of them has done so .

the state systems had many common features , but were hardly uniform .

the walsh act preserves the basis structure of the earlier law , expands upon it , and makes more specific matters that were previously left to individual state choice .

it contemplates a publicly available , contemporaneously accurate , online system .

conscious of the legal and technical adjustments required , the walsh act anticipates that states and other jurisdictions may require three years or more to fully implement its modifications .

as a consequence , for purposes of compliance by the states and other jurisdictions , the prior law remains in effect until the later of three years after enactment or one year after the necessary software for the new uniform , online system has become available .

for registrants , however , the new requirements became effective upon enactment .

the adam walsh child protection and safety act is focused , as its name implies , upon child protection and safety .

its efforts involve the creation of new federal crimes , the enhancement of the penalties for preexisting federal crimes , and the amendment of federal criminal procedure .

many of these efforts are child - specific ; some are more general .

the new federal crimes include the following .

murder in the course of a wider range of federal sex offenses , 18 u.s.c .

2245 internet date rape drug trafficking , 21 u.s.c .

841 ( b ) ( 7 ) kidnaping that involves the use of interstate facilities , 18 u.s.c .

1201 child abuse in indian country , 18 u.s.c .

1153 production of obscene material , 18 u.s.c .

1465 , 1466 obscenity or pornography in internet source codes , 18 u.s.c .

2252c child exploitation enterprises , 18 u.s.c .

2252a ( g ) .

the list of penalty increases is comparable , if somewhat more extensive .

serious violent crimes against children , 18 u.s.c .

3559 ( f ) coercion or enticement of a child for illicit sexual purposes , 18 u.s.c .

2422 interstate transportation of a child for illicit sexual purposes , 18 u.s.c .

2423 sexual abuse in a federal prison or enclave , 18 u.s.c .

2242 aggravated sexual abuse of a child , 18 u.s.c .

2241 abusive sexual contact with a child , 18 u.s.c .

2244 sexual exploitation of a child , 18 u.s.c .

2251 traffic in child exploitive material , 18 u.s.c .

1591 failure to report child abuse , 18 u.s.c .

2258 false statements relating child or sexual offenses , 18 u.s.c .

the amendments to federal criminal procedure are a bit less numerous and somewhat more likely to implicate crimes in addition to those committed against children .

among their number are: random searches of sex offender registrants as a condition of probation or supervised release , 18 u.s.c .

3563 , 3583 expanded dna collection from those facing federal charges or convicted of any federal offense , 42 u.s.c .

the act establishes , reinforces , and revives several grant programs devoted to child and community safety .

section 603 authorizes mentoring grants for the big brothers big sisters of america .

section 604 requires the organization to provide the administrator of the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevent with progress reports twice a year .

section 605 authorizes appropriations for these purposes of $9 million ( for fy2007 ) , $10 million ( for fy2008 ) ) , $11.5 million ( for fy2009 ) , $13 million ( for fy2010 ) , and $15 million ( for fy2011 ) .

the national police athletic league youth enrichment act established a grant program for the police athletic league , with an authorization of appropriations in the amount of $16 million a year through fy2005 .

subtitle vi - b , â§â§611-617 , reauthorizes appropriations at the same levels for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 and revises the factual information found in the organic legislation relating to the league .

section 621 empowers the attorney general to make grants to state , local and tribal governments in order to outfit sex offenders with electronic monitoring devices .

it authorizes appropriations of $5 million for each of fiscal years 2007 , 2008 and 2009 and thereafter requests the attorney general to report on the effectiveness of the program .

section 623 creates a grant program available to both public and private entities that assist in treatment of juvenile sex offenders or that assist the states in their enforcement of sex offender registration requirements .

appropriations are authorized for fy2007 through fy2009 in such amounts as are necessary in the case of the enforcement grants and in the amount $10 million per year in the case of the juvenile sex offender grants .

section 624 permits the attorney general to award grants to facilitate the prosecution of cases cleared as a consequence of the dna backlog elimination .

it authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary for that purpose for fy2007 through fy2011 .

section 625 establishes a grant program for law enforcement agencies to combat sexual abuse of children with authorized appropriations of the necessary sums for fy2007 through fy2009 .

section 626 calls for grants to a national private , nonprofit organization for a program of crime prevention media campaign .

for such purposes , it authorizes appropriations of $7 million ( for fy2007 ) , $8 million ( for fy2008 ) ) , $9 million ( for fy2009 ) , and $10 million ( for fy2010 ) .

section 627 permits the attorney general to awards grants to state , local and tribal government programs for the voluntary fingerprinting of children .

it authorizes the appropriations totaling $20 million for use through fy2011 for the task .

section 628 authorizes grants to enable a private , nonprofit organization â the rape , abuse & incest national network ( rainn ) â to operate a sexual assault hotline , conduct media campaigns , and provide technical assistance for law enforcement .

it authorizes appropriations of $3 million per year for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 .

section 630 permits the attorney general to establish an online child safety grant program for the benefit of state , territorial and nonprofit grantees , subject to the availability of appropriations .

section 631 creates the jessica lunsford address verification grant program to enable state , local and tribal grantees to verify the addresses of registered sex offenders with authorization of the necessary appropriations for fy2007 through fy2009 and the requirement of an attorney general's report on the effectiveness of the program .

the act sets forth a wide assortment of other provisions designed to prevent , prosecute or punish the victimization of children .

among them are sections that broaden access to federal criminal records information systems , create a national child abuse registry , expand recordkeeping requirements for those in the business of producing sexually explicit material , immunize officials from civil liability for activities involving sexual offender registration , and authorize and direct the department of justice to establish and maintain a number of child protective activities .

section 633 directs the secretary of health and human services to establish a registry of substantiated instances of child abuse or neglect collected from state and tribal sources .

the registry is only to be made available to federal , state , local and tribal entities obligated to protect children against abuse and neglect .

the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) maintains a number of criminal information databases , consisting of information supplied by state and federal law enforcement officials , that can be used to determine the existence and extent if any of a particular individual's criminal record .

the system is used primarily for law enforcement purposes , but is also available for such purposes as background checks of employees or prospective employees for certain occupations .

section 151 directs the attorney general to make the fbi's national criminal information databases available to governmental child protective service agencies and , when related to responsibilities under federal law , to the national center for missing and exploited children .

section 152 expands the obligation of states , territories and tribes that receive payments under title iv - e of the social security act for foster care and adoption assistance to expand the background checks conducted on prospective foster and adoptive parents .

under prior law , unless a state had "opted out," it was required to conduct a criminal records check of prospective foster and adoptive parents of a child for whose benefit assistance payments were to be made and to withhold payments from those convicted of various child abuse or neglect offenses , crimes of violence , or sex offenses .

section 152 makes the obligation more specific and expansive by insisting that the states do a fingerprint criminal record check using the fbi's national crime information databases of all prospective foster and adoptive parents regardless of the prospect of receiving assistance .

they are obligated to check the child abuse and neglect registry in any state in which a prospective parent or an adult member of their household has lived in the previous five years as well .

and they must honor reciprocal registry requests from other states and take steps to prevent unauthorized dissemination of the information .

moreover , section 152 ( b ) phases out ( by october 1 , 2008 ) the ability to opt out of the criminal records check responsibility for the states that had previously elected to do so .

section 153 makes the fbi's national criminal information databases available for fingerprint - based background checks not only of prospective foster and adoptive parents , but also for employees or prospective employees of public and private schools or when sought in child abuse or child neglect investigation by state welfare officials .

law enforcement agencies that report missing children to the fbi's national criminal information databases have long been precluded from imposing a waiting period before they would accept a missing person report .

section 154 precludes them from imposing a policy dictating removal from the system based solely on the age of the missing person .

the producers of sexually explicit material must maintain records designed to ensure that they are not using children as subjects .

they must keep detailed records , available for inspection , on the name , age , and means of verification of those whose performances are depicted in their material .

the attorney general has authority to issue implementing regulations and has done so .

enforcement of the regulations was preliminarily enjoined initially , however , on the grounds that while the statute covered only primary producers , the regulations purported to reach as well secondary producers who did not arrange for the appearance of the performers .

moreover , the prospects of enforcement were clouded by uncertainty over the implications of ashcroft v. free speech coalition , in which the supreme court held that inclusion of "virtual child pornography" within class of proscribed child pornography offended first amendment principles .

section 502 addresses those concerns by amending 18 u.s.c .

2257 to make it clear that it applies to secondary producers , and that it applies to the producers of digitally created or computer manipulated explicit sexual activities but only where those depicted are actually human beings .

the definitions of pornography regularly refer to "actual or simulated sexual" activity .

in order distance itself from the difficulties the court found in "virtual" sexual activity , section 2257 refers only to "actual" activity .

in order to deal with simulated sexual activity by human beings , section 503 creates a companion recording keeping mandate for the producers of "simulated sexually explicit conduct. .

the new section likewise applies only where there are human performers ; and reaches the same kinds of producers that section 2257 touches .

at one time , child victims injured as a result of various federal sexual offenses had a cause of action against the offender for attorneys fees and the greater of actual damages or $50,000 .

section 707 increased the minimum to $150,000 .

the underlying sex offenses are violations of 18 u.s.c .

2241 ( c ) ( aggravated sexual abuse ) , 2242 ( sexual abuse ) , 2243 ( sexual abuse of a minor or ward ) , 2251 ( sexual exploitation of a child ) , 2251a ( selling or buying a child for sexual purposes ) , 2252 ( transporting , distributing or selling child sexually exploitive material ) , 2252a ( transporting or distributing child pornography ) , 2260 ( overseas production of child pornography ) , 2421 ( interstate travel of illicit sexual purposes ) , 2422 ( coercion or enticement for illicit sexual purposes ) , and 2423 ( transportation of a minor of illicit sexual purposes ) .

section 707 also amends section 2255 to permit recovery even if the injury caused by the offense only occurs after the child is an adult .

federal law requires electronic service providers who discover evidence of child pornography to report the matter to law enforcement authorities by way of the cyber tip line of the national center for missing and exploited children , a private nonprofit organization .

the provision affords service providers immunity from civil liability for good faith compliance .

with an exception of intentional , malicious , or reckless misconduct , section 130 of the act affords the center , its officers , employees and agents civil and criminal immunity for performance related to the provision .

the new immunity is similar to that found in the protect act which , although it does not provide immunity from criminal liability , seems to grant more all encompassing civil immunity .

civil immunity for government officers , employees and their agents for conduct involving the sexual offender registration system established in title i of the act is found in section 131 .

whether the safe harbor shields the center and those associated with it from both federal and state liability under either provision remains to be seen .

the same question may be asked of the immunity bath afforded government officers , employees and agents .

the act includes several sections in which the department of justice is authorized , directed or encouraged to take action in the greater interest of child protection and safety .

section 142 provides the legal foundation for justice department's project safe childhood , established shortly before passage of the act .

the project directs the various united states attorneys to coordinate federal , state , local and tribal efforts to investigate and prosecute internet crimes against children .

it features strategic planning , training , and information sharing at the judicial district level .

participants include the fbi ( innocent images unit ) ; the secret service ; the postal service ( child exploitation task forces ) ; immigration and customs enforcement ( cyber crime center ) ; the justice department's criminal division and internet crimes against children ( icac ) task forces ; state , local and tribal law enforcement officials , and the national center for missing and exploited children .

section 145 instructs the attorney general to expand his efforts to prevent misuse of the internet by sex offenders .

it ask that he expand training opportunities for federal , state and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors and that he involve members of the computer industry and other agencies in efforts to combat the sexual victimization of children through the internet .

section 622 authorizes the bureau of prisons to establish residential and nonresidential sex offender monitoring programs to treat and supervise sex offenders .

section 629 authorizes the attorney general , in consultation with the national center for missing and exploited children , to develop and execute public awareness programs relating to child - safe use of the internet and to access to federal and state sexual offender registries .

section 632 instructs the marshals service to establish and coordinate a fugitive safe surrender program in designated cities for the capture of fugitives from federal , state and local justice .

it authorizes appropriations for that purpose in the amounts of $3 million ( for fy2007 ) , $5 million ( for fy2008 ) , and $8 million ( for fy2009 ) .

section 704 directs the attorney general to increase by not less than 200 attorneys the number of prosecutors dedicated to child sexual exploitation cases and assigned to the various united states attorneys offices â subject to the availability of appropriations .

section 705 asks the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to increase the number of computer forensic examiners devoted to the investigation of sexual exploitation of children and related offenses â by not fewer than 30 examiners in the case of the department of justice and not fewer than 15 in the department of homeland security .
