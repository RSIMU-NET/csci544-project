the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant was created by the 1996 welfare reform law , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-193 ) .

it replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the new deal , aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) , and some of its related programs .

the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children — specifically , those headed by single mothers — that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s .

the 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding ( appropriations ) for tanf through the end of fy2002 .

most of the legislative activity on tanf since 2002 has been to extend the program funding and financing authority for tanf .

most of these extensions did not change tanf policy , though policy changes were included in extensions enacted in 2006 , 2010 , and 2012 .

the tanf extension act of 2019 ( p.l .

116-4 ) extended tanf funding through june 30 , 2019 .

this report will begin with a brief overview of the history of the afdc program and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s .

that overview will be followed by a summary of the 1996 welfare reform law and the changes made since 1996 .

the report concludes with a detailed chronology of tanf legislation .

the modern form of cash assistance for needy families with children dates back to the progressive era of the early 1900s , and state - or locally funded mothers' pensions for "fatherless" families .

the purpose of these programs was to permit these mothers to stay at home and care for their children .

federal funding for these programs was first provided in the social security act of 1935 ( p.l .

74-271 ) through the aid to dependent children ( adc ) program , later renamed the aid to families with dependent children program ( afdc ) .

many of the later changes , and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s , focused on issues of work and whether providing cash to nonworking single mothers served as disincentives for both work and marriage .

however , the history of the adc / afdc program touched many other facets of the well - being of children and their families .

adc / afdc provided federal funding for social services , medical assistance , child care , and foster care .

these were later spun off into separate programs , with dedicated federal funding .

while much of the focus of the welfare reform debates was on the single mother ( custodial parent ) , adc / afdc policy also touched on noncustodial parents .

the child support enforcement ( cse ) program was created , in great part , to reimburse states and the federal government for the costs of providing assistance to single mothers , and making noncustodial fathers responsible for these costs .

cse has evolved into a program that distributes child support payments collected from noncustodial parents to custodial parents , mostly to families that have never received or are no longer receiving cash assistance .

the 1996 welfare reform law repealed afdc and some of its related programs and replaced it with the tanf block grant .

funding for the afdc - related child care programs was consolidated into a separate funding stream dedicated to child care .

some things did not change with the 1996 law .

as was the case with afdc , tanf programs are run by states ( and sometimes localities ) , and they determine the maximum benefits under the programs and set the income eligibility thresholds .

table 1 summarizes some of the major differences between afdc and tanf .

it should be noted that at the time of enactment of the 1996 law many states were operating under waivers of the afdc rules that related to cash assistance .

these waivers imposed time limits , set different rules for counting earnings than did the afdc federal rules , and set different rules for work or participation in job activities .

tanf permitted states to continue programs operated under waivers , even if the provisions of the waiver were inconsistent with tanf rules .

the last of these waivers expired in 2007 .
