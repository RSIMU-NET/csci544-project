early in the 110 th congress , the chairmen of the house and senate judiciary committees introduced essentially identical versions of the court security improvement act of 2007 , as h.r .

660 and s. 378 , that mirrored legislation that passed the senate at the close of the 109 th congress .

each house reported and passed somewhat different variations , although the basic structure of the legislation remained unchanged in both instances .

the senate subsequently accepted and passed h.r .

660 with slight amendments , which the house in turn accepted under suspension of the rules .

the president the bill on january 7 , 2008 .

the bill as passed , public law 110-177 ( p.l .

110-177 ) , consists of four components: adjustments to applicable provisions of criminal law , reenforcement of the authority and oversight features of the law that governs federal judicial security , grant programs to facilitate increased security for the judiciary of the states , and miscellaneous provisions whose relation to judicial security might initially appear remote .

existing federal criminal law seeks to ensure the safety and integrity of federal judicial and other official proceedings by proscribing threats and violence ( 1 ) against federal personnel , ( 2 ) against witnesses in official proceedings , and ( 3 ) against federal proceedings and facilities .

the united states sentencing commission was established in 1984 as an independent entity located within the judicial branch .

its purpose is to promulgate sentencing guidelines for use by federal courts in criminal cases .

those guidelines , once binding upon the courts , are now simply advisory , although the courts must continue to consider them and the guidelines continue to carry considerable persuasive force .

the commission may enter into contracts in fulfillment of its responsibilities .

as a general rule , appropriated funds are available for obligation under contract or otherwise only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated .

there are several exceptions to the general rule .

for example , the heads of executive agencies may contract for services that begin in one fiscal year and end in the next .

they may also enter into multi - year contracts .

and with sufficient security , they may make advance payments on contract obligations to be fulfilled at a later date .

in the judicial branch , the administrative office of the united states courts enjoys similar authority .

section 501 temporarily grants the sentencing commission comparable authority , 28 u.s.c .

995 ( f ) ( expiring on september , 30 , 2010 ) .

judges of the united states courts of appeal and united states district courts serve during good behavior , which ordinarily means for life .

when they reach 65 years of age with at least 15 years of service or at such later date as their age and years of service equal 80 years , they may remain in active service , they may retire at an annuity equal to their salary on the date of retirement , or they may retire to senior status .

judges in senior status continue to serve but are considered to have left office for vacancy purposes so that replacements may be appointed .

senior judges receive full salary , including any pay increases or adjustments given judges on active service , as long as they essentially carry at least the equivalent of 25% of the workload of a full time member of the court .

when the office of personnel management announced life insurance premium increases for district and appeals court judges in 1999 , the judges and the administrative office objected that the increase would operate as a disincentive to serve on senior status .

the appropriations legislation for that year included a provision now found in 28 u.s.c .

604 ( a ) ( 5 ) : the director ... shall ... pay on behalf of justices and judges of the united states appointed to hold office during good behavior , aged 65 or over , any increases in the cost of federal employees' group life insurance imposed after april 24 , 1999 , including any expenses generated by such payments , as authorized by the judicial conference of the united states .

similar provisions have been made for judges of the tax court and the court of federal claims , judges who serve 15 year terms .

they may be recalled to perform judicial duties for periods up to 90 days a year .

section 502 makes this provision applicable to magistrate judges .

the chief judges of the various united states courts of appeal or the various circuit judicial councils may designate and assign senior judges to perform judicial duties within the circuit .

as a general matter , senior judges who are designated and assigned enjoy all of the powers of the court , circuit or district to which they are assigned , except for the power to permanently designate a publisher for legal notices or depository of funds or "to appoint any person to a statutory position. .

federal statutes describe the appointment authority for several positions in the judicial branch .

bankruptcy judges are appointed by the circuit court of appeals , who also appoint their clerks and librarians ; circuit judges appoint their own law clerks and secretaries ; and circuit chief justices appoint senior staff attorneys .

magistrate judges are appointed by the district court judges , who also appoint their clerks and court reporters ; individual judges appoint their own bailiffs , law clerks and secretaries .

beyond the explicit exceptions and the general rule notwithstanding , there are several powers that only a judge in "regular active service" and no senior judge may exercise .

thus , only a judge in regular active service may serve as a chief judge of a federal district or circuit .

the decision to present an appeal to all of the judges of a particular circuit ( to grant a hearing or rehearing en banc ) is made by a majority vote of the judges of that circuit who are in regular active service .

a senior judge may participate in an en banc appeal only if he or she was a member of the panel that initially decided the case being heard en banc .

senior judges may serve on the united states sentencing commission and on the board of the federal judicial center .

they may serve as well as members of the judicial conference of the united states , the rule propounding body for the federal courts .

they may also sit on the judicial councils for their circuits , the local rule making authority for the circuit , but the number of members of such councils and their terms of service are determined by a majority vote of the judges in regular active service in the circuit .

section 503 amends 28 u.s.c .

296 to declare that senior judges "when designated and assigned to the court to which such judge was appointed , having performed in the preceding calendar year an amount of work equal to or greater than the amount of work an average judge in active service on that court would perform in 6 months , and having elected to exercise such powers , shall have all the powers of a judge of that court , including participation in appointment of court officers and magistrates , rulemaking , governance , and administrative matters," 28 u.s.c .

296 .

although the amendment might under other circumstances be thought to extend merely to those judicial powers and tasks for which there is no contrary instruction by statute or rule , the specific mention of the appointment of magistrate seems to preclude such a construction .

it would presumably override the circuit court en banc limitations as well .

magistrate judges are appointed pursuant to a statute that declares that , "the judges of each united states district court and the district courts of the virgin islands , guam , and the northern mariana islands shall appoint united states magistrate judges..." 28 u.s.c .

631 ( a ) .

section 504 amends this language to add , after "the northern mariana islands" , the parenthetical " ( including any judge in regular active service and any judge who has retired from regular active service under section 371 ( b ) of this title , when designed and assigned to the court to which such judge was appointed ) " .

the amendment may present an interpretative challenge .

the problem is that only united states district court judges retire under section 371 ( b ) ; the judges in the virgin islands , guam and the northern mariana islands retire under section 373 .

so does the amendment intend to add only senior united states district court judges to the core of judges who may participate in the decision to appoint magistrate judges for their districts ? .

probably , but that intent would have been more clearly demonstrated if the parenthetical had been added immediately after the phrase "united states district court. .

such a reading might be thought to render the amendment redundant since the prior section vests senior judges with share in the appointment of magistrate judges for their districts , but it can also be read as simply confirming the operation of the previous section .

or does the amendment intend to permit both united states district court senior judges who retired under section 371 ( b ) and territorial judges who retired under section 373 to participate in the appointment magistrate judges of their courts ? .

possibly , but read literally it would mean that territorial judges could participate as long as they had elected eligibility for senior status upon retirement regardless of whether they had been actually recalled .

or does the amendment intend only to permit appointment by a senior judge in the district court of the northern mariana islands who retired under section 373 ? .

very unlikely , for while it is perhaps the most grammatically faithful reading , it would mean affording a senior judge of the northern mariana islands authority that is denied the other territorial district courts .

moreover , senior judges of the northern mariana islands retire under section 373 rather than 371 as stated in the amendment .

federal courts that sentence an offender to prison may also include a term of supervised release to be served upon completion of the defendant's term of imprisonment , 18 u.s.c .

3583 .

they may at the same time impose a fine upon the defendant of up to $250,000 for most felonies and lesser amounts for misdemeanors , 18 u.s.c .

3571 .

prior law stated that a defendant was not to be released on supervised release unless he agreed to follow an installment schedule for any remaining fine obligations , 18 u.s.c .

3624 ( e ) ( 2000 ed. ) .

since the defendant must be released upon service of his sentence , the language suggested he might avoid supervised release simply by refusing to accept an installment schedule .

section 505 amends the prior language to compel the bureau of prisons to notify prisoners upon their release of their obligation to follow an installment payment schedule in order to satisfy any outstanding fine obligations , 18 u.s.c .

3624 ( e ) .

section 506 instructs the attorney general to study whether public access to state and local public records imperils the safety of federal judges .

the presidential threat protection act authorized the marshals service to direct and coordinate permanent fugitive apprehension task forces composed of federal , state and local law enforcement officers in order to capture fugitives from justice .

the act authorized appropriations of $30 million for the purpose for fy2001 and $5 million per year for each of the two fiscal years thereafter .

section 507 authorizes appropriations of $10 million for each of the fiscal years from 2008 through 2012 for the fugitive apprehension task forces .

the real id act establishes certain minimum requirements for state drivers' licenses and other state identification documents if they are to be received for federal identification purposes â including the individual's home address .

in the case of federal judges , section 508 allows the states to substitute the address of the court where the federal judge has his or her chambers .

section 509 increases the number of judgeships on the ninth circuit court of appeals from 28 to 29 and reduces the number on the district of columbia circuit court of appeals from 12 to 11 .

the statement in the report of the section's sponsor , senator feinstein , indicates the amendment is intended to reflect the relative workloads of the two circuits and the need to address the growing backlog of cases in the ninth circuit , id .

at 10 ( additional views of senator feinstein ) .

offenders of federal and state criminal law face the prospect of probation , imprisonment , parole , supervised release , assessments , fines , forfeiture , and / or restitution orders .

they may also suffer obligations , disabilities , disqualifications , and ineligibility as a consequence of their convictions , quite apart from the sanctions imposed at the time of sentencing .

the law of a particular jurisdiction may authorize authorities to lift the burden of some of these under some circumstances .

section 510 directs the national institute of justice to study and report on the collateral consequences of conviction under federal law and the laws of the various states .

although the section provides explicit descriptions of the "collateral sanctions" and "disqualifications" it anticipates the report will describe , the diversity of p.l .

110-177 in the area may make the task challenging .

18 u.s.c .
