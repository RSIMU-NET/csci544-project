the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2002 to fy2009 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the bill's four titles .

it also lists the total of several scorekeeping adjustments .

these figures were not available for the house bill or for s. 3258 .

tables 4 through 15 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2008-fy2009 .

accompanying these tables is a discussion of the key issues involved in the major programs in the four titles .

regular annual appropriations for the corps' civil works activities have been augmented since hurricane katrina through supplemental appropriations and through the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 .

in 2008 , the agency received more than $9 billion in supplemental funds ; these funds are for work related to post - katrina repair and improvements in coastal louisiana and for emergency flood response , including the 2008 midwest flood and hurricane ike response .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 provided an additional $4.6 billion to the agency for fy2009 .

for the agency's regular annual appropriations , p.l .

111-8 provides $5.402 billion for fy2009 , which is above the bush administration's request of $4.741 billion but below the fy2008 enacted amount of $5.587 .

the preliminary budget request for fy2010 is at $5.1 billion .

unlike highways and municipal water infrastructure programs , federal funds for the corps are not distributed to states or projects based on a formula or delivered via a competitive program .

generally around 85% of the appropriations for the corps' civil works activities is directed to specific projects .

many of these projects are identified in the budget request and others are added during congressional deliberations of the agency's appropriations .

as a result , the agency's funding is often part of the debate over earmarks .

generally , appropriations are not provided to studies , projects , or activities that have not been previously authorized , typically in a water resources development act ( wrda ) .

estimates of the backlog of authorized projects vary from $11 billion to more than $80 billion , depending on which projects are included ( eg , those that meet administration budget criteria , those that have received funding in recent appropriations , those that have never received appropriations ) .

the backlog raises policy questions , such as whether there is a disconnect between the authorization and appropriations process and how to prioritize among authorized activities .

the bush administration's approach to the backlog was to limit the number of new starts , i.e. , activities not previously funded , and to focus funds on completing a limited number of activities .

congress has generally chosen to distribute the corps appropriations across a larger set of projects and to initiate a limited number of new starts .

p.l .

111-8 continues the use of restrictions and congressional oversight on the corps' initiation of new starts via reprogramming funds during the fiscal year .

the department of the interior requested that congress reduce funding for the central utah project ( cup ) completion account and also for the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) for fy2009 .

the total request for title ii funding was originally $961.3 million â€” $189.6 million ( 16% ) below fy2008 funding levels .

however , president bush submitted a budget amendment in june 2008 rescinding another $175 million from reclamation's budget .

the revised total request for title ii is $786.3 million , 32% below fy2008 appropriations .

p.l .

111-8 provides $1.1 billion for title ii ; $33.1 million less than enacted for fy2008 , but $331.5 million more than requested for fy2009 .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities historically funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs , and the bill now includes programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics , which formerly had been included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

the bush administration's fy2009 request for doe programs was $25.9179 billion , compared with $24.3780 billion appropriated for fy2008 .

the house appropriations committee recommended $27.2174 billion , and the senate appropriations committee recommended $27.0417 billion .

p.l .

111-8 funds these programs at $26.9670 billion .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .
