on february 24 , 2011 , the department of defense ( dod ) announced the boeing company as the winner of a competition to build 179 new kc - 46a aerial refueling tankers for the air force , a contract valued at roughly $35 billion .

the kc - xs , to be procured at a maximum rate of 15 aircraft per year , are to replace roughly one - third of the air force's aging fleet of kc - 135 aerial refueling tankers .

the air force and the u.s. transportation command state that replacing the kc - 135s is their highest recapitalization priority .

the administration's proposed fy2014 defense budget requested $1,558.6 million in air force research and development funding to continue kc - 46a development and acquisition .

the kc - 46a acquisition program is a subject of intense interest because of the dollar value of the contract , the number of jobs it may create , the importance of tanker aircraft to u.s. military operations , and because previous attempts by dod to move ahead with a kc - x acquisition program over the last several years have led to controversy and ultimately failed .

the history of those earlier attempts forms an important part of the context for dod's kc - x competition , particularly in defining the required capabilities for the kc - 46a and designing and conducting a fair and transparent competition .

the issues for congress in fy2014 are whether to approve , reject , or modify the air force's request for fy2014 research and development funding for the kc - 46a program , and to evaluate the fairness and transparency of the contract process .

congress' decision on these issues could affect dod capabilities and funding requirements , and the aircraft manufacturing industrial base .

the administration's proposed fy2013 defense budget requested $1,815.6 million in air force research and development funding to continue kc - 46a development and acquisition .

the house armed services committee , in its report accompanying h.r .

4310 , recommended funding the next generation aerial refueling aircraft program at $1,815.6 million , the requested level .

the senate armed services committee , in its report accompanying s. 3254 , recommended funding the next generation aerial refueling aircraft program at $1,728.5 million , $87.1 million below the requested level , with the following explanation: next generation aerial refueling aircraft the budget request included $1,815.6 million to continue development of the kc – 46a , the next - generation aerial refueling aircraft .

the program office received fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 tanker replacement transfer fund ( trtf ) funds in fiscal year 2011 that provided $135.0 million more research , development , test , and evaluation ( rdt&e ) funding than the air force believed it needed during that period .

the department of the air force applied $47.9 million of the $135.0 million to small business innovation research activities , leaving $87.1 million of the $135.0 million in excess fiscal year 2011 funding available to cover fiscal year 2012 activities .

since congress already provided full funding of the fiscal year 2012 requirement , the department could apply $87.1 million in fiscal year 2012 funds against fiscal year 2013 funding requirements .

therefore , the committee recommends a reduction of $87.1 million in the budget request for the kc – 46a emd program .

the house appropriations committee , in its report accompanying h.r .

5856 , recommended funding the next generation aerial refueling aircraft program at $1,815.6 million , the requested level .

it directed submission of reports on program cost growth , stating: kc – 46a the committee directs the secretary of the air force to continue to submit quarterly reports on any kc – 46a contract modifications with a cost greater than or equal to $5,000,000 , as directed by the explanatory statement accompanying the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 .

the senate appropriations committee , in its report accompanying h.r .

5856 , recommended funding the next generation aerial refueling aircraft program at $1,738.5 million , $77.1 million below the requested level , for "air force identified forward financing. .

fy2013 appropriations levels were ultimately established by h.r .

h.rept .

112-78 , accompanying h.r .

1540 , explained the funding reduction: kc - 46a aerial refueling aircraft program the budget request contained $877.1 million in pe 65221f for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft , kc - 46a .

the committee supports the attributes and benefits regarding the kc - 46a competition and acknowledges that the source - selection process was conducted fairly amongst all competitors .

according to department of defense acquisition officials , the competition resulted in at least a twenty percent savings for the unit cost of the aircraft and a savings of $3.0 to $4.0 billion as compared to the source - selection competition held for the tanker in 2008 .

the committee plans to closely monitor the kc - 46a engineering , manufacturing and development program to ensure that the taxpayer dollars are wisely invested and that the platform will result in a capability that enhances the warfighter's global reach capabilities .

the committee also understands that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics ( usd , at&l ) will conduct quarterly reviews of the air force's kc - 46a program .

elsewhere in this title , the committee includes a provision that would require the comptroller general of the united states to conduct an annual review of the kc - 46a program and to provide the results to the congressional defense committees beginning on march 1 , 2012 .

furthermore , the committee directs usd , at&l to provide to the congressional defense committees the results of each quarterly review of the kc - 46a program within 30 days after the date of completion of each review .

at each quarterly review briefing , usd , at&l is directed to provide notice of a major engineering , design , capability or configuration change to the kc - 46a , and cost for that change when it becomes known , that is different from the baseline aircraft offered in the final proposal related to air force contract #fa8625-11-c600 .

the committee recommends $849.9 million , a decrease of $27.2 million , in pe 65221f for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft because that funding is in excess to the $818.0 million obligation authority limited by usd , at&l for the program for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 .

the report accompanying s. 1253 as passed by the senate armed services committee ( s.rept .

112-26 , accompanying s. 1253 ) recommended $749.1 million for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft , a reduction of $127.1 million from the administration's request , to "align funding to signed kc – 46a contract. .

the report went on to explain: next generation aerial refueling aircraft the budget request included $877.1 million to continue development of the kc – 46a , the next - generation aerial refueling aircraft .

the air force developed the budget estimates before signing the contract for the kc – 46a and before knowing the funding required , and the timing of that requirement .

based on a comparison of the program's fiscal year 2012 budget submission and the contemplated funding allotments for fiscal year 2011 specified in the recently signed engineering and manufacturing development ( emd ) contract , the air force already has funds that are well in excess of what is needed to execute the current kc – 46a contract .

the program will need roughly $753.5 million to cover planned fiscal year 2011 activities , but the program has $830.5 million available in fiscal year 2011 from regular appropriations and the tanker replacement transfer fund .

this means that $77.0 million is available within the program to pay for fiscal year 2012 kc – 46a emd activities .

in addition , the fiscal year 2012 budget request of $877.1 million for kc – 46a emd exceeds fiscal year 2012 requirements for the emd by $50.1 million .

in total , this means that the budget request for fiscal year 2012 exceeds the amount of funds to keep the kc – 46a program fully funded and on schedule by a total of $127.1 million .

therefore , the committee recommends a reduction of $127.1 million in the budget request for the kc – 46a emd program .

the conference report accompanying h.r .

1540 as passed recommended $742.1 million for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft , a reduction of $135.0 million from the administration's request — $127.1 million was cut to "align funding to signed kc – 46a contract," and $7.9 million was considered "excess to requirement. .

the house appropriations committee , in its report ( h.rept .

112-110 , accompanying h.r .

2219 ) recommended funding the next generation aerial refueling aircraft at the administration's request , $877.1 million .

the report also stated: kc – 46a change reporting the award for the air force's kc – 46a aerial refueling tanker was announced on february 24 , 2011 .

the committee's recommendation fully funds the request for this vital program .

air force leadership testified before the committee that efforts would be made to ensure that the new tanker will be delivered within cost and on schedule .

in order to further this approach , the committee directs the secretary of the air force to report any authorized contract modifications with a cost greater than or equal to $5,000,000 to the congressional defense committees not later than 30 days following the authorization of such change .

senate the senate appropriations committee report ( s.rept .

112-77 , accompanying h.r .

2219 ) recommended $742.1 million for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft , a reduction of $135.0 million from the administration's request , with the accompanying language: kc - 46a - the budget request includes $877,084,000 for the development of a next generation aerial refueling tanker .

replacing the aging tanker fleet is essential to the air force's modernization efforts , and the committee remains very supportive of this program .

however , after the budget was submitted , the air force conducted an integrated baseline review [ibr] of the program , which changed the annual spending plan to complete the development effort of the program .

as a result , the air force identified $135,000,000 that will not be required in fiscal year 2012 .

therefore , the committee recommends reducing the request by this amount to align the budget with the new ibr .

final action the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on the fy2012 defense appropriations bill funded the next generation aerial refueling aircraft at the administration's request , $877.1 million .

house the house armed services committee , in its report ( h.rept .

111-166 of june 18 , 2009 ) on h.r .

2647 , recommends approving the administration's request for $439.6 million in research and development funding for the kc - x program .

 ( page 190 , line 88 ) the committee's report states: kc – x the committee notes that the kc – x program is planned to replace the department of the air force's kc – 135 aerial refueling tanker fleet , which now has an average aircraft age of 47 years .

the committee also notes that the kc – x program has been subject to delays resulting from contractor protests to the government accountability office , and believes that further delay in the acquisition of the kc – x aerial refueling tanker could jeopardize department of defense requirements for global mobility .

accordingly , the committee strongly urges the department to include the necessary funds in its future years defense program to rapidly conduct source selection and to award a kc – x aerial refueling tanker contract as expeditiously as possible .

 ( pages 100-101 ) the report also states: kc – x tanker replacement program the committee believes that the department of defense should implement measures to ensure competition throughout the lifecycle of the kc – x tanker replacement program to ensure that the program delivers the best capability to the warfighter and the best value to the u.s. government .

accordingly , the committee urges the secretary of defense to utilize as many of the competitive measures specified in subsection ( b ) of section 202 of the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( public law 111 – 23 ) as is practicable when developing the acquisition strategy and source selection plan .

the committee notes that the intent of section 202 is to require the secretary of defense to plan for persistent competition to control program costs and improve the reliability of the kc – x tanker acquired by the department throughout the program's lifecycle , including development , procurement , and sustainment .

 ( page 203 ) section 1032 of h.r .

2647 requires secretary of defense to submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the force structure findings of the 2009 quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) .

regarding section 1032 , the committee's report states: the committee expects that the analyses submitted will include details on all elements of the force structure discussed in the qdr report , and particularly the following:... ( 3 ) a description of the factors that informed decisions regarding aerial refueling aircraft force structure , including: the modeling , simulations , and analyses used to determine the number and type of aerial refueling aircraft necessary to meet the national defense strategy ; the force sizing constructs used including peak demand ; the number and type of aerial refueling aircraft necessary to meet the national security objective ; the changes made , and supporting rationale for the changes made , to the aerial refueling aircraft force structure from that proposed in mcs – 05 ; and the operational risks associated with the planned aerial refueling aircraft fleet , based on requirements of combatant commanders , and measures planned to address those risks ; ... ( page 388 ) section 1044 of h.r .

2647 would repeal section 1081 of the fy2008 defense authorization act ( h.r .

4986 / p.l .

110-181 of january 28 , 2008 ) , which directed the secretary of the air force to conduct a pilot program of at least five years' duration to assess the feasibility and advisability of utilizing commercial fee - for - service air refueling tanker aircraft for air force operations .

regarding section 1044 , the committee's report states: the committee is aware that the air force has conducted initial analysis to develop the program structure for the pilot program , based on two diverse options , and has received feedback from potential providers in the aviation industry .

however , based on its review of data gathered to date , the committee is concerned that the pilot program will be a costly alternative with little operational benefit and is not in the best interest of the air force .

 ( page 391 ) the committee's report also states: fee for service refueling the budget request contained $10.0 million for a fee - for - service refueling pilot program .

the committee recommends eliminating the funds for the pilot program .

a provision is included elsewhere in this title [section 1044] that would repeal the requirement to conduct a fee - for - service pilot program .

 ( page 284 ; see also page 282 for the recommended line - item reduction ) senate division d of s. 1390 as reported by the senate armed services committee ( s.rept .

111-35 of july 2 , 2009 ) presents the detailed line - item funding tables that in previous years have been included in the senate armed services committee's report on the defense authorization bill .

division d recommends approving the administration's request for $439.6 million in research and development funding for the kc - x program .

 ( page 687 of the printed bill , line 88 ) the committee's report states: kc – x tanker replacement program the committee regards the need to modernize the current fleet of kc – 135 aerial refueling tanker aircraft as a vital national security priority and supports the kc - x tanker recapitalization program , as well as efforts by the air force both to maintain the existing fleet and augment capability with aerial fee - for - service , if it proves cost - effective under the pending pilot program .

given the troubled history of the program , the committee expects that the department of defense will pursue a process of procuring replacement tankers that will ensure that the joint warfighter receives the best capability at the best price .

the committee believes that this can only be achieved by an acquisition strategy that does not pre - determine the outcome of the competition and a competition that is fair and open .

in addition , the committee believes that , in accordance with the principles of the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( public law 111 – 23 ) and as a means of improving contractor performance , the department of defense must ensure that the acquisition strategy of the kc – x program includes measures that ensure competition , or the option of competition , throughout the life cycle of the program , where appropriate and cost - effective .

 ( page 99 ) section 1058 of s. 1390 would amend section 1081 of the fy2008 defense authorization act ( h.r .

4986 / p.l .

110-181 of january 28 , 2008 ) , which directed the secretary of the air force to conduct a pilot program of at least five years' duration to assess the feasibility and advisability of utilizing commercial fee - for - service air refueling tanker aircraft for air force operations .

the committee's report states: the committee recommends a provision [section 1058] that would provide an exemption to the 5 – year limitation on multiyear contracts and make other minor changes to enable the air force to implement a fee - for - service air refueling support pilot program .

section 1081 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( public law 110 – 181 ) directed the secretary of the air force to conduct a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of utilizing commercial fee - for - service air refueling tanker aircraft for air force operations .

the air force has been working with the private sector to implement this pilot program .

the air force has informed the committee that results from their formal request for information process indicate that a multiyear contract that exceeds the current 5-year limit would be necessary to promote adequate competition and reduce program costs .

the air force needs to have authority to make commitments for the 8-year pilot program in order to issue a request for proposal .

the air force also needs to be able to offer carriers insurance coverage similar to that provided to civil reserve air fleet ( craf ) program partners .

this provision would provide the air force with those authorities .

fy2010 dod appropriations bill ( h.r .

3326 ) final version  in lieu of a conference report , the house appropriations committee on december 15 , 2009 , released an explanatory statement on a final version of h.r .

3326 .

this version was passed by the house on december 16 , 2009 , and by the senate on december 19 , 2009 , and signed into law on december 19 , 2009 , as p.l .

111-118 .

the explanatory statement states that it "is an explanation of the effects of division a [of h.r .

3326 ] , which makes appropriations for the department of defense for fiscal year 2010 .

as provided in section 8124 of the consolidated bill , this explanatory statement shall have the same effect with respect to the allocation of funds and the implementation of this as if it were a joint explanatory statement of a committee of the conference. .

the explanatory statement provided $15.0 million in air force research and development "for program management" of a "next generation air refueling aircraft," reduced from an administration request for 439.6 million ; $30.0 million of the reduction was attributed to savings due to a delay in awarding the tanker contract .

another $394.6 million was transferred to title viii , the general provisions section of the bill .

of that transferred money , $291.7 million was made available for a tanker replacement transfer fund .

section 8119 of h.r .

3326 explains the tanker replacement transfer fund thusly: in addition to funds made available elsewhere in this act , there is hereby appropriated $291,715,000 , to remain available until transferred: provided , that these funds are appropriated to the `tanker replacement transfer fund' ( referred to as `the fund' elsewhere in this section ) : provided further , that the secretary of the air force may transfer amounts in the fund to `operation and maintenance , air force' , `aircraft procurement , air force' , and `research , development , test and evaluation , air force' , only for the purposes of proceeding with a tanker acquisition program: provided further , that funds transferred shall be merged with and be available for the same purposes and for the same time period as the appropriations or fund to which transferred: provided further , that this transfer authority is in addition to any other transfer authority available to the department of defense: provided further , that the secretary of the air force shall , not fewer than 15 days prior to making transfers using funds provided in this section , notify the congressional defense committees in writing of the details of any such transfer: provided further , that the secretary shall submit a report no later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter to the congressional defense committees summarizing the details of the transfer of funds from this appropriation .

the explanatory statement also includes this provision: aerial refueling tanker program the recommendation includes $15,000,000 in research , development , test and evaluation , air force for program management and a general provision providing $291,715,000 in a tanker replacement transfer fund .

not later than 10 days after the release of the final request for proposal soliciting bids for an aerial tanker replacement aircraft , the secretary of the air force is directed to submit a report to the congressional defense committees that includes a description of changes from the draft proposal to the final request for proposal and the rationale for each change .

the secretary of the air force is encouraged to pursue tanker recapitalization at a rate of36 aircraft per year instead of 12 or 15 aircraft in the current plan .

this quantity will recapitalize the fleet in one - third the time and allow for a rapid retirement of the aging kc - 135 aircraft .

furthermore , a more accelerated procurement strategy will avoid the large sustainment and modernization costs associated with keeping the legacy kc - 135 fleet in the inventory longer .

house the house appropriations committee , in its report ( h.rept .

111-230 of july 24 , 2009 ) on h.r .

3326 , recommends $439.6 million in research and development funding for the kc - x program , as requested by the administration , but transfers this funding from the air force's research and development account to a "tanker replacement transfer fund" established by section 8112 of the bill as reported .

 ( see also page 273 , line 88. ) .

the text of section 8112 is as follows: sec .

8112 .

 ( a ) in addition to funds made available elsewhere in this act , there is hereby appropriated $439,615,000 to remain available until transferred: provided , that these funds are appropriated to the `tanker replacement transfer fund' ( referred to as `the fund' elsewhere in this section ) : provided further , that the secretary of the air force may transfer amounts in the fund to `operation and maintenance , air force' , `aircraft procurement , air force' , and `research , development , test and evaluation , air force' , only for the purposes of proceeding with a tanker acquisition program: provided further , that funds transferred shall be merged with and be available for the same purposes and for the same time period as the appropriations or fund to which transferred: provided further , that this transfer authority is in addition to any other transfer authority available to the department of defense: provided further , that the secretary of the air force shall , not fewer than 15 days prior to making transfers using funds provided in this section , notify the congressional defense committees in writing of the details of any such transfer: provided further , that the secretary shall submit a report no later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter to the congressional defense committees summarizing the details of the transfer of funds from this appropriation .

 ( b ) the secretary of defense is directed to award one or more contracts for the aerial refueling tanker replacement program according to either of the following alternatives: ( 1 ) a contract to a single offeror based on a best value or lowest cost source selection derived from full and open competition , subject to the condition that non - development aircraft produced under such contract must be finally assembled in the united states .

such competition and source selection shall include evaluation of the life - cycle costs of each aircraft over a 40-year period ( including costs of fuel consumption , military construction and other factors normally associated with operation and support of tanker aircraft ) and shall include an independent 40-year life - cycle cost estimate conducted by a federally funded research and development center .

 ( 2 ) contracts awarded to each of the two offerors that responded to request for proposal no .

fa8625-07-r - 6470 ( as released on january 29 , 2007 ) subject to the condition that all non - development aircraft produced under any such contracts must be finally assembled in the united states .

 ( c ) the secretary of defense shall certify in writing to the congressional defense committees by october 1 , 2009 , which of the procurement alternatives in subsection ( b ) represents the most cost - effective and expeditious tanker replacement strategy that best responds to united states national security requirements .

the certification shall be accompanied by a report to the congressional defense committees detailing the rationale for such certification .

the committee's report states: aerial refueling tanker replacement program the committee firmly believes that the department must act promptly to recapitalize the aging air force aerial refueling fleet .

the department's current program has been beset with countless setbacks , from allegations of corruption to a protest of the previous source selection decision .

in the meantime , our nation's aerial refueling tankers continue to age , with the average age of a kc – 135 being almost 50 years old today .

the aerial refueling replacement program ( kc – x , kc – y and kc – z ) plans to procure between 12 and 15 aircraft per year to eventually replace the current fleet of 513 aircraft .

this method of recapitalization will take decades to complete , with the current fleet of eisenhower - era tankers being 80 years old by the time the last legacy aircraft is retired .

during this period , the air force will invest billions of taxpayer dollars in maintenance of an ever aging and increasingly unreliable fleet .

based on studies conducted by the department of defense , total fleet costs are anticipated to increase from $2.1 billion per year to $3 billion per year by 2040 due to increasing depot maintenance and forecasted modernization programs in avionics and aircraft systems .

additionally , the department anticipates depot maintenance costs increasing from $320,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 in 2040 due to aging aircraft related maintenance .

never in the history of our nation has the military purposely planned to maintain aircraft past 50 years , much less 80 years of operation so even these estimates may understate the actual cost .

in addition to the cost of maintaining the aging tanker fleet , the cost per flying hour of a new tanker is almost half the cost of the existing fleet .

the lower cost per flying hour alone will save the taxpayer $1,795,500,000 per year for a fleet of 513 aircraft ( current total aircraft inventory ) or $3,500,000 per plane per year replaced .

to address these concerns , the committee recommendation includes a general provision providing $439,615,000 and the option for choosing one vendor or dual sourcing for the aerial refueling tanker replacement program .

along with this authority , the committee believes that it is in the best interest of the taxpayer to pursue recapitalization at a rate of 36 aircraft per year vice 12 or 15 aircraft .

this quantity will allow for recapitalization in one - third the time and thus allow for a rapid retirement of the current kc – 135 aircraft .

this plan will result in avoiding a large sustainment and modernization cost of the legacy kc – 135 fleet by allowing them to retire earlier than is currently programmed .

additionally , having more than one aircraft provider will allow for competition to help control the procurement cost , promote cost reduction measures , and allow for a faster aircraft replacement rate .

further , the committee directs the secretary of defense to , prior to the release of a draft or final request for proposal soliciting bids for an aerial tanker replacement aircraft , submit a report to the congressional defense committees that includes a description of key mission requirement and performance parameters that will be used as the basis for determining the key selection criteria in the source selection process ; a full and complete characterization and definition of ''best value'' ; a description of the process that the department of defense intends to use to ensure open , balanced and trans parent communications with potential offerors ; and a full description of the corrections made to the source selection process that addresses the issues raised by the government accountability office in its ''statement regarding the bid protest decision resolving the aerial refueling tanker protest by the boeing company , b311344 et .

al , june 18 , 2008'' .

 ( pages 276-277 ) the report also states: a major imperative of the committee's funding recommendations is to improve the efficiency with which department of defense resources are expended .

the committee believes that one of the best ways to support united states forces is to improve the stability of acquisition programs and increase quantities to field new equipment more rapidly .

in many cases , the procurement rates for new equipment are well below what could reasonably be described as economic order quantities .

the practice of stretching out procurement schedules not only delays fielding modernized weapons but is costly as well .

for example , in the case of the aerial refueling tanker , annual maintenance costs are expected to climb by $900,000,000 , and depot maintenance costs are expected to increase by $780,000,000 .

in contrast , the lower cost per flying hour for a new fleet of tankers will save taxpayers $3,500,000 per aircraft per year .

the committee also notes that the aerial refueling tankers are a crucial piece of our nation's ability to deploy and operate anywhere in the world .

 ( page 4 ) the report also states: fee - for - service refueling the committee provides no funding for the fee - for - service refueling pilot program due to concerns with the lack of a validated requirement for the program .

the air force should instead focus on the kc – 135 tanker replacement program which is a joint requirements oversight council validated requirement .

the committee recommends $439,615,000 in title viii of this act only for the recapitalization of the aging kc – 135 fleet with a competitive procurement of a commercial derivative tanker aircraft .

 ( page 91 ) senate the senate appropriations committee , in its report ( s.rept .

111-74 of september 10 , 2009 ) on h.r .

3326 , recommends $409.6 million in research and development funding for the kc - x program — a $30 million reduction from the administration's request , with the reduction being for "contract award delay. .

the recommended funding is located in the air force's research and development account , as requested .

potential longevity of kc - 135 fleet 2004 dsb report and 2006 rand analysis a 2004 defense science board ( dsb ) task force report examined , among other things , the potential longevity of the kc - 135 fleet .

the 2006 rand analysis of alternatives ( aoa ) on aerial refueling also examined the technical condition of the kc - 135 fleet .

the dsb report stated that airframe service life , corrosion , and maintenance costs factors would potentially determine the kc - 135s operational life expectancy .

each of these factors is discussed briefly below .

airframe service life kc - 135s , along with their associated b - 52 bombers , were originally purchased to give the united states a strategic nuclear strike capability .

as a result , both fleets of airplanes spent a significant amount of time during the cold war on ground alert .

consequently , in 2004 , the average kc - 135 airframe had flown only about 17,000 hours of an estimated service life of 36,000 hours ( kc - 135e ) or 39,000 hours ( kc - 135r ) .

on this basis , the dsb report concluded that kc - 135 airframes were viable until 2040 at "current usage rates. .

the 2006 rand aoa similarly concluded that the kc - 135 fleet "can operate into the 2040s," but not without risks .

corrosion the 2004 dsb report concluded that corrosion did not pose an "imminent catastrophic threat to the kc - 135 fleet" and that the air force's maintenance practices were postured "to deal with corrosion and other aging problems," but also stated: however , because the kc - 135s are true first generation turbojet aircraft designed only 50 years from the time man first began to fly , concerns regarding the ability to continue operating these aircraft indefinitely are intuitively well founded .

maintenance costs a 2004 gao report stated that kc - 135 flying hour costs increased in real ( i.e. , inflation - adjusted ) terms by 29% between 1996 and 2002 .

the dsb report agreed that kc - 135 maintenance costs had increased significantly , but found that they had leveled off due to air force changes in kc - 135 depot processes .

the dsb report forecasted modest growth in maintenance costs in the future .

risks of flying older aircraft some observers express about potential problems that may arise in flying 50- to 80-year - old tankers that could possibly ground the entire kc - 135 fleet .

the dsb report examined the issue and concluded that "although grounding is possible , the task force assesses the probability as no more likely than that of any other aircraft in the inventory of the services. .

the 2006 rand analysis expressed a belief that it is possible that kc - 135s will be able to operate into the 2040s , but the report expressed a lack of confidence that kc - 135s could continue to be operated that long without risks of major maintenance cost increases , poor fleet availability , or possible fleet - wide grounding .

the rand analysis concluded that "the nation does not currently have sufficient knowledge about the state of the kc - 135 fleet to project its technical condition over the next several decades with high confidence. .

the analysis recommended more thorough scientific and technical study of the kc - 135 to provide a more reliable basis for future assessments of the condition of the kc - 135 fleet .
