t he renewable electricity production tax credit ( ptc ) expired on january 1 , 2018 , for nonwind facilities .

thus , under current law , the credit is not available for nonwind projects that begin construction after december 31 , 2017 .

under current law , wind facilities that begin construction before the end of 2019 may qualify for the ptc .

however , the ptc for wind started phasing down in 2017 .

whether the ptc should be extended , modified , or remain expired is an issue that may be considered in the 116 th congress .

legislation enacted during the first session of the 114 th congress , the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , extended the ptc for wind for five years ( with a phase down starting in 2017 ) .

legislation enacted during the second session of the 115 th congress , the bipartisan budget agreement of 2018 ( bba18 ; p.l .

115-123 ) , retroactively extended the ptc for nonwind technologies for tax year 2017 .

this report provides a brief overview of the renewable electricity ptc .

the first section of the report describes the credit .

the second section provides a legislative history .

the third section presents data on ptc claims and discusses the revenue consequences of the credit .

the fourth section briefly considers some of the economic and policy considerations related to the credit .

the report concludes by briefly noting policy options related to the ptc .

the renewable electricity ptc is a per - kilowatt - hour tax ( kwh ) credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources .

to qualify for the credit , the electricity must be sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person .

the credit can be claimed for a 10-year period once a qualifying facility is placed in service .

the maximum credit amount for 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 was 2.3 cents per kwh .

the maximum credit amount for 2017 and 2018 is 2.4 cents per kwh .

the maximum credit rate , set at 1.5 cents per kwh in statute , is adjusted annually for inflation .

wind ( before applying the 2017-2019 phaseout rates ) , closed - loop biomass , and geothermal energy technologies qualify for the maximum credit amount ( see table 1 ) .

other technologies , including open - loop biomass , small irrigation power , municipal solid waste , qualified hydropower , and marine and hydrokinetic energy facilities , qualify for a reduced credit amount , where the amount of the credit is reduced by one - half ( see table 1 ) .

under current law , nonwind facilities for which construction began before january 1 , 2018 , may qualify for the ptc .

for wind facilities , the credit is available for facilities for which construction begins before january 1 , 2020 .

however , for facilities that begin construction during 2017 , the credit is reduced by 20% .

the credit is reduced by 40% for facilities that begin construction in 2018 , and reduced by 60% for facilities that begin construction in 2019 .

before 2013 , the ptc expiration date was a placed - in - service deadline , meaning that the electricity - producing property had to be ready and available for use before the credit's expiration date .

the amount that may be claimed for the ptc is set to phase out once the market price of electricity exceeds threshold levels .

since being enacted , market prices of electricity have never exceeded the threshold level and the ptc has not been phased out , nor is the ptc likely to be phased out under current law .

in the past , the ability to claim the ptc was also , in some cases , limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax ( amt ) .

before 2018 , the ptc was available for taxpayers subject to the amt for the first four years of the credit .

while the ptc could not be claimed against the corporate amt , unused credits could be carried forward to offset future regular tax liability .

while few firms were subject to the corporate amt , this limitation may have been significant for those affected .

the corporate amt was eliminated as part of the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) .

from 2009 through 2017 , ptc - eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit ( itc ) in lieu of the ptc .

property that was placed in service during 2009 , 2010 , or 2011 , or which was placed under construction in one of these years , also had the option of claiming an american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) section 1603 grant in lieu of tax benefits .

there are also production tax credits for indian coal and refined coal .

indian coal production facilities must have been placed in service before january 1 , 2009 , for coal produced before january 1 , 2016 , to receive credits .

there is no placed - in - service limitation for coal produced and sold after december 31 , 2015 .

under current law , credits are not available for coal produced after 2017 .

the base rate for indian coal is $2.00 per ton , but with the inflation adjustment the credit was $2.4 in 2017 .

for refined coal , the base credit amount is $4.375 per ton , and the 2018 credit with the inflation adjustment is $7.307 per ton .

refined coal facilities must have been placed in service before january 1 , 2012 , to qualify for credits .

refined coal facilities that were placed in service before this deadline may still be receiving credits , as the credit was allowed for production over a 10-year period .

the ptc was first enacted in 1992 as part of the energy policy act of 1992 ( epact92 ; p.l .

102-486 ) .

since 1999 , the ptc has been extended 11 times ( see table 2 ) .

in many instances , the ptc lapsed before being reinstated .

when first enacted as part of the epact92 , the ptc was available for electricity generated using wind or closed - loop biomass systems .

the credit was initially set to expire on june 30 , 1999 .

in addition to extending the ptc through december 31 , 2001 , the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 ( p.l .

106-170 ) added poultry waste as a qualifying technology .

the ptc was again extended , through december 31 , 2003 , as part of the job creation and worker assistance act ( p.l .

107-147 ) .

the working families tax relief act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-311 ) included provisions extending the ptc through december 31 , 2005 .

legislation enacted later in the 108 th congress substantially modified the ptc .

the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( ajca ; p.l .

108-357 ) added new qualifying resources , including open - loop biomass ( including agricultural livestock waste ) , geothermal energy , solar energy , small irrigation power , and municipal solid waste ( landfill gas and trash combustion facilities ) .

instead of being able to claim the ptc for the first 10 years of production , these new qualifying resources were limited to a five - year ptc period .

further , open - loop biomass , small irrigation power , and municipal solid waste facilities had their credit amount reduced by one - half .

the ajca also introduced a ptc for refined coal , with a rate of $4.375 per ton ( indexed for inflation after 1992 ) , available for qualifying facilities placed in service before january 1 , 2009 .

the ptc was extended twice during the 109 th congress .

the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact05 ; p.l .

109-58 ) extended the ptc for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years , through 2007 .

epact05 also added two new qualifying resources: hydropower and indian coal .

hydropower was added as a half - credit qualifying resource .

indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven - year period , with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years , and $2.00 per ton for the last three years , adjusted for inflation .

epact05 also extended the credit period from 5 years to 10 years for all qualifying facilities ( other than indian coal ) placed in service after august 8 , 2005 .

the tax relief and health care act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-432 ) extended the ptc for one year , through 2008 , for all qualifying facilities other than solar , refined coal , and indian coal .

the ptc was again extended and modified as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( eesa ; p.l .

110-343 ) .

the ptc for wind and refined coal was extended for one year , through 2009 , while the ptc for closed - loop biomass , open - loop biomass , geothermal energy , small irrigation power , municipal solid waste , and qualified hydropower was extended for two years , through 2010 .

marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were also added by eesa as qualifying resources .

a new credit for steel industry fuel was also introduced .

this credit was set at $2.00 per barrel - of - oil equivalent ( adjusted for inflation with 1992 as the base year ) .

for facilities that were producing steel industry fuel on or before october 1 , 2008 , the credit was available for fuel produced and sold between october 1 , 2008 , and january 1 , 2010 .

for facilities placed in service after october 1 , 2008 , the credit was available for one year after the placed - in - service date or through december 31 , 2009 , whichever was later .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) provided a longer - term extension of the ptc , extending the ptc for wind through 2012 and the ptc for other renewable energy technologies through 2013 .

provisions enacted in arra also allowed ptc - eligible taxpayers to elect to receive a 30% investment tax credit ( itc ) in lieu of the ptc .

arra also introduced the section 1603 grant program , which allowed ptc - and itc - eligible taxpayers to receive a one - time payment from the treasury in lieu of tax credits .

under arra , the section 1603 grant program was available for property placed in service or for which construction started in 2009 or 2010 .

the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) extended the section 1603 grant program for one year , through 2011 .

the ptc for wind , which was scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 , was extended for one year , through 2013 , as part of the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) .

in addition to extending the ptc for wind , provisions in atra changed the credit expiration date from a placed - in - service deadline to a construction start date for all qualifying electricity - producing technologies .

the ptc , as well as the itc in lieu of ptc option , was retroactively extended through 2014 as part of the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-295 ) .

the protecting americans from tax hikes ( path ) act of 2015 , enacted as division q of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , extended the ptc expiration date for nonwind facilities for two years , through the end of 2016 .

the itc in lieu of ptc option was also extended through 2016 .

for indian coal facilities , the production credit was extended for two years , through 2016 .

additionally , for indian coal facilities , the placed - in - service limitation was removed , allowing the credit for production at facilities placed in service after december 31 , 2008 , to qualify .

as part of division p of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , the ptc for wind was extended through 2019 .

the credit was extended at current rates through 2016 .

for wind facilities beginning construction in 2017 , the credit is reduced by 20% .

the credit is reduced by 40% for facilities beginning construction in 2018 , and reduced by 60% for facilities beginning construction in 2019 .

the ptcs for nonwind technologies and the ptc for indian coal expired at the end of 2016 , but were retroactively extended for tax year 2017 in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba18 ; p.l .

115-123 ) .

absent further legislative action , the ptc for nonwind technologies and the ptc for indian coal will not be available for facilities the construction of which begins after december 31 , 2017 .

estimates of the cost , or foregone revenue , associated with tax expenditure provisions can be found in the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) annual tax expenditure tables .

because jct's figures are estimates , they may differ from actual amounts of tax credit claims .

between 2018 and 2022 , estimated revenue losses associated with the ptc are $25.8 billion ( see table 3 ) .

most of these revenue losses , $24.0 billion , are due to the ptc for wind energy .

an estimated $0.8 billion is for ptcs for electricity produced using geothermal , $0.5 billion for ptcs for electricity generated using open - loop biomass , $0.3 billion for ptcs for electricity generated using municipal solid waste , and $0.1 billion for ptcs for electricity generated using qualified hydropower .

over the same five - year period , the estimated revenue losses associated with the production credits for refined coal and indian coal are $0.1 billion each .

jct's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law .

a policy that further extends the ptc would increase these tax expenditure estimates .

information on ptc claims by corporations is available from the irs through the 2013 filing year .

for 2013 , 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the ptc ( see table 4 ) .

most of the credits claimed were for production of renewable electricity , with only a few claims being made for refined coal , indian coal , or steel industry fuel .

in total , for 2013 , taxpayers claimed ptcs of $2.8 billion .

because the ptc is paid out for 10 years , most ptcs awarded in any given year are the result of previous - year investments .

some taxpayers may not be able to use all of their tax credits to offset taxable income in a given tax year .

in this case , taxpayers may carry forward unused credits to offset tax liability in a future tax year .

in 2010 , nearly $1.2 billion in ptcs were carried forward from previous tax years .

the irs data on ptc claims highlight the effect that policy actions taken in response to the economic downturn had on renewable energy tax credit claims .

while the number of taxpayers claiming the ptc increased between 2008 and 2009 , this number decreased after 2009 .

with the section 1603 grant option available , fewer taxpayers claimed the ptc .

while section 1603 grants were available in lieu of the ptc , $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that otherwise would have been ptc - eligible .

this amount is not directly comparable to the costs of the ptc because section 1603 grants were a one - time payment , while projects can claim the ptc for 10 years of production .

the effect of the economic downturn can also be seen in data on tax credit carry forwards .

the amount of ptcs being carried forward more than doubled between 2008 and 2009 , then doubled again between 2009 and 2010 .

during the economic downturn , taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits .

further , weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy project developers to establish partnerships to monetize tax credits .

other available estimates provide information on the cost of a long - term ptc extension .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that a permanent ptc ( or a ptc extended through the budget horizon ) for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028 .

extending the indian coal production credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion between 2019 and 2028 .

extending the wind construction start date through the end of the budget window , beyond 2019 , would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027 .

the ptc was enacted in 1992 to promote the "development and utilization of certain renewable energy sources. .

the 1999 sunset was included to provide an "opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the credit. .

when the ptc was extended as part of a "tax extenders" package in 1999 , congress noted that the ptc had been important to the development of environmentally friendly renewable power , and extended the credit to promote further development of wind ( and other ) resources .

recent extensions of the ptc reflect a belief that the tax incentives contribute to the development of renewable energy infrastructure , which advances environmental and energy policy goals .

research suggests that the ptc has driven investment and contributed to growth in the wind industry .

while further extension of the ptc may lead to further investment and growth in wind infrastructure , this potential is limited in the case of short - term extensions .

further , retroactive extensions provide what are often characterized as windfall benefits , rewarding taxpayers that made investments absent tax incentives .

while the ptc has contributed to increased use of renewable electricity resources , research on its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed .

in a 2013 report , the national academy of sciences estimated that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small ( 0.3% ) increase in power - sector emissions .

in an evaluation of the renewable energy tax credit extensions enacted in p.l .

114-113 , the national renewable energy laboratory concluded that the recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions , particularly if natural gas prices are low .

a common rationale for government intervention in energy markets is the presence of "externalities," which result in "market failures. .

pollution resulting from the production and consumption of energy creates a negative externality , as the costs of pollution are borne by society as a whole , not just energy producers and consumers .

because producers and consumers of polluting energy resources do not bear the full cost of their production ( or consumption ) choices , too much energy is produced ( or consumed ) , resulting in a market outcome that is economically inefficient .

tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option for addressing the inefficiencies and market failures in the energy sector .

here , the subsidies approach is not the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective .

subsidies reduce the average cost of energy , encouraging energy consumption , countering energy conservation initiatives , and offsetting emissions reductions .

additionally , tax subsidies do not necessarily provide a comparable incentive for all emissions reduction alternatives , and may favor more costly reductions over less costly ones .

finally , tax subsidies also reduce tax revenues .

to the extent that these subsidies are financed by distortionary taxes on other economic activities , they reduce economic efficiency .

a more direct and economically efficient approach to addressing pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector would be a direct tax on pollution or emissions , such as a carbon tax .

this option would generate revenues that could be used to offset other distortionary taxes , achieve distributional goals , or reduce the deficit .

a carbon tax approach would also be "technology neutral," not requiring congress to select which technologies to subsidize .

tax incentives are also not the most efficient mechanism for delivering federal financial support directly to renewable energy developers and investors .

stand - alone projects often have limited tax liability .

thus , project developers often seek outside investors to "monetize" tax benefits using "tax - equity" financing arrangements .

the use of tax equity investors , often major financial institutions , reduces the amount of federal financial support for renewable energy that is delivered directly to the renewable energy sector .

tax incentives that reward production , as opposed to investment , are likely to lead to more renewable electricity per dollar of federal subsidy .

another consideration is the interaction of the ptc with other policies designed to support the development of renewable electricity resources .

more than half of u.s. states currently have renewable portfolio standards ( rps ) policies in place .

subsidies for renewable energy at the federal level , including the ptc , reduce the cost of complying with state - level rps mandates .

without legislative action , the ptc is not available to nonwind projects that began construction after december 31 , 2017 , or wind projects that begin construction after december 31 , 2019 .

one option is to allow the ptc to expire as scheduled .

under this option , projects that meet specified construction start dates would receive the ptc for the first 10 years of qualified production .

another option would be to provide a temporary extension of the ptc .

with this option , the construction start date deadline could be extended by a set number of years .

with the enactment of p.l .

114-113 , the expiration date for the ptc for wind is different than the expiration date for the ptc for other technologies .

thus , congress may choose to extend the ptc for nonwind technologies .

the extension could be made retroactive for 2018 .

if the ptc for nonwind technologies were extended , the phaseout that currently applies to wind could be applied to other technologies .

another alternative would be to extend the ptc for nonwind technologies , and remove the phaseout for wind , such that all ptc - eligible technologies qualified for the ptc at the same rate .

in 2014 , house ways and means committee chairman dave camp proposed a form of ptc phaseout as part his tax reform proposal introduced in the 113 th congress , the tax reform act of 2014 ( h.r .

1 ) .

under this proposal , the ptc inflation adjustment factor would have been eliminated .

this would reduce the value of the ptc for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kwh , for all ptc - eligible properties still within the 10-year eligibility window .

thus , facilities that had received a 2.3 cent per kwh ptc in 2014 , and were still within their 10-year ptc window in 2015 , would have seen the value of the ptc fall to 1.5 cents per kwh for 2015 and beyond .

under chairman camp's proposal , the ptc would have been fully repealed after 2024 .

because the value of the ptc would be reduced for existing facilities , the jct estimates that this proposal would have raised $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023 , relative to current law at the time .

a similar proposal was introduced in the 114 th congress as the ptc elimination act ( h.r .

1901 ) .

president obama's fy2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the ptc .

additionally , under president obama's proposal , the ptc would be made refundable , solar facilities would be added as qualifying property , and the credit would be modified such that renewable electricity consumed by the producer could qualify for tax credits .

solar property that currently qualifies for the residential energy efficient property credit would also be eligible for the ptc .

additionally , the investment tax credit ( itc ) for renewable energy would be made permanent .

in analysis of president obama's fy2017 budget , the jct estimated that making permanent the ptc and itc , along with these other changes , would cost $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026 .
