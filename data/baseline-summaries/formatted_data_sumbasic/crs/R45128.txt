congress passed the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act on march 23 , 2018 ( h.r .

1625 ) .

both the house and senate appropriations committees had reported agriculture appropriations bills for fy2018 ( h.r .

3268 , s. 1603 ) .

the house also had passed a consolidated bill that included agriculture ( h.r .

3354 ) .

the full senate did not consider the agriculture appropriations bill on the floor .

new , higher budget caps in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) facilitated the final appropriation .

specifically , the house appropriations committee passed h.r .

3268 on july 12 , 2017 , and the senate appropriations c ommittee passed s. 1603 on july 20 , 2017 .

on september 14 , the house passed an eight - bill consolidated appropriation , h.r .

3354 , with the agriculture bill as division b that included amendments to the house - reported version ( table 1 , figure 1 , appendix b ) .

the discretionary total of the enacted agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion , which is $2.1 billion more than enacted in fy2017 ( +10% ) , on a comparable basis that includes the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ; table 2 ) .

the administration had proposed a $15.8 billion discretionary total ( a reduction of 25% ) , the house - passed bill $20 billion , and the senate - reported bill $20.53 billion .

the appropriations also carry mandatory spending — though that is largely determined in separate authorizing laws — that total nearly $123 billion .

thus , the overall total of the enacted fy2018 agriculture appropriation is $146 billion .

the trump administration released its full fy2018 budget request on may 23 , 2017 , along with the detailed justification from the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .

the agriculture appropriations bill — formally known as the agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act — funds all of usda , excluding the u.s. forest service .

it also funds the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services .

in even - numbered fiscal years , the act carries cftc funding under a practice started in fy2008 for handling house - senate jurisdictional differences .

jurisdiction is with the house and senate committees on appropriations and their respective subcommittees on agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies .

the bill includes mandatory and discretionary spending , but the discretionary amounts are the primary focus during the bill's development .

the scope of the bill is shown in figure 2 .

the federal budget process treats discretionary and mandatory spending differently .

discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most of the attention during the appropriations process .

the annual budget resolution process sets spending limits for discretionary appropriations .

agency operations ( salaries and expenses ) and many grant programs are discretionary .

mandatory spending — though carried in the appropriation and usually advanced unchanged — is controlled by budget rules ( eg , paygo ) during the authorization process .

spending for so - called entitlement programs is set in laws such as the 2014 farm bill and 2010 child nutrition reauthorizations .

in fy2018 agriculture appropriations , discretionary appropriations were 16% ( $23.3 billion ) of the total .

mandatory spending carried in the act comprised $123 billion , about 84% of the $146 billion total .

about $99 billion of the $123 billion mandatory amount could be attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill ( figure 2 ) .

other programs are not in the authorizing jurisdiction of the agriculture committees .

within the discretionary total , the largest discretionary spending items are for the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) ; rural development ; agricultural research ; fda ; foreign food aid and trade ; farm assistance program salaries and loans ; food safety inspection ; conservation ; and animal and plant health programs ( figure 2 ) .

the main mandatory spending items are the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap , and other food and nutrition act programs ) , child nutrition ( school lunch and related programs ) , crop insurance , and farm commodity and conservation programs paid through usda's commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) .

snap is referred to as an "appropriated entitlement" and requires an annual appropriation .

amounts for the nutrition program are based on projected spending needs .

in contrast , the ccc operates on a line of credit .

the annual appropriation provides funding to reimburse the treasury for using this line of credit .

over time , changes by title of the agriculture appropriations bill have generally been proportionate to changes in the bill's total discretionary limit , though some activities have sustained relative increases and decreases .

agriculture appropriations peaked in fy2010 , declined through fy2013 , and since then have increased ( figure 3 ) .

comparisons to historical benchmarks , though , may depend on adjustments for inflation and other factors ( figure 4 ) .

the stacked bars in figure 3 represent the discretionary spending that was authorized for each appropriations title since fy2008 .

prior to fy2018 enactment , the total of the positive stacked bars is the budget authority contained in titles i - vi .

it was higher than the official discretionary spending allocation for the subcommittee ( the line ) because of the budgetary offset from negative amounts in title vii general provisions and other scorekeeping adjustments .

general provisions were net negative mostly because of rescissions and limits placed on mandatory programs .

like most new administrations , the trump administration released its fy2018 budget request in 2017 later than the usually expected first week of february .

it released an outline ( sometimes called a "skinny budget" ) on march 16 , 2017 , that expressed intentions primarily at the cabinet level .

for usda , it proposed a 21% reduction , including eliminating funding for some programs .

the administration's budget outline overlapped with congress finishing fy2017 appropriations .

on may 5 , 2017 , the explanatory statement for the fy2017 appropriation ( p.l .

115-31 ) addressed the direction of the new request for fy2018 by reminding the administration of congress's role: usda and fda should be mindful of congressional authority to determine and set final funding levels for fiscal year 2018 .

therefore , the agencies should not presuppose program funding outcomes and prematurely initiate action to redirect staffing prior to knowing final outcomes on fiscal year 2018 program funding .

on may 23 , 2017 , the administration released its full fy2018 budget request .

usda concurrently released its full budget summary and justification , as did the fda .

some omb proposals were not consistent with the usda request .

as an independent agency , cftc requested a different amount in its budget justification than the administration requested .

for agriculture appropriations ( including cftc ) , the trump administration requested $15.82 billion of discretionary spending , $5.3 billion less than in fy2017 ( - 25% ; table 2 , figure 3 ) .

from these documents , the congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began to consider their own bills in the summer of 2017 .

at the time the house appropriations subcommittees began marking up their fy2018 bills , an fy2018 budget resolution had not yet been adopted .

therefore , the house appropriations committee incrementally made "302 ( b ) " allocations to its subcommittees to facilitate markups beginning in june 2017 .

the agriculture subcommittee was allowed nearly $20 billion of discretionary budget authority for fy2018 .

the house agriculture appropriations subcommittee marked up its fy2018 bill on june 28 , 2017 , by voice vote .

on july 12 , 2017 , the full appropriations committee passed and reported an amended bill ( h.r .

3268 , h.rept .

115-232 ) by voice vote ( table 1 , figure 1 ) .

as the beginning of the fiscal year neared without many floor - passed appropriations bills , the house passed on september 14 , 2017 , an eight - bill consolidated appropriation ( h.r .

3354 ) with agriculture as division b .

it included several budget - neutral amendments to the reported version .

the $20 billion discretionary total in the house - passed fy2018 agriculture appropriation ( table 2 , figure 3 ) was officially $1.13 billion less than enacted in fy2017 ( - 5.3% , on a comparable basis that adds cftc back to the fy2017 agriculture appropriation's total ) .

compared to fy2017 , the house - passed bill would have achieved this reduction primarily by reducing rural development by $262 million , nutrition assistance by $220 million , farm and conservation programs by $199 million , department administration by $123 million , and research by $98 million , among other changes .

table 3 provides details at the agency level .

in the absence of an adopted fy2018 budget resolution , the senate appropriations committee made 302 ( b ) allocations to its subcommittees in july 2017 , similar to the house approach .

the agriculture subcommittee was allowed $20.53 billion of discretionary authority for fy2018 .

the senate agriculture appropriations subcommittee marked up its fy2018 bill on july 18 , 2017 , by voice vote .

two days later , the full appropriations committee passed and reported its amended bill ( s. 1603 , s.rept .

115-131 ) on july 20 , 2017 , by a vote of 31-0 ( table 1 , figure 1 ) .

the discretionary total of the senate - reported bill was $20.53 billion ( table 2 , figure 3 ) , which was $352 million less than enacted in fy2017 without cftc ( - 1.7% ) .

the senate - reported bill would have provided $776 million more than the house - passed bill on a comparable basis without the cftc .

the senate - reported bill would have made fewer and smaller reductions compared to fy2017 than the house - passed bill .

compared to fy2017 , it would have reduced rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million and increased foreign food aid by $140 million , providing more for each of these program areas than the house - passed bill ( table 3 ) .

it would also have made $220 million more in reductions — through rescissions and changing mandatory programs — than the house - passed bill .

fy2018 began on october 1 , 2017 , without an enacted appropriation .

as a result , congress has passed crs to continue to fund the government .

in general , a cr continues the funding rate and other provisions of the previous year's appropriation .

however , the office of management and budget ( omb ) prorates funding to the agencies on an annualized basis for the duration of the cr through a process known as apportionment .

crs may also provide a different amount through anomalies or make specific administrative changes .

1 .

the first cr for fy2018 ( division d of p.l .

115-56 ) lasted until december 8 , 2017 .

it continued fy2017 funding levels and provisions with two general exceptions and two anomalies for the agriculture appropriation: a 0.6791% across - the - board reduction ( section 101 ( b ) ) .

sufficient funding to maintain mandatory program levels , including for nutrition programs ( section 111 ) .

an increase of about $2 million for the commodity supplemental food program , a domestic food assistance program that predominantly serves the low - income elderly .

rather than the fy2017 funding level of $236 million , the cr provides about $238 million for this program .

this anomaly is typically included to maintain caseload and participation based on food costs ( section 116 ) .

a technical correction for the computation of a rescission to section 32 funds in light of the availability that is allowed for carryover funds , especially for disaster payments that are at the discretion of the usda ( section 117 ) .

2 .

a second cr ( p.l .

115-90 ) extended the provisions and anomalies of the first cr to december 22 , 2017 .

3 .

a third cr ( p.l .

115-96 ) extended the cr to january 19 , 2018 .

it also waived paygo rules ( section 5002 ) for the tax cuts and jobs act ( p.l .

115-97 ) that could have caused a sequestration of mandatory spending as an automatic budgetary offset , which could have affected the farm bill budget .

4 .

in the absence of a further cr or appropriation by january 19 , a three - day government shutdown occurred through january 22 , when a fourth cr ( p.l .

115-120 ) extended the cr to february 8 , 2018 .

5 .

in the absence of a further cr or appropriation by february 8 , an overnight government shutdown occurred during the early morning of february 9 , when a fifth cr ( p.l .

115-123 ) extended the cr to march 23 , 2018 .

this cr was part of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 that raised the budget caps for discretionary spending in fy2018 and fy2019 , provided disaster assistance for agriculture , amended several farm bill provisions , and extended sequestration effects .

on february 9 , 2018 , congress passed the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba ; p.l .

115-123 ) , which broadly authorized supplemental appropriations , including for crop and livestock losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires ( division b , subdivision 1 , title i ) .

the act also included a six - week cr through march 23 , 2018 ( division b , subdivision 3 ) .

importantly for the anticipated farm bill reauthorization , the bba revised several agriculture programs , which had long - term policy implications because it changed farm bill statutes ( division b , section 20101 ; and division f ) and added mandatory spending authority .

perhaps most importantly for completing the fy2018 appropriation , it raised the discretionary spending caps ( division c , title i ) that are in statute from the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) .

in supplemental appropriations , the bba added $3.6 billion of disaster assistance in fy2018 .

specifically , it provided $2.36 billion of block grants to the states for losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires .

it added $941 million for conservation and watershed recovery , $165 million for rural water and wastewater recovery , and $89 million for disasters in six other usda accounts .

for the expected successor to the current farm bill , the bba added $1.4 billion of mandatory funding to the 10-year baseline .

specifically , it added $1.1 billion for dairy programs , $240 million for permanent disaster assistance programs , and a $62 million net addition for cotton .

the cotton addition is nearly $3 billion from adding seed cotton to the farm commodity programs , offset by about $2.9 billion in reductions from reallocating base acres and crop insurance .

a version of these changes was in the senate appropriations markup , section 728 of s. 1603 .

the bba offsets some of these additions by extending sequestration on mandatory accounts under the bca ( appendix a ) for two more years , for fy2026 and fy2027 , at an estimated future effect on agriculture accounts of $2.6 billion .

raising the budget caps for overall discretionary spending — that were set by the bca — facilitated the development of a final full - year appropriation for fy2018 .

a majority in congress desired greater spending for at least some of the appropriations subcommittees .

for fy2018 , the bba raised the nondefense discretionary cap by $63 billion from $516 billion to $579 billion and for defense by $80 billion from $549 billion to $629 billion .

for fy2019 , it raised the nondefense discretionary cap by $68 billion and the defense cap by $85 billion .

on march 23 , 2018 , congress passed the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act ( h.r .

1625 ) .

the discretionary total of the agriculture portion ( division a ) is $23.3 billion , an increase of $2.1 billion above the enacted amount in fy2017 ( +10% , on a comparable basis that includes cftc ; table 2 ) .

the discretionary total is higher than in either the house - passed or senate - reported bills , as became possible under the bba , and is nearly as high as the peak in agriculture appropriations in fy2010 ( figure 3 ) .

the appropriations also carry nearly $123 billion of mandatory spending , though that total is largely determined in separate authorizing laws .

thus , the overall total of the enacted fy2018 agriculture appropriation is about $146 billion ( figure 2 ) .

compared to fy2017 , the enacted appropriation increases spending primarily through an extra $1.38 billion in general provisions , for programs that receive funding elsewhere in the appropriation .

amounts in general provisions may not be as likely to become part of the annual base for those programs .

for example , in addition to amounts for the rural utilities service elsewhere in the act , the general provisions provide an additional $500 million for rural water programs , and $600 million for expanding rural broadband .

the general provisions also provide an extra $116 million for food for peace foreign food aid , and $94 million for opioid enforcement and surveillance at fda ( table 3 ) .

in the regular portion of the appropriations for agencies , the consolidated appropriations act increases agricultural research spending by $138 million over four agencies ( including increasing the agriculture and food research initiative by $25 million to $400 million , and increasing buildings and facilities funding by $41 million for the agricultural research service ) .

it also increases the base amount for food for peace by $134 million to $1.6 billion .

unlike the practice from more than the past decade , the fy2018 agriculture appropriation does not impose as many changes to mandatory program spending ( chimps ) , such as to the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) , fresh fruit and vegetable program , or rescissions to the rural development cushion of credit account or to section 32 .

the absence of these usual chimps in the fy2018 agriculture appropriation costs about $740 million against the discretionary limit of the bill compared to fy2017 .

table 3 presents the amounts in the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act by agency and many programs , compared to the house - passed , senate - reported , and administration proposals .

it also compares the fy2018 appropriation to three prior years , fy2015-fy2017 .

appendix a .

budget sequestration sequestration is a process of automatic , largely across - the - board reductions that permanently cancel mandatory and / or discretionary budget authority .

sequestration is triggered as a budget enforcement mechanism when federal spending would exceed statutory budget goals .

sequestration is currently authorized in the bca ( p.l .

112-25 ) for discretionary spending through fy2021 and for mandatory spending through fy2027 , as amended by subsequent acts and explained below .

besides fy2013 — when the timing of appropriations and the first year of sequestration resulted in triggering sequestration on discretionary spending — bipartisan budget acts in 2013 , 2015 , and 2018 ( p.l .

113-67 , p.l .

114-74 , and p.l .

115-123 , respectively ) have avoided sequestration on discretionary spending .

these acts raised the discretionary budget caps that were placed in statute by the bca and allowed congress to enact larger appropriations than were allowed under the bca .

sequestration , however , continues to apply to certain accounts of mandatory spending and is not avoided by the bipartisan budget acts ( table a - 1 ) .

the original fy2021 sunset on the sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended four times to pay for avoiding sequestration of discretionary spending in the near term or as a general budgetary offset for other bills: 1 .

congress extended the duration of mandatory sequestration by two years ( until fy2023 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2013 .

2 .

congress extended it by another year ( until fy2024 ) to maintain retirement benefits for certain military personnel ( p.l .

113-82 ) .

3 .

congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts another year ( until fy2025 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2015 .

4 .

congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts by another two years ( until fy2027 ) as an offset in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 division c , section 30101 ( c ) ) .

some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration .

the nutrition programs and the conservation reserve program are statutorily exempt , and some prior legal obligations in crop insurance and the farm commodity programs may be exempt as determined by omb .

generally speaking , the experience since fy2013 is that omb has ruled that most of crop insurance is exempt from sequestration , while the farm commodity programs , disaster assistance , and most conservation programs have been subject to it .

for example , under the 2014 farm bill , the first farm commodity program payments began to be paid in october 2015 , and usda indicated that they would be subject to the 6.8% reduction that was applicable to fy2016 .

thus , sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts continues in fy2018 .

nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts are reduced by a 6.6% sequestration rate and thus are paid at 93.4% of what they would have otherwise provided .

this results in a reduction of about $1.3 billion less than what would have been authorized from mandatory agriculture accounts in fy2018 .

table a - 1 shows the rates of sequestration that have been announced so far and the total amounts of budget authority that have been cancelled from accounts in the agriculture appropriations bill .

table a - 2 provides additional detail at the account level for sequestration on mandatory accounts within the jurisdiction of agriculture appropriations .
