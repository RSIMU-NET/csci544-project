pollution from excessive levels of phosphorus and other nutrients has long been recognized as a major contributor to the environmental degradation of the florida everglades ecosystem .

in 1988 , the federal government sued the state of florida and two of its state agencies , alleging that water released onto federal lands from agricultural sources contained elevated levels of phosphorus and other nutrients in violation of state water quality standards .

based on a 1992 consent decree settling this lawsuit , florida enacted the everglades forever act in 1994 .

this act required the state to establish a numeric limit for phosphorus by december 2003 ( i.e. , phosphorus criterion ) and required actions to comply with this limit by december 2006 .

several everglades - related lawsuits have since been filed by environmental , agricultural , and tribal stakeholders .

in spring 2003 , florida amended the 1994 act to create significant flexibility in deadlines for phosphorus mitigation , and in july 2003 , florida issued a rule establishing a limit for phosphorus and methods to measure compliance with that limit .

these new laws and the rule have generated controversy among several stakeholders in the restoration effort underway in the everglades and caused concern among some members of congress that the state may not meet the 2006 deadline for mitigating phosphorus .

this concern is reflected in the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations act ( p.l .

108-137 , signed into law december 1 , 2003 ) and the fy2004 interior and related agencies appropriations act ( p.l .

108-108 , signed into law november 10 , 2003 ) .

these laws condition fy2004 everglades funding based on florida meeting phosphorus mitigation and water quality standards by the 2006 deadline ( as specified in the consent decree and the efa ) and require federal agencies to determine whether florida is meeting the deadline .

if not , the laws state that congress may disapprove fy2004 funding for everglades restoration projects .

the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations act ( p.l .

108-137 ) , and fy2004 interior and related agencies appropriations act ( p.l .

108-108 ) , both include provisions related to phosphorus mitigation and water quality in the everglades .

both condition funding for everglades restoration on one or more reports that determine whether certain everglades waters meet water quality requirements as specified in the legislation .

deadline .

the provisions require federal agencies to determine whether florida is meeting the deadline , and if not , the provisions state that congress may disapprove fy2004 funding for some everglades restoration projects .

this florida state law , chapter 2003-12 , as amended ( hereafter referred to as the amended efa ) changes the everglades forever act of 1994 ( efa ; florida statutes â§373.4592 ) by authorizing a new plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the everglades , known as the "everglades protection area tributary basins conceptual plan for achieving long - term water quality goals final report" or long - term plan .

this report provides for a planning process to ensure that discharges of water into the everglades will comply with state water quality standards and that phosphorus levels in these waters will not alter the native everglades ecosystem .

in contrast to the efa , the new law contains provisions that appear to create flexibility in this goal .

for example , the long - term plan is to be implemented from 2003 to 2016 and is expected to "provide the best available phosphorus reduction technology" ( â§3 ( b ) ) .

further , the new law allows the long - term plan to be changed through adaptive management , which may lead to changes in the implementation of phosphorus reduction activities and an extension of any compliance deadlines .

the amended efa does contain provisions that suggest the december 2006 deadline for meeting the phosphorus criterion is expected to be met .

for example , the bill states that "by december 31 , 2006 , the department and the district shall take such action as may be necessary to implement the pre - 2006 projects and strategies of the long - term plan so that water delivered to the everglades protection area achieves in all parts of the everglades protection area state water quality standards , including the phosphorus criterion and moderating provisions" ( â§3 ( b ) ) .

note that this provision requires the implementation of projects and strategies by december 2006 to achieve the phosphorus criterion , but does not require the phosphorus criterion be met by 2006 .

the new law does not specify a particular date by which the phosphorus criterion must be met .

the long - term plan also specifies that a second 10-year phase ( 2017-2026 ) to reduce phosphorus may be necessary to achieve the plan objective .

the objective in the plan is to obtain , to the maximum extent practicable , a long - term geometric average phosphorus concentration in waters discharged to the everglades that is within the upper annual concentration limit of the criterion as calculated in the 2003 everglades consolidated report .

this mean has been defined by the florida department of environmental protection as 10 ppb over a 5-year period , with no single year going beyond 15 ppb .

phosphorus is one of the primary water pollutants in the everglades and is generally thought to be caused by natural leaching , urban runoff , and agricultural runoff from sugar plantations , vegetable farms , and livestock operations ( eg , from animal waste ) .

some researchers have also attributed phosphorus in the everglades to atmospheric deposition , but measurement techniques and values for this are highly uncertain .

the 2003 everglades consolidated report documents total phosphorus concentrations as being highest in the northern everglades ( waters flowing into lnwr and water conservation areas ; see figure 1 ) , and lowest in the southern everglades , where enp is located .

the report states that this is indicative of phosphorus - rich water in the canals that carry water from the everglades agricultural area , although urban runoff has also been identified as contributing phosphorus to the everglades .

in the everglades , as in other ecosystems , excessive levels of phosphorus and other nutrients lead to eutrophication .

eutrophication is a natural process that occurs when bodies of water experience an increase in the inflow of nutrients , including phosphorus , leading to an increase in organic matter ( eg , plants in the case of the everglades ) .

when plants begin to die and decompose , they consume dissolved oxygen from the water .

a rapid inflow of excessive nutrients can speed this process to an unnatural pace .

if dissolved oxygen levels fall substantially and rapidly , fish and aquatic plant populations will suffer .

eutrophication also favors plants that can use high levels of nutrients .

for example , excessive levels of phosphorus in the everglades is thought to be the primary factor behind the conversion of native sawgrass marshes and sloughs to vegetation stands dominated by cattails .

this shift in vegetation has resulted in less habitat for wading birds and other wildlife and reduced populations of several native plant species .

further , the rapid growth of cattails is partly responsible for clogging waterways and altering the hydrology in parts of the everglades .

the beginning of excessive phosphorus input into the everglades can be traced back to the 1940s , when several thousand acres of land were cleared and converted to agricultural production .

this clearing exposed soils , which began to erode and leach phosphorus into waterways that connected to the everglades .

production intensified after the cuban revolution in 1959 , as cuban exiles fled to florida and established sugar plantations .

by the mid - 1960s , florida sugar production had increased four - fold .

today , sugarcane production contributes two - thirds of the economic production of everglades agriculture , and uses nearly 80% of the crop land in the everglades agricultural area ( eaa ) .

 ( see figure 1 . ) .

sugar production contributes phosphorus to the ecosystem primarily through fertilizers and to a lesser extent through decomposition of plants .

fertilizers and plant decomposition are also the main causes of phosphorus leaching from vegetable production .

by the 1980s , the problem with phosphorus had gained visibility .

in 1988 , the federal government sued the south florida water management district ( sfwmd ) and the florida department of environmental regulation , alleging that these agencies were not enforcing state water quality standards in enp and the lnwr .

state water quality standards at the time included a narrative criterion stating that nutrient concentrations in water should not cause an imbalance in natural populations of aquatic flora and fauna .

after nearly three years of litigation , the parties reached a settlement in 1991 acknowledging that water entering lnwr did cause such an imbalance in violation of state water quality standards , and that water entering enp from the state water conservation areas also contained harmful levels of phosphorus .

the settlement outlined the steps florida would take to restore and maintain water quality , including: achieving specified interim phosphorus limits by 1997 and specified long - term phosphorus limits by 2002 ( later extended to 2006 ) in the enp and lnwr ; establishing stormwater treatment areas ( stas ) , which are large filtration marshes that would filter agricultural runoff from the eaa ; and establishing a regulatory permit program requiring farmers to use best management practices ( bmps ) to reduce agricultural run - off ( including phosphorus ) from the eaa .

the phosphorus limits established were different for lnwr and enp .

for example , by july 2002 , water in the shark river slough in eastern enp was supposed to meet phosphorus limits of less than 8 ppb ( in a wet year ) to less than 13 ppb ( in a dry year ) .

water in lnwr was expected to meet phosphorus limits of 7 ppb ( in a wet year ) to 17 ppb ( in a dry year ) by july 2002 .

as part of the phosphorus reduction strategy , stas and bmps were expected to limit phosphorus in waters flowing from the eaa into lnwr to a long - term average of 50 ppb .

this settlement agreement was entered as part of a consent decree in united states v. south florida water management district ( 847 f. supp .

1567 ) in 1992 .

litigation ensued after the consent decree was reached .

in 1994 , florida passed its efa in an attempt to end lawsuits and administrative appeals generated from the settlement agreement .

this act provided the current framework for restoration efforts in florida regarding water quality and phosphorus pollution .

it differed from the consent decree in two important ways: ( 1 ) it covered state everglades lands in addition to federal everglades lands , and ( 2 ) it established a deadline for meeting state water quality requirements by december 31 , 2006 .

the efa also acknowledged that waters entering the everglades contained an excessive level of phosphorus and provided for: ( 1 ) implementation of the everglades construction project through the construction of six stas ; ( 2 ) monitoring and research programs in the eaa ; ( 3 ) a mandate for the florida department of environmental protection ( dep ) to propose a numerical phosphorus criterion and adopt a rule by december 31 , 2003 , with a default criterion of 10 ppb if this is not achieved ; ( 4 ) creation of an agricultural privilege tax in the c - 139 basin ( agricultural area ) and eaa ; ( 5 ) the right of the sfwmd , to use funds from florida's preservation 2000 program to construct stas ; and ( 6 ) by december 31 , 2006 , the dep and the sfwmd must take the necessary actions to ensure that water delivered to the eaa achieves state water quality standards and the phosphorus criterion .

it also specified that the agricultural sector use bmps to lower phosphorus runoff .

phosphorus mitigation by agriculture in the everglades seems to be working .

some stakeholders point to this to justify added flexibility in reaching phosphorus mitigation goals .

due to bmps and stas , phosphorus loads in the everglades have been decreasing .

the 2004 draft everglades consolidated report by sfwmd states that the bmps and stas have reduced average total phosphorus discharges from the stormwater treatment areas to about 35 ppb of phosphorus ( with a potential range of 25-45 ppb ) , compared to the interim goal of 50 ppb established by the 1994 act .

the report also states that these practices removed more than 1,400 tons of phosphorus that otherwise would have entered the everglades .

in 2003 , the sfwmd governing board determined that meeting the deadlines in the original efa ( without integrating cerp projects with sfwmd projects ) would require actions in addition to the stas and bmps , many of which would be costlyâapproximately $700 millionâand possibly unnecessary once cerp components are in place .

the board decided instead to recommend flexibility in achieving the phosphorus criterion to allow sfwmd projects to be integrated with cerp projects .

based on these concerns and a review of the reduced phosphorus levels in water discharged into the everglades protection area , the board endorsed the everglades protection area tributary basins conceptual plan for achieving long - term water quality goals final report or long - term plan .

this plan recommends an initial phase from 2003-2016 for achieving the 10 ppb threshold for phosphorus and a second phase of 2017-2023 if needed .

the plan has three primary components , including ( 1 ) the implementation of structural and operational modifications to projects that aim to lower phosphorus levels in the everglades ( eg , stas ) by december 2006 ; ( 2 ) optimization of water quality performance and integration with cerp by december 2006 ; and ( 3 ) adaptive management and resulting modifications and improvements to enhance water quality after december 2006 .

this plan formed the basis for florida's amendments to the efa in may 2003 .
