the mission of hhs is to "enhance the health and well - being of americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound , sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine , public health , and social services. .

hhs is currently organized into 11 main agencies , called operating divisions ( listed below ) , which are responsible for administering a wide variety of health and human services programs , and conducting related research .

in addition , hhs has a number of staff divisions within the office of the secretary ( os ) .

these staff divisions fulfill a broad array of management , research , oversight , and emergency preparedness functions in support of the entire department .

hhs operating divisions eight of the hhs operating divisions are part of the u.s. public health service ( phs ) .

phs agencies have diverse missions in support of public health , including the provision of health care services and supports ( eg , ihs , hrsa , samhsa ) ; the advancement of health care quality and medical research ( eg , ahrq , nih ) ; the prevention and control of disease , injury , and environmental health hazards ( eg , cdc , atsdr ) ; and the regulation of food and drugs ( eg , fda ) .

the three remaining hhs operating divisionsâacf , acl , and cmsâare not phs agencies .

acf and acl largely administer human services programs focused on the well - being of vulnerable children , families , older americans , and individuals with disabilities .

cmsâwhich accounts for the largest share of the hhs budget by farâis responsible for administering medicare , medicaid , and the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , in addition to certain programs related to private health insurance .

 ( for a summary of each operating division's mission and links to agency resources related to the fy2021 budget request , see the appendix . ) .

the budget and accounting act of 1921 ( p.l .

67-13 ) , as amended , requires the president to submit an annual consolidated federal budget to congress at the beginning of each regular congressional session , not later than the first monday in february .

many of the proposals in the president's budget would require changes to laws that govern mandatory spending levels or policies , which are typically established on a multiyear or permanent basis .

discretionary spending , however , which is roughly one - third of the budget , is decided and controlled each fiscal year through the annual appropriations process .

while congress is ultimately not required to adopt the president's proposals or recommendations , the submission of the president's budget typically initiates the congressional budget process and informs congress of the president's recommended spending levels for agencies and programs .

the fy2021 president's budget request was submitted to congress on february 10 , 2020 .

less than two months before this , all 12 of the annual appropriations acts for fy2020 had been enacted into law on december 20 , 2019 .

the fy2020 funding levels shown in fy2021 president's budget materials generally reflect enacted annual levels , with limited exceptions .

the exceptions include cases in which full - year mandatory funds had not yet been provided for programs typically funded outside of the annual appropriations process ( eg , mandatory funding for the temporary assistance for needy families block grant or the community health center fund ) .

in such cases , the fy2021 president's budget generally uses estimated fy2020 funding levels based on annualized amounts provided in the most recent short - term funding extensions .

because some fy2020 amounts have not been finalized , this report generally refers to fy2020 funding levels as estimates , whereas amounts for earlier years are called actual or final .

in addition , amounts shown for fy2020 do not include supplemental appropriations or other spending effects resulting from coronavirus disease response measures that have been enacted since the fy2021 president's budget request was submitted .

under the president's budget request , hhs would spend an estimated $1.370 trillion in outlays in fy2021 ( see table 1 ) .

this is $48 billion ( +4% ) more than estimated hhs outlays in fy2020 and about $156 billion ( +13% ) more than actual hhs outlays in fy2019 .

historical estimates by the office of management and budget ( omb ) indicate that hhs has accounted for at least 20% of all federal outlays in each year since fy1995 .

most recently , omb estimated that hhs accounted for 27% of all federal outlays in fy2019 , and projects that it would account for 28% of outlays if all proposals in the president's budget request were enacted .

figure 2 displays proposed fy2021 hhs outlays by major program or spending category in the president's request .

as this figure shows , mandatory spending typically accounts for the vast majority of the hhs budget .

in fact , two mandatory spending programsâmedicare and medicaidâare expected to account for 86% of all estimated hhs spending in fy2021 .

medicare and medicaid are entitlement programs , meaning the federal government is required to make mandatory payments to individuals , states , or other entities based on criteria established in authorizing law .

this figure also shows that discretionary spending accounts for about 8% of estimated fy2021 hhs outlays in the president's request .

although discretionary spending represents a relatively small share of total hhs spending , the department nevertheless receives more discretionary funding than most federal departments .

according to omb data , hhs accounted for almost 8% of all discretionary budget authority across the government in fy2019 .

the department of defense was the only federal agency to account for a larger share of all discretionary budget authority in that year ( 50% ) .

 figure 3 provides a breakdown of the fy2021 hhs budget request by operating division .

when taking into account mandatory and discretionary budget authority ( i.e. , total budget authority ) , cms accounts for the largest share of the request: nearly $1.3 trillion .

the majority of the cms budget request would go toward mandatory spending programs , such as medicare and medicaid .

spending on medicare and medicaid is expected to increase from fy2020 levels under the president's request , both in terms of proposed law and current law estimates .

the request also includes a number of legislative proposals that would reduce spending on these programs ( relative to current law , but not the prior year ) if enacted .

when looking exclusively at discretionary budget authority ( as illustrated in figure 3 and detailed in table 3 ) , funding for cms is comparatively smaller , accounting for $3.7 billion of the hhs discretionary request .

discretionary cms funds primarily support program operations and federal administrative activities , though some funds also go toward efforts to reduce health care fraud and abuse .

the largest share of the hhs discretionary request would go to the phs agencies: roughly $64.8 billion in combined public health funding for fda , hrsa , ihs , cdc , atsdr , nih , and samhsa ( no funds would go to ahrq under the request ) .

nih would receive the largest amount of discretionary budget authority of any single hhs operating division: $37.7 billion .

this represents a decrease of roughly $2.6 billion ( - 6% ) from fy2020 .

all of the existing nih institutes and centers would receive a decrease under the request .

the majority of the proposed nih budget would support biomedical research performed by hospitals , medical schools , universities , and other research institutions around the country .

acf would receive the second - largest discretionary funding level among the hhs operating divisions: $20.2 billion .

this would represent a decrease of roughly $4.2 billion ( - 17% ) from fy2020 .

the majority of the discretionary acf request ( more than 80% ) would go to early childhood care and education programs , such as head start and the child care and development block grant .

as has been the case since fy2018 , the budget proposes to eliminate several acf programs , including the low income home energy assistance program ( liheap ) and the community services block grant ( csbg ) .

table 4 puts the fy2021 request for each hhs operating division and the office of the secretary into context , displaying it along with estimates of funding provided over the four prior fiscal years ( fy2017-fy2019 ) .

these totals are inclusive of both mandatory and discretionary funding .

the amounts in this table are shown in terms of budget authority ( ba ) and outlays .

ba is the authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or other financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures involving federal government funds .

outlays occur when funds are actually expended from the treasury ; they could be the result of either new budget authority enacted in the current fiscal year or unexpended budget authority that was enacted in previous fiscal years .

as a consequence , the ba and outlays in this table represent two different ways of accounting for the funding that is provided to each hhs agency through the federal budget process .

for example , table 4 shows $0 in fy2021 ba for ahrq because the president's budget proposes to eliminate this agency ; however , the table shows an estimated $299 million in fy2021 ahrq outlays , reflecting the expected expenditure of funds previously provided to the agency .

this appendix provides for each operating division a brief summary of its mission , the applicable appropriations bill , the fy2021 budget request level , and links to additional resources related to that request .
