t he budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) , which was signed into law on august 2 , 2011 , includes statutory limits on discretionary spending for fy2012-fy2021 , often referred to as "spending caps. .

there are currently separate annual limits for defense discretionary and nondefense discretionary spending .

 ( the defense category consists only of discretionary spending in budget function 050 , "national defense. .

the nondefense category includes discretionary spending in all other budget functions. ) .

each discretionary spending limit is enforced separately through sequestration .

discretionary spending that is provided for certain purposes is effectively exempt from the spending limits .

this means that when compliance with the discretionary spending limits is evaluated , these special types of spending are treated differently: adjustments .

the law specifies that spending for certain activities , such as responding to a national emergency or fighting terrorism , will receive special budgetary treatment .

this spending is most easily thought of as being exempt from , or an exception to , the spending limits .

formally , however , the bca states that the enactment of such spending allows for a subsequent upward adjustment of the discretionary limits to accommodate the spending .

as a result , these types of spending are referred to as "adjustments. .

 ( the reference here to "adjustments to the limits" should be distinguished from statutory changes that have been enacted since 2011 increasing the spending limits. ) .

these adjustments are not formally made until after the spending legislation has been enacted .

therefore , references to the discretionary spending limits typically refer to the spending limit level before the permitted adjustments have been included .

21 st century cures act spending exempt from the limits .

in addition to the adjustments specified in the bca , the 21 st century cures act ( division a of p.l .

114-255 ) , enacted on december 13 , 2016 , provided that a limited amount of appropriations for specified purposes ( at the national institutes for health and the food and drug administration and for certain grants to respond to the opioid crisis ) are to be subtracted from any cost estimate provided for the purpose of enforcing the discretionary spending limits .

as of the date of this report , the cures act is unique in providing a statutory exemption of this kind .

these adjustments and the cures act exemptions complicate conversations and information related to overall discretionary spending amounts .

when references are made to total discretionary spending , those figures may include spending that is provided under the adjustments authority as well as the cures act exemptions .

however , when references are made to the discretionary spending limits , typically they do not include the spending that occurs as part of the adjustments or the cures act exemptions .

more information is provided below on each adjustment and the cures act .

while the categories of spending described below are often thought of as being exempt from the spending limits , in fact the enactment of such spending allows for a subsequent upward adjustment of the discretionary limits to accommodate the spending .

for this reason , we refer to these categories of spending as "adjustments. .

permissible adjustments to the discretionary spending limits are specified in section 251 ( b ) of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( title ii of p.l .

99-177 ( 2 ) ) , unless otherwise noted .

the office of management and budget ( omb ) is responsible for evaluating compliance with the discretionary spending limits .

to provide transparency to the process of evaluating such compliance , omb is required to submit sequestration reports to congress .

in these reports , and in the president's annual budget submission , omb is required to calculate the permissible adjustments and to specify the discretionary spending limits for the fiscal year and each succeeding year .

the sections below provide more detailed information on the adjustments .

these adjustments vary greatly .

two adjustmentsâoverseas contingency operations ( oco ) and emergency spendingâhave made up the vast majority of the spending .

these adjustments are uncapped and can be used for broad purposes .

five other adjustments are capped and can be used for specific programs or purposes .

two additional adjustments address potential technical issues that can arise in enforcing the spending limits .

title i in division a of the 21 st century cures act ( p.l .

114-255 ) , enacted in december 2016 , authorized appropriations for programs and activities related to health care , research , and opioid abuse .

the act also established a distinctive budgetary mechanism related to certain authorizations that is different from the adjustments described above but has a similar effect .

specifically , the act established three accounts: the national institutes of health ( nih ) innovation account , the food and drug administration ( fda ) innovation account , and the account for the state response to the opioid crisis .

the act then transferred funds from the general fund of the treasury to these accounts and authorized those funds to be appropriated for specific dollar amounts in specific fiscal years .

those funds were not to be available for obligation until they were appropriated in appropriations acts each fiscal year .

the act further stated that when appropriations are enacted for such authorized activitiesâup to the authorized amount each fiscal yearâthose appropriations are to be subtracted from any cost estimate provided for the purpose of enforcing the discretionary spending limits .

this effectively exempts any spending provided for these activities between fy2017 and fy2026 from the spending caps .

specifically , the bill provides such exceptions for the accounts and amounts shown in below .

in each case , the exemptions apply only to the years included in the respective table .
