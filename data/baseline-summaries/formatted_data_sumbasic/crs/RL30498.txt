a bipartisan compromise bill to provide comprehensive immigration reform ( s. 1639 ) stalled in the senate on june 28 , 2007 , when the key cloture vote failed .

in terms of the h - 1b provisions , s. 1639 would increase the annual cap on h - 1b visas to 115,000 ( and potentially up to 180,000 ) .

it also draws on the labor market protections proposed in s. 1035 , the h - 1b and l - 1 visa fraud and abuse prevention act of 2007 .

other h - 1b bills include s. 1038 / h.r .

1930 , h.r .

1758 , s. 31 , s. 1397 , s. 1092 , s. 1351 , h.r .

2538 , and h.r .

3194 .

proponents of expanding h - 1b admissions argue that h - 1b workers are essential if the united states is to remain globally competitive and that employers should be free to hire the best people for the jobs .

they say that the education of students and retraining of the current workforce is a long - term approach , and they cannot wait to fill today's openings .

some point out that many mathematics , computer science , and engineering graduates of u.s. colleges and universities are foreign students and that we risk a "reverse brain drain" if that talent leaves the united states .

others assert that h - 1b workers help create jobs , either by ultimately starting their own information technology firms or by providing a workforce sufficient for firms to remain in the united states .

proponents of the increase also cite media accounts of information technology workers from india who prefer to work for companies in india and warn that the work will move abroad if action to increase h - 1b visas is not taken .

those opposing any further increases assert that there is no compelling evidence of a labor shortage in these professional areas that cannot be met by newly graduating students and by retraining the existing u.s. work force .

they argue that the education of u.s. students and training of u.s. workers should be prioritized .

opponents also maintain that salaries and compensation would be rising if there is a labor shortage and if employers wanted to attract qualified u.s. workers .

critics draw on an investigation of lca applications in 2005 , which reported that many employers were paying h - 1b visa holders below the median prevailing wage for the corresponding occupation and location .

some allege that employers prefer h - 1b workers because they are less demanding in terms of wages and working conditions .

others express concern that an industry's dependence on temporary foreign workers may inadvertently lead the brightest u.s. students to seek positions in fields offering more stable and lucrative careers .

many opposed to an increase in h - 1b visas cite the gao reports that document abuses of h - 1b visas and recommend additional controls to protect u.s. workers .

alternatively , some maintain that the h - 1b ceiling is arbitrary and would not be necessary if more stringent protections for u.s. workers were enacted .

they argue the question is not "how many" but "under what conditions. .

some would strengthen the anti - fraud provisions and would broaden the recruitment requirements and layoff protections enacted in 1998 for "h - 1b dependent" employers to all employers hiring h - 1b workers .

others would reform the labor attestation and certification process and would make the labor market tests for nonimmigrant temporary workers comparable to those for immigrants applying for one of the permanent employment - based admissions categories to level the playing field .

gao has issued reports that recommended more controls to protect workers , to prevent abuses , and to streamline services in the issuing of h - 1b visas .

gao concluded that the dol has limited authority to question information on the labor attestation form and to initiate enforcement activities .

gao also concluded that the former ins's handling of h - 1b petitions had potential for abuses .

some would expand the investigative and enforcement authority of dol over h - 1b employers and would increase the penalties for employers violating the h - 1b provisions .

negotiators for the uruguay round agreements of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) , completed in 1994 and known as the general agreement on trade in services ( gats ) , included specific language on temporary professional workers .

this language references §101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( h ( i ) ( b ) of ina and commits the united states to admitting 65,000 h - 1b visa holders each year under the definition of h - 1b specified in gats .

some have expressed concerned that trade agreements include language on temporary professional workers that bars the united states from future statutory changes to h - 1b visas as well as other temporary business and worker nonimmigrant categories .

some assert that the office of the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) has overstepped its authority by negotiating immigration provisions in ftas and are voicing opposition to trade agreements that would prevent congress from subsequently revising immigration law on temporary professional nonimmigrants .

proponents of these trade agreements point out that they are merely reflecting current immigration law and policy .

they argue that the movement of people is subsumed under the broader category of "provision of services" and thus an inherent part of any free trade agreement .

such agreements on the flow of business people and workers , they maintain , are essential to u.s. economic growth and business vitality .

some concerns have been raised about the need to monitor h - 1bs workers , particularly those whose employment gives them access to controlled technologies ( i.e. , those that could be used to upgrade military capabilities ) .

gao found that 15,000 foreign nationals from countries of concern ( eg , china , india , iran , iraq , north korea , pakistan , sudan , and syria ) had changed their immigration status to an h - 1b visa in 2001 to obtain jobs that could have involved controlled technologies without the department of commerce screening and called for a reexamination of policies that give foreign nationals access to such technology .

supporters of the current policy maintain that safeguards which are more than adequate are already in place and point out that all foreign nationals who seek to enter the united states are screened for potential national security risks by both the department of state and the department of homeland security .

the legislation in the 110 th congress that would revise the h - 1b visas builds on over a decade of legislation action on this issue .

for a review of past legislation proposals and laws enacted , see appendix , "brief legislative history of h - 1b visa. .

s. 1348 , the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 ( offered by majority leader harry reid as a placeholder for floor debate on comprehensive immigration reform ) , would raise the statutory limit on h - 1b visas from 65,000 to 115,000 and would escalate this ceiling by 20% each year subsequent to a fiscal year when the numerical limits were reached .

the bill also would exempt h - 1bs who had earned an advanced degree from an accredited university in the united states from the statutory numerical limits , and the exemption for up to 20,000 h - 1b visas would change from aliens holding master's or higher degree from u.s. institutions to foreign institutions .

a bipartisan compromise bill to provide comprehensive immigration reform ( s. 1639 ) , which senators edward kennedy and arlen specter offered , was on the senate floor the week of june 25 .

s. 1639 includes a variety of revisions to the h - 1b provisions in the ina .

among other things , it would raise the fy2008 cap to 115,000 and provide that in subsequent years dhs may issue additional h - 1b visas up to a 180,000 cap .

it also would require the submission of w - 2 forms of the internal revenue service as part of the h - 1b renewal petition .

s. 1639 stalled in the senate on june 28 , 2007 , when the key cloture vote failed .

the h - 1b and l - 1 visa fraud and abuse prevention act of 2007 ( s. 1035 ) introduced by senators durbin and grassley aims to enhance labor market protections pertaining to h - 1b visas .

specifically , this bill would require that employers seeking to hire an h - 1b visa holder pledge that they have made a good - faith effort to hire u.s. workers first and that the h - 1b visa holder will not displace a u.s. worker .

s. 1035 would prohibit employers from hiring h - 1b employees who are then outsourced to other companies and would prohibit companies from hiring h - 1b employees if they employ more than 50 people and more than 50% of their employees are h - 1b visa holders .

moreover , s. 1035 would give dol authority to review employers' h - 1b applications for "clear indicators of fraud or misrepresentation of material fact" and would give dol more authority to conduct employer investigations .

s. 1639 draws on the labor market protections proposed in s. 1035 .

senator john cornyn and representative john shaddeg have introduced companion bills — s. 1038 / h.r .

1930 , the securing knowledge , innovation , and leadership act of 2007 .

this legislation would amend the ina to exempt from the annual h - 1b visa cap an alien who has ( 1 ) earned a master's or higher degree from an accredited u.s. university ; or ( 2 ) been awarded a medical specialty certification based on post - doctoral training and experience in the united states .

the bills further would increase the annual h - 1b cap , with an escalator clause that would provide a 20% increase for the following year if the previous year's ceiling is reached .

senator susan collins has introduced s. 31 , which would increase labor condition application penalties , provide h - 1b alien with whistle - blower protections , and require uscis to submit to congress a fraud risk assessment of the h - 1b visa program .

senator chuck hagel has introduced s. 1092 , the high - tech worker relief act of 2007 , which would amend the ina to increase the number of annual h - 1b for to 115,000 in fy2007 and 195,000 in fy2008 .

it also would eliminate the 20,000 annual cap on aliens with master's or higher degrees who can enter the united states without being subject to h - 1b visa limits .

senator judd gregg has introduced s. 1351 , the h - 1b visa program modernization act of 2007 , which would increase h - 1b visas to 150,00 in fy2008 with an escalator clause for subsequent years .

it would strengthen labor market protections for u.s. workers competing with potential h - 1b workers and would expand the investigative and enforcement authority of dol .

senator joseph lieberman has introduced the skilled worker immigration and fairness act ( s. 1397 ) , which would exempt from the h - 1b ceilings any alien who has earned a master's or higher degree in science , technology , engineering , or mathematics from an institution of higher education outside of the united states , or who has been awarded a medical specialty certification based on post - doctoral training and experience in the united states .

the bill would raise the annual limits to 115,000 for fy2007 and rely on a market - based calculation or the greater of 115,000 for each subsequent fiscal year .

the bill includes enforcement provisions that would address application fraud and misrepresentation , employer penalties , and dol investigations .

representative david wu has introduced h.r .

1758 , which would amend the ina to provide h - 1b visas in each of fy2008 through fy2012 for 65,000 to persons who have a master's or ph.d. degree and meet the requirements for such status .

the employers of these additional h - 1b workers would be required to make scholarship payments to institutions of higher education for undergraduate and postgraduate education .

representative bill pascrell has introduced the defend the american dream act of 2005 ( h.r .

2538 ) , which would require employers of h - 1b nonimmigrants to use one of three specified methods ( whichever results in the highest wages ) to determine wages for purposes of required wage attestations .

it further would require employers who previously employed one or more h - 1b nonimmigrants to submit with their labor condition application ( lca ) a copy of the w - 2 wage and tax statement filed with respect to those nonimmigrants .

among other provisions , it would extend to 180 days the period during which certain h - 1b employers must show nondisplacement of u.s. workers and require such employers to actively engage in recruitment efforts .

it would prohibit employers from outsourcing or otherwise contracting for the placement of an h - 1b nonimmigrant with another employer , regardless of whether the other employer is an h - 1b dependent employer .

in terms of the caps , it would eliminate the exemption from h - 1b numerical admission limitations for certain aliens with a u.s. master's or higher degree .

representative tom feeney has introduced h.r .

3194 , which seeks to improve the h - 1b nonimmigrant program by increasing the exchange of information between the departments of labor and homeland security .

when congress enacted the immigration and nationality act of 1952 , the h - 1 nonimmigrants were described as aliens of "distinguished merit and ability" who were filling positions that were temporary .

nonimmigrants on h - 1 visas had to maintain a foreign residence .

over the years , congress made a series of revisions to the h - 1 visa category and in 1989 , split the h - 1 visa into ( a ) and ( b ) .

the immigration act of 1990 ( p.l .

101-649 ) established the main features of h - 1b visa as it is known today .

foremost , §205 of p.l .

101-649 replaced "distinguished merit and ability" with the "specialty occupation" definition .

it added labor attestation requirements and the numerical limit of 65,000 on h - 1b visas issued annually .

it also dropped the foreign residence requirement and allowed for "dual intent" ( i.e. , an exception to the ina for h - 1b aliens to obtain an h - 1b visa simultaneous with seeking lpr status ) .

american competitiveness and workforce improvement act enacted as the 105 th congress drew to a close , title iv of the fy1999 omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act ( p.l .

105-277 ) raised the h - 1b ceiling by 142,500 over three years and contained provisions aimed at correcting some of the perceived abuses .

most importantly , the 1998 law added new attestation requirements for recruitment and lay - off protections , but only requires them of firms that are "h - 1b dependent" ( generally at least 15% of the workforce are h - 1bs ) .

all firms now have to offer h - 1bs benefits as well as wages comparable to their u.s. workers .

education and training for u.s. workers was to be funded by a $500 fee paid by the employer for each h - 1b worker hired .

the ceiling set by the new law was 115,000 in both fy1999 and fy2000 , 107,500 in fy2001 , and would revert back to 65,000 in fy2002 .

the house ( h.r .

3736 ) and the senate ( s. 1723 ) had offered proposals to raise the h - 1b ceiling for the next few years , though each bill approached the increase differently .

each bill would have added whistle blower protections for individuals who report violations of the h - 1b program and would have increased the penalties for willful violations of the h - 1b program .

many considered the provisions aimed at protecting u.s. workers as the most controversial in h.r .

3736 as it was reported by the house judiciary committee .

while s. 1723 as passed by the senate did add provisions penalizing firms that lay off u.s. workers and replace them with h - 1b workers if the firms have violated other attestation requirements , amendments that would have required prospective h - 1b employers to attest that they were not laying off u.s. workers and that they tried to recruit u.s. workers failed on the senate floor .

h.r .

3736 as reported included lay - off protection and recruiting requirement provisions similar to those that the senate rejected .

on the other hand , s. 1723 included language that would have expanded the education and training of u.s. students and workers in the math , science , engineering and information technology fields .

pre - conference discussions between senate and house republicans late in july 1998 yielded a compromise on key points of difference , but it did not address all the clinton administration's concerns regarding the education and training of u.s. workers and reform of the existing program .

after a presidential veto threat of the republican compromise , republicans began working out a compromise with the white house , and this language passed as the substitute when h.r .

3736 came to the house floor on september 24 , 1998 .

the house - passed language was then folded into p.l .

105-277 .

american competitiveness in the twenty - first century act on october 3 , 2000 , both chambers of congress passed the american competitiveness in the twenty - first century act of 2000 ( s. 2045 ) with bipartisan support , and president clinton signed the new law ( p.l .

106-313 ) on october 17 .

the senate had debated the legislation for several days , though much of the debate centered on procedural issues — specifically whether amendments that would legalize certain aliens ( mostly central americans and liberians ) would be permitted .

the house passed s. 2045 under a suspension of the rules shortly after the senate passed it .

the language that passed was a substitute version offered by judiciary committee chairman orrin hatch with bipartisan support .

it includes many of the same features as the version of the bill reported earlier by the senate judiciary committee .

it raises the number of h - 1b visas by 297,500 over three years , fy2000-fy2002 .

specifically , it adds 80,000 new h - 1b visas for fy2000 , 87,500 visas for fy2001 , and 130,000 visas for fy2002 .

it also authorizes additional h - 1b visas for fy1999 to compensate for the excess inadvertently approved that year .

in addition , p.l .

106-313 excludes from the new ceiling all h - 1b nonimmigrants who work for universities and nonprofit research facilities .

a provision that would have exempted h - 1b nonimmigrants with at least a master's degree from the numerical limits was dropped from the final bill .

the new law also makes a major change in the law governing the permanent admission of immigrants by eliminating the per - country ceilings for employment - based immigrants .

it also has provisions that facilitate the portability of h - 1b status for those already here lawfully and requires a study of the "digital divide" on access to information technology .

the new law makes changes in the use of the h - 1b fees for education and training , notably earmarking a portion of dol training funds for skills that are in information technology shortage areas and adding to the nsf portion a k - 12 math , science and technology education grant program .

because s. 2045 originated in the senate , it did not contain revenue provisions .

separate legislation to increase the h - 1b fee from $500 to $1,000 ( p.l .

106-311 , h.r .

5362 ) passed the house on october 6 , the senate on october 10 , and was signed by president clinton on october 17 .

the conference agreement on the fy2001 commerce , justice , state appropriations bill ( h.r .

4942 , h.rept .

106-1005 ) includes a provision that would authorize another h - 1b fee that employers would pay for expedited servicing of the petitions .

prior to passage of s. 2045 , the house judiciary committee had been taking a somewhat different approach to the h - 1b issue .

after mark - up considerations for several days , the house judiciary committee had ordered chairman lamar smith's bill , the technology worker temporary relief act ( h.r .

4227 ) , reported with amendments on may 17 , 2000 .

h.r .

4227 would have eliminated the numerical limit on h - 1b visas for fy2000 and would have allowed for temporary increases ( i.e. , enabling employers to hire h - 1b workers outside of the numerical ceilings ) in fy2001 and fy2002 if certain conditions were met .

these conditions included demonstrating that there was a net increase from the previous year in the median wages ( including cash bonuses and similar compensation ) paid to the u.s. workers on the payroll .

h.r .

4227 also would have revised the requirements employers of h - 1b workers must meet , notably adding a $40,000 minimum salary and new reporting requirements .

like s. 2045 , universities , elementary and secondary schools , and nonprofit research facilities would have been exempt from most of these new requirements .

h.r .

4227 would have required all h - 1b employers to file w - 2 forms and add anti - fraud provisions ( including the requirement that the h - 1b have full - time employment ) funded by a $100 fee .

an additional $200 processing fee would also have been collected and allocated to ins and dol to expedite the processing of h - 1b petitions and attestations .

like s. 2045 , h.r .

4227 included provisions that would facilitate the portability of h - 1b status for those already here lawfully .

the bill also would have instructed the u.s. government accountability office ( formerly general accounting office , gao ) to study the recruitment measures — particularly among under - represented groups — and training efforts undertaken by employers .

the house judiciary committee issued the bill report ( h.rept .

106-692 ) on june 23 .

the house committee on education and the workforce considered the education and training provisions of the h - 1b statute and marked up legislation introduced by its chairman william goodling ( h.r .

4402 ) on may 10 , 2000 .

as reported on may 25 , 2000 ( h.rept .

106-642 ) , h.r .

4402 would have directed the secretary of labor to use 75% of the funding she receives from the h - 1b education and training fee account to provide training in the skilled shortage occupations related to specialty occupations ( as defined under ina's h - 1b provisions ) .

the bill would have transferred 25% of the funds from the fee account to the department of education to augment a student loan forgiveness program for teachers of mathematics , science , and reading .

representatives david dreier and zoe lofgren introduced h.r .

3983 , which would have added an additional 362,500 over fy2001-fy2003 .

specifically , it would have raised the ceiling by 200,000 for three years and would have set aside 60,000 visas annually through fy2003 for persons with master's degrees .

it would have required employers to file w - 2 forms with dol for each h - 1b worker employed .

like p.l .

106-313 , h.r .

3983 would have eliminated the per - country ceilings for permanent employment - based admissions .

it would have enabled employers to use internet recruiting to meet labor market recruitment requirements and would have established an internet web - based tracking system for immigration - related petitions .

like p.l .

106-311 , this bill would have increased the $500 fee for education and training to $1,000 , and it would have modified the scholarship and training program requirements , including the addition of student loan forgiveness in special cases .

representative sheila jackson - lee , the ranking member of the house judiciary immigration and claims subcommittee , introduced h.r .

4200 , which would have set the ceiling at 225,000 annually for fy2001-fy2003 , with the condition that it would have fallen back to 115,000 if the u.s. unemployment rate exceeds 5% and 65,000 if the unemployment rate exceeds 6% .

h.r .

4200 would have allocated 40% of the h - 1b visas in fy2000 to nonimmigrants who have at least attained master's degrees and would have increased that allocation to 50% in fy2001 and 60% in fy2002 ( with 10,000 set aside each year for persons with ph.d. degrees ) .

the bill also provided additional visas retroactively for those inadvertently issued in excess of the fy1999 ceiling .

it would have added a sliding fee scale based upon the size of the firm seeking h - 1b workers and would have revised the uses of the fees collected for education and training programs , including programs for children .

among other provisions , it further would have modified the attestation requirements of employers seeking to hire h - 1b workers .

house judiciary immigration and claims subcommittee chairman lamar smith had previously introduced h.r .

3814 , which would have added 45,000 h - 1b visas for fy2000 if the employer met certain conditions .

it would also have raised the fee to $1,000 for scholarships and training , with most of the revenue going to merit - based scholarships for students .

h.r .

3814 also included provisions for expedited processing of h - 1b petitions funded by a $250 fee and would have added anti - fraud provisions ( including the requirement that the h - 1b have full - time employment ) funded by a $100 fee .

it would have given the secretary of state responsibility for maintaining records on h - 1b nonimmigrants .

other bills pertaining to the h - 1b issues were introduced .

the new workers for economic growth act ( s. 1440 / h.r .

2698 ) introduced by senator phil gramm and representative dave dreier would have raised the ceiling of h - 1b admissions to 200,000 annually fy2000-fy2002 .

those h - 1b nonimmigrants who have at least a master's degree and earn at least $60,000 would not have counted toward the ceiling .

those who have at least a bachelor's degree and are employed by an institution of higher education would have been exempted from the attestation requirements as well as the ceiling .

senator john mccain introduced s. 1804 , which , among other initiatives , would have eliminated the h - 1b ceiling through fy2006 .

representative david wu introduced h.r .

3508 , which would have increased the ceiling by 65,000 annually through 2002 for those with master's or ph.d. degrees , provided the employers establish scholarship funds .

the bringing resources from academia to the industry of our nation act ( h.r .

2687 ) , introduced by representative zoe lofgren , would have created a new nonimmigrant visa category , referred to as "t" visas , for foreign students who have graduated from u.s. institutions with bachelor's degrees in mathematics , science or engineering and who are obtaining jobs earning at least $60,000 .

the helping improve technology education and competitiveness act ( s. 1645 ) , introduced by senator charles robb , also would have created a "t" nonimmigrant visa category for foreign students who have graduated from u.s. institutions with bachelor's degrees in mathematics , science , or engineering and who are obtaining jobs paying at least $60,000 .

more stringent than h.r .

2687 , s. 1645 included provisions aimed at protecting u.s. workers that are comparable to the provisions governing the h - 1b visa .

legislation in the 107 th congress several bills addressing the h - 1b numerical limits were introduced in the 107 th congress .

h.r .

2984 would have amended the ina to require the attorney general to ensure that only h - 1b visa holders who actually commence employment are counted toward the ceiling .

representative tom tancredo offered h.r .

3222 , which would have set the upper limit of h - 1b admissions at 65,000 and reduced it by 10,000 for each quarter percentage point by which the unemployment rate for the united states exceeded 6% .

emerging concerns of a shortage of nurses and other health care workers , however , prompted interest in the use of h - 1bs among health care professionals .

the senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration held hearings may 22 , 2001 , on "immigration policy: rural and urban health care needs. .

although the 107 th congress did not alter h - 1b admission levels , it did include provisions that allow h - 1b visa holders to remain in that status beyond the statutory time limits of their temporary visas if their employers had filed applications for them to become legal permanent residents .

conferees on the department of justice reauthorization act ( h.r .

2215 , h.rept .

107-685 ) included §11030a , which authorizes the attorney general to extend the stay in one - year increments for h - 1b nonimmigrants while their applications are pending .

on october 3 , 2002 , senator orrin hatch , ranking republican on the senate committee on the judiciary , introduced legislation ( s. 3051 ) with the expressed purpose of extending h - 1b status for aliens with lengthy adjudications , using language comparable to §11030a .

the conference report on h.r .

2215 passed the house september 26 , 2002 , and the senate october 3 , 2002 .

president bush signed the department of justice reauthorization act on november 2 , 2002 as p.l .

107-272 .

legislation in the 108 th congress free trade agreements the ustr's legislation implementing the chile and singapore ftas was introduced july 15 , 2003 , as s. 1416 / h.r .

2738 and s. 1417 / h.r .

2739 , respectively .

the house passed h.r .

2738 and h.r .

2739 on july 24 , 2003 , and the senate passed them on july 31 , 2003 ( p.l .

108-77 and p.l .

108-78 respectively ) .

title iv of each of these laws amends several sections of the immigration and nationality act ( ina , 8 u.s.c. ) .

foremost , the laws amend §101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( h ) of ina to carve out a portion of the h - 1b visas — designated as the h - 1b - 1 visa — for professional workers entering through the ftas .

in many ways the fta professional worker visa requirements parallel the h - 1b visa requirements , notably having similar educational requirements .

the h - 1b visa , however , specifies that the occupation require highly specialized knowledge , while the fta professional worker visa specifies that the occupation require only specialized knowledge .

the laws also amend §212 of ina to add a labor attestation requirement for employers bringing in potential fta professional worker nonimmigrants that is similar to the h - 1b labor attestation statutory requirements .

the additional attestation requirements for "h - 1b dependent employers" currently specified in §212 are not included in the labor attestation requirements for employers of the fta professional worker nonimmigrants .

s. 1416 / h.r .

2738 contains numerical limits of 1,400 new entries under the fta professional worker visa from chile , and s. 1417 / h.r .

2739 contains a limit of 5,400 for singapore .

the bills do not limit the number of times that an alien may renew the fta professional worker visa on an annual basis , unlike h - 1b workers , who are limited to a total of six years .

the bills count an fta professional worker against the h - 1b cap the first year he / she enters and again after the fifth year he / she seeks renewal .

although the foreign national holding the fta professional worker visa would remain a temporary resident who would only be permitted to work for any employer who had met the labor attestation requirements , the foreign national with a fta professional worker visa could legally remain in the united states indefinitely .

h - 1b reform on july 24 , 2003 , senator christopher dodd and representative nancy johnson introduced the usa jobs protection act of 2003 ( s. 1452 / h.r .

2849 ) , which would have made several changes to current law on h - 1b visas , as well as revised the l visa category .

in § 4 of s. 1452 / h.r .

2849 , the lay - off protection provisions in current law pertaining to h - 1b - dependent employers would have been broadened to cover all employers hiring h - 1b workers .

the lay - off protection period would have expanded from 90 days before and after hiring h - 1b workers to 180 days .

the bills also would have given dol the authority to initiate investigations of h - 1b employers if there is reasonable cause .
