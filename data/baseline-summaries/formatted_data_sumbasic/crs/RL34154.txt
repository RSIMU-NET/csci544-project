on june 18 , 2008 , the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-246 , the 2008 farm bill ) became law when the house and senate voted to override president bush's veto of h.r .

6124 .

enactment of the new law suspends the provisions of permanent law that would have taken effect without a new law .

what were the consequences of congress not having enacted a new farm bill before the end of fy2007 , the commonly reported expiration date of many of the provisions of the 2002 farm bill ? .

what might have happened if a new farm bill were not enacted in early 2008 ? .

would programs authorized by the expiring legislation have ceased to operate , or would they have continued under non - expiring provisions of permanent law ? .

where there is permanent law , would the design and funding have changed ? .

the 2002 omnibus farm bill ( p.l .

107-171 ) included a wide range of program authorities , some of which were mandatory and others discretionary .

mandatory , in this context , means that the authority to spend necessary funds is provided by statute .

this mandatory category includes the commodity support programs , export programs , some conservation programs , and food stamps .

discretionary programs are authorized , but annual funding is subject to congressionally approved appropriations .

discretionary programs in the farm bill include some conservation programs , federal farm loan programs , rural development programs , agricultural research , and some foreign food aid , among others .

in nearly all cases , a farm bill supersedes permanent authorizing law for a period of four to six years .

the farm bill is important because it may substantially change program design from what is in the permanent law , as is the case with commodity support programs .

typically , with regard to appropriated programs , the farm bill sets policy parameters and upper limits on program activity levels and appropriations authority .

without an extension , most appropriated programs ( also referred to as discretionary programs ) in the 2002 farm bill and some mandatory programs , such as food stamps , would have faced the prospect of not having statutory authority for the appropriations committees to provide funding in fy2008 and subsequent years .

the lack of authority to appropriate funds for authorized programs ( and even for some programs not authorized ) has not been a barrier for appropriations in past congresses .

the mandatory commodity support programs authorized in the 2002 farm bill cover the 2007 crops .

so , all subsidy obligations related to 2007 crop production are covered by the law , even if spending occurs in fy2008 .

for commodity support programs , there was little reason to enact a farm bill before the end of calendar year 2007 .

in fact , past farm bills generally have been enacted late in the year , after the end of the fiscal year .

the 1981 and 1985 farm bills were enacted in late december , and the 1990 farm bill was enacted in late november .

what was expected to be a 1995 farm bill was not enacted until april 4 , 1996 , another case of belated action .

even in that case , payments were made on the 1995 crops and farmers went ahead with planting operations for their 1996 crops .

policy officials and the agriculture community expected a 2007 farm bill to be enacted before the end of calendar year 2007 .

however , lack of new commodity support legislation before harvest in 2008 did little harm other than leaving producers of "covered commodities" uncertain about the size of payments they might receive .

the uncertainty about future policy could have affected some farmers' ability to acquire production loans from commercial lenders .

but even if congress had deemed a one - or two - year extension necessary for the commodity support programs beyond the 2007 crop year , that action likely could have waited until june 2008 , when winter wheat — the first of the 2008 crop year commodities — was harvested .

many of the usda conservation programs administered by the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) deal with evaluating the causes and severity of resource problems , developing physical and management systems to address the problems , and providing technical and financial assistance to farmers implementing preventive and remedial practices .

the cost of these programs largely relates to agency personnel who provide specialized technical training , cost - sharing with farmers , and administrative overhead .

conservation program spending recently has averaged about $5 billion annually .

while most of the larger conservation programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill and would have expired the end of fy2007 , several mostly older programs , with total spending about $1 billion , are permanently authorized and appropriations committees are to provide such sums as necessary to meet program needs .

thus , there is no constraint on appropriators in future years .

as with most appropriated ( discretionary ) programs , funding depends heavily on budget requests from the administering executive agency .

so , the future of these programs , short of a change in the permanent authorizing law , largely is in the hands of the appropriators .

these programs are listed at the top of table 2 .

the food security act of 1985 ( p.l .

99-198 ) and subsequent amendments have become the legal foundation for another set of programs that now account for almost $4 billion , 80% of usda conservation spending .

most of these programs are administered by nrcs , while the largest ( the conservation reserve program ( crp ) ) is administered by usda's farm service agency ( fsa ) , with support from nrcs .

the original authorizing legislation expired in 1990 , but has been extended and amended by periodic farm bills .

many of these programs were extended by the 2002 farm bill and most of the programs expired september 30 , 2007 .

however , the temporary farm bill extensions continued these programs .

the absence of new mandatory program authority likely would mean that no new contracts could be signed with farmers .

all existing contracts would stay in force for their specified lives , and payments would continue to be made on the existing contracts .

three mandatory conservation programs were funded at specific levels by the temporary extensions — the farmland protection program ( $97 million ) , the wildlife habitat incentives program ( $85 million ) , and the ground and surface water conservation program ( $60 million ) .

also , two programs , the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) and the conservation security program ( csp ) , have been extended in earlier legislation to fy2010 and fy2011 , respectively .

the mandatory conservation programs are listed in the bottom half of table 2 , with their temporary expiration dates .

at the end of fy2007 ( and with no enacted farm bill to extend them ) , a number of authorities in domestic food assistance laws expired .

they effectively were extended by a series of appropriations actions and temporary farm bill extensions .

because the appropriations act provided funding for all domestic food assistance programs through the end of fy2008 , most programs ( and the terms and conditions under which they operate ) would have been unaffected if temporary extensions expired without new legislation .

however , some provisions of domestic food assistance law would have terminated .

without some action , authority to continue to pay out nutrition assistance grants to puerto rico and american samoa ( totaling some $1.6 billion for fy2008 ) would have terminated without a temporary extension .

provisions allowing usda to reduce , by just under $200 million a year , states' regular federal matching payments for food stamp administrative costs also would have terminated without a temporary extension .

this authority is intended to adjust for administrative costs shared with other federally supported public assistance programs .

other , less significant authorities that would have been affected include: continuation of several food stamp pilot projects in which elderly or disabled recipients receive cash benefits , $5 million in grants for simplified application projects , $5 million in grants for community food projects , directive for minimum , per - case administrative cost payments for commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) projects , provisions regarding the amounts of cheese and nonfat dry milk to be provided to the csfp , and provisions regarding contracting with private companies to process usda - donated commodities .

several agricultural trade and international food aid programs were subject to expiration unless a new farm bill was enacted .

in fact , a short - term expiration occurred between may 22 , 2008 , and june 18 , 2008 — that is , the period between enactment of the 2008 farm bill without title iii ( p.l .

110-234 ) and enactment of the version with title iii ( p.l .

110-246 ) .

these trade programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill to receive mandatory funding .

the programs in question regarding expiration were export credit guarantees , export credit guarantees for emerging markets , facilities credit guarantees , export market promotion , general export and dairy export subsidies , and technical assistance for specialty crops .

authority to carry out international emergency and non - emergency food aid programs is provided by p.l .

480 , the agricultural trade development and assistance act .

several authorities in p.l .

480 expired without a temporary extension or a new farm bill .

these include the authorization of minimum volumes of commodity assistance under title ii ( title ii of p.l .

480 , emergency and private assistance ) , the authority to finance sales ( title i ) or enter into agreements to provide commodities for emergencies or development projects ( title ii ) , and the authority to carry out p.l .

480-financed agricultural technical assistance in sub - saharan african and caribbean countries .

authority to replenish stocks of the bill emerson humanitarian trust , a reserve of commodities and cash used to meet unanticipated food aid needs , also expired without temporary extension .

most rural development loan and grant programs are authorized through permanent law and funded through annual appropriations , which were received for fy2008 in the consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

however , several mandatory rural development programs were newly authorized or extended by the 2002 farm bill .

these programs expired on september 30 , 2007 , and were not included in the temporary extensions: enhanced rural access to broadband technology program ; value - added product development grants program ; renewable and alternative energy systems grant program .
