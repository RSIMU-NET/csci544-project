the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments as well as numerous related agencies .

the bill typically contains three primary titles .

title i provides funding for most department of the interior ( doi ) agencies , many of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs .

title ii contains appropriations for the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .

title iii funds agencies in other departments , such as the forest service in the department of agriculture and the indian health service in the department of health and human services ; arts and cultural agencies , such as the smithsonian institution ; and various other entities .

title iii of the bill is referred to as "related agencies. .

neither the house nor the senate passed regular fy2015 appropriations for interior , environment , and related agencies before the start of the fiscal year on october 1 , 2015 .

before that date , the house appropriations committee had reported h.r .

5171 , the department of the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations act , 2015 , containing fy2015 appropriations , and the chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on interior , environment , and related agencies had released a draft measure and accompanying explanatory statement .

neither measure had subsequent legislative action .

because regular fy2015 appropriations were not enacted prior to october 1 , 2015 , continuing appropriations were temporarily provided after that date .

under the continuing appropriations resolution , 2015 ( cr ) , agencies generally received funding at the fy2014 level minus an across - the - board reduction of 0.0554% .

funding was generally provided under the authority and conditions , and to the same extent and manner , as in fy2014 .

further , funding could not be used to initiate or resume projects or activities for which funding or authority was not provided for fy2014 .

the cr provided appropriations through december 11 , 2014 ; two subsequent laws extended continuing funding through december 17 , 2014 .

on december 16 , 2014 , regular fy2015 appropriations were enacted for interior , environment , and related agencies as part of p.l .

113-235 .

the law included total appropriations of $30.48 billion for these agencies , primarily in division f. this report provides a brief overview of fy2015 appropriations levels .

it first addresses the appropriations requested by the president for fy2015 for agencies in the bill and compares the requested appropriations with fy2014 enacted appropriations .

it next discusses the fy2015 appropriations contained in h.r .

5171 as reported by the house appropriations committee and the appropriations recommended in the senate interior subcommittee draft .

it then summarizes the components of the fy2015 enacted appropriations and compares the fy2015 enacted level with funding enacted for the prior five years ( fy2010-fy2014 ) and recommended for fy2015 .

appropriations are complex .

for example , the budget requests for some agencies are large , numbering several hundred pages and containing numerous funding , programmatic , and legislative changes for congressional consideration .

further , appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts , activities , and subactivities , and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information .

this report does not provide account - and subaccount - level information .

further , it does not discuss agency highlights under the president's request , the house committee - reported bill , the senate interior subcommittee draft , or the fy2015 appropriations law , such as increases , decreases , budgetary reorganizations , and legislative changes .

appropriations enacted for interior , environment , and related agencies over the prior five fiscal years ( fy2010-fy2014 ) peaked in fy2010 at $32.32 billion .

relative to fy2010 , fy2015 enacted appropriations decreased by $1.84 billion ( - 5.7% ) .

the overall decline can be attributed primarily to reduced appropriations for epa , which fell $2.15 billion ( - 20.9% ) .

the appropriations for doi agencies and related agencies have increased since fy2010 â€” by $43.7 million ( 0.4% ) for doi and $277.1 million ( 2.5% ) for related agencies .

with the exception of fy2010 , fy2015 appropriations were higher than the appropriations enacted for each of the fiscal years during the five - year period .

for instance , relative to fy2011 total appropriations of $29.61 billion , the fy2015 level was an increase of $867.0 million ( 2.9% ) .

most recently , the fy2015 appropriations level was $358.0 million ( 1.2% ) higher than the fy2014 appropriations level .

fy2015 appropriations also were higher than the fy2015 appropriations in h.r .

5171 as reported by the house appropriations committee ( by $196.0 million , 0.6% ) .

however , fy2015 enacted appropriations were lower than requested by the president for fy2015 ( by $212.9 million , - 0.7% ) and recommended in the senate interior subcommittee draft ( by $228.0 million , - 0.7% ) .
