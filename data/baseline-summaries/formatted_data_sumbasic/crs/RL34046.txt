on december 26 , 2007 , the president signed the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( h.r .

2764 ) , into law ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

this act incorporated 11 of the 12 fy2008 appropriations bills ; the transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies appropriations act , 2008 , was included as division k of the act .

the thud appropriations act provided $103.6 billion ( after rescissions and other adjustments ) in total budgetary resources , $4.0 billion more than the fy2007 level .

dot received $65.5 billion , an increase of $2.3 billion over fy2007 .

hud received $37.6 billion , $1.4 billion over the fy2007 level .

in an exchange of amendments between the senate and the house , congress converted the state , foreign operations , and related agencies appropriations bill , 2008 , into the consolidated appropriations bill , 2008 , and completed action on the new bill during december 17-19 , 2007 .

prior to that , on november 14 , 2007 , the conference committee on the fy2008 thud appropriations bill ( h.r .

3074 ) had reported a conference agreement ( h.rept .

110-446 ) on november 13 , 2007 , and the house had approved the agreement on november 14 , 2007 .

the conference agreement recommended $105.8 billion ( after rescissions and other adjustments ) , $6.2 billion more than the fy2007 enacted funding level , and $5.5 billion over the administration's budget request .

the president threatened to veto the bill for exceeding the requested funding level .

the senate did not take up the agreement .

during the period between the beginning of fy2008 ( october 1 , 2007 ) and the signing of the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , congress provided funding through a series continuing resolutions , generally at fy2007 funding levels .

on september 12 , 2007 , the senate passed h.r .

3074 , which provides $105.9 billion ( after rescissions and other adjustments ) for transportation and housing and urban development appropriations for fy2008 .

the senate committee on appropriations had reported a draft of the legislation ( in the form of s. 1789 ) on july 16 , 2007 .

the committee recommended a total of $104.7 billion ( after rescissions and other adjustments ) ; $1.2 billion was added to the bill during deliberations on the senate floor for highway bridge repair and replacement , in response to concerns about the integrity of bridges raised by the collapse of an interstate highway bridge in minnesota on august 1 , 2007 .

this is $5.9 billion ( 6% ) more than the comparable amount for fy2007 , and $5.6 billion ( 6% ) more than requested for fy2008 .

on july 24 , 2007 , the house passed h.r .

3074 , which provides $104.4 billion ( after rescissions and other adjustments ) in thud appropriations for fy2008 .

this is $4.4 billion ( 4% ) more than the comparable amount provided for fy2007 , and $4.1 billion ( 4% ) more than requested for fy2008 .

on february 5 , 2007 , president bush released his fy2008 budget request , 10 days before the congress finished work on the fy2007 spending bills by enacting a revised year - long continuing resolution ( p.l .

110-5 ) .

the fy2007 cr funded most hud programs at their fy2006 level , but with decreases for some programs and increases for other programs .

the cr provided hud with more than $36.6 billion for fy2007 .

the 110 th congress also enacted a fy2007 supplemental funding bill , the u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability act ( p.l .

110-28 ) , which contained several provisions that made changes within the fy2007 funding levels for hud programs .

 ( for more details , see crs report rl33344 , the department of housing and urban development: fy2007 budget , by [author name scrubbed] et al. ) .

the president's fy2008 budget requested about a billion - dollar decrease in funding for hud .

although the budget called for increased funding for programs for the homeless , persons with aids , and first - time homebuyers , several programs were targeted for elimination ( hope vi , rural housing and economic development , brownfields redevelopment , and section 108 loan guarantees ) or funding cuts ( section 202 housing for the elderly , section 811 housing for the disabled , the community development block grant ( cdbg ) program , lead hazard reduction , fair housing programs , and the public housing capital fund ) .

the fy2008 funding debate was also influenced by the ongoing decline in receipts from the federal housing administration ( fha ) available to offset the cost of the budget .

for fy2007 , it was estimated that fha would generate a net surplus of more than $650 million that could offset the cost of the hud budget ; for fy2008 , the amount was estimated to be about $250 million , although legislative proposals were offered to increase the amount .

 ( for a more detailed discussion , see crs report rl34022 , the department of housing and urban development: fy2008 appropriations , by [author name scrubbed] et al. ) .

on july 11 , 2007 , the house appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2008 departments of transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies appropriations act ( thud ) funding bill ( h.r .

3074 ) .

the following day , the senate appropriations committee approved its version ( s. 1789 ) .

both bills would have increased funding above the president's request for a number of hud programs , including section 8 tenant - based rental assistance , housing for the elderly and housing for the disabled , and cdbg .

both bills also would have provided funding for all programs that were slated for elimination in the president's budget .

on july 24 , 2007 , the house approved h.r .

3074 .

several floor amendments were adopted that would have made administrative changes to hud programs , but only one amendment changed funding levels , by transferring $6.76 million to housing counseling assistance from hud's inspector general account .

on september 11 , 2007 , the senate began consideration of its version of h.r .

3074 after substituting the content with the language of s. 1789 .

on september 12 , 2007 , the senate approved the legislation after adopting several housing - related amendments , including: set - aside of $100 million in the home account to fund foreclosure prevention activities ; transfer of $380,000 from hud's salaries and expenses account to the fair housing account in order to fund the creation and promotion of translated materials to help in serving persons with limited english proficiency ; a set - aside of $25 million in the home account to fund the american dream downpayment initiative ; and a transfer of $2.4 million from the working capital fund to the research and technology account to provide additional funding for tribal colleges and universities .

on november 8 , 2007 , house and senate conferees agreed to a fy2008 thud funding bill .

the total for hud in the conference agreement ( h.rept .

110-446 ) was lower than the house and senate - passed levels , but higher than the president's request .

the agreement was reported on november 13 , 2007 , and was approved by the house on november 14 , 2007 .

according to a statement of administration policy released by the office of management and budget , the president intended to veto the bill , since its funding level was above his request .

the full senate never considered the conference agreement .

on december 19 , 2007 , congress enacted the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( attached to h.r .

2764 ) , to fund most of the federal government , including hud , for the remainder of the fiscal year .

the overall hud funding level provided in the consolidated appropriations act is less than originally approved by the house , senate , or house - senate conference committee , but is about $2 billion higher than the president's request .

it funds most hud programs at the levels provided in the conference agreement ( h.rept .

110-446 ) , although it reduces funding for some programs , including the hope vi program , the home program , and the community development block grant program .

it also reduces funding for hud's research and technology , working capital , and management expenses accounts .

additionally , the bill contains a rescission of $723 million in advance appropriations for the section 8 voucher program .

the bill was signed into law by the president on december 26 , 2007 ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

the president's budget requested $16 billion for tenant - based rental assistance , a slight increase over the $15.9 billion enacted for fy2007 .

h.r .

3074 , as passed by the house , would have provided $16.3 billion .

the senate - passed version of the bill would have increased funding for tenant - based rental assistance to $16.6 billion .

the conference agreement would have funded the account between the house - and senate - passed levels , at $16.4 billion .

p.l .

110-161 funded tenant - based rental assistance just below the conference agreement level , but also included a rescission of $723 million , leaving the total amount available for the account at $15.6 billion .

the majority of tenant - based rental assistance funding is dedicated to voucher renewals .

since fy2004 , congress has made changes each year in how hud is to distribute voucher renewal funding to public housing authorities ( phas ) .

for example , the fy2007 cr did not adopt the same allocation formula that was in place in fy2006 .

in fy2006 , phas were funded based on what they had received in fy2005 , with some adjustments .

for fy2007 , congress directed hud to fund phas based on their actual leasing and costs from the previous 12 months , with some adjustments .

in his fy2008 budget , the president requested that phas receive renewal funding using a formula similar to the one in place in fy2006 .

the house - passed version of h.r .

3074 adopted a formula similar to the one requested by the president .

the committee report ( h.rept .

110-38 ) noted that the committee chose not to use updated data for allocating fy2008 funding because the committee wanted to give phas additional time to adjust to their fy2007 allocations before changing the formula again , since hud had delayed allocating fy2007 funding under the new formula .

the senate - passed bill would have allocated funding based on phas' most recent 12 months of leasing and cost data , with adjustments , similar to the formula used in the fy2007 cr .

the conference agreement would have used a formula similar to the one included in the senate version of the bill .

the final appropriations act , p.l .

110-161 , allocates renewal funding using a different formula from the house , senate , or house - senate conference agreement .

renewal funds will be allocated to phas based on their leasing and cost data from the prior year , plus inflation and other adjustments , and then reduced by the amount by which their unusable program reserves exceed 7% of their fy2007 funding allocation .

as noted earlier , p.l .

110-161 reduced the total funding for renewals with a rescission of $723 million , the amount estimated to be available in unusable agency reserves .

 ( for more information , see crs report rl33929 , recent changes to the section 8 voucher renewal funding formula , by [author name scrubbed] , and crs report rl34002 , section 8 housing choice voucher program: issues and reform proposals , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

prior to fy2008 , no new vouchers — called incremental vouchers — had been funded since fy2002 .

both the house and senate bills for fy2008 proposed funding for new incremental vouchers targeted to certain populations .

the house version of h.r .

3074 would have provided $30 million for incremental vouchers for certain non - elderly disabled families and homeless veterans .

the senate bill would have provided $105 million for incremental vouchers for homeless veterans and for families with children in the child welfare system or youth transitioning out of foster care .

the conference agreement would have provided $135 million for incremental vouchers for the same populations .

p.l .

110-161 provides $125 million for incremental vouchers for homeless veterans , families with children in the child welfare system or youth transitioning out of foster care , and non - elderly disabled families .

the president's fy2008 budget requested a $130 million increase in funding for the public housing operating fund .

in recent years , hud has not requested , and congress has not provided , sufficient appropriations to fund all phas at 100% of their operating fund formula eligibility .

instead , phas generally receive some percentage of their eligible budgets , referred to as the proration level .

the fy2007 cr provided $3.8 billion for the operating fund , which resulted in a proration of 83% .

for fy2008 , the president requested $4 billion ( $3.99 billion for formula grants ) , which is estimated to result in a proration level of just over 80% .

the fy2008 appropriations law ( p.l .

110-161 ) — as proposed in the house bill , senate bill , and their conference agreement — provides $200 million more than the president's request for the operating fund .

 ( for more information , see crs report rs22557 , public housing: fact sheet on the new operating fund formula , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

for fy2008 , the president requested $2 billion for the capital fund , a $400 million reduction from fy2007 funding .

the majority of the reduction would come from the formula grants that hud provides to phas to use to modernize their public housing .

both the house - and senate - passed bills would have increased funding above the president's requested level for the public housing capital fund .

the house bill would have funded the account at the fy2007 level ( $400 million above the president's request ) , and the senate bill would have provided almost $500 million above the president's request .

p.l .

110-161 — like the house - senate conference agreement — funds the account at the house - passed level .

for fy2008 , the president again requested that congress provide no new funds for the hope vi program , and that congress rescind the $99 million provided to the program in fy2007 .

p.l .

110-161 — like the house bill , senate bill , and the house - senate conference agreement — provides funding for the hope vi program and does not rescind fy2007 funding , as requested in the president's budget .

p.l .

110-161 funds the program at $100 million , which is less than the amount proposed in the house bill and house - senate conference agreement ( $120 million ) , but the same as proposed by the senate bill .

the president's fy2008 budget recommendation for the formula portion of the community development block grant ( cdbg ) program was approximately $3 billion , 20% less than the $3.7 billion appropriated for distribution to entitlement communities and states in fy2007 .

as approved by the house , h.r .

3074 would have provided $3.9 billion for cdbg formula grants .

the senate - passed version of h.r .

3074 would have funded cdbg formula grants at $3.7 billion .

the conference agreement would have provided $3.8 billion .

p.l .

110-161 funds cdbg at $3.6 billion , less than the amount proposed by the house , senate , or house - senate conference agreement .

in addition to the cdbg program , the community development fund account has also been used to fund other community development programs , including congressionally directed projects through the economic development initiatives ( edi ) and neighborhood initiatives ( ni ) programs .

the president's budget proposed eliminating funding for edis and nis , characterizing these programs as duplicative of the activities funded by the cdbg formula grant program .

both house and senate bills would have provided funding for edi and ni earmarks .

the house - passed version of h.r .

3074 recommended $160 million for edis and $20 million for nis ; the senate - passed version would have provided $248 million for edis and $40 million for nis .

the conference agreement would have provided $184 million for edis and $27 million for nis .

p.l .

110-161 provides slightly less than the conference agreement: $180 million for edis and $26 million for nis .

the administration's budget also proposed eliminating funding for several community development programs funded outside of the community development fund account , including brownfields redevelopment , section 108 loan guarantees , and rural housing and economic development grants .

the president's request for no new funding for these accounts was rejected in the house and senate bills , as well as the house - senate conference agreement and p.l .

110-161 .

the house bill would have funded section 108 loan guarantees at $3.7 million , brownfields redevelopment at $9.9 million and rural housing and economic development grants at the enacted level for fy2007 , $16.8 million .

the senate bill would have provided $6 million for section 108 loan guarantees , $10 million for brownfields redevelopment , and $17 million for rural housing and economic development .

p.l .

110-161 — as proposed in the house - senate conference agreement — provides $4.5 million for section 108 loan guarantees , $10 million for brownfields redevelopment , and $17 million for rural housing and economic development .

the president's budget for fy2008 proposed to increase funding for the homeless assistance grants by $144 million above the fy2007 level , to $1.586 billion .

however , $25 million of the fy2008 requested appropriation would have been transferred to the department of labor to fund a prisoner re - entry initiative under the president's request .

as in past years , the administration also proposed to consolidate the three competitive homeless assistance grants — the supportive housing program ( shp ) , the shelter plus care ( s+c ) program , and the section 8 moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy dwellings ( sro ) program — into one competitive grant .

as passed by the house , h.r .

3074 did not include the prisoner re - entry initiative , and instead proposed to fund the homeless programs at $25 million less than the president's request — $1.561 billion .

the senate - passed bill also did not fund the prisoner re - entry initiative ; however , it would have funded the homeless programs at $1.586 billion , the same level recommended by the president .

of that amount , $25 million would have funded a new demonstration program to rapidly rehouse homeless families living in shelters .

p.l .

110-161 — as proposed in the house - senate conference agreement — adopts the senate - passed funding level and includes funding for the demonstration program .

none of the funding bills considered by congress , including p.l .

110-161 , included the president's proposal to consolidate the competitive grants .

however , separate legislation introduced in both the house ( h.r .

840 ) and senate ( s. 1518 ) proposed to consolidate the programs .

 ( for more information about the distribution of the homeless assistance grants , see crs report rl33764 , the hud homeless assistance grants: distribution of funds , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

the president's fy2008 budget proposal for the section 202 housing for the elderly program would have reduced funding by almost $160 million ( nearly 29% ) from the fy2007 level , to $575 million .

the house - passed version of h.r .

3074 would have provided just under $735 million for elderly housing programs , while the senate - passed version would have provided exactly $735 million .

p.l .

110-161 — as proposed in the house - senate conference agreement — provides $735 million for the section 202 program .

 ( for more information , see crs report rl33508 , section 202 and other hud rental housing programs for low - income elderly residents , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

the president's fy2008 budget , like that for fy2007 , proposed to cut funding for the section 811 housing for the disabled program nearly in half .

in fy2007 , the program was funded at just under $237 million .

in fy2008 , the administration's budget requested $125 million for the section 811 housing for the disabled program .

the decrease would have resulted from the president's proposal to stop funding the capital grants component of the program and to only fund the rental voucher component of the program .

the house - passed bill would have provided funding at the fy2007 level ( just under $237 million ) ; the senate - passed bill , conference agreement , and p.l .

110-161 included $237 million for section 811 .

for fy2008 , the fha account was expected to generate $250 million in offsetting receipts , which is less than the amount of administrative expenses expected to be incurred by the account .

this is a significant change from a few years ago when the income to the insurance funds ( which was regularly in excess of $1 billion ) exceeded the costs and resulted in negative appropriations for fha .

this decline in offsetting receipts tracks fha's declining market share .

the president's fy2008 budget included three legislative proposals that it estimated would generate $362 million in budget savings .

the first proposal was to remove the aggregate limit on the number of home equity conversion mortgages ( hecms ) and set the loan limit for hecms at 100% of the conforming loan limits , rather than allowing them to vary by area .

the second proposal was to amend the national housing act to permit hud to increase the loan limits on the various multifamily housing programs by up to 170% on an area - by - area basis and by up to 215% on a project - by - project basis .

the third proposal was to increase the fee charged by the government national mortgage association ( ginnie mae ) for guaranteeing mortgage - backed securities by six basis points .

p.l .

110-161 — as proposed in the house bill , senate bill , and house - senate conference agreement — adopted only the first two proposals , but with larger estimates of savings ( $540 million , as shown under the heading legislative proposals in table 5 ) .

the president's budget also proposed to move several accounts from the general insurance / special risk insurance fund to the mutual mortgage insurance fund .

none of the appropriations bills considered by congress , including p.l .

110-161 , adopted the president's proposed transfer .
