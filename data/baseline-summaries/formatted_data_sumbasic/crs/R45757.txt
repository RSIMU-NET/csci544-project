this report provides background information and potential issues for congress for three types of large unmanned vehicles ( uvs ) that the navy wants to develop and procure in fy2021 and beyond: large unmanned surface vehicles ( lusvs ) ; medium unmanned surface vehicles ( musvs ) ; and extra - large unmanned undersea vehicles ( xluuvs ) .

the navy wants to acquire these large uvs as part of an effort to shift the navy to a new fleet architecture ( i.e. , a new combination of ships and other platforms ) that is more widely distributed than the navy's current fleet architecture .

the navy is requesting $579.9 million in fy2021 research and development funding for these large uvs and their enabling technologies .

the issue for congress is whether to approve , reject , or modify the navy's acquisition strategies and fy2021 funding requests for these large uvs .

the navy's proposals for developing and procuring them pose a number of oversight issues for congress .

congress's decisions on these issues could substantially affect navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding and uv industrial bases .

in addition to the large uvs covered in this report , the navy also wants to develop and procure smaller usvs and uuvs , as well as unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) of various sizes .

other u.s. military services are developing , procuring , and operating their own types of uvs .

separate crs reports address some of these efforts .

the navy's proposals for developing and procuring the large uvs covered in this report pose a number of oversight issues for congress , including those discussed below .

 table 2 summarizes congressional action on the navy's fy2021 funding request for the lusv , musv , and xluuv programs and their enabling technologies .
