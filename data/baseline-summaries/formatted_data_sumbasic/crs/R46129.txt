f ollowing his resignation as president , richard nixon wanted to destroy recordings created in the white house that , among other things , documented actions he and others took in response to investigations connected to a burglary in the watergate building and his reelection campaign .

under policy at the time , presidential materials were considered the president's private property .

in response , congress passed a number of laws to preserve the integrity of documents and other information related to nixon's presidency and made those laws applicable to all future presidencies .

enacted in 1978 , the presidential records act ( pra ; 44 u.s.c .

â§â§2201-2207 ) established public ownership of records created by presidents and their staff in the course of discharging their official duties .

the pra additionally established procedures for congressional and public access to presidential and vice presidential information and the preservation and public availability of such records at the conclusion of a presidency .

this report provides context on the institutions involved in presidential recordkeeping , explains what is and is not considered to be a presidential record , and identifies recordkeeping responsibilities and access policies during and after a presidency .

the report concludes with information and policy options for congressional oversight and enforcement of the pra with respect to electronic records provisions under the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 .

while the pra provides similar provisions for records created by the vice president , this report focuses on presidential records .

also , information on the federal records act ( fra ) , more broadly , is available in crs reports crs report r43072 , common questions about federal records and related agency requirements , by meghan m. stuessy and crs in focus if11119 , federal records: types and treatments , by meghan m. stuessy .

the pra governs the records of the president , vice president , and certain components of the executive office of the president ( eop ) .

the pra specifies roles and responsibilities for the management and enforcement of presidential records policy to the president , the national archives and records administration ( nara ) , and the department of justice ( doj ) .

the pra requires the president to take "all such steps as may be necessary to assure that the activities , deliberations , decisions , and policies that reflect the performance of the president's constitutional , statutory , or other official or ceremonial duties are adequately documented. .

the president is further directed to implement records management controls to accomplish these ends and may consult nara and doj on how to best comply with the statute .

nara preserves selected government records , oversees recordkeeping throughout the government , and makes government records publicly available pursuant to the pra and other authorities .

nara provides advice and assistance to the white house on records management practices upon request , throughout a presidential transition and a presidency , and to former presidents .

the pra details which presidential records and materials nara is to assume responsibility for at the conclusion of a president's administration .

the pra requires the head of nara , the archivist of the united states , to consult with congress and particular congressional committees on requests for the disposal of such records deemed to be of special congressional interest .

doj provides guidance to the executive branch on how to comply with the legal requirements of government information policy , of which records maintenance policy , including presidential records , is a part .

additionally , the archivist and the attorney general jointly investigate the unlawful removal or destruction of government and presidential records .

the pra defines presidential records as documentary materials , or any reasonably segregable portion thereof , created or received by the president , the president's immediate staff , or a unit or individual of the executive office of the president whose function is to advise or assist the president , in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional , statutory , or other official or ceremonial duties of the president .

such termâ ( a ) includes any documentary materials relating to the political activities of the president or members of the president's staff , but only if such activities relate to or have a direct effect upon the carrying out of constitutional , statutory , or other official or ceremonial duties of the president .

this definition of presidential records is distinct from federal records and excludes a president's personal records .

unlike federal records , which may be considered temporary or permanent records depending on their content , all presidential records are considered permanent records due to their permanent value and , as a result , should be maintained in perpetuity by the federal government , subject to some limitations described below .

a president's personal recordsâidentified in the pra as documents "of a purely private or nonpublic character"âare excluded from preservation requirements .

as a result of the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 , all government records ( both presidential and federal ) are assessed for preservation not by the media used to store the information but rather by the content of the information itself .

in the pra's case , documentary materials , of which presidential records are a part , includes "all books , correspondence , memoranda , documents , papers , pamphlets , works of art , models , pictures , photographs , plats , maps , films , and motion pictures , including , but not limited to , audio and visual records , or other electronic or mechanical recordations , whether in analog , digital , or any other form. .

if the content of any documentary material meets the criteria of a presidential record , the information must be preserved according to the pra regardless of the information's format .

presidential records are additionally protected and restricted from public consumption for a set period of time .

because of these additional restrictions on presidential records versus federal records , it is important to identify which organizations within the eop create presidential records instead of federal records .

additionally , the time during a president's life in which the documents are created may help differentiate between personal , private records and presidential records .

policies concerning the custody of presidential materials informs the way such information is controlled , accessed , and released during and after a president's time in office .

prior to the pra's enactment , presidential papers were traditionally the private property of the president , who would then donate the materials to institutions for public consumption .

the pra fundamentally changed the status of presidential records as publicly owned materials .

the pra is explicit: "the united states shall reserve and retain complete ownership , possession , and control of presidential records ; and such records shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. .

in passing the pra , congress required that "public access to the materials would be consistent under standards fixed in law. .

the pra provides records maintenance requirements and permissions depending on whether a presidency is in progress or has concluded .

the pra's effectiveness relies on its ability to be enforced , both in terms of accessing presidential records for oversight purposes through the mechanisms described in statute and in terms of maintaining the records themselves so that they may be accessed .

in light of the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 requirement to collect presidential records regardless of their media but based on their content , questions regarding the volume and the meaning of an electronic record's completeness are creating policy implications that may be suitable for congressional consideration .

these matters may be of particular interest to congress as it carries out its oversight activities and ensures that emerging formats of presidential records are effectively collected and controlled .

the volume of presidential records has increased exponentially in the digital age , as indicated by reporting on the amount of such records at the conclusion of a presidency .

according to nara's 2009 report on alternative models for presidential libraries , the clinton administration provided nara 20 million presidential record emails at the conclusion of the president's eight - year tenure .

the george w. bush administration provided 150 million email records after its eight - year tenureâmore than seven times the number of emails provided by the previous administration .

to date , the barack obama presidential library estimates that nara has received 300 million emails , doubling the amount from the previous administration .

"huge volumes of electronic information" are a "major challenge" in record management , according to the government accountability office ( gao ) , and "electronic information is increasingly being created in volumes that pose a significant technical challenge to our ability to organize it and make it accessible. .

nara's ability to process the volume of presidential records is closely linked to information access issues .

in its fy2020 congressional budget justification , nara noted it has "a significant backlog of unanswered [foia] requests at presidential libraries covered" by the pra in part because of the volume of records and the information restriction process: nara must review all presidential papers page - by - page , to identify and redact national security and other restricted information , which means it will take decades to make all of the records available to the public .

processing records in response to foia requests is even more time - consuming than processing the same number of pages in a systematic , archival fashion and does not produce discrete records collections that would be meaningful to the general public .

because of this increased volume , nara's ability to keep pace with the explosion of records will be dependent on nara's staffing , funding , and training levels .

any delay in nara's processing of records may impact the ability of interested parties to access materials in a timely fashion , and nara's ability to comply with the pra's statutory directive to make records available as rapidly and completely as possible .

the increasing use of electronic records also requires the institutions involved in presidential records oversight to ensure the record information's authenticity and completeness .

the eop and nara need to ensure that record materials are appropriately protected from corruption or destruction , but these protections take on a different meaning in a digital , instead of analog , environment .

given the increase in presidential records , congress may consider whether or not the presidential records institutions are able to consistently meet nara directives , bearing in mind that while nara supervises agency implementation of the fra , nara provides advice and assistance to the white house on records management practices upon request .

nara has provided guidance on including metadata elements in the collection of federal records under the fra that the eop may adopt as well .

however , data on implementation is self - reported by agencies , and similar information is not required to be provided for presidential records on a routine basis .

last updated in 2005 , nara's guidance on identifying and maintaining trustworthy websites says that such records have the following characteristics: reliability: content is trusted as a full and accurate representation of transactions , activities , or facts ; authenticity: proven to be what it purports to be ; integrity: complete and unaltered ; and usability: can be located , retrieved , presented , and interpreted .

nara's guidance suggests that agencies "maintain the content , context , and sometimes the structure of" their websites to ensure that their records are trustworthy .

one instructive example is nara's attempts to archive underlying documents and web materials on whitehouse.gov .

while collecting records material appears to be a straightforward task , policy decisions such as when and what to collect impact the material's context ( i.e. , the circumstances that situate the material and give it meaning ) , usability , and completeness .

some accompanying digital information , such as who accessed the information or reviewed the document , may not be available without holistic preservation .

for example , nara acknowledges that it does not archive the user interface of the white house website , but it has attempted to "freeze" an approximation of the website as it appeared at the conclusion of a presidency and not at various points during an administration .

further , nara notes , "these 'frozen in time' sites are representations of the original websites and approximate the interface and functionality for easy access by the public .

these websites are no longer updated so links to external websites and some internal pages will not work. .

such decisions may have implications on the type of information available to future researchers , federal agencies , and congress .
