in 1972 , the supreme court ruled in deepsouth packing co. v. laitram corp .

that , under the patent act as it was written at that time , it was not an act of patent infringement to manufacture the components of a patented invention in the united states and then ship them abroad for assembly into an end product .

in response to this loophole in the patent law that would have allowed potential infringers to avoid liability , congress added subsection ( f ) to â§ 271 of the patent act .

this statutory provision now states: ( 1 ) whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the united states all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention , where such components are uncombined in whole or in part , in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the united states in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the united states , shall be liable as an infringer .

 ( 2 ) whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the united states any component of a patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use , where such component is uncombined in whole or in part , knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the united states in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the united states , shall be liable as an infringer .

the patent at issue in microsoft v. at&t concerned at&t's patent on a speech coder - decoder ( a codec ) .

a speech codec is a software program that is capable of converting spoken words into a compact code , or vice versa .

at&t brought suit against microsoft in 2001 , alleging that the speech codec included in microsoft's windows operating system infringes its patent .

microsoft filed a motion to exclude evidence of alleged liability arising from foreign sales of windows , pursuant to â§ 271 ( f ) of the patent act .

microsoft exports overseas a limited number of u.s. - made "golden master disks" containing the machine - readable software code of its windows operating system ; foreign computer manufacturers may use these disks to replicate the master disk in generating multiple copies of windows for installation on foreign - assembled computers that are then sold to foreign customers .

in support of its motion to limit liability and any damages award , microsoft argued that: ( 1 ) software is intangible information such that it could not be a "component" of a patented invention within the meaning of â§ 271 ( f ) ; and ( 2 ) even if the windows software were a "component," no actual "components" had been "supplied" from the united states as required by â§ 271 ( f ) because the copies of windows installed on the foreign - assembled computers had all been made abroad .

in considering microsoft's motion , the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york first cited previous federal circuit decisions supporting the proposition that software is patentable .

furthermore , the court explained that â§ 271 ( f ) does not limit "components" to only physical machines or tangible structures , but rather could include intangible information or data .

thus , the district court rejected microsoft's argument that software could not be a "component" of a patented invention under â§ 271 ( f ) .

as for the copies made abroad from the golden master disk sent from the united states , the district court held that such copies still came within the scope of â§ 271 ( f ) in light of the legislative intent of the statute to prohibit the circumvention of infringement through exportation .

after microsoft appealed , a divided panel of the federal circuit affirmed the district court's decision .

the appellate court relied on prior federal circuit case law that had held that "without question , software code alone qualifies as an invention eligible for patenting , and ... statutory language [does] not limit section 271 ( f ) to patented 'machines' or patented 'physical structures,' such that software [can] very well be a 'component' of a patented invention for the purposes of â§ 271 ( f ) . .

the federal circuit also ruled that , because "the act of copying is subsumed in the act of 'supplying,'" the exportation of the golden master disks , with the specific intent that they be replicated abroad , is an act that comes within the meaning of â§ 271 ( f ) 's "supplied or caused to be supplied in or from the united states. .

in dissent , federal circuit judge randall r. rader objected to the majority opinion's view that "supplies" within the meaning of â§ 271 ( f ) includes the act of foreign "copying. .

judge rader expressed concerns that such an interpretation is , in effect , an impermissible "extraterritorial expansion" of u.s. patent law because it reaches "copying" activity overseas .

in his view , at&t's remedy lies not in u.s. law , but rather the law of the foreign country in which the infringement due to copying occurred .

the supreme court accepted microsoft's petition for a writ of certiorari in october 2006 , in order to answer two questions: 1 .

whether digital software codeâan intangible sequence of "1's" and "0's"âmay be considered a "component[] of a patented invention" within the meaning of section 271 ( f ) ( 1 ) ; and , if so , 2 .

whether copies of such a "component[]" made in a foreign country are "supplie[d] ... from the united states. .

in a 7-1 decision issued in late april 2007 , the court reversed the federal circuit's judgment , holding that microsoft was not liable for patent infringement under â§ 271 ( f ) , as the statute is currently written , when foreign - manufactured computers are loaded with windows software that has been copied abroad from a master disk or an electronic transmission sent by microsoft from the united states .

in regard to the first question posed in the case , associate justice ruth bader ginsburg , writing for the majority , explained that there are two ways to conceptualize software: one can speak of software in the abstract: the instructions themselves detached from any medium .

 ( an analogy: the notes of beethoven's ninth symphony. ) .

one can alternatively envision a tangible "copy" of software , the instructions encoded on a medium such as a cd - rom .

 ( sheet music for beethoven's ninth. ) .

abstract software code does not qualify as a component , for purposes of triggering liability under â§ 271 ( f ) , because it is an "idea" lacking physical embodiment and thus it cannot be a "usable , combinable part of a computer. .

justice ginsburg analogized software in the abstract to a detailed set of instructions , similar to that of a blueprint .

but information sent abroad that instructs someone on how to build the components of a patented invention does not come within the scope of â§ 271 ( f ) ; she observed that congress , in enacting the statutory provision , did not include the export of design tools such as blueprints , schematics , templates , and prototypes .

thus , for the windows software to be considered a "component" under â§ 271 ( f ) , the software code must be encoded or otherwise expressed in some sort of tangible mediumâa computer - readable software "copy" such as a cd - rom .

the court thus declined to adopt at&t's characterization of software in the abstract as a combinable component that qualifies for â§ 271 ( f ) liability .

in reaching its answer to the second question , the court largely agreed with judge rader's dissent from the federal circuit's opinion .

the copies of windows used for installation on the foreign computers had been made abroad ; those copies were not "supplied" from the united states , even though the master disk from which they were duplicated had been exported .

according to justice ginsburg , this distinction is legally relevant for liability purposes under â§ 271 ( f ) ; further , such liability is not affected by the ease of copying software .

noting that keys or machine parts may also easily be copied from a master , she observed that â§ 271 ( f ) "contains no instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made abroad nevertheless 'supplie[d] ... from the united states.' .

furthermore , justice ginsburg argued that the traditional presumption against extraterritorial application of united states law , particularly in patent law , would help favor the court construing â§ 271 ( f ) in a manner that excludes intangible software code and copies of software made abroad .

echoing judge rader's advice , justice ginsburg observed that "[i]f at & t desires to prevent copying abroad , its remedy lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents. .

at the end of the opinion , justice ginsburg conceded that the court's decision effectively creates a "loophole" for software makers to avoid liability under â§â 271 ( f ) .

however , she explained that the court would resist using the "dynamic judicial interpretation" that would be needed to adjust the patent law "to account for the realities of software distribution. .

the majority opinion expressly invited congress to consider whether this apparent loophole in favor of software companies , to the extent that it may exist , merits closing .

interestingly , the majority opinion of the court excluded footnote number 14 , which was supported by only four justices ( justices kennedy , scalia , souter , and ginsburg ) .

this footnote reads as follows: microsoft suggests that even a disk shipped from the united states , and used to install windows directly on a foreign computer , would not give rise to liability under â§â 271 ( f ) if the disk were removed after installation .

we need not and do not reach that issue here .

associate justice samuel alito , in a concurrence joined by justices thomas and breyer , would have decided that particular issue raised in footnote 14 in favor of microsoft's assessment of liability under â§ 271 ( f ) .

justice alito asserted that a "component" of an infringing physical device under â§ 271 ( f ) "must be something physical" ; thus , "[b]ecause no physical object originating in the united states was combined with these computers , there was no violation of â§ 271 ( f ) . .

he further observed that "[n]o physical aspect of a windows cd - româoriginal disk or copyâis ever incorporated into the computer itself" because the cd - rom is removed from the computer after the installation process copies the windows code to the computer's hard drive .

therefore: [i]t is irrelevant that the windows software was not copied onto the foreign - made computers directly from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the united states .

to be sure , if these computers could not run windows without inserting and keeping a cd - rom in the appropriate drive , then the cd - roms might be components of the computer .

but that is not the case here .

in lone dissent , associate justice john paul stevens explained that he would affirm the federal circuit's majority opinion in the case , because he deemed that judgment to be "more faithful to the intent of the congress that enacted â§â 271 ( f ) . .

in his view , abstract software code , whether embodied in a physical medium or detached from it , should be considered a "component" within the meaning of â§ 271 ( f ) because it has no other intended use except for installation onto a computer's hard drive ; therefore , it is a "component" used for assembly of an infringing machine , and microsoft would be liable for exporting it .

he also objected to the court's comparison of abstract software to blueprints , because "unlike a blueprint that merely instructs a user how to do something , software actually causes infringing conduct to occur .

it is more like a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound than sheet music that tells a pianist what to do. .

the outcome of the microsoft decision is not unlike that of the deepsouth packing co. v. laitram corp .

opinion in 1972 .

in deepsouth , the supreme court interpreted the patent act as it was then written to exclude from infringement liability the making in the united states of the unpatented parts of a patented shrimp deveining machine , and exporting such unassembled parts to foreign buyers for combination abroad .

congress then enacted â§ 271 ( f ) as a specific response to deepsouth , to expand the scope of patent infringement activity to include the supply of a patented invention's component from the united states for combination abroad .

now in microsoft , the supreme court has expressly invited congress to consider whether it is desirable to revise patent infringement liability under â§â 271 ( f ) to include exporting software with the intent that such product be copied abroad for use on foreign computers .
