the u.s. government continues to lead a multilateral coalition that seeks to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the islamic state organization by progressively reducing the geographic and political space , manpower , and financial resources available to it .

stated u.s. strategy to achieve this objective consists of a number of "lines of effort," including , in partnership with several european and arab states , direct military action , support for iraqi and syrian partner ground forces , intelligence gathering and sharing , and efforts to restrict flows of foreign fighters and disrupt the islamic state's finances .

administration officials have identified areas where they believe progress has been made in implementing u.s. and allied strategy to date , but they continue to state that it may take a considerable amount of time to achieve the full range of u.s. objectives .

they also note the potential for delays or setbacks .
