t his report describes actions taken by the administration and congress to provide fy2020 appropriations for commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ( cjs ) accounts .

the dollar amounts in this report reflect only new appropriations made available at the start of the fiscal year .

therefore , the amounts do not include any rescissions of unobligated or deobligated balances that may be counted as offsets to newly enacted appropriations , nor do they include any scorekeeping adjustments ( eg , the budgetary effects of provisions limiting the availability of the balance in the crime victims fund ) .

in the text of the report , appropriations are rounded to the nearest million .

however , percentage changes are calculated using whole , not rounded , numbers , meaning that in some instances there may be small differences between the actual percentage change and the percentage change that would be calculated by using the rounded amounts discussed in the report .

the annual cjs appropriations act provides funding for the departments of commerce and justice , select science agencies , and several related agencies .

appropriations for the department of commerce include funding for agencies such as the census bureau , the u.s. patent and trademark office , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , and the national institute of standards and technology .

appropriations for the department of justice ( doj ) provide funding for agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation ; the bureau of prisons ; the u.s .

marshals ; the drug enforcement administration ; and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives , along with funding for a variety of public safety - related grant programs for state , local , and tribal governments .

the vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .

the annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the legal services corporation and the equal employment opportunity commission .

the administration requests $71.388 billion for cjs for fy2020 , which is $1.520 billion ( - 2.1% ) less than the $72.908 billion appropriated for cjs for fy2019 ( see table 1 ) .

when comparing the administration's fy2020 request to the fy2019 funding , it should be considered that the administration formulated its fy2020 budget request before full - year appropriations for fy2019 were enacted .

the administration requests the following: $12.214 billion for the department of commerce , which is $801 million ( +7.0% ) more than fy2019 enacted funding ; $30.529 billion for the department of justice , which is $405 million ( - 1.3% ) less than fy2019 enacted funding ; $28.092 billion for the science agencies , which is $1.491 billion ( - 5.0% ) less than fy2019 enacted funding ; and $552 million for the related agencies , which is $425 million ( - 43.5% ) less than fy2019 enacted funding .

the increase in funding for the department of commerce is almost entirely the result of a proposed $2.334 billion ( 65.7% ) increase for the census bureau's periodic censuses and programs account .

the funding is requested to help the census bureau conduct the decennial 2020 census .

the administration's fy2020 budget for cjs proposes eliminating several agencies and programs: eda , nist's manufacturing extension partnership , noaa's pacific coastal salmon recovery fund , the community relations service ( its functions would be moved to doj's civil rights division ) , the cops office ( grants for community policing activities would be moved to ojp ) , nasa's office of stem engagement ( formerly the office of education ) , and the legal services corporation .

the administration requests some funding for the eda ( $30 million ) and legal services corporation ( $18 million ) to help provide for an orderly closeout of these agencies .

the administration proposes a $30 million ( - 75.0% ) reduction for the minority business development administration .

it proposes to change the agency's focus to being a policy office that concentrates on advocating for the minority business community as a whole rather than supporting individual minority business enterprises .

the administration proposes to move funding for the high intensity drug trafficking areas ( hidta ) program to the dea .

currently , hidta funding is administered by the office of national drug control policy .

the administration's requested funding for many cjs accounts is below fy2019 levels ; however , there are a few exceptions , which include the following: bis ( +$10 million , +8.1% ) , economic and statistical analysis ( +$7 million , +6.9% ) , ntia ( +$3 million , +7.4% ) , the executive office of immigration review ( +$110 million , +19.6% ) , doj's general legal activities ( +$23 million , +2.6% ) , the u.s .

marshals' federal prisoner detention account ( +$315 million , +20.3% ) , doj's national security division ( +$8 million , +8.1% ) , atf ( +$52 million , +3.9% ) , and the office of the u.s. trade representative ( +$6 million , +11.3% ) .

the administration proposes renaming three of nasa's accounts: the space technology account would be changed to the exploration technology account , the exploration account would be changed to the deep space exploration systems account , and the space operations account would be changed to the low earth orbit and spaceflight operations account .

unlike the administration's fy2019 budget , which proposed a new account structure for nasa , the fy2020 budget proposal does not appear to include a realignment of items that would be funded from these accounts .

the annual cjs appropriations act traditionally includes an obligation cap of funds expended from the crime victims fund ( cvf ) .

the administration's fy2020 budget does not include a proposed obligation cap for the cvf .

rather , the administration proposes a new $2.300 billion annual mandatory appropriation for crime victims programs .

within this amount , $492.5 million would be for the ovw , $10.0 million would be for oversight of ovc programs by the oig , $12.0 million would be for developing innovative crime victims services initiatives , and a set - aside of up to $115.0 million would be for tribal victims assistance grants .

from the remaining amount , the office for victims of crime ( ovc ) would provide formula and non - formula grants to the states to support crime victim compensation and victims services programs .

also , the administration's budget includes a proposal to transfer all of the atf's responsibilities related to alcohol and tobacco enforcement to the department of the treasury's tax and trade bureau .

the administration argues that the proposed realignment will allow the atf to focus on its efforts to prevent violent crime .

the proposal does not affect how much the administration requests for the atf for fy2020 .

table 1 outlines the fy2019 funding and the administration's fy2020 request for the department of commerce , the department of justice , the science agencies , and the related agencies .

 figure 1 shows the total cjs funding for fy2010-fy2019 , in both nominal and inflation - adjusted dollars ( more - detailed historical appropriations data can be found in table 2 ) .

the data show that nominal funding for cjs reached a 10-year high in fy2019 , though in inflation - adjusted terms , funding for fy2019 was lower than it was in fy2010 .

there is a cyclical nature to total nominal funding for cjs because of appropriations for the census bureau .

overall funding for cjs traditionally starts to increase a few years before the decennial census , peaks in the fiscal year in which the census is conducted , and then declines immediately thereafter .

this is discussed in more detail below .

increased funding for cjs also coincides with increases to the discretionary budget caps under the budget control act of 2011 ( bca , p.l .

112-25 ) .

the bca put into effect statutory limits on discretionary spending for fy2012-fy2021 .

under the act , discretionary spending limits were scheduled to be adjusted downward each fiscal year until fy2021 .

however , legislation was enacted that increased discretionary spending caps for fy2014 to fy2019 .

a sequestration of discretionary funding , ordered pursuant to the bca , cut $2.973 billion out of the total amount congress and the president provided for cjs for fy2013 .

since then , funding for cjs has increased as more discretionary funding has been allowed under the bca .

figure 2 shows total cjs funding for fy2010-fy2019 by major component ( i.e. , the department of commerce , the department of justice , nasa , and the nsf ) .

although decreased appropriations for the department of commerce ( a 47.4% reduction ) mostly explain the overall decrease in cjs appropriations from fy2010 to fy2013 , cuts in funding for doj ( - 8.7% ) and nasa ( - 9.8% ) also contributed .

funding for nsf held relatively steady from fy2010 to fy2013 .

overall cjs funding has increased since fy2014 , and this is partially explained by more funding for the department of commerce to help the census bureau prepare for the 2020 decennial census .

while funding for the department of commerce decreased from fy2018 to fy2019 , it is partly the result of the department receiving $1.000 billion in emergency supplemental funding for fy2018 .

if supplemental funding is excluded , appropriations for the department of commerce increased 2.5% from fy2018 to fy2019 .

while increased funding for the department of commerce partially explains the overall increase in funding for cjs since fy2014 , there have also been steady increases in funding for doj ( +11.5% ) , nasa ( +21.8% ) , and nsf ( +12.6% ) , as higher discretionary spending caps have been used to provide additional funding to these agencies .

also , increased funding for the department of commerce is not only the result of more funding for the census bureau .

funding for noaa increased by 41.0% from fy2014 to fy2018 and funding for nist increased by 15.9% over the same time period .

however , funding for both of these agencies decreased from fy2018 to fy2019 , meaning that the increase in the department of commerce's funding during this time period was almost solely attributable to increased funding for the census bureau .
