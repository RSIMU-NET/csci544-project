r ecent high - profile data breaches and privacy violations have raised national concerns over the legal protections that apply to americans' electronic data .

while some concern over data protection stems from how the government might utilize such data , mounting worries have centered on how the private sector controls digital information , the focus of this report .

inadequate corporate privacy practices and intentional intrusions into private computer networks have exposed the personal information of millions of americans .

at the same time , internet connectivity has increased and varied in form in recent years , expanding from personal computers and mobile phones to everyday objects such as home appliances , "smart" speakers , vehicles , and other internet - connected devices .

americans now transmit their personal data on the internet at an exponentially higher rate than the past .

along with the increased connectivity , a growing number of "consumer facing" actors ( such as websites ) and "behind the scenes" actors ( such as data brokers and advertising companies ) collect , maintain , and use consumers' information .

while this data collection can benefit consumers — for instance , by allowing companies to offer them more tailored products — it also raises privacy concerns , as consumers often cannot control how these entities use their data .

as a consequence , the protection of personal data has emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration .

despite the increased interest in data protection , the legal paradigms governing the security and privacy of personal data are complex and technical , and lack uniformity at the federal level .

the supreme court has recognized that the constitution provides various rights protecting individual privacy , but these rights generally guard only against government intrusions and do little to prevent private actors from abusing personal data online .

at the federal statutory level , while there are a number of data protection statutes , they primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data .

the federal trade commission ( ftc ) fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing the federal prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices .

but no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of personal data .

in contrast to the "patchwork" nature of federal law , some state and foreign governments have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation .

some analysts suggest these laws , which include the european union's ( eu's ) general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) and state laws such as the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ) , will create increasingly overlapping and uneven data protection regimes .

this fragmented legal landscape coupled with concerns that existing federal laws are inadequate has led many stakeholders to argue that the federal government should assume a larger role in data protection policy .

however , at present , there is no consensus as to what , if any , role the federal government should play , and any legislative efforts at data protection are likely to implicate unique legal concerns such as preemption , standing , and first amendment rights , among other issues .

this report examines the current u.s. legal landscape governing data protection , contrasting the current patchwork of federal data protection laws with the more comprehensive regulatory models in the ccpa and gdpr .

the report also examines potential legal considerations for the 116th congress should it consider crafting more comprehensive federal data protection legislation .

the report lastly contains an appendix , which contains a table summarizing the federal data protection laws discussed in the report .

given the inherent limitations in common law and constitutional protections , congress has enacted a number of federal laws designed to provide statutory protections of individuals' personal information .

in contrast with the scheme prevalent in europe and some other countries , rather than a single comprehensive law , the united states has a "patchwork" of federal laws that govern companies' data protection practices .

these laws vary considerably in their purpose and scope .

most impose data protection obligations on specific industry participants — such as financial institutions , health care entities , and communications common carriers — or specific types of data , such as children's data .

other laws , however , supplement the constitution's limited privacy protections and apply similar principles to private entities .

the stored communications act ( sca ) , for instance , generally prohibits the unauthorized access or disclosure of certain electronic communications stored by internet service providers .

lastly , some laws prohibit broad categories of conduct that , while not confined to data protection , limit how companies may handle personal data .

most notably , the federal trade commission act ( ftc act ) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices. .

as some scholars have pointed out , the ftc has used its authority under the ftc act to develop norms and principles that effectively fill in the gaps left by other privacy statutes .

these laws are organized below , beginning with those most narrowly focused on discrete industries and moving toward more generally applicable laws .

in light of its gap - filling function , this section lastly discusses the ftc act — along with the consumer financial protection act ( cfpa ) , which covers similar types of conduct .

the appendix to this report contains a table summarizing the federal data protection laws discussed .

adding to the complex federal patchwork of data protection statutes are the laws of the fifty states .

first and foremost , major regulators of privacy and data protection in the states include the courts , via tort and contract law .

with respect to tort law , in addition to the "privacy" causes of action that developed at the state level during the early 20th century ( discussed above ) , negligence and other state tort law claims serve as a means to regulate businesses that are injured from data security issues or otherwise fail to protect their customers from foreseeable harm .

contracts , implied contracts , and other commercial causes of action can also form important bulwarks for privacy .

the common law , however , is not perfect: it is subject to variability from state to state , and within states , from judge to judge and jury to jury .

in addition to the common law , most states have their own statutory framework which may affect data protection and the use of data by private entities .

for example , many states have a consumer protection law , sometimes prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices , often referred to as "little ftc acts. .

these laws , like the ftc act , are increasingly being used to address privacy matters .

in addition , each state has passed a data breach response law , requiring some form of response or imposing liability on companies in the event of a breach of their data security .

while an examination of every state data security law is beyond the scope of this report , at least one state has undertaken a general and ambitious effort to regulate data security .

specifically , the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ) , enacted in 2018 , has captured significant attention .

in addition to u.s. states like california , some foreign nations have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation .

the eu , in particular , has long applied a more wide - ranging data protection regulatory scheme .

whereas privacy principles in the u.s. constitution focus on government intrusions into private life and u.s. data privacy statutes generally are sector - specific , european privacy regulations have generally concerned any entity's accumulation of large amounts of data .

as a result , foundational eu treaties provide individuals with a general right to "protection of personal data" from all potential interferences .

the objective of the eu's most recent data privacy legislation — the gdpr — is to safeguard this right to personal data protection , while ensuring that data moves freely within the eu .

although some commentators argue that the federal government should supplement the current patchwork of federal data protection laws with more comprehensive legislation modeled on the ccpa or gdpr , some trump administration officials have criticized these legislative approaches and questioned whether they will improve data privacy outcomes .

the administration has argued that many comprehensive data privacy models have resulted in "long , legal , regulator - focused privacy policies and check boxes , which only help a very small number of users[.] .

rather than pursuing a prescriptive model in which the government defines ( or prescribes ) data protection rules , the trump administration advocates for what it describes as an outcome - based approach whereby the government focuses on the "outcomes of organizational practices , rather than on dictating what those practices should be. .

in september 2018 , the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) in the department of commerce issued a request for public comments on the trump administration's efforts to develop an outcome - based approach to advancing consumer privacy that also protects prosperity and innovation .

according to ntia , changes in technology have led consumers to conclude that they are losing control over their personal information , while at the same time that foreign and state privacy laws have led to a fragmented regulatory landscape that disincentives innovation .

accordingly , ntia is attempting to develop a set of "user - centric" privacy outcomes and goals that would underpin the protections that should be produced by any federal actions related to consumer privacy .

ntia's proposed policy focuses on a set of outcomes that the trump administration seeks to achieve: in addition to identifying desired outcomes , ntia's request for public comments states that the trump administration is in the process of developing "high - level goals for federal action" related to data privacy .

ntia's proposed privacy framework shares certain elements of prescriptive legal regimes like the gdpr and ccpa .

common features include a right to withdraw consent to certain uses of personal data ; accountability for third - party vendors and servicers ; and a right to access , amend , complete , correct , or delete personal data .

but ntia's request for public comments does not specifically describe how the trump administration intends to accomplish its outcomes and goals .

instead , it states that ntia "understand[s] that there is considerable work to be done to achieve" the identified objectives .

the comment period closed on november 9 , 2018 , and ntia received input from more than 200 individuals and entities .

the debate over whether congress should consider federal legislation regulating data protection implicates numerous legal variables and options .

"data protection" itself is an expansive concept that melds the fields of data privacy ( i.e. , how to control the collection , use , and dissemination of personal information ) and data security ( i.e. , how to protect personal information from unauthorized access or use and respond to such unauthorized access or use ) .

there is no single model for data protection legislation in existing federal , state , or foreign law .

for example , some state laws focus solely on data security or address a particular security concern , such as data breach notifications .

other state laws isolate a single privacy - related issue , such as the transparency of data brokers — companies that aggregate and sell consumers' information , but that often do not have a direct commercial relationship with consumers .

recent data protection laws such as the ccpa and gdpr appear to indicate a trend toward combining data privacy and security into unified legislative initiatives .

these unified data protection paradigms typically are structured on two related features: ( 1 ) an enumeration of statutory rights given to individuals related to their personal information and ( 2 ) the creation of legal duties imposed on the private entities that possess personal information .

the specific list and nature of rights and duties differ depending on the legislation , and some have proposed to define new rights in federal legislation that do not have a clear analog in existing state or foreign law .

consequently , at present , there is no agreed - upon menu of data protection rights and obligations that could be included in federal legislation .

although data protection laws and proposals are constantly evolving , some frequently discussed legal rights include: the right to know what personal data is being collected , used , and disseminated , and how those activities are occurring ; the right to control the use and dissemination of personal data , which may include the right to opt out or withhold consent to the collection or sharing of such data ; the right to review personal data that has been collected and to delete or correct inaccurate information ; the right to obtain a portable copy of personal data ; the right to object to improper activities related to personal data ; and the right to learn when a data breach occurs ; commonly discussed obligations for companies that collect , use , and disseminate personal data include rules defining: how data is collected from individuals ; how companies use data internally ; how data is disseminated or disclosed to third parties ; what information companies must give individuals related to their data ; how data is kept secure ; when breaches of security must be reported ; the accuracy of data ; and reporting requirements to ensure accountability and compliance .

whether to enact federal data protection legislation that includes one or more of these rights and obligations has been the subject of a complex policy debate and multiple hearings in recent congresses .

part of the legislative debate concerns how to enforce such rights and obligation and raises questions over the role of federal agencies , state attorneys general , and private citizen suits .

in addition , some elements of the data protection proposals and models could implicate legal concerns and constitutional limitations .

while the policy debate is outside the scope of this report , the following sections discuss legal considerations relevant to federal data protection proposals that the 116th congress may choose to consider .

these sections begin by analyzing legal issues related to the internal structure and definition of data protection - related rights and obligations and then move outward toward an examination of external legal constraints .

the current legal landscape governing data protection in the united states is complex and highly technical , but so too are the legal issues implicated by proposals to create unified federal data protection policy .

except in extreme incidents and cases of government access to personal data , the "right to privacy" that developed in the common law and constitutional doctrine provide few safeguards for the average internet user .

although congress has enacted a number of laws designed to augment individual's data protection rights , the current patchwork of federal law generally is limited to specific industry participants , specific types of data , or data practices that are unfair or deceptive .

this patchwork approach also extends to certain state laws .

seeking a more comprehensive data protection system , some governments — such as california and the eu — have enacted wide - ranging laws regulating many forms of personal data .

some argue that congress should consider creating similar protections in federal law , but others have criticized the eu's and california's approach to data protection .

should the 116th congress consider a comprehensive federal data protection program , its legislative proposals may involve numerous decision points and legal considerations .

an initial decision point is the scope and nature of any legislative proposal .

there are numerous data protection issues that could be addressed in any future legislation , and different possible approaches for addressing those issues ( such as using a "prescriptive" or "outcome - based" approach ) .

other decision points may include defining the scope of any protected information and determining the extent to which any future legislation should be enforced by a federal agency .

further , to the extent congress wants to allow individuals to enforce data protection laws and seek remedies for the violations of such laws in court , it must account for article iii's standing requirements .

under the supreme court's 2016 spokeo inc. v. robins decision , plaintiffs must experience more than a "bare procedural violation" of a federal privacy law to satisfy article iii and to sue to rectify a violation of that law .

federal preemption also raises complex legal questions — not only of whether to preempt state law , but what form of preemption congress should employ .

finally , from a first amendment perspective , supreme court jurisprudence suggests that while some "privacy" regulations are permissible , any federal law that restricts protected speech , particularly if it targets specific speakers or content , may be subject to more stringent review by a reviewing court .
