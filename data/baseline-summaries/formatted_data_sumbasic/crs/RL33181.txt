on may 11 , 2005 , the emergency supplemental appropriation act ( p.l .

109-13 ) was enacted with a provision relating to the construction of border fencing .

this provision originated in h.r .

on april 7 , 2006 , the senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to recommit s. 2454 to the senate judiciary committee with instructions that it be reported back with the hagel amendment ( hagel - martinez compromise ) on a 38 to 60 vote .

that same day the senate rejected , on a 36 to 62 vote , a motion to invoke cloture on s. 2454 .

the hagel - martinez compromise , with some modifications , was subsequently introduced in the senate on april 24 , 2006 , as the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 ( s. 2611 / s. 2612 ) .

senate amendment 4788 was added to the department of defense appropriation bill , h.r .

5631 , on august 2 , 2006 , and would appropriate $1.8 billion to the national guard for the construction of border fencing .

h.r .

5631 was passed by the senate on september 7 , 2006 , and is currently in conference .

before september 11 , 2001 , border security fell piecemeal under the mandate of many diverse federal departments , including but not limited to the department of justice ( the immigration and naturalization service ) ; the department of the treasury ( the customs service ) ; the department of agriculture ( the animal and plant health inspection service ) ; and the department of transportation ( the coast guard ) .

in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , policymakers have focused a great deal of attention on securing america's international borders .

the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-296 ) consolidated most federal agencies operating along the u.s. borders within the newly formed department of homeland security ( dhs ) , which was charged with securing the nation against a potential terrorist attack .

most of these agencies were located in the directorate of border and transportation security ( bts ) , which was charged with securing the borders ; territorial waters ; terminals ; waterways ; and air , land , and sea transportation systems of the united states ; and managing the nation's ports of entries .

the fy2006 dhs appropriations act ( p.l .

109-90 ) eliminated bts and required the two of its component agencies , customs and border protection ( cbp ) and immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , to report directly to the secretary's office .

the u.s. coast guard was established as , and remains , a standalone division within dhs .

the concept of border security is an intricate part of overall homeland security .

border security involves securing the many means by which people and things can enter the country .

operationally , this means controlling the official ports of entry ( poe ) through which legitimate travelers and commerce enter the country , and patrolling the nation's land and maritime borders to safeguard against and interdict illegal entries .

within dhs , cbp is the agency charged with securing the nation's international border at and between poe .

at poe , cbp officers screen the goods and travelers that are attempting to enter the country to ensure that unwanted or dangerous people and things to do not enter the country .

between poe , border patrol agents attempt to detect and prevent the illegal entry of terrorists , weapons of mass destruction , unauthorized aliens , and contraband .

although the movement of goods into the country is clearly an important aspect of the overall security of the u.s. borders , this report will focus on the movement of people into the country because that has been the main issue addressed by most of the border security legislation currently being considered in the 109 th congress .

cargo security issues are planned to be discussed in a forthcoming report .

this report is organized to reflect the main border security issues relating to the movement of people into the country , as indicated by the legislation currently pending in the 109 th congress .

as such , it focuses on legislation with provisions affecting the movement of people into the country between poe , and at poe .

appendix a includes a table that tracks the status of the bills that are discussed in this report .

appendix b includes a table that groups the bills discussed by issue area .

the united states border patrol ( usbp ) within cbp is charged with securing the u.s. international land border between poe , detecting and preventing the entry of terrorists , weapons of mass destruction , and illegal aliens into the country , and interdicting drug smugglers and other criminals along the border .

as such , the usbp patrols over 8,000 miles of the u.s. international borders , including the roughly 2,000 mile southern and 4,000 mile northern borders .

in its efforts to secure the border , the usbp deploys a wide range of resources , including technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) , sensors , and cameras ; infrastructure , including fences , vehicle barriers , and checkpoints ; on - road and off - road vehicles , boats , fixed wing aircraft , and helicopters .

there has been much debate in the 109 th congress concerning whether dhs has sufficient resources to adequately fulfill its border security mission .

many of the issues identified between poe relate to resource requirements and allocation strategies .

there are currently 317 official poe into the united states , including 216 airports that are international poes , 143 seaports , and 115 land poes .

cbp officers assigned to these poe may be responsible for more than one mode of transportation , even processing all three conveyance types: air , land , and sea .

as individuals attempt to enter the country through poe , cbp officers must inspect their documentation to ascertain whether they have legal authorization to enter .

in order to make their decision regarding whether to admit the individual , cbp officers must use a variety of different databases and must examine the traveler's documents .

there are a number of issues relating to this process that are being considered in the legislation currently pending in the 109 th congress .

a number of different bills include provisions requiring dhs to implement a biometric entry / exit program .

the current biometric entry / exit system is the u.s .

visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program , which requires selected foreign nationals attempting to enter the united states to submit two fingerprints and a photograph when arriving to the country through an airport poe .

this information is used to verify their identity and administrative status .

the program is in the process of being expanded to all poe , but does not currently feature an exit component .

some bills call for enhancing the capabilities of the current us - visit program .

h.r .

4437 , h.r .

4312 , h.r .

5067 , s. 2368 , and s. 2377 would direct dhs to collect 10 fingerprints from aliens currently required to register in us - visit as they enter the country .

s. 1438 , s. 1916 , and s. 2049 would expand the current system by authorizing the secretary to collect biometric data from visitors as they exit the country and to collect data from alien crew members landing in the united states .

s. 1438 and s. 1916 would authorize such sums as may be necessary to implement the automated entry exit biometric program at all land poe in fy2006 and fy2007 ; s. 2049 would authorize such sums as may be necessary to fund this expansion each year from fy2008 to fy2010 .

s. 2368 and s. 2377 would require the biometric entry and exit system to integrate arrival and departure information into an electronic database that could be used by dhs and the department of state , and would require the system to be implemented at land poe by october 1 , 2006 .

h.r .

1320 would create an office of us - visit outreach to inform local border officials and residents about developments with the program .

the bill would also require dhs to digitize the collection of arrival and departure records .

s. 1033 and h.r .

2033 would require dhs to collect biometric information from visiting aliens as they enter and exit the country .

h.r .

4313 would require dhs to implement an entry and exit system at land poe no later than october 1 , 2006 .

h.r .

4437 , as amended , would require dhs to submit timelines for deploying the us - visit system to all land poe and for implementing the exit component at all land poe .

s. 2454 , s.amdt .

3192 , s. 2611 , s. 2612 , s. 3564 would require dhs to submit a schedule for deploying us - visit at all land poe , for developing and deploying the system's exit control component , and for making all immigration screening systems interoperable .

the bills would also authorize dhs to require entering and departing aliens to provide information including biometric data , and to collect biometric data from alien crewmen .

additionally , all four bills would add withholding biometric data as a ground for inadmissibility .

lastly , h.r .

5017 would require dhs to submit a report to congress detailing its compliance to date with the irtpa requirements concerning implementation of an entry and exit system and the steps that will be taken to fully implement the system .

the bill would also require the government accountability office to certify whether the entry and exit system has been fully implemented as per the irtpa requirements .

h.r .

1320 would make permanent the secure electronic network for travelers rapid inspection ( sentri ) and the nexus program and would create remote enrollment centers for these programs away from the borders of the united states .

the bill would also authorize appropriations for poe modifications to expand these programs , and would require an annual report from dhs concerning the implementation of these programs .

h.r .

4437 , as amended , would require dhs to submit a timeline for making all the immigration screening systems operated by the department interoperable .

h.r .

4437 , as amended , would also require dhs to institute a pilot program to evaluate the use of automated systems at no fewer than two foreign airports for pre - screening incoming travelers .

passenger information would be screened against the consolidated terrorist watchlist , and the bill would require that the program make use of the machine - readable data elements available on passports .

the bill would require the program to run for no fewer than 90 days , and would require dhs to report to congress on the program within 30 days of its conclusion .

a number of bills direct the secretary to hire no less than 250 additional cbp officers at poe in each year from fy2006 to fy2010 , including s. 1916 ; s. 1438 ; h.r .

688 ; h.r .

3938 ; h.r .

4312 ; h.r .

4437 ; h.r .

5067 .

h.r .

4313 , s. 2368 , s. 2377 , s. 2454 , and s.amdt .

3192 would add 250 cbp officers each year from fy2007 to fy2011 .

s. 2454 and s.amdt .

3192 would also add 250 poe inspectors each year from fy2007 to fy2011 .

s. 2611 , s. 2612 , and h.r .

3564 would add no less than 500 poe inspectors each year authorized ; s. 2611 and s. 2612 from fy2006 to fy2011 ; s. 3564 from fy2007 to fy2011 .

h.r .

4312 , h.r .

4437 , and h.r .

5067 would require dhs to deploy radiation portal monitors to all poe and would authorize such sums as may be necessary for this purpose in fy2006 and fy2007 .

h.r .

1320 would call for the installation of radiation portal monitors at all southern poe and would authorize $49 million for this purpose .

h.r .

4412 would require the interagency border inspection system ( ibis ) to be integrated with all existing u.s .

citizenship and immigration services databases .

s. 2611 , s. 2612 and s. 3564 would direct dhs to create a poe technology demonstration program in order to test and evaluate new and existing technologies relating to inspections , communications , port tracking , identification of persons and cargo , sensory devices , personal detection , decision support , and the detection and identification of weapons of mass destruction .

dhs would be authorized to implement the demonstration program at three to five poe , and the bills would set forth some selection requirements for at least one of these poes .

dhs would be required to submit a report to congress on the activities carried out at these demonstration sites within one year of enactment .

a number of bills include provisions that would add funding for poe infrastructure and resources .

h.r .

1320 would authorize $1 billion for a land border infrastructure improvement fund to carry out infrastructure and technology improvements at poe .

h.r .

4313 would add 25 poe along the international land border at locations to be determined by the secretary , and would authorize appropriations of $125 million for this purpose .

s. 2061 , s. 2368 , and s. 2377 would authorize the secretary to construct additional poe at whatever locations he deems necessary , and would also authorize the secretary to make necessary improvements to existing poe .

s. 2394 would require dhs to make an annual report to congress describing the status of poe infrastructure and identifies projects to improve poe security .

s. 2611 , s. 2612 , and s. 3564 would direct the general services administration to update its existing port of entry infrastructure assessment study .

this update should identify poe infrastructure and technology improvement projects needed to enhance security and expedite commerce and prioritize these projects based on their ability to fulfill immediate security requirements and facilitate trade .

additionally , the bills would direct dhs , in conjunction with other federal , state , local , and private entities involved in international trade , to submit a national land border security plan to congress that would assess the vulnerability of each poe located along the land border .

dhs would also be authorized to designate one or more poe security coordinators at each poe along the land border as part of this plan .

s.amdt .

3192 , s. 2611 , and s. 2612 include a provision that would create criminal penalties for those aliens who attempt to elude or elude customs , immigration , or agriculture inspections at poe , or who fail to stop at the command of a cbp officer .

offenders would be subject to a prison term of not more than three years ; not more than 10 years if they inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily injury during their offense ; and up to life in prison or the death penalty if death results from their offense .

all three bills would also make failure to obey to cbp officers' directives at a poe while driving a vehicle or other conveyance prima facie evidence of smuggling .

lastly , all three bills would make failure to obey the lawful orders of cbp officers , usbp agents , and ice investigators subject to a fine or a prison sentence of up to five years .

h.r .

6061 would require dhs to evaluate the authority of customs and border protection ( cbp ) personnel to stop vehicles that enter the united states illegally and refuse to stop when ordered to do so .

it would require dhs to compare cbp's authority to stop vehicles with the coast guard's authority to stop vessels and to assess whether cbp's authority should be expanded .

the bill would also require dhs to review the equipment and the technology available to cbp personnel to stop vehicles in order to assess whether better equipment is available and should be deployed , and to evaluate the training provided to cbp personnel to stop vehicles .

lastly , the bill would require a report within 60 days of its enactment with the results of this evaluation .

the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( irtpa ) of 2004 ( p.l .

108-458 §7209 ) changed the documentary requirements for citizens of western hemisphere countries .

irtpa required all individuals for whom documentation requirements had previously been waived under §212 ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) of ina , including american and canadian citizens , to provide proof of citizenship in order to be admitted into the united states at poe by january 1 , 2007 .

s. 2611 would authorize dhs to develop a passport card that would allow u.s. citizens to travel to mexico , canada , the caribbean , and bermuda and would extend the deadline for implementing the new documentary requirements to the later of either june 1 , 2009 , or the date that is three months after the secretary of state and the secretary of dhs certify that the process for applying and receiving passport cards has met certain requirements outlined in the bill , that poe have been equipped with the sufficient technologies to ensure that implementation will not impede the flow of traffic into the united states , and that cbp officers have received the training and infrastructure needed to properly implement the program .

the bill , among other things , would require the passport card be designed to provide a platform for all registered traveler programs , would set a maximum fee of $34 for the card , and would require this fee to be reduced if an individual applied for a passport card and a passport at the same time .

the bill would also direct dhs to enter into a demonstration project with at least one state to allow that state to include citizenship information on its driver's licenses in order to meet the irtpa requirements .

lastly , the bill would require dhs to establish a program that would allow u.s. citizens who do not have the irtpa - required documentation to cross the international border for a period of not more than 72 hours and would direct dhs to establish a grace period for individuals unaware of the changes in documentary requirements at the border .

h.r .

5456 would require that , within one year of its passage , no individual be admitted to the united states without presenting appropriate documentation .

prior to the formation of dhs , customs and immigration inspections at poe were handled by different types of inspectors .

after dhs was created , however , the department integrated the inspection duties through the "one face at the border" initiative .

this means that customs and border protection ( cbp ) inspectors are essentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections .

h.r .

4312 , h.r .

4437 , and h.r .

5067 would require dhs to submit a report: describing the goals , benefits , and challenges of the initiative ; providing a breakdown of the current numbers of inspectors and their pre - dhs agency ; and describing the current training given to inspectors and the steps taken to ensure the maintenance of the expertise of customs , immigration , and agricultural inspectors .

h.r .

4044 would create three "distinct inspectional occupations: immigrations , customs , and agriculture" within cbp that would coordinate closely with each other but that would report to separate operational chains of command .

h.r .

1320 and h.r .

1817 would require dhs to submit a report to congress on the "one face at the border initiative. .

in the 109 th congress , there has been some debate concerning whether the current organizational division between cbp and ice is justified due to the apparent lack of coordination and communication between the two agencies .

h.r .

1817 would require the secretary to submit a report outlining the rationale for and the benefits of the current organizational division of cbp and ice .

h.r .

4312 , h.r .

4437 , h.r .

5067 and h.r .

5813 would require , subject to the availability of appropriations , an increase of at least 25% ( above the number of positions funded in the previous fiscal year ) , of the number of canine detection teams in use at u.s. ports of entry for each of the fiscal years 2007 to 2011 .

h.r .

4285 and h.r .

4958 would direct dhs to increase the number of trained canine detection teams deployed at poe by not less than 25% , subject to the availability of appropriations , each year from fy2007 to fy2011 .

h.r .

4285 , h.r .

4958 , h.r .

5813 and h.r .

5814 would require the secretary to take the following actions: to fully coordinate and maximize the use of dhs' canine training facilities and resources ; to consider ways to utilize the canine teams trained by other public and private entities ; to prioritize the use of domestically bred canines ; to consult with other federal agencies to encourage the domestic breeding of canines ; to consolidate procurement and reduce the cost of purchasing canines ; and to require dhs to submit a report to congress within 120 days of enactment .

h.r .

4958 , h.r .

5813 , and h.r .

5814 would establish and authorize funding for a competitive grant program for domestic breeders of canines best suited for detection training purposes for fy2007 through fy2011 .

these four bills would also establish a homeland security canine detection accreditation board to implement a voluntary accreditation process and require that canine detection teams acquired with dhs grant funds be certified through this accreditation process .

h.r .

1320 would authorize necessary appropriations to increase the number of cbp canine units by 20% above the level in place at the end of fy2004 .

h.r .

1320 would also require the proportionate distribution of the new units to both the northern and southern borders , and would require that the new units be used only for bomb , passenger and currency detection purposes .
