the senate appropriations committee's subcommittee on energy and water development approved its version of the fy2015 bill on june 17 , 2014 , with a total of $34.21 billion ( including budget scorekeeping adjustments ) .

the subcommittee's draft bill and report were released by the appropriations committee on july 24 , 2014 .

the subcommittee would increase funding for the army corps of engineers to $5.13 billion and for the department of the interior's bureau of reclamation to $1.23 billion .

funding for the department of energy would total $28.36 billion , including $205.9 million in rescissions .

full committee markup scheduled for june 19 , 2014 , was postponed because of administration objections to a planned amendment to block proposed environmental protection agency carbon dioxide regulations , according to media reports .

no further action on the senate draft bill was taken .

 table 1 indicates the status of the fy2015 funding legislation .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

the energy and water development bill provides funding for the civil program of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , an agency in the department of defense with both military and civilian responsibilities .

under its civil works program , the corps plans , builds , operates , and maintains a wide range of water resources facilities .

the corps attracts congressional attention because its projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects , in addition to their water resource development purposes .

corps appropriations are generally authorized in water resources development acts .

most recently , congress enacted a new water resources development act in june of 2014 , the water resources reform and development act of 2014 ( wrrda , p.l .

113-121 ) .

this bill authorized new corps projects and studies and altered numerous corps policies and procedures .

in most years , the president's budget request for the corps is below the agency's enacted appropriation .

for fy2015 , congress appropriated $5.454 billion for the corps in p.l .

113-235 .

the president's fy2015 budget request for the corps was $4.561 billion .

the house approved $5.557 billion for the corps , and the senate appropriations subcommittee recommended $5.162 billion .

for fy2014 , congress had provided $5.468 billion in the agency's annual civil works appropriations in p.l .

113-76 .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and energy efficiency , nuclear power , fossil energy r&d , the strategic petroleum reserve , energy statistics , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs .

the fy2013 continuing resolution , p.l .

113-6 , funded doe programs at $25.1 billion , including the sequestration requirements of the budget control act .

the fy2014 bill , p.l .

113-76 , appropriated $27.3 billion for doe .

the administration's request for fy2015 was $28.4 billion .

the house approved $27.3 billion , and the senate committee on appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development recommended $28.4 billion .

the enacted fy2015 measure provided $27.9 billion for doe .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

for fy2015 the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) requested $1.0595 billion ( $124.3 million net , including the inspector general's office ) .

the total funding request is $3.6 million above the fy2014 level but would constitute a net reduction of $1.0 million because of higher offsetting fees .

major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users .

in comparison with the request , the house approved a total funding increase of $5 million for nrc .

however , a smaller revenue offset would have resulted in a $50 million increase in the net appropriation , to $174.3 million ( including the inspector general's office ) .

the senate subcommittee recommended the same amount as the administration request .

the consolidated appropriations act reduced nrc's total spending level by $44.2 million from the request .

the reduction was based on the availability of $34.2 million in carryover funds and $10.0 million in lower staffing levels .

the nrc budget request included $237.9 million for new reactor activities , $16.5 million above the fy2014 level .

until 2007 , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s .

however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities and other generating companies to apply for licenses for 30 new reactors .

several of those applications were subsequently withdrawn or suspended , though , as falling natural gas prices reduced the competitiveness of nuclear power .

nrc issued combined construction and operating licenses for four new reactors at two sites in georgia and south carolina in early 2012 .

nine license applications for new reactors are still under active nrc review , according to the fy2015 justification .

nrc's proposed fy2015 budget included no funds for licensing doe's previously planned yucca mountain nuclear waste repository .

because the obama administration wants to cancel the yucca mountain project and filed a motion to withdraw the license application on march 3 , 2010 , the nrc's fy2011 appropriation was used to close out its licensing activities .

as discussed in the " nuclear waste disposal " section of this report , the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered nrc on august 13 , 2013 , to continue reviewing the yucca mountain license application , using $11.1 million in leftover funding .

the house provided $55.0 million for nrc to continue adjudicating the yucca mountain license application , while the senate subcommittee included no similar provision .

no yucca mountain funding was included in the enacted appropriation .

for regulation of operating reactors , nrc's fy2015 budget request included $577.3 million , $12.8 million below the fy2014 level .

those activities include reactor safety inspections , license renewals and modifications , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises .

the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan increased congressional and public concern about the safety of u.s. nuclear power plants .

nrc established a task force 10 days after the accident to review nrc's regulatory system .

nrc issued the first regulatory orders resulting from that review on march 12 , 2012 , and is currently working on additional regulations .

regulation and oversight activities related to cybersecurity have also been increasing , according to the budget justification .

the senate subcommittee draft report expressed concern over nrc regulation of nuclear materials , such as radioactive sources that "are vulnerable to theft and could be used by terrorists to build dirty bombs. .

the subcommittee's draft bill included requirements that nrc establish mandatory security standards for the most risk - significant categories of radioactive materials and increase inspections .

no similar provisions were included in the h.r .

83 explanatory statement .

the energy policy act of 2005 permanently extended a requirement that 90% of nrc's budget be offset by fees on licensees .

not subject to the offset are expenditures from the nuclear waste fund to pay for waste repository licensing , spending on general homeland security , and doe defense waste oversight .

the offsets in the fy2015 budget request would have resulted in a net appropriation of $124.2 million .

net funding in the final bill was $119.8 million .
