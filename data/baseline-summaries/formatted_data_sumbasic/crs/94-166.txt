crime is ordinarily proscribed , tried , and punished according to the laws of the place where it occurs .

american criminal law applies beyond the geographical confines of the united states , however , under certain limited circumstances .

state prosecution for overseas misconduct is limited almost exclusively to multi - jurisdictional crimes , that is , crimes where some elements of the offense are committed within the state and others are committed beyond its boundaries .

a surprising number of federal criminal statutes have extraterritorial application , but prosecutions have been relatively few .

this may be because when extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction does exist , practical and legal complications , and sometimes diplomatic considerations , may counsel against its exercise .

the constitution grants congress broad powers to enact laws of extraterritorial scope and imposes few limitations on the exercise of that power .

the states enjoy only residual authority , but they too may and have enacted criminal laws which apply beyond the territorial confines of the united states .

prosecutions are relatively few , however , perhaps because of the practical , legal , and diplomatic obstacles that may attend such an endeavor .
