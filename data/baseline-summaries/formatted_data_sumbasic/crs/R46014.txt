following a presidential declaration of emergency or major disaster , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) may provide three primary forms of assistance: individual assistance ( ia ) , public assistance ( pa ) , and hazard mitigation assistance ( hma ) .

ia , which is the focus of this report , provides aid to affected individuals and households , and can take the form of assistance for housing and for other needs through the individuals and households program , crisis counseling , disaster unemployment assistance , disaster legal services , and disaster case management services , as well as mass care and emergency assistance .

pa provides grants to local , state , territorial , and indian tribal governments , as well as certain private nonprofit organizations , for emergency protective measures , debris removal operations , and repair or replacement of damaged public infrastructure .

hma funds pay for mitigation and resiliency projects and programs to reduce the threat or impacts of future disasters .

this report provides brief descriptions of the categories of ia authorized under the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( stafford act ; p.l .

93-288 , as amended ; 42 u.s.c .

â§â§5121 et seq. ) .

the information is based on the program guidance that fema released in march 2019 , to serve as a comprehensive ia program policy resource ; the individual assistance program and policy guide ( iappg ) applies to emergencies and disasters declared on or after march 1 , 2019 .

state , territorial , and indian tribal governments do not automatically receive ia when a disaster occurs .

following an incident , the governor or tribal chief executive must request that the president declare an emergency or major disaster and that ia be authorized .

when drafting a request for a major disaster declaration authorizing ia , the state , territorial , or indian tribal government must demonstrate that the incident exceeds their capacity to effectively respond without federal assistance .

fema then evaluates the request using a set of factors before providing a recommendation to the president .

in march 2019 , fema released the updated factors considered when evaluating a governor's request for ia , which became effective june 1 , 2019 .

thus , this report also lists and briefly describes the updated ia factors .

various types of fema ia may be provided to disaster survivors .

the available ia options depend on the type of declaration ( i.e. , an "emergency" or "major disaster" ) , and the type ( s ) of ia requested by the governor of the affected state or the tribal chief executive .

these requests must be authorized by fema ( for information on the factors considered when determining whether to authorize ia , see the " ia factors " section , below ) .

fema's ia program includes 1 .

mass care and emergency assistance ; 2 .

crisis counseling assistance and training program ; 3 .

disaster unemployment assistance ; 4 .

disaster legal services ; 5 .

disaster case management ; and 6 .

individuals and households program .

a brief description of each form of ia is included below .

state , territorial , and indian tribal governments do not automatically receive individual assistance ( ia ) when an incident occurs .

the governor or tribal chief executive must request that the president declare an emergency or major disaster and that ia be authorized .

this is because federal assistance is intended to supplementânot supplantâlocal , state , territorial , or indian tribal government response and recovery efforts .

in making such a request , the governor or tribal chief executive is claiming and must demonstrate that they are unable to effectively respond to the incident without federal assistance .

the governor or tribal chief executive's request for a presidential declaration of emergency or major disaster must include information about the actions and resources that have been or will be committed , and an estimate of the amount and severity of the disaster - caused damages , in addition to other required information .

specific factors are considered by fema when evaluating the need for supplemental federal assistance to individuals ( i.e. , ia ) pursuant to a request for a major disaster declaration .

fema provides a recommendation to the president , and the decision to grant a declaration request is at the president's discretion .

the authority to designate assistance types to be made available is delegated to the fema assistant administrator for the disaster assistance directorate .

on march 21 , 2019 , as required by section 1109 of the sandy recovery improvement act of 2013 ( sria , division b of p.l .

113-2 ) , fema issued a final rule revising the factors considered when evaluating a governor's request for ia .

the factors were revised to establish more objective criteria for evaluating the need for assistance , clarify eligibility requirements , and expedite a presidential declaration determination .

these factors became effective june 1 , 2019 .

in addition to the revised factors , fema also produced guidance for use by state , territorial , and indian tribal governments when drafting requests for major disaster declarations authorizing ia .

in addition to determining ia eligibility , the factors are also used to identify the types of ia that will be made available to the requesting state / territory / indian tribal government .

the factors considered when evaluating a governor's request for a major disaster declaration authorizing individual assistance are intended to assess the "severity , magnitude , and impact of a disaster , as well as the capabilities of the affected jurisdictions. .

"fema will always consider all relevant information submitted as part of a declaration request. .

as was the case prior to the adoption of the revised ia factors , major disaster declarations are made at the president's discretion and the ia factors do not limit presidential discretion .

brief descriptions of the factors are as follows: 1 .

state fiscal capacity and resource availability requires an evaluation of the resources available to the local and state / territorial / indian tribal government , nongovernmental organizations , and the private sector , combined with the circumstances that contribute to a lack of sufficient resources , resulting in a need for supplemental federal assistance .

this factor includes two subfactors: a .

fiscal capacity evaluates the state's ability to raise revenue for disaster response and recovery using one of two variables: ( 1 ) increasing or decreasing , or higher or lower state total taxable resources ( ttr ) ; or ( 2 ) â higher or lower state gross domestic product ( gdp ) , which may be considered as the primary alternative to ttr for requesting territories or when ttr data is unavailable .

higher or lower per capita personal income by local area may also be considered with ttr or state gdp when fema needs to better assess the need for supplemental federal assistance within a local area .

in addition , other factors may be considered because even states with a high fiscal capacity may be affected by disasters that overwhelm their capabilities , or the variables ( i.e. , ttr and state gdp ) may not accurately reflect a state's fiscal capacity due to extenuating circumstances ; and b .

resource availability evaluates whether the disaster - caused needs can be met using non - stafford act sources .

two variables are considered: ( 1 ) â resources and services provided by local and state / territorial / indian tribal governments , and nongovernmental and private sector organizations ; and ( 2 ) â the cumulative effect of recent disasters occurring in the previous 24-month period .

2 .

uninsured home and personal property losses considers the results of the fema - state preliminary damage assessment ( pda ) process to evaluate the extent of damage and estimated cost of assistance .

the subfactors considered include ( 1 ) the "peril that caused the disaster damage" because it may affect insurance coverage ; ( 2 ) the percentage of affected applicants with insurance for the peril that caused the damage ; ( 3 ) whether the concentration of damages is in one area or if it is widespread ; ( 4 ) the number of homes damaged and degree to which they are damaged ( i.e. , whether habitability is affected ) ; ( 5 ) the estimated cost of assistance based on the pda data and historical data ; ( 6 ) the estimated rate of homeownership for the affected homes , which may influence whether the ihp is needed , and what types of housing assistance should be made available ; and ( 7 ) other relevant pda data that may demonstrate a need for supplemental federal assistance .

3 .

disaster impacted population profile evaluates the recovery challenges of the impacted population considering the affected community's demographics as compared with national averages .

4 .

impact to community infrastructure evaluates the disaster's impact by considering disruption , damage , or destruction for more than 72 hours to any of the following three subfactors: ( 1 ) life - saving and life - sustaining services that provide an "essential community function that ... will affect public health and safety" , such as police , fire , and emergency medical services ( ems ) , medical facilities , and water treatment services ; ( 2 ) essential community services that improve quality of life , such as schools and childcare providers , and social services ; and ( 3 ) transportation infrastructure and utilities that , for example , render housing uninhabitable or inaccessible , or affect the delivery of services .

5 .

casualties , including the number of individuals who are missing , injured , or deceased as a result of a disaster , indicate the level of trauma , which may influence the appropriate types of ia assistance to provide .

disaster related unemployment identifies the number of individuals who may have lost work or become unemployed as a result of the disaster and who do not qualify for standard unemployment insurance .
