this title authorizes up to $125 million in funding to establish national and state job training programs , administered by the department of labor , to help address job shortages that are impairing growth in green industries , such as energy efficient buildings and construction , renewable electric power , energy efficient vehicles , and biofuels development .

loans , grants , and debentures are established to help small businesses develop , invest in , and purchase energy efficient buildings , fixtures , equipment , and technology .

section 1201 empowers the small business administration ( sba ) to make "express" loans for certain energy efficiency and renewable energy projects .

section 1202 creates a two - year pilot loan program for purchasing energy efficient technologies under section 7 ( a ) of the small business act at half the cost that would have otherwise been required .

after the pilot program terminates , gao is required to prepare a report to congress that describes its energy - saving impact .

section 1203 creates small business energy efficiency , sustainability , and telecommuting programs .

reports to congress are required for each of those programs .

section 1204 raises the small business investment act ( sbia ) loan ceilings for certain energy efficiency and renewable energy projects undertaken by small businesses .
