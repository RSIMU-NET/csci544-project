the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) is affecting communities around the world and throughout the united states , with case counts growing daily .

containment and mitigation efforts by federal , state , and local governments have been undertaken to flatten the curve âthat is , to curb widespread transmission that could overwhelm the nation's health care system .

federal response efforts have included the enactment of laws to provide authorities and supplemental funding to prevent , prepare for , and respond to the pandemic .

this report focuses on supplemental fy2020 discretionary appropriations provided to programs and activities traditionally funded by the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies ( lhhs ) appropriations bill .

as of the date of this report , lhhs supplemental appropriations for covid - 19 response have been provided in four separate supplemental appropriations measures: title iii , division a , of the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-123 ) , enacted on march 6 , 2020 .

title v , division a , of the families first coronavirus response act ( ffcra , p.l .

116-127 ) , enacted on march 18 , 2020 .

title viii , division b , of the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act , p.l .

116-136 ) , enacted on march 27 , 2020 .

title i , division b , of the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act ( ppphcea , p.l .

116-139 ) , enacted on april 24 , 2020 .

in total , lhhs has received roughly $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from these covid - 19 response measures .

these funds are in addition to roughly $195 billion in regular fy2020 lhhs discretionary appropriations provided in division a of p.l .

116-94 , the fy2020 lhhs omnibus appropriations act that was enacted on december 20 , 2019 .

unlike the annual discretionary appropriations , however , these additional funds were designated as an "emergency requirement" and thus were effectively exempted from otherwise applicable budget enforcement requirements ( such as the statutory discretionary spending limits ) .

overall , the covid - 19 supplemental funds have increased fy2020 lhhs discretionary appropriations by approximately 143% .

the relevant legislative history of each of the four enacted laws containing lhhs supplemental appropriations is detailed below .

as previously mentioned , lhhs has received in total roughly $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from the covid - 19 response measures ( table 1 ) .

hhs received funding in all four supplemental appropriations acts , whereas the department of labor ( dol ) , the department of education ( ed ) , and entities funded under the related agencies ( ra ) heading received funding in the third supplemental only .

hhs received the vast majority of all lhhs covid - 19 supplemental fundsâ$248 billion , or 89% .

ed received the second - largest shareâ$31 billion , or 11% .

dol and ra received approximately 0.1% and 0.2% , respectively .

the remainder of this report provides highlights for hhs , dol , ed , and ra , and includes a detailed table ( table 2 ) organized by department or agency and by account , program , or activity .

the majority of dol funds ( $345 million ) in the third measure are for dislocated worker assistance through activities authorized by the workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) .

specifically , the dol funds are for the wioa national reserve , which provides national dislocated worker grants ( ndwgs ) to states and localities to assist with worker dislocation resulting from natural disasters and mass layoffs .

these funds are generally expected to address workforce - related effects of the covid - 19 pandemic .

the majority of hhs funds ( 93% ) in the supplemental appropriations measures have been appropriated to the public health and social services emergency fund ( phssef ) .

the phssef account is used by the hhs secretary for one - time or short - term funding , such as emergency supplemental appropriations , and for some ongoing public health preparedness activities in the office of the hhs assistant secretary for preparedness and response ( aspr ) .

accounts at the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) received approximately 3% of the supplemental hhs appropriations provided in the covid - 19 response measures .

accounts at the administration for children and families ( acf ) received a similar amount .

remaining funds were provided in smaller amounts to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , the administration for community living ( acl ) , the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , and the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) .

while amounts shown in table 2 are displayed as appropriated , readers should note that the first , third , and fourth covid - 19 supplemental appropriations acts authorized hhs to transfer funds made available in these acts , provided the transfers are made to prevent , prepare for , and respond to the pandemic .

 ( this broad authority giving hhs discretion over certain transfers is in addition to provisions in these three measures that direct hhs to make specific transfers. ) .

the first measure broadly allowed for hhs to transfer funds among accounts at cdc , nih , and phssef .

the third measure allowed for transfers among amounts at cdc , phssef , acf , acl , and nih .

the fourth measure allowed for transfers among accounts at cdc , nih , phssef , and the food and drug administration , but limited the amounts available for such transfers ( eg , it excluded from this authority $75 billion provided to the phssef for the "provider relief fund" ) .

the acts require hhs to notify the house and the senate appropriations committees 10 days in advance of such transfers .

the phssef received about $232 billion in funding across the four measures .

this accounts for 83% of all lhhs funds provided in the acts ( and 93% of the hhs funds in the lhhs titles of the bills ) .

these phssef funds may support various activities , including health care surge capacity and the development and purchase of medical countermeasures , including vaccines .

in general , phssef supplemental funding has been provided for four main sets of activities .

medical countermeasures and surge capacity: the first and third measures each provided funding to support the development , and in some cases federal purchase , of covid - 19 medical countermeasures , such as diagnostic tests , treatments , vaccines , and medical supplies , as well as for healthcare workforce and other surge capacity activities .

in total , approximately $30.4 billion has been provided for these activities .

note that the bills also specify that some of these funds are to be transferred elsewhere ( eg , to other federal agencies for the care of persons under federal quarantine ) or reserved for specific purposes or activities ( eg , deposits to the strategic national stockpile ) .

these activities may be carried out by various aspr components , especially the biomedical advanced research and development authority ( barda ) for countermeasure development and procurement .

covid - 19 testing for the uninsured : the second supplemental measure included $1 billion to provide reimbursements for covid - 19 testing and related services for persons who are uninsured .

in addition , the fourth measure specified that up to $1 billion out of the amounts appropriated for broader covid - 19 testing purposes ( discussed below ) may be used to cover the costs of testing for the uninsured .

both measures provide for these payments to be made according to the national disaster medical system ( ndms ) definitive care reimbursement mechanism .

however , the program is administered by hrsa .

provider relief fund: the third and fourth supplemental measures each provided funding for a "provider relief fund" to assist health care providers and facilities affected by the covid - 19 pandemic .

these funds are intended to reimburse eligible health care providers for health care - related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to covid - 19 .

the measures define eligible providers broadly as any that provide "diagnoses , testing , or care for individuals with possible or actual cases of covid - 19. .

in total , $175 billion has been appropriated for the provider relief fund .

covid - 19 testing , surveillance , and contact tracing : the fourth supplemental measure provided $25 billion to augment national capacity for covid - 19 containment , including expanded testing capacity , and workforce and technical capacity for disease surveillance and contact tracing .

the bill directed hhs to reserve some of these funds for specific purposes ( eg , not less than $11 billion is for states , localities , territories , tribes , tribal organizations , urban indian health organizations , or health service providers to tribes ) .

in addition , the bill specified that certain funds are to be transferred to other agencies and accounts ( eg , $600 million is to be transferred to the fda for diagnostic , serological , antigen , and other tests ) .

in addition to the activities specified above , phssef appropriations in the first , third , and fourth supplemental measures called for some portion of the funds to be transferred to other agencies or accounts for particular activities .

for instance , some phssef funds are required to be transferred to the hrsa for health centers , rural health , the ryan white hiv / aids program , and health care systems .

further public health - related funding for preparedness and response was appropriated to the cdc ( $6.5 billion ) and nih ( $1.8 billion ) in the first and third supplemental measures .

in addition , the fourth supplemental explicitly directed certain phssef appropriations to be transferred to cdc and nih for covid - 19 response activities .

when accounting for these transfers , total funding directed to the cdc would come to not less than $7.5 billion and total funding directed to nih would come to not less than $3.6 billion .

the cdc funding was intended , among other things , to support grants , or cooperative agreements with grants to states , localities , tribes and other entities , for public health activities ( eg , surveillance , infection control , diagnostics , laboratory support , and epidemiology ) , as well as for global disease detection and modernization of public health data collection .

the funds may also be used to support public outreach campaigns , and provide guidance to physicians , health care workers , and others .

most of the nih funding was provided to several institutes to support basic scientific research as well as research on potential vaccines , therapeutics , and diagnostics related to covid - 19 .

acl received a total of $1.2 billion in the second and third response measures .

the majority of this funding ( $750 million ) was spread across a variety of activities that the agency undertakes to help provide meals to low - income seniors .

samhsa received $425 million in the third measure , with $250 million for certified community behavioral health clinics , $50 million for suicide prevention programs , and not less than $15 million for indian tribes .

the measure specified that not less than $100 million be made available as emergency response grants for state governments for crisis intervention services , mental health and substance use disorder treatment , and recovery supports for individuals affected by the pandemic .

cms received $200 million in the third measure .

at least half of this appropriation was to be spent on additional infection control surveys for federally certified facilities with populations vulnerable to severe illness from covid - 19 .

acf received $6.3 billion in the third measure .

these funds were directed to a number of human services programs .

for instance , the child care and development block grant received $3.5 billion to provide continued assistance to child care providers in the event of decreased enrollment or program closures .

these funds may also be used to support child care facilities that are open and operating , including those providing care for the children of essential workers .

several other acf programs received funding , including the community services block grant ( $1 billion ) , head start ( $750 million ) , and the low income home energy assistance program ( $225 million ) .

almost all of the $30.925 billion in supplemental ed appropriations provided in the third measure are for the education stabilization fund ( esf ) .

the esf is composed of three emergency relief funds: ( 1 ) a governor's emergency education relief ( geer ) fund ( â§18002 ) , ( 2 ) an elementary and secondary school emergency relief fund ( esserf ; â§18003 ) , and ( 3 ) a higher education emergency relief ( heer ) fund ( â§18004 ) .

the third measure provided a total of $30.750 billion for the esf and specified that these funds are to remain available through september 30 , 2021 .

the geer fund may be used to provide emergency support through grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) that the state educational agency ( sea ) or governor determines to have been the most significantly impacted by covid - 19 .

emergency support may also be provided through grants to institutions of higher education ( ihes ) serving students within the state that the governor determines to have been the most significantly impacted by covid - 19 .

a governor may also choose to provide emergency support to any other ihe , lea , or education - related entity within the state that he or she deems "essential for carrying out emergency educational services" to students for a broad array of purposes ranging from any activity authorized under various federal education laws to the provision of child care and early childhood education , social and emotional support , and the protection of education - related jobs .

funds from the esserf are to be awarded to states based on their relative shares of grants awarded under title i - a of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended .

seas are required to provide at least 90% of the funds to leas to be used for myriad purposes such as any activity authorized under various federal education laws ( eg , esea ) , coordination of preparedness and response to the covid - 19 pandemic , technology acquisition , mental health , and activities related to summer learning .

funds retained by the sea must be used for emergency needs , as determined by the sea , to address issues in response to the covid - 19 pandemic and for administration .

the heer fund is to distribute funds to ihes to address needs directly related to the covid - 19 pandemic , including , but not limited to , transitioning courses to distance education and grant aid to students for their educational costs such as food , housing , course materials , health care , and child care .

the social security administration ( ssa ) received the largest amount ( $300 million ) among the related agencies .

these funds were provided to the ssa limitation on administrative expenses account to support the salaries and benefits of all ssa employees affected as a result of office closures .

the funds are also to be used for costs associated with telework , phone , and communication services for employees ; for overtime costs and supplies ; and for processing disability and retirement benefit workloads and backlogs .

 table 2 displays funding directed to lhhs programs and activities , as enacted , across the four covid - 19 supplemental appropriations acts .

it is organized by department or agency and by account , program , or activity .

the table also indicates a number of cases in which appropriations language reserved funds within a particular account for specific programs or activities , or directed that funds be transferred to other accounts .

it makes note of instances in which these reservations are for not less than ( nlt ) or not more than ( nmt ) a certain dollar amount .

in cases where the bill text calls for transfers , funds are shown in the account to which they were appropriated , not in the account to which they are to be transferred .
