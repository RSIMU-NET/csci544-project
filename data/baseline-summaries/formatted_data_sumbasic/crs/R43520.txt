this report is intended as an introduction to the laws and rules governing the community development block grant ( cdbg ) and related programs .

the cdbg program , administered by the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , was first authorized by title i of the housing and community development act ( hcda ) of 1974 , p.l .

93-383 .

the program is one of the largest and longest - standing federal block grants in existence , annually allocating billions of dollars in federal assistance to state and local governments in support of community and economic development efforts .

during the program's 40-year existence , congress has appropriated approximately $145 billion in cdbg - formula grants to help state and local governments undertake housing , economic development , neighborhood revitalization , and other community development activities .

congress has also appropriated approximately $50 billion in supplemental cdbg funds to address extraordinary events , including economic recessions , and manmade and natural disasters .

in fy2013 , the latest data available at this writing , the cdbg program was the largest source of federal assistance to state and local governments for community development activities , and the 20 th largest source of grant assistance to states and local governments , ranking behind such programs as federal aid to highways , transit assistance , aid for the education of the disadvantaged , school improvements , special education , medicaid and medicare , and temporary assistance to children and families .

federal grant assistance to state and local governments falls within three broad categories: ( 1 ) Â revenue sharing , ( 2 ) categorical grants , and ( 3 ) block grants .

revenue sharing is generally characterized as formula driven with broad discretion given to state and local governments while categorical grants are narrowly targeted to a specific activity or activities and may be awarded competitively or by formula .

the third category is block grants .

according to the now - defunct advisory commission on intergovernmental relations , a block grant is characterized by five basic traits: it authorizes federal aid for a wide range of activities within a broad functional area ; it gives recipient jurisdictions fairly substantial administrative discretion ; its administrative , fiscal reporting , planning , and program requirements are geared to keeping federal administrative intrusiveness to a minimum , while recognizing the need to ensure adequate oversight and that national goals are accomplished ; its formula - based distribution provision narrows grantor administrative discretion and provides some sense of fiscal certainty for grantees ; and its eligibility provision is fairly specific , relatively restrictive , and tends to favor units of general local government .

the cdbg program meets all of the above characteristics of a block grant .

there are three categories of recipients eligible for direct allocations of cdbg program funds: entitlement communities ( including insular areas ) , states , and section 107 special project grants .

the primary goal of the cdbg program is "the development of viable urban communities , by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities , principally for persons of low and moderate income. .

as a condition for receiving funds , the program's authorizing statute requires states and local governments to certify that proposed cdbg activities meet one of the program's three national objectives .

eligible activities must: principally benefit low - and moderate - income persons defined as families and individuals whose household incomes do not exceed 80% of a jurisdiction's median income ; aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight ; or meet an urgent need by addressing conditions that pose a serious and immediate threat to the health and safety of residents .

the statute governing the program also requires states and entitlement communities to allocate at least 70% of their cdbg allocation , during a one - , two - , or three - year period specified by the grantee , to eligible activities principally benefitting low - and moderate - income persons .

the statute and regulations governing the cdbg program detail the specific requirements and responsibilities of entitlement communities ; states ; nonentitlement communities ; and hud , the federal administering agency .

starting in 1995 , hud revamped the cdbg application and planning requirements as part of a larger reinventing government effort carried out by the clinton administration .

most significantly , as part of its reinvention efforts , the department published new rules governing planning and reporting requirements for cdbg , home , emergency solution grants , and housing opportunities for persons with aids .

the rules consolidated planning and performance reporting requirements for these four programs and required eligible jurisdictions to designate a single starting date for the four grant programs .

consistent with the growing focus on the devolution of authority to lower levels of government , hud anticipated that the consolidated plan would: encourage communities and states to develop comprehensive , coordinated approaches in the administration of federal housing and community development programs ; reduce federal paperwork requirements ; improve program accountability through the use of measurable goals ; and strengthen citizen participation .

when initially issuing these planning and reporting regulations , hud noted that the consolidated submission replaced the comprehensive housing assistance strategy ( chas ) of the home program , the community development plan required by the cdbg program , emergency shelter grants ( now emergency solutions grants ) and housing opportunities for people with aids applications .

the rule also consolidated the reporting requirements for these programs , replacing five general performance reports with one performance report .

as noted by hud , the consolidated plan and consolidated report replaced 12 previously required documents .

after amounts specified in an appropriations act are allocated to section 107 special - purpose activities and other identified activities , 70% of the remaining funds are allocated by formula to entitlement communities , and 30% to the states for distribution to nonentitlement communities .

funds are awarded to entitlement communities based on the higher yield from one of two weighted formulas using population , housing , and poverty data .

title i of the hcda identifies the categories of eligible activities that may be undertaken with cdbg funds .

program activities fall into five general categories: planning and administrative activities ; public works and public facilities ; housing - related activities ; public services ; and economic development .

table 1 is an illustrative list of eligible activities by categories .

ineligible activities include the acquisition , construction , or renovation of buildings used for the conduct of general local government ; the pirating of jobs and economic activity from another jurisdiction ; the construction of new housing ; the acquisition of construction equipment ; and political activities .

in addition to authorizing funding of cdbg formula grants , the cdbg authorizing statute also includes language authorizing other programs and activities intended to work in coordination with cdbg formula grant in support of the program's national objectives .

this includes set - asides for indian tribes and programs that provide loan guarantees in support of large scale economic development projects , programs that support the redevelopment of brownfields , provisions that provide disaster assistance , and provisions that support special projects .

in addition , in the wake of the mortgage crisis , congress has also used the cdbg program's framework to support local and state government efforts to acquire , rehabilitate , and resell abandoned and foreclosed housing .

this section provides brief descriptions of those programs .

august 22 , 2014 , will mark the 40 th anniversary of the enactment of the housing and community development act of 1974 , p.l .

93-383 , including title i of the act which created the cdbg program .

this landmark piece of legislation and the program it created , though amended over time , has remained relatively true to the principles of the block grant concept , which stresses local flexibility and discretion in the development and execution of housing and community development plans and activities .

because of its formula - based approach , the program has encouraged communities to undertake long - range , multi - phase redevelopment efforts .

congress has modified the program over time , including increasing the number of activities eligible for funding , shifting the percentage of funds awarded to entitlement communities , creating a second allocation formula to address concerns that the first formula was regionally biased , and granting state governments direct administrative control of a segment of the program .

congress has also authorized related programs intended to supplement , but not supplant , the cdbg program .

some observers contend that the proliferation of these so - called supplemental programs divert resources from the core program .
