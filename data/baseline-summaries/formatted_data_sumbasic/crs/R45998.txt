over the past couple of decades , national attention to "emerging contaminants" or "contaminants of emerging concern" ( cecs ) in surface water and groundwater has been increasing .

although there is no federal statutor y or regulatory definition of cecs , generally , the term refers to unregulated substances detected in the environment that may present a risk to human health , aquatic life , or the environment .

cecs can include many different types of manmade chemicals and substancesâsuch as those in personal care products , pharmaceuticals , industrial chemicals , lawn care and agricultural products , and microplasticsâas well as naturally occurring substances such as algal toxins or manganese .

cecs often enter the environment , including ground and surface waters , via municipal and industrial wastewater discharges and urban and agricultural storm runoff .

although municipal and industrial wastewater are both treated prior to discharge into waterways , treatment facilities are often not designed to remove cecs .

the availability of data on cecsâsuch as concentration and pervasiveness in the environment or exposure or toxicity data that would help determine their risk to humans and aquatic lifeâmay be limited .

in some cases , detections of cecs in the environment have triggered a call for action from federal , state , and local government , as well as congress .

increased monitoring and detections of one particular group of chemicals , per - and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( pfas ) , has recently heightened public and congressional interest in these cecs and has also prompted a broader discussion about how cecs are identified , detected , and regulated and whether additional actions should be taken to protect human health and the environment .

several statutesâincluding the safe drinking water act ; the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) ; the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) ; and the clean water act ( cwa ) âprovide authorities to the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) and states to address particular cecs .

in the 116 th congress , members have introduced more than 40 bills to address pfas through various means .

multiple bills , including house - and senate - passed national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) bills for fy2020 ( h.r .

2500 and s. 1790 , respectively ) , would direct epa to take regulatory and other actions to address pfas under several environmental statutes .

two of these bills ( h.r .

2500 and h.r .

3616 ) would direct epa to address pfas using authorities provided to the agency under the cwa , which congress established to restore and protect the quality of the nation's surface waters .

global concern about another group of cecsâmicroplasticsâand their potential impacts has also been mounting .

recent studies have found that treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants can be key sources of microplastics , as can runoff from agricultural sites where sewage sludge from the wastewater treatment process has been applied as fertilizer .

as with many other cecs , wastewater treatment facilities are generally not designed to screen for microplastic debris , such as microbeads , plastic fragments , or plastic fibers from clothing .

congress has shown interest in addressing the impacts of plastic pollution .

in 2015 , congress passed legislation to ban plastic microbeads from rinse - off personal care products ( "microbead - free waters act of 2015," p.l .

114-114 ) .

more recently , some members in the 116 th congress announced plans to introduce comprehensive legislation to address plastic waste in fall 2019 .

some stakeholders have asserted that epa could be more effective in using its existing cwa authorities to address cecs , while others have suggested a need to identify and address potential gaps in cwa authorities through amendments to the statute .

this report examines authorities available to address cecs under the cwa .

epa has several cwa authorities it may use to address cecs , although it faces some challenges in doing so .

the cwa's stated objective is "to restore and maintain the chemical , physical , and biological integrity of the nation's waters. .

to help achieve this objective , the cwa prohibits the discharge of pollutants from any point source ( i.e. , a discrete conveyance , such as a pipe , ditch , etc. ) .

to waters of the united states without a permit .

under the cwa , one of the primary mechanisms to protect or improve surface water quality is to limit or prohibit discharges of contaminants , including cecs , in national pollutant discharge elimination system ( npdes ) permits .

the cwa authorizes epa and delegated states to set limits or prohibit discharges of pollutants in permits through technology - based effluent ( i.e. , discharge ) limitations and standards and through water - quality - based effluent limitations , which are established through water quality standards and criteria .

technology - based effluent limitations are specific numerical limits ( i.e. , maximum allowable levels of specific pollutants ) that represent the minimum level of control that must be established in a permit .

in cases where technology - based effluent limitations are not adequate to meet applicable water quality standards , the permits also incorporate water - quality - based effluent limitations .

water - quality - based effluent limitations are specific limits established in a permit that , if not exceeded in the discharge , allow for attainment of water quality standards in the receiving water .

water quality standardsâestablished by states , territories , tribes , and epaâdefine the desired condition or level of protection of a water body and what is needed to achieve or protect that condition .

in addition , the cwa authorizes epa to designate contaminants as toxic pollutants ( cwa â§307 ) or as hazardous substances ( cwa â§311 ) , which may trigger other actions under the cwa and cercla .

this section first identifies the authorities available under the cwa , their applicability to cecs , and potential challenges with epa use of these authorities .

recent congressional interest in cecs has largely focused on addressing one particular group of cecsâpfasâand addressing them through several statutes , such as the safe drinking water act .

however , legislation in the 116 th congress proposes to address pfas using cwa authorities .

h.r .

3616 âthe clean water standards for pfas act of 2019âand section 330a of h.r .

2500 , the house - passed version of the ndaa for fy2020 , would direct epa to add pfas to the cwa toxic pollutant list and publish elgs and pretreatment standards for pfas within specified time frames .

in addition , section 330g of the house - passed version of the ndaa bill , sections 6731-6736 of s. 1790 ( the senate ndaa bill ) , h.r .

1976 , and s. 950 would direct the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) to carry out nationwide samplingâin consultation with states and epaâto determine the concentration of perfluorinated compounds in surface water , groundwater , and soil .

these bills would also require usgs to prepare a report for congress and provide the sampling data to the epa as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies that request it .

additionally , the bills would require the data to be used to "inform and enhance assessments of exposure , likely health and environmental impacts , and remediation priorities. .

some members have also introduced legislation to require comprehensive pfas toxicity testing ( h.r .

2608 ) .

in addition to focusing on pfas , several bills proposed in the 116 th congress look more broadly at how to address cecs .

for example , some aim to improve federal coordination and research and support states in addressing emerging contaminants .

s. 1507 , s. 1251 , and sections 6741-6742 of s. 1790 would direct the white house office of science and technology policy to establish a national emerging contaminant research initiative .

the bills would also direct epa to develop a program to provide technical assistance and support to states for testing and analysis of emerging contaminants and establish a database of resources available through the program to assist states with testing for emerging contaminants .

while these efforts are more focused on cecs in drinking water , the bill directs the epa to ensure that the database is available to groups that have interest in emerging contaminants , including wastewater utilities .

while congress is currently debating how to best address the concerns related to widespread detections of pfas , attention to other emerging contaminants ( eg , microplastics and algal toxins ) has also increased with the availability of new detection methods and increased monitoring .

observers note that in the coming years , other cecs will likely emerge and prompt similar calls for immediate action to protect public health and the environment .

many observers argue that federal actions to address cecs currently tend to be reactive rather than proactive .

many of these observers assert that more focus and attention is needed on assessing the toxicity of chemical substances before they are introduced into commerce .

congress is currently considering legislation to improve federal coordination and responses to cecs .

specific to the cwa , some observers advocate for oversight to identify and address potential gaps or barriers in cwa authorities and processes that make it difficult for epa and states to quickly respond when cecs are detected .

other observers assert that epa could better use its existing authorities to address cecs .

for example , epa has not updated its elgs for certain industrial categories in decades .

accordingly , some observers assert that various elgs do not reflect advancements in science or technology that could lead to new effluent limitations for cecs .

similarly , some stakeholders assert that epa could better prioritize which cecs warrant water quality criteria development .

epa's ability to address these and other recommendations depends on the availability of resources , treatment technologies , and scientific and economic data .

moving forward , congress may be interested in evaluating epa appropriations for the cwa programs that support epa's efforts to address discharges of cecs .

congress may also be interested in overseeing the administration's implementation of these programs .
