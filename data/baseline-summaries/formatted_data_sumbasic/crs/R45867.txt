cigarette use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the united states , claiming an estimated 480,000 lives or more each year .

further , between 2009 and 2012 , cigarette smoking - attributable economic costs totaled over $289 billion in the united states .

although cigarette use in the united states continues to decline , according to centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) analyses , 34.2 million american adults smoked cigarettes every day or some days in 2018 , and nearly 1.2 million american middle and high school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days in 2019 .

electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ends ) have become popular in recent years , particularly among youth .

ends is an umbrella term for various types of electronic tobacco products , including electronic cigarettes ( e - cigarettes ) .

an e - cigarette is a battery - operated device typically containing nicotine , flavorings , and other chemicals that , when heated , creates inhalable aerosol ( i.e. , vapor ) .

according to cdc analyses , 8.1 million american adults used e - cigarettes every day or some days in 2018 .

about 5.4 million american middle and high school students used an e - cigarette in the past 30 days in 2019 .

there has been debate in the public health community regarding the public health impact of ends products .

some view them as a safer alternative for adults who smoke cigarettes because the aerosol produced from e - cigarettes is considered less harmful in the short - term than combusted smoke produced from cigarettes .

however , others are alarmed by the marked increase in ends use among youth , and are concerned that these products may undo the years of tobacco control efforts that have successfully reduced cigarette smoking among both youth and adults .

further , the emergence of e - cigarette , or vaping , product use - associated lung injury ( evali ) that has resulted in 60 deaths and 2,711 hospitalizations as of january 21 , 2020 has raised concern among public health stakeholders , congress , and the general public .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for regulating the manufacture , marketing , distribution , and sale of tobacco products .

fda's center for tobacco products ( ctp ) âestablished in 2009 pursuant to the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act of 2009 ( tca ; p.l .

111-31 ) âis primarily responsible for tobacco product regulation .

the tca established ffdca chapter ix , under which fda is authorized to regulate tobacco products .

within ctp , the tobacco products scientific advisory committee ( tpsac ) provides recommendations on tobacco regulatory decisions or any other matter listed in chapter ix of the ffdca .

the tpsac includes 12 members with diversified experience and expertise .

because tobacco products have no added health benefits , fda's regulation of these products differs in certain respects from fda's regulation of medical products under its jurisdiction ( eg , prescription drugs , biologics , and medical devices ) .

similar to medical product manufacturers , tobacco product manufacturers are subject to manufacturer requirements , including payment of user fees , registration establishment , and premarket review , among others .

however , while medical product manufacturers are generally required to meet a standard of safety and effectiveness to receive premarket approval from fda , tobacco product manufacturers are instead generally required to meet a standard of "appropriate for the protection of public health" to receive marketing authorization .

in addition , tobacco product manufacturers , importers , distributors , and retailers are required to comply with certain tobacco - specific requirements that have been authorized under the tca as a result of the unique harms that tobacco products pose to human health .

examples of such requirements include the development of tobacco product standards , testing and reporting of ingredients , submission of health information to the agency , and distribution and promotion restrictions , among others .

this report describes ( 1 ) fda's authority to regulate tobacco products ; ( 2 ) general requirements for manufacturers of tobacco products , many of which are modeled after medical product requirements ; ( 3 ) requirements that are unique to tobacco product manufacturers , distributors , importers , and retailers ; and ( 4 ) compliance and enforcement .

the report concludes with a discussion of policy issues and considerations for congress .

appendix a describes the iqos tobacco heating system , appendix b briefly summarizes the tobacco master settlement agreement of 1998 , appendix c provides definitions of terms used in this report , and appendix d provides acronyms used in this report .

as amended by the tca , section 901 of the ffdca gives fda the authority to regulate the manufacture , marketing , sale , and distribution of tobacco products .

a tobacco product is defined as "any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption , including any component , part , or accessory of a tobacco product ( except for raw materials other than tobacco used in manufacturing a component , part , or accessory of a tobacco product ) . .

any article that is a drug , device , or combination product ( a combination of a drug , device , or biological product ) is excluded from the definition of tobacco product .

drugs , devices , and combination products are subject to chapter v authorities under the ffdca .

however , it is not always clear whether a product that is derived from tobacco should be regulated as a drug , device , combination product , or a tobacco product ( eg , an ends product that makes certain health claims ) .

as such , fda has promulgated regulations to provide assistance to manufacturers intending to market products that are made or derived from tobacco based on the products' "intended uses. .

upon enactment , the tca explicitly covered the following tobacco products: cigarettes and cigarette tobacco , roll - your - own tobacco , and smokeless tobacco .

however , the tca gave fda the broad authority to regulate any other tobacco products deemed by the agency to meet the definition of a tobacco product and thus subject to chapter ix of the ffdca .

in 2016 , fda promulgated regulations ( known as "the deeming rule" ) that extended the agency's authority over all tobacco products that were not already subject to the ffdca , including ends , cigars , pipe tobacco , hookah tobacco , nicotine gels , dissolvable tobacco , and other tobacco products that may be developed in the future .

figure 1 shows each of the tobacco products currently under fda's authority .

tobacco product manufacturers are subject to certain requirements , including payment of user fees , registration establishment , premarket review , and postmarket surveillance , among others .

in the sections below , manufacturer requirements are discussed for tobacco products overall , with exceptions for issues unique to certain classes of tobacco products .

tobacco product manufacturers , importers , distributors , and retailers are required to comply with certain tobacco - specific requirements as a result of the unique harms that tobacco products pose to human health .

each of these requirements is described below , and most requirements apply to all tobacco products , with some specified exceptions .

if fda finds that a retailer , manufacturer , importer , or distributor is not complying with ffdca chapter ix requirements or fda regulations , the agency can take corrective action .

such corrective actions include warning letters , civil money penalty ( cmp ) complaints , and no - tobacco - sale order ( ntso ) complaints , as well as seizures , injunctions , and criminal prosecution ( with the department of justice ) .

although the tca expanded fda's authority to regulate tobacco products in 2009 , stakeholders have recently identified several issues related to the regulation of these products that may be of interest to congress: fda and public health stakeholders remain concerned about the marked increase in use of ends among youth over the past few years , and many in the public health community argue that this increase is largely driven by the availability of youth - friendly flavors in these products .

while the public health community generally views ends as a safer alternative for adult cigarette smokers , there is concern that increased use of ends among youth may undo the years of tobacco control efforts that have successfully reduced cigarette smoking among both youth and adults .

the emergence of evali has further heightened concern among public health stakeholders , congress , and the general public .

public health stakeholders have been concerned about youth access to tobacco products more broadly and expressed support for raising the minimum age of access for tobacco products from 18 to 21 years of age .

congress recently made this change legislatively , but some want congress to take further action to address tobacco use among youth .

the remote sales of tobacco productsâincluding endsâmay be an opportunity for youth to purchase tobacco products illegally , due to difficulties in enforcing purchasing restrictions through this medium .

generally separate from the aforementioned public health issues , another issue concerns fda's authority to collect tobacco user fees .

more specifically , fda has determined that it currently does not have the authority to assess user fees from ends manufacturers and importers , despite these products being deemed subject to fda regulation .

these four issues are discussed in detail below , along with potential considerations for policymakers .

since the emergence of ends in the tobacco marketplace , there has been ongoing debate regarding their public health impact .

the public health community generally views them as a harm reduction tool for adults who specifically smoke cigarettes .

harm reduction refers to the replacement of a more harmful activity with a less harmful one when elimination of the activity is difficult or infeasible .

ends have the potential to reduce harm among adult cigarette smokers who have experienced difficulty quitting , as the aerosol from ends "contains fewer numbers and lower levels of most toxicants than does smoke from combustible tobacco cigarettes. .

yet the data are complex regarding the effectiveness of ends as a harm reduction or cessation tool for adults who smoke cigarettes .

as of early 2018 , the national academies of sciences , engineering , and medicine ( nasem ) concluded that "there is general agreement that the number , size , and quality of studies for judging the effectiveness of e - cigarettes as cessation aids in comparison with cessation aids of proven efficacy are limited , and therefore there is insufficient evidence to permit a definitive conclusion at this time. .

further , the long - term health effects associated with use of ends are still largely unknown , and fda has not yet approved any ends products as cessation devices .

in spite of these questions , many adult cigarette smokers have expressed an interest in ends as a way to quit cigarette smoking .

some argue that having adults completely switch from cigarettes to ends can generally be viewed as positive for the public's health , given the morbidity and mortality associated with cigarette smoking .

however , many in the public health community are alarmed by the marked increase in use of ends products among youth , which are now the most popular tobacco product used among this age group .

research studies suggest that this change has occurred , in large part , as a result of access to flavored ends products .

the availability of flavored ends products has created tension between industry and the public health community .

industry - funded research suggests that availability of flavored ends may be more appealing to adult cigarette smokers ( in comparison to nonsmoking teens ) and could help adult cigarette smokers quit cigarette smoking .

conversely , one systematic review of the literature found that both youth and adults enjoy flavors in e - cigarettes .

however , the authors of this review stated that "in terms of whether flavored e - cigarettes assisted [adults] quitting smoking , we found inconclusive evidence. .

in combination , numerous studies have documented that flavors entice youth to initiate and continue using tobacco products , including ends .

further , the nasem concluded that there is substantial evidence that ends use among youth increases the risk of such youth ever using cigarettes , leading to concern that tobacco control efforts that have successfully reduced cigarette smoking among both youth and adults will be diminished .

the culmination of these factors raises questions about how to regulate ends products going forward and , specifically , how to address flavors in tobacco products ( including ends ) .

in march 2019 , fda released a draft guidance document specifying its intended enforcement activities related to flavored ends .

this guidance specified that fda would prioritize enforcement of premarket review , distribution , and sale requirements related to certain flavored ends products that may be most accessible to youth .

for example , fda would prioritize enforcement of distribution and sale requirements in retail locations where certain flavored ends products may be most accessible to youth , such as in convenience stores and gas stations that do not have adult - only sections .

in september 2019 , fda announced that it would finalize this guidance document "in the coming weeks," with the intention of clearing "the market of flavored e - cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e - cigarette use. .

delays in guidance finalization led to a congressional hearing on december 4 , 2019 to investigate the cause for delay .

in january 2020 , fda released the final guidance document , with some changes compared to the draft guidance .

specifically , the march 2019 draft guidance focused enforcement of premarket authorization requirements based on how and where ends products are sold , while the final guidance focuses enforcement of premarket authorization requirements based on ends product characteristics ( eg , cartridge - based products ) .

some public health stakeholders expressed concern that the final guidance does not go far enough to reduce ends use among youth .

in response to concerns regarding youth access to ends products , including flavored ends products , congress may consider further limiting when flavors can be used in ends .

congress may also choose to outright ban all flavors ( including menthol ) in endsâas well as in other tobacco productsâas some legislation introduced in the 116 th congress has proposed .

congress may consider proposals that reduce any tobacco product use , including ends , among youth while leaving the option of ends use open for adult cigarette smokers in order to benefit the public's health .

congress may also consider how availability of flavored tobacco products would fit into those proposals .

amidst a rise in ends use among youth , the emergence of evali has raised concern among public health stakeholders , the general public , and congress .

according to cdc , data suggest that the outbreak began in june 2019 .

emergency department ( ed ) visits reached a peak in september 2019 , but have since declined .

as of january 21 , 2020 , 60 deaths have been confirmed in 27 states and dc , and 2,711 hospitalized evali cases have been reported to cdc in all 50 states , dc , puerto rico , and the u.s. virgin islands .

among hospitalized evali patients with available data , 66% were male and 76% were under 35 years old .

further , among a subset of hospitalized evali patients , 82% reported using tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) - containing products .

although the causes of evali are still unknown , laboratory data suggest that vitamin e acetateâan additive found in some thc - containing ends productsâis closely associated with evali .

vitamin e acetate is commonly used as a dietary supplement and in skin creams .

while the ingestion and dermal use of vitamin e acetate is not generally associated with adverse health effects , the safety of inhaling vitamin e acetate has not been closely examined .

fda and cdc , along with state and local health departments , have been working together closely to investigate the issue .

fda , the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , and local and state authorities have also been investigating the supply chain of ends associated with evali .

fda and dea announced that they have seized 44 websites that were advertising the sale of illicit thc - containing vape cartridges , although none of the products advertised on the websites have been linked to any cases of evali .

such thc - containing products may raise a larger question of federal oversight pertaining to these products that are available in states permitting the sale of marijuana for recreational or medicinal purposes .

marijuanaâincluding marijuana - derived compounds such as thcâis an illicit substance at the federal level subject to dea enforcement and regulatory control .

however , some states have implemented their own laws on marijuana pertaining to recreational and medicinal use , and the dea has largely focused resources on criminal networks involved in the illicit marijuana trade .

therefore , thc - containing ends products available for sale in states that are allowing recreational and medicinal marijuana may not be the focus of dea's current enforcement efforts and regulation .

further , ends products that do not contain any components , parts , or accessories that are derived from tobacco ( eg , do not contain nicotine ) and are not expected to be consumed like a tobacco product may not meet the definition of a tobacco product under the ffdca .

therefore , such products may not be subject to fda regulatory requirements pertaining to tobacco products .

fda has indicated that the agency would regulate such products on a "case - by - case basis , based on the totality of the circumstances. .

many public health stakeholders have been concerned about youth access to tobacco products more broadly and expressed support for raising the minimum age of purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21 .

numerous scientific studies and surgeon general reports have documented that tobacco product use often begins before the age of 18 .

nearly 90% of cigarette smokers have tried their first cigarette by age 18 , and 98% have tried their first cigarette by age 26 .

the tca required fda to commission a report on the public health impact of raising the minimum age of tobacco product sales .

fda contracted with the institute of medicine ( now known as the national academy of medicine ) , and concluded in a 2015 report that "increasing the minimum age of legal access to tobacco products will likely prevent or delay the initiation of tobacco use by adolescents and young adults. .

however , the report noted that "the impact on initiation of tobacco use of raising the minimum age of legal access to tobacco products to 21 will likely be substantially higher than raising it to 19 , but the added effect of raising the minimum age of legal access beyond age 21 to age 25 will likely be considerably smaller. .

in fy2020 appropriations , congress amended the ffdca to raise the federal minimum age of tobacco product sales to 21 .

fda is also required to update its regulations by june 20 , 2020 to reflect the new federal minimum age of tobacco purchasing , as well as the federal minimum age verification requirement ( age verification required for individuals less than 30 years of age ) .

the final rule is required to take effect by september 20 , 2020 .

while public health stakeholders view this development in a positive light , some are concerned that the tobacco industry supported this initiative to avoid other measures that could also curb tobacco useâincluding ends useâamong youth .

related to the issue of youth access to tobacco productsâincluding endsâsome have identified remote sales ( i.e. , non - face - to - face sales ) as an opportunity for minors to illegally purchase tobacco products , due to difficulties in enforcing purchasing restrictions through this medium .

while the prevent all cigarette trafficking ( pact ) act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-154 ) placed certain restrictions on remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco , it did not outright prohibit them .

further , the pact act limits the ability of states and local governments to regulate the delivery carriers involved in remote salesâcomplicating enforcement effortsâand did not place such restrictions on other tobacco products , such as ends .

section 906 of the ffdca requires fda to promulgate regulations on remote sales of tobacco products , including age verification requirements .

in 2011 , fda issued an anprm regarding remote sales and distribution of tobacco products , but has not taken further regulatory action since that time .

legislation has been introduced in the 116 th congress that would ban all tobacco product remote sales , including remote sales of ends .

as has been proposed previously , congress may also consider amending the pact act to extend its provisions to other tobacco products beyond cigarettes and smokeless tobacco , such as ends .

as mentioned , fda does not collect user fees from ends manufacturers and importers .

given recent concerns around ends products , ctp has dedicated a portion of its user fees paid by other tobacco product manufacturers and importers to address ends - specific issues .

therefore , some stakeholders have suggested that manufacturers and importers of ends products be subject to tobacco user fees to offset costs associated with fda's current and future ends - specific activities .

however , fda has determined that it currently does not have the authority to assess user fees from ends manufacturers and importers because congress did not specify an enumerated class for ends products and did not provide a framework by which fda could potentially assess user fees for ends products .

based on fda's interpretation , in order for ends manufacturers to be subject to the tobacco product user fees , congress would need to provide fda with the statutory framework for doing so .

for example , congress may consider amending both the fetra formula and section 919 of the ffdca .

however , ends products are not currently subject to federal excise taxes , and such taxes are a critical component of the fetra formula ( see " user fees " ) .

therefore , if congress were to amend fetra and the ffdca to explicitly provide fda the authority to assess user fees on ends manufacturers and importers , congress would likely need to amend the internal revenue code ( irc ) to make ends products subject to federal excise taxes .

another option for congress may be to create a new , separate ends user fee program .

there has been recent congressional and executive branch interest in requiring ends manufacturers and importers to pay user fees .

legislation has been introduced in the 116 th congress that would either amend the ffdca's current user fee structure by striking the fetra provisions to allow for assessment of ends user fees , or create a new , separate ends user fee program .

the fy2021 president's budget request also proposes requiring ends manufacturers and importers ( along with manufacturers and importers of certain other deemed products ) to pay $100 million in user fees starting in fy2021 .

however , based on fda's current interpretation , user fees could not be collected from ends manufacturers and importers without first enacting authorizing legislation .

appendix a .

the iqos tobacco heating system the iqos tobacco heating system ( iqos ) is commonly referred to as a "heat - not - burn" tobacco product .

this new technology differs from ends technology because it aerosolizes the tobacco plant itself , rather than a tobacco - derived e - liquid .

fda has determined that the iqos meets the definition of a cigarette and , as such , is subject to additional ffdca requirements and regulations specific to cigarettes , such as advertising restrictions .

the iqos is composed of three main components: the iqos heatstick is a filtered , noncombusted cigarette .

a heatstick is designed to be electrically heated to release nicotine - containing aerosol .

the nicotine is derived from a reconstituted tobacco sheet made from ground tobacco powder .

the iqos holder is an electrically powered and rechargeable unit that holds and warms the heatstick .

the holder is used for a single heatstick for about six to seven minutes , after which the holder needs to be charged and the used heatstick is discarded .

the iqos charger recharges and cleans the holder after each use .

given the novel technology of the iqos , some industry stakeholders see this product as a potential precedent for the premarket review process that ends products will eventually undergo .

on may 15 , 2017 , fda received pmtas from phillip morris international ( pmi ) for the iqos tobacco heating system ( iqos ) .

pmi filed four pmta applications for the iqos .

three pmta applications were for the heatstickâtwo of which were for menthol flavored heatsticksâand one pmta application was for the holder and charger .

nearly two years later , on april 30 , 2019 , fda authorized the iqos tobacco heating system for marketing through these pmtas .

based on the substantial back and forth between pmi and fda to elicit the information needed for the complete pmta applications , there is concern that small ends manufacturers may not have the resources to engage in the pmta process in the future .

there is also concern that fda may need additional resources to accommodate the inevitable influx of lengthy ends pmta applications .

appendix b .

tobacco master settlement agreement of 1998 on november 23 , 1998 , attorneys general from 46 states , the district of columbia , and the u.s. territories signed a contractual agreement ( the master settlement agreement , or msa ) with the major cigarette companies to settle state lawsuits to recover the costs , borne by medicaid and other public programs , of treating smoking - related illnesses .

the remaining four states â mississippi , florida , texas , and minnesota â had settled individually with the companies prior to the msa .

under the terms of the msa , the companies agreed to make annual payments in perpetuity and accept certain restrictions on tobacco product advertising , marketing , and promotion .

specifically , the msa: prohibited cigarette companies from targeting youth in the advertising , promotion , or marketing of their products ; banned the use of cartoons in advertising ; limited each company to brand - name sponsorship of one sporting or cultural event a year , excluding concerts , team sports , events with a significant youth audience , or events with underage contestants ; banned public transit advertising ; banned outdoor billboard advertising , excluding billboard advertising for brand - name sponsored events ; limited advertising outside retail stores to signs no bigger than 14 sq .

ft ; banned company payments to promote cigarettes in various media , including movies and tv ; banned non - cigarette apparel with brand - name logos except at brand - name sponsored events ; banned gifts of non - cigarette items to youth in exchange for cigarettes ; restricted the use of nationally recognized non - tobacco brand names for cigarettes ; and limited free samples of cigarettes to adult - only facilities .
