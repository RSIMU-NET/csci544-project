congress uses an annual appropriations process to provide discretionary spending for federal government agencies .

the responsibility for drafting legislation to provide such spending is currently divided among 12 appropriations subcommittees in each chamber , each of which is tasked with reporting a regular appropriations bill to cover all programs under its jurisdiction .

the timetable currently associated with this process requires the enactment of these regular appropriations bills prior to the beginning of the fiscal year ( october 1 ) .

if regular appropriations are not enacted by that deadline , one or more continuing resolutions ( crs ) may be enacted to provide funds until all regular appropriations bills are completed or the fiscal year ends .

during the fiscal year , supplemental appropriations may also be enacted to provide funds in addition to those in regular appropriations acts or crs .

amounts provided in these appropriations acts are subject to limits , both procedural and statutory , that are enforced through respective mechanisms such as points of order and sequestration .

the timing and focus of the fy2015 appropriations process was affected at the outset by at least three significant factors .

first , the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( p.l .

113-67 ) provided set levels for the fy2015 statutory discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense spending .

it also provided an alternative basis for procedural budget enforcement in the absence of a budget resolution .

this agreement was enacted on december 26 , 2013 , about nine months ahead of the start of fy2015 .

at about the time of its enactment , some observers asserted that the earliness with which funding levels had been provided could contribute to the enactment of some or all of the fy2015 appropriations bills before the fiscal year began .

in addition , in establishing levels for defense and nondefense spending , some observers suggested that the debate over fy2015 appropriations would be focused on the specifics of funding various agencies and programs instead of on overall levels of budgetary resources .

the second and third significant factors that affected the start of the fy2015 appropriations process were the late enactment of fy2014 regular appropriations and the delays in the president's budget submission to congress .

regular appropriations for fy2014 were not enacted until january 17 , 2014 , more than three months after the beginning of the fiscal year .

the president's budget submission followed about six weeks later , roughly one month after it was due .

the bulk of the submission occurred on march 4 , with additional details provided the following week .

the overseas contingency operations / global war on terrorism ( oco / gwot ) portion of the submission was not provided until june 26 .

in response to these delays , the house and senate appropriations committees conducted hearings on a condensed schedule to allow committee action on the draft appropriations bills to begin during the months of april and may .

none of the fy2015 regular appropriations bills were enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year .

in the 113 th congress , the house appropriations committee reported 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills , and the house passed seven of these .

during that same congress , the senate appropriations committee reported eight of the regular bills .

although one of them received floor consideration , none was passed by the senate .

consequently , on september 19 , 2014 , a fy2015 cr ( p.l .

113-164 ) was enacted into law to provide temporary funding through december 11 , 2014 .

two further extensions of this cr were enacted to provide temporary funding for all 12 regular appropriations bills through december 13 and december 17 ( p.l .

113-202 and p.l .

113-203 , respectively ) .

on december 16 , 2014 , regular appropriations for 11 out of the 12 regular appropriations bills were enacted as part of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( divisions a - k of ( p.l .

113-235 ) ; the fy2015 consolidated act ) .

a fourth cr was also enacted in division l of p.l .

113-235 to extend temporary funding for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) through february 27 , 2015 .

action on fy2015 appropriations also occurred in the early part of the 114 th congress .

on february 27 , a fifth cr was enacted to further extend temporary funding for dhs through march 6 , 2015 ( h.r .

33 ; p.l .

114-3 ) .

full year appropriations for the dhs were ultimately signed into law on march 4 , 2015 ( h.r .

240 ) .

this report provides background and analysis on congressional action related to the fy2015 appropriations process .

the first section discusses the status of discretionary budget enforcement for fy2015 , including the statutory spending limits and allocations normally associated with the congressional budget resolution .

the second section provides information on the consideration and enactment of regular appropriations and an overview of aggregate discretionary spending .

the third section discusses the legislative action on fy2015 crs and associated budget enforcement considerations .

further information with regard to the fy2015 regular appropriations bills is provided in the various crs reports that analyze and compare the components of the current house and senate proposals .

the framework for budget enforcement of discretionary spending under the congressional budget process has both statutory and procedural elements .

the statutory elements are the discretionary spending limits derived from the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) .

the procedural elements are primarily associated with the budget resolution and limit both total discretionary spending and spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee .

the house and senate currently provide annual appropriations in 12 regular appropriations bills .

each of these bills may be considered and enacted separately , but it is also possible for two or more of them to be combined into an omnibus vehicle for consideration and enactment .

alternatively , if some of these bills are not enacted , funding for the projects and activities therein may be provided through a full - year cr .

none of the fy2015 regular appropriations bills was enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year , october 1 , 2014 .

final action for 11 out of the 12 regular appropriations bills occurred during the 113 th congress with the enactment of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( divisions a - k of p.l .

113-235 , the fy2015 consolidated act ) on december 16 , 2014 .

the fy2015 department of homeland security appropriations act was considered and enacted during the first months of the 114 th congress , on march 4 , 2015 ( h.r .

240 ) .

because none of the fy2015 regular appropriations bills was to be enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year , a cr ( h.j.res .

124 ; p.l .

113-164 ) was enacted on september 19 , 2014 .

this cr generally extended funding at last year's levels , with a small across - the - board reduction and certain enumerated exceptions , through december 11 , 2014 .

two additional crs were enacted to extend temporary funding for all 12 regular appropriations bills through december 13 and december 17 ( p.l .

113-202 and p.l .

113-203 , respectively ) .

a fourth cr was enacted as part of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act to extend temporary funding for dhs through february 27 , 2015 ( division l , h.r .

83 ) .

on february 27 , a fifth cr was enacted to further extend funding through march 3 , 2015 ( h.r .

33 ; p.l .

114-3 ) , after another cr ( h.j.res .

35 ) was defeated on the house floor .

the continuing appropriations resolution for fy2015 was introduced by representative harold rogers , chairman of the house appropriations committee , on september 9 , 2014 .

the following week , on september 16 , the house adopted a special rule ( h.res .

722 ) allowing for the consideration of an amendment that authorized the president to arm and train vetted elements of syrian opposition groups and that provided for the potential use of funds for those purposes .

the next day , after debate on h.j.res .

124 and the syria amendment thereto was completed , the house adopted the amendment by a vote of 273-156 and passed the cr by a vote of 319-108 .

on september 18 , the senate invoked cloture on the cr by a vote of 73-27 .

it then passed the cr on that same day by a vote of 78-22 .

the president signed the cr into law on september 19 .

according to the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , the annualized budget authority for regular appropriations provided in the cr that is subject to the bca limits was $1,012.236 billion .

when spending designated as for oco / gwot , continuing disability reviews and redeterminations , health care fraud abuse control , or disaster relief is included , the total amount of annualized budget authority in the cr was $1,110.678 billion .

cbo also estimated that annualized spending in the cr would exceed one of the two statutory discretionary spending limits .

defense spending in the cr was estimated to total $517.689 billion , which is about $3.583 billion below the defense limit , but nondefense spending was estimated to total $494.547 billion , which was about $2.191 billion above the nondefense limit .

however , the bca limits are first enforced within 15 calendar days after the congressional session adjourns sine die , and the funds in this cr were superseded by the enactment of h.r .

83 prior to that time .

as congressional action was occurring on h.r .

83 to complete the annual appropriations process for 11 out of the 12 regular appropriations bills , it became evident that additional time would be needed .

on december 10 , 2014 , representative harold rogers , chairman of the house appropriations committee , introduced h.j.res .

130 to extend the effectiveness of the first fy2015 cr for two additional days — to december 13 , 2014 .

on december 11 , this measure was agreed to in the house without objection and passed the senate by a voice vote .

it was signed into law by the president on december 12 , 2014 ( p.l .

113-202 ) .

that same day , the chairman of the house appropriations committee introduced another cr , h.j.res .

131 , to further extend the effectiveness of the first fy2015 cr through december 17 , 2014 .

the measure passed the house without objection and the senate by a voice vote .

it was signed into law on december 13 , 2014 ( p.l .

113-203 ) .

these temporary appropriations laws were superseded by the enactment of h.r .

83 on december 16 , 2014 .

as was previously discussed , the omnibus appropriations package that provided annual appropriations for 11 out of the 12 regular appropriations acts also contained an extension of the dhs funding provided in the first cr through february 27 , 2015 ( division l of h.r .

83 ) .

this cr also made a few modifications to the first cr , including the addition of two provisions related to dhs ( section 101 of division l ) .

congressional consideration of h.r .

83 is discussed in the report section entitled " the fy2015 consolidated act ( h.r .

83 , p.l .

113-235 ; divisions a - k ) . .

the measure was enacted on december 16 , 2014 .

congressional negotiations on h.r .

240 and annual funding for dhs had not been completed by the time the temporary funding provided by the fourth cr was scheduled to expire on february 27 .

consequently , on february 26 , representative harold rogers introduced a measure to provide a further temporary extension of funding for dhs through march 19 , 2015 ( h.j.res .

35 ) .

on february 27 , the house considered the measure pursuant to a special rule ( h.res .

129 ) , but it was defeated by a vote of 203-224 .

later on february 27 , the senate took up an unrelated measure ( h.r .

33 ) and amended it with a one - week extension of dhs funding that expires on march 3 , 2015 .

the measure passed the senate by a voice vote .

the house subsequently suspended the rules and agreed to the senate amendment by a vote of 357-60 .

the measure was signed into law by the president that evening ( p.l .

114-3 ) .

the funding provided therein was superseded by the enactment of annual appropriations for dhs ( h.r .

240 ) on march 4 , 2015 .
