generally speaking , there are two types of mortgage - backed securities ( mbss ) .

the first are those securities that are packaged and issued by government sponsored entities ( gses ) — the federal national mortgage association ( "fannie mae" ) and the federal home loan mortgage corporation ( "freddie mac" ) — and a wholly owned government corporation , the government national mortgage association ( "ginnie mae" ) .

the second are those mbss that are packaged and issued by private market participants ( i.e. , mortgage companies , savings and loans , and commercial banks ) , known as private label mbss .

the laws governing the issuance of these two types of mbss are different .

mbss offered by the gses and ginnie mae are exempt from the registration requirements and ongoing disclosure obligations contained in the federal securities laws .

private label mbss do not enjoy a blanket exemption from the federal securities laws and are classified by the securities and exchange commission as a type of "asset - backed security" ( abs ) that must register under the securities act of 1933 ( '33 act or securities act ) or obtain an exemption and provide continuing disclosures required by the securities exchange act of 1934 ( '34 act or exchange act ) .

this report will provide an overview of the registration requirements for private label mbss under the securities act .

it also highlights the most frequently used exemptions for private label mbss .

it outlines potential liability for fraud and / or material misstatements in the required disclosures and the consequences for failure to register when required by federal securities laws .

this report will not discuss reporting requirements or liability for mbss under the exchange act of 1934 .

the securities act requires issuers of all types of securities to register the offering with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) or to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements .

a registration statement consists of two parts: a prospectus , which must be delivered with every offer to sell the securities and contain the information outlined in section 10 of the securities act , and other information which need not be provided to potential purchasers but must be on file with the sec and available for public inspection .

failure to file a registration statement when one is required results in a violation of section 5 of the '33 act and strict liability under section 12 ( a ) ( 1 ) .

sections 11 and 12 of the securities act provide private causes of actions for material misstatements or omissions contained in the registration of private label mbs securities .

section 15 of the act creates liability for controlling persons .

these causes of action are described in this section .

the commission has the statutory authority to bring an action for violation of the securities act , as well as any violation of the rules and regulations issued by the commission pursuant to the act .

whenever the commission believes a person has violated or is about to violate the provisions of the securities act , the commission has the power to issue a cease and desist order .

pursuant to any cease and desist order , the commission has the authority to order accounting and disgorgement .

the commission may also bring civil or criminal actions for violations of the act .

in conjunction with the enforcement described above , the commission may bring an action for violation of section 17 of the securities act .

section 17 is a general antifraud provision .

it prohibits any individual , in the offer or sale of securities , from employing various means or devices of fraud .

some courts have held that there is an implied private right of action under section 17 ( similar to that of rule 10b - 5 of the exchange act ) , but the supreme court has yet to rule on this question .
