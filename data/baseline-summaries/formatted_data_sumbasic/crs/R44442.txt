for many decades , the university of california ( uc ) operated los alamos and lawrence livermore national laboratories .

laboratory employees , as uc employees , could participate in the uc pension plan .

when the contracts for the labs' operations were taken over by private corporations , the contracts between doe and the new laboratory operators included provisions that provided pensions to employees who had worked under the uc contract that mirrored the uc pension benefits .

these pensions were larger than those provided to employees hired after the contracts were granted to private employers .

to make up the difference , nnsa has paid into the pension plan for those current employees who formerly worked under the uc system .

nnsa requested , and congress appropriated , $162.3 million in fy2019 .
