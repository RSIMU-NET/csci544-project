title i of the child and family services improvement and innovation act ( p.l .

112-34 ) extends funding authorization for five years ( fy2012-fy2016 ) for certain programs that support child welfare - related child and family services ( under title iv - b of the social security act ) .

the funding authorization for those programs had been set to expire with fy2011 ( i.e. , on september 30 , 2011 ) .

the measure also makes certain child welfare policy changes to those programs and to the foster care and adoption assistance program ( under title iv - e of the social security act ) .

the policy changes included for programs under both title iv - b and title iv - e of the social security act are primarily related to serving children who are in foster care and their families .

title ii of p.l .

112-34 renews the authority for the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) to annually approve up to 10 child welfare demonstration projects for each of three years ( fy2012-fy2014 ) .

in addition , it adds a number of policy changes related to state eligibility to conduct child welfare demonstration projects ( often called "waiver" projects ) and hhs approval of those projects .

authority for hhs to grant new waivers expired on march 31 , 2006 .

substantively identical versions of the child and family services improvement and innovation act were introduced in the house ( h.r .

2883 ) by representative geoff davis , with representative lloyd doggett , and introduced in the senate ( s. 1542 ) by senator max baucus , with senator orrin hatch , on the same day , september 12 , 2011 .

after those bills were each favorably reported ( and without substantive amendment ) by the house ways and means committee ( h.r .

2883 ) and the senate finance committee ( s. 1542 ) , the house passed h.r .

2883 on september 21 , 2011 , and the senate did the same on september 22 .

president barack obama signed the bill into law on september 30 , 2011 ( p.l .

112-34 ) .

title iv - b of the social security act authorizes a range of programs and activities to support child welfare - related child and family services and research .

these include the stephanie tubbs jones child welfare services program ( subpart 1 , hereafter child welfare services program ) , the promoting safe and stable families program ( subpart 2 ) , the national random sample study of child welfare ( section 429 ) , and the mentoring children of prisoners program ( section 439 ) .

the funding authorization for each of these programs was set to expire as of september 30 , 2011 .

the child and family services improvement and innovation act makes the following changes to title iv - b of the social security act: it extends the annual discretionary funding authorization for the child welfare services program at its current law level for five years ( $325 million for each of fy2012-fy2016 ) .

it provides annual mandatory funding authorization for the promoting safe and stable families program for five years ( fy2012-fy2016 ) at $345 million ; and it extends the discretionary funding authorization for that program at the current law level for those same five years ( $200 million for each of fy2012-fy2016 ) .

it continues for each of five years ( fy2012-fy2016 ) a reservation of mandatory promoting safe and stable program funds for the court improvement program ( $30 million ) ; grants to regional partnerships to assist children affected by parental substance abuse ( $20 million ) ; and grants to states related to monthly caseworker visits ( $20 million ) .

title ii of the child and family services improvement and innovation act renews the authority of hhs to waive certain requirements of federal child welfare policy to permit states to conduct demonstration projects , sometimes referred to as "waiver projects. .

these projects must be likely to promote the child welfare objectives included in title iv - b and title iv - e of the social security act .

as discussed in the first part of this report , title iv - b authorizes federal grants to states for provision of a broad range of services intended to strengthen and support families in ways that enhance the safety and stability of children and increase the well - being of children and their families .

title iv - e , by contrast , primarily provides federal reimbursement to states for a part of the cost of providing foster care to eligible children ( including payments for room and board and cost of permanency planning activities ) , and for the cost of providing assistance on behalf of eligible children who leave foster care for adoption or guardianship .

similar to the title iv - b purposes , the primary purposes of federal dollars provided to states under title iv - e are to ensure the safety of children , to secure permanence for them , and , overall , to enhance their well - being .

the amendments made by the child and family services improvement and innovation act that are related to extension of waiver authority are effective on the date of enactment of h.r .

2883 ( september 30 , 2011 ) .

the amendments made with regard to data standardization are effective as of october 1 , 2012 .

all of the other amendments are effective as of october 1 , 2011 .

however , if hhs determines that a state needs to pass specific legislation ( not appropriations ) to allow it to comply with a new or amended ( title iv - b or title iv - e ) state plan requirement made by the act , that state may have some additional time ( specified in statute ) to come into compliance .

substantively identical versions of the child and family services improvement and innovation act were introduced on september 12 , 2011 , in the house and the senate .

the house bill ( h.r .

2883 ) was introduced by representative geoff davis , with representative lloyd doggett , and the senate bill ( s. 1542 ) was introduced by senator max baucus with senator orrin hatch .

the introduction of the child and family services improvement and innovation act was announced by the house ways and means committee in a press release that quoted senators baucus and hatch along with representatives davis and doggett .

some of the provisions in the child and family services improvement and innovation act were previously included in the child and family services extension and improvement act ( h.r .

2790 ) , introduced on august 2 , 2011 , by representative geoff davis , with representative doggett ; the state child welfare innovation act ( s. 1013 ) , introduced on may 17 , 2011 , by senator baucus , with senators hatch , enzi , and rockefeller ; the partners for stable families and foster youth affected by methamphetamine and other substance abuse act ( s. 1234 ) , introduced on june 20 , 2011 , by senator grassley ; and a bill to renew the authority of hhs to grant child welfare waivers ( h.r .

1194 ) , which was introduced by representative mcdermott , with representative geoff davis , and passed the house on may 31 , 2011 .

the introduction of the child and family services improvement and innovation act followed a march 2011 hearing held by the senate finance committee with regard to child welfare waiver authority as well as several related hearings held by the subcommittee on human resources of the house ways and means committee — including those that looked at data matching ( march 2011 ) , improving title iv - b programs ( june 2011 ) , and child maltreatment - related deaths ( july 2011 ) .

on september 14 , 2011 , the house ways and means committee held a markup of h.r .

2883 and unanimously agreed to report the bill favorably to the full house .

the committee submitted a report on the bill ( h.rept .

112-210 ) to the full house on september 19 , 2011 .

on september 21 , 2011 , the full house passed h.r .

2883 under suspension of the rules ( with a recorded vote of 395-25 ) .

on september 20 , 2011 , the senate finance committee held a markup of s. 1542 and agreed to report that bill favorably to the senate floor ( without amendment ) .

for a bill to be enacted , both chambers must act on the same bill .

therefore , when the full senate took up the child and family services improvement act on september 22 , 2011 , it acted on the house - passed bill ( h.r .

2883 ) , which was identical to s. 1542 , and passed it by unanimous consent .

the bill was presented to the president on september 27 , 2011 , and was signed into law on september 30 , 2011 ( p.l .

112-34 ) .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimated no significant direct ( mandatory ) spending costs for h.r .

2883 .

this is because all of the mandatory funding included in the bill ( and related to the safe and stable program ) is currently counted in the baseline .

further , none of the policy changes that are made by the bill were deemed by cbo to have a significant effect on federal spending .

cbo did note that certain of the new requirements would necessitate some additional spending by states .

however , it assumed the amount of this spending would be "small" and , therefore , was not enough for the legislation to be considered as creating an unfunded mandate .

cbo's cost estimate notes that the bill also extends discretionary funding authorization for the child welfare services program ( all program funding ) and the safe and stable program ( some of the program's funding ) for each of the five years from fy2012 to fy2016 .

these discretionary funding authorizations provided in h.r .

2883 ( enacted as p.l .

112-34 ) are equal to the annual amounts authorized in each of the previous five fiscal years: $325 million for child welfare services and $200 million for the safe and stable program .

however , as noted by cbo , the amount of actual funding provided is subject to the discretion of congress as part of the annual appropriations process .

further , the actual discretionary funding appropriated for these programs in fy2011 was considerably less .
