president obama strongly opposed the house appropriations committee bill in an april 28 , 2015 , statement of administration policy .

the administration particularly criticized the bill's reductions in the president's budget request for energy efficiency and renewable energy and strongly objected to a prohibition on the corps rulemaking on the definition of "waters of the united states. .

according to the administration statement , the president's senior advisors would have recommended a veto of the house committee bill .

congressional consideration of the annual energy and water development appropriations bill is affected by certain procedural and statutory budget enforcement measures .

the procedural budget enforcement is primarily through limits associated with the budget resolution on total discretionary spending and spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee .

statutory budget enforcement is derived from the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) .

the bca established limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending .

these limits are in effect for each of the fiscal years between fy2012 and fy2021 , and are primarily enforced by an automatic spending reduction process called sequestration .

the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( p.l .

113-67 ) established higher levels for the fy2014 and fy2015 spending limits than what would have otherwise been in effect .

the original bca process to calculate the limits would have again become effective starting in fy2016 , but higher limits were enacted by the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-74 ) .

 ( for more information on discretionary spending limits , see crs report crs report r44062 , congressional action on fy2016 appropriations measures , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

for fy2015 , appropriations for energy and water development programs were included in the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( h.r .

83 ) .

energy and water funding totaled $519 million above the request and $653 million above fy2014 , including rescissions .

the consolidated appropriations measure passed the house on december 11 , 2014 , and the senate on december 13 , 2014 , and was signed by the president on december 16 , 2014 ( p.l .

113-235 ) .

the administration's fy2016 energy and water development appropriations request and subsequent congressional action have highlighted several significant areas of debate .

the issues described in this section — listed approximately in the order they appear in the energy and water development bill — were selected based on the total funding involved and the percentage of increases or decreases , the amount of congressional attention , and their impact on broader public policy considerations .

 table 1 indicates the steps taken during consideration of the fy2016 funding legislation .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2008 through fy2016 .

the annual energy and water development appropriations bill includes four titles: title i — corps of engineers — civil ; title ii — department of the interior ( central utah project and bureau of reclamation ) ; title iii — department of energy ; and title iv — independent agencies , as shown in table 3 .

major programs in the bill are described in this section in the approximate order they appear in the bill .

funding details for many of these programs are provided in separate crs reports as indicated .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

their recent appropriations history is shown in table 7 .

the following hearings were held by the energy and water development subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees on the fy2016 budget request .

testimony and opening statements are posted on most of the web pages cited for each hearing , along with webcasts in many cases .
