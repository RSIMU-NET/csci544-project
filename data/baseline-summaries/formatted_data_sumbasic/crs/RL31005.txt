on january 10 , 2002 , the president signed p.l .

107-117 , the fy2002 dod appropriations act ( h.r .

3338 ) .

on december 20 , 2001 , the house and the senate passed h.r .

3338 by 408 to 6 and 94 to 2 , respectively .

in addition to providing the fundingrequested by the administration for dod , the act allocates $20 billion in emergency terrorismresponse supplemental ( p.l .

107-38 ) funding among all federal agencies to combat terrorism andprovide aid and recovery to the victims of the attacks .

the debate on the fy2002 dod appropriations act centered on the allocation of the $20 billion in funding to combat terrorism .

the conferees resolved the significant differences betweenthe house and senate versions by shifting $4.3 billion in funding requested by the administrationfor dod to non - defense agencies to combat terrorism and provide aid to new york city .

efforts inboth houses to increase funding for antiterrorism beyond the $20 billion already enacted in theemergency supplemental failed after president bush threatened to veto any bill that exceeded thatamount .

the final version of the bill provides $317.2 billion to the department of defense in regularappropriations .

the dod authorization act ( s. 1438 ) was passed on december 13 and also provided the amount requested by the administration .

the authorizers resolved the chief item ofcontention - base closures - by delaying the date to 2005 .

there was little controversy about the total amount of regular appropriations for dod .

along with funds for military construction and other defense - related programs , the $317.2 billion for dodin the final version of h.r .

3338 provides $343.3 billion , about the same amount intotal as requested by the administration .

because of the recession that began last spring , along withaccommodating the full defense request , emergency spending to combat terrorism , and lower taxrevenues because of the tax act , funding government expenditures in fy2002 will require not onlyusing all of the social security surplus but also returning to deficit spending .

congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriationsmeasures , the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill .

congress also acts every year ona national defense authorization bill , which authorizes programs funded in all of the regularappropriations measures .

the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely thesame level of detail as the defense - related appropriations , and congressional debate about majordefense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization .

because thedefense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related , this report trackscongressional action on both measures .

the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense ( dod ) , including pay and benefits of military personnel , operation and maintenance ofweapons and facilities , weapons procurement , and research and development , as well as for otherpurposes .

most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense , though the bill also provides ( 1 ) relatively small , unclassified amounts for the central intelligenceagency retirement fund and intelligence community management , ( 2 ) classified amounts for nationalforeign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod , and ( 3 ) very small amounts for some other agencies .

five other appropriations bills also provide fundsfor national defense activities of dod and other agencies including: the military construction appropriations bill , which finances constructionof military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing , all administered bydod ; and the energy and water development appropriations bill , which funds atomicenergy defense activities administered by the department of energy .

the va - hud - independent agencies appropriations bill , which finances civildefense activities administered by the federal emergency management agency , activities of theselective service system , and dod support for national science foundation antarctic research ; the commerce - justice - state appropriations bill , which funds nationalsecurity - related activities of the fbi , the department of justice , and some other agencies ; and the transportation appropriations bill , which funds some defense - relatedactivities of the coast guard .

on january 10 , 2002 , the president signed p.l .

107-117 ( h.r .

3338 ) , the fy2002dod appropriations act , including both the regular funding for defense and the allocation of $20billion among all government agencies that was provided in the emergency terrorism responsesupplemental to combat terrorism ( see h.rept .

107-350 and table 1a ) .

on december 20 , 2001,the house and the senate passed h.r .

3338 / p.l .

107-117 , the conference version of thefy2002 department of defense ( dod ) appropriations bill .

although congress provided $343.3billion for national defense , close to the total requested by the administration , congressre - allocated the funding - providing $1.7 billion less than requested for the department of defense,and $500 million more for military construction , and $750 million more for the department ofenergy's defense programs .

 ( 2 ) of the $20 billion inemergency supplemental funding that wasallocated in h.r .

3338 , dod received $3.5 billion .

although p.l .

107-117 ( h.r .

3338 ) makes various changes to the administration's fy2002 request for regular dod appropriations , the administration's basic priorities are preserved,including a substantial increase in overall resources for defense , a large increase in military pay andfull funding of defense health benefits , and a major jump in spending for missile defense .

congressdoes , however , reduce spending on operations and maintenance on the basis of various pricingadjustments and efficiency measures in order to accommodate increases to the procurement andrdt&e accounts ( see below for a fuller discussion ) .

a week earlier , on december 13 , 2001 , both houses passed s. 1438 , the conference version of the fy2002 dod authorization bill ( see s.rept .

107-333 and table 1b ) .

the confereesresolved the chief issue in contention - authorizing another round of base closures as requested bythe administration - by delaying the date to 2005 .

in addition , the authorizers set upward limits onthe amounts that could be provided in the emergency supplemental to combat terrorism .

table 1a .

status of fy2002 defense appropriations table 1b .

status of fy2002 defenseauthorizatio .

the president had requested that dod receive a total of $21.1 billion in emergencysupplemental funds , including $14 billion that was distributed by the president , and $7.3billion , which would become available if included in an appropriations act ( see above ) .

 ( 10 ) with enactment of the fy2002 dod appropriations bill , the total amount that dod receivesfrom the emergency supplemental is $17.5 billion , or $3.8 billion less than requested by theadministration ( see table 2 ) .

all but $57 million of the $40 billion in emergency funds hasnow been allocated .

 ( 11 ) passed on september 14 , 2001 , p.l .

107-38 / h.r .

2888 , the fy2001 emergency appropriations act for recovery from and response to terrorist attack on theunited states provided $40 billion in emergency spending to be allocated by theadministration in consultation with congress .

the funds are to be spent for the followingpurposes: federal , state , and local preparedness for relief from and for responding to the attack ; support to counter , investigate and prosecute domestic and internationalterrorism ; increased security for transportation ; repairing damage to public facilities and transportation systems ; and supporting national security .

funds designated as emergency spending are not subject to the limitations set in concurrent budget resolutions .

the president was required to consult with the chairmen and ranking minority members of the appropriations committees prior to the transfer of the funds to individual agencies.after consultation with the appropriations committees about the allocation of the funds , theinitial $10 billion becomes available immediately .

 ( dod refers to these funds as 'cash' .

 ) the second $10 billion became available 15 days after the office of management and budgetsubmitted a proposed allocation and plan for use of the funds to the appropriationscommittees .

 ( dod refers to these funds as '15 day notification' funds ) .

an additional $20billion became available if included in a later appropriation bill .

these funds are includedin p.l .

107-117 , the enacted version of h.r .

3338 ( see above ) .

according to the emergency terrorism response supplemental , p.l .

107-38 , not less than $20 billion of the $40 billion "shall be allocated for disaster recovery activities andassistance related to the terrorist acts in new york , pennsylvania , and virginia on september11 , 2001. .

 ( 12 ) the law also provides that thepresident may submit detailed requests tocongress if further funding is required .

although the emergency supplemental required thatthe director of omb was to provide quarterly reports to the appropriations committees onthe use of funds , beginning on january 2 , 2002 , that reporting requirement was supercededby the one included in the dod appropriations act , calling for quarterly reports 30 days afterenactment ( by february 9 , 2002 ) .

on september 14 , congress also passed s.j.res .

23 authorizing the president to use military force against those responsible for the terrorist attack .

three weekslater , on october 7 , the u.s. initiated the bombing of afghanistan to destroy the terroristtraining camps of osama bin laden and dislodge the taliban government .

funding for thewar is included in the emergency supplemental ( see section on defense spending below ) .

since september 21 , omb has sent congress eight notifications of intended and requested allocations of the $40 billion emergency supplemental , including a notice onoctober 16 that contained details of the $20 billion proposal that needed to be approved bycongress in an fy2002 appropriation bill .

 ( 13 ) boththe house and senate appropriationscommittee included their allocations of the administration's request for that $20 billion ina separate section of the fy2002 dod appropriations bill ( h.r .

3338 , h.rept.107-298 , s.rept .

107-109 ) .

as costs of recovery and response efforts have risen , however,policy differences emerged over the amount , timing , and priorities of the supplementalspending .

the white house , concerned over potential rising budget deficits for fy2002 , argued that the $40 billion emergency total was sufficient for the moment , but that the presidentwould entertain more spending next year if needs exist .

many lawmakers , including seniorappropriations committee members , however , called for the infusion of immediateresources well above the $40 billion figure , with an emphasis on funds for new york cityin order to meet the $20 billion allocation directive in p.l .

107-38 .

president bush said thathe would veto legislation that would spend more than the $40 billion already enacted .

theseissues were considered during floor debate on the dod appropriations bill in both the houseand the senate floor debate .

 ( 14 ) .

since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , the budgetary context for decisionson spending levels for federal programs has changed dramatically .

at the beginningof september , leaders of both parties were debating whether higher spending fordiscretionary programs - including an additional $18.4 billion above theadministration's initial request for the department of defense - could beaccommodated after the tax cut in the spring without tapping the surplus generatedby social security revenues .

with the recession that began in the spring of 2001 andthe new spending to combat terrorism , the possibility of keeping the social securitysurplus "off - limits" has disappeared , and both the administration and thecongressional budget office are predicting deficit spending in 2002 and 2003 .

 ( 31 ) in august 2001 , cbo estimated that the total surplus in 2002 would be $176 billion ( see table 8 ) , with all but $2 billion resulting from the surplus in socialsecurity revenues .

 ( 32 ) the lower cbo estimatereflected primarily the effects of the tax decreases enacted in the spring as well as the downturn in the economy .

 ( 33 ) withhigher funding for dod as well as other agencies under consideration , it was likelythat congress would have to tap the surplus in the medicare hospital insurance fund ( hi ) and social security revenues .

after the attacks of september 11 , however , withthe new concern about combating terrorism , and the ongoing conflict in afghanistan , the fiscal debate shifted from the potential problem of tapping the social securitysurplus to adding funding for defense programs and homeland security .

thatadditional spending , coupled with the recession , made worse by the terrorist attacks,made that prospect inevitable .

on december 20 , 2001 , the house and the senate passed the conference versionof h.r .

3338 , the fy2002 dod appropriations bill ( h.rept .

107-350 ) by 408-6 in the house and 92-2 in the senate .

in addition to dod's regularappropriations , the fy2002 defense bill allocates the $20 billion in funding from theemergency terrorism response supplemental that had to be included in anappropriation act ( see discussion above ) .

on december 13 , the house and senate passed the fy2002 dod authorizationact by 382 to 40 in the house and 96 to 2 in the senate ( p.l .

107-107 , h.rept.107-333 , see table 1b ) .

the act provides the $343.3 billion as requested by theadministration , an 11% increase over fy2001 without taking into account fundingfrom the emergency supplemental .

like the appropriators , the authorizers' actionreduces the amount for the department of defense by $1.2 billion , and re - allocatesthose funds to military construction ( +$600 million ) and defense - related activities ofthe department of energy ( +$600 million ) .

passage of the fy2002 dod authorization act was delayed by the difficulty in resolving the issue of authorizing another round of base closures in 2003 asproposed by the administration .

initially , the house opposed an additional round andthe senate supported another round .

 ( 44 ) in the finalcompromise included in theconference version , congress agreed to authorize a round of base closures butdelayed the date until 2005 .

as part of the compromise , the conference version alsorequires that a 'super - majority' of at least seven of the nine commissioners approveany decision to add bases to those suggested by the secretary of defense .

 ( 45 ) duringhouse floor debate , several members raised concerns about the base closureprovision .

on the senate side , the chief concern raised during floor debate was thepotentially de - stabilizing effects of president bush's decision to withdraw from theabm treaty announced on december 13 , particularly at a time of rapid buildup inthe u.s.'s ballistic missile defense program , an increase that was largely endorsed bycongress in the 2002 budget .

completion and passage of the conference report was also delayed by the need to resolve the issue of the navy's access to the training vase at vieques ( see below ) ,and by the debate about the allocation of emergency supplemental spending ( seeabove ) .

earlier , congressional action on fy2002 defense authorization andappropriations bills had been delayed because the administration did not submit itsamended request until june 27 because of the ongoing review of military strategy andbecause of the evacuation of congress due to the delivery of anthrax - laden letters .

major issues resolved in the conference report and changes made in each house arediscussed below .

congress completed action on the fy2002 congressional budget resolution ( h.con.res .

83 ) in early may - the house approved a conferenceagreement on the resolution on may 9 , and the senate on may 10 - before theadministration had determined its defense spending plans .

the conferenceagreement established a provisional target of $324.8 billion in new budget authorityfor the national defense budget function ( which includes department of energydefense - related activities and defense - related activities of other agencies as well asof the department of defense ) .

to allow for further increases in defense , the resolution used the mechanism ofreserve funds , separately administered in the house and the senate , to accommodateincreased spending in fy2002 and over the whole fy2002-fy2011 period .

with the lower mid - session estimates of the surplus issued by both omb and cbo in august ( reflecting the effect of the tax cut in the spring as well as other changes ) , thedownturn in the economy , and additional spending in response to the terrorist attacks , it will be impossible to accommodate the defense increase without tapping socialsecurity revenues .

in fact , both cbo and the administration now predict deficitspending in fy2002 through fy2004 , in addition to fully using the medicare andsocial security surplus ( see above ) .

several issues emerged as key matters of debate on the fy2002 defense budgetthough the salience of some of these issues changed in response to the september 11terrorist attack and new issues emerged about the appropriate role for the departmentof defense in combating terrorism , and the changes in funding should flow from thatrole ( see discussion above about funding to combat terrorism ) .

major issues raisedduring this year's debate on the defense budget included: was the $343.5 billion requested by the new administration the appropriate amount relative to defense needs , and could that amount beaccommodated without dipping into the medicare surplus infy2002 ? .

was increased funding of over 60% and proposed restructuringof the ballistic missile defense program appropriate , and how would theadministration's plans affect the anti - ballistic missile treaty ( abm ) ? .

was funding for procurement - slightly below last year's level - adequate ? .

what , if any , implications arise from the rapid growth indefense health costs ? .

were the large proposed increases in operation andmaintenance funding necessary to support readiness , and will higher funding foro&m squeeze out other defense needs in the future ? .

a variety of other important issues - ranging from the level of military compensation to finding alternatives to navy live fire training on vieques - were alsobe considered , and are discussed in later sections of this report .
