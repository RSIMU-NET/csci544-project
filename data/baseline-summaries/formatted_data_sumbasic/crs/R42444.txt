various benefits may be available to unemployed workers to provide income support .

when eligible workers lose their jobs , the unemployment compensation ( uc ) program may provide up to 26 weeks of income support through the payment of regular uc benefits .

unemployment benefits may be extended for up to 13 or 20 weeks by the permanent extended benefit ( eb ) program under certain state economic conditions .

from july 2008 through december 2013 , unemployment benefits were also extended for additional weeks by the temporarily authorized emergency unemployment compensation ( euc08 ) program .

the euc08 program is now expired .

this report provides a detailed legislative history of the euc08 program .

it also describes the structure and availability of euc08 benefits prior to program expiration at the end of calendar year 2013 .

on june 30 , 2008 , president george w. bush signed the supplemental appropriations act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-252 ) into law .

title iv of this act created a new temporary unemployment insurance program , the emergency unemployment compensation ( euc08 ) program .

this was the eighth time congress created a federal temporary program to extend unemployment compensation during an economic slowdown .

authorization for the euc08 program expired the week ending on or before january 1 , 2014 .

the last day of euc08 availability was december 28 , 2013 ( december 29 , 2013 for new york ) .

prior to this expiration , state uc agencies administered euc08 benefits along with regular uc benefits and benefits from the permanently authorized eb program .

the now - expired euc08 program should not be confused with the similarly named extended benefit ( eb ) program .

the euc08 program was temporary and , prior to expiration , a portion of the program was available regardless of state unemployment conditions in all states except for north carolina .

in comparison , the eb program is permanently authorized and applies only to certain states on the basis of state unemployment conditions as specified in law .

each monday the department of labor issues its "extended benefit trigger notice" at http: / / www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov / unemploy / claims_arch.asp .

if the "available weeks" column within the notice has either 13 or 20 for a particular state's row , that extended benefit program is active in that state with a potential of up to 13 or 20 weeks of eb for its unemployed workers .

when economic conditions in a state no longer meet the criteria for extended benefits , the eb program becomes inactive .

there is no "grandfathering" of the eb benefit .

when a state eb program becomes inactive , payment of all eb benefits stops immediately .

the eb program is permanently authorized by the federal - state extended unemployment compensation act of 1970 ( euca ) , p.l .

91-373 ( 26 u.s.c .

3304 , note ) .

the eb program provides for additional weeks of unemployment benefits , up to a maximum of 13 weeks during periods of high unemployment and , at the option of each state , up to a maximum of 20 weeks in certain states with extremely high unemployment .

under euca , eb benefits are funded half ( 50% ) by the federal government through an account for that purpose in the unemployment trust fund ( utf ) .

states fund half ( 50% ) through their state accounts in the utf .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) , as amended , temporarily provided for 100% federal financing of eb benefits through december 31 , 2013 ( through the extended unemployment compensation account within the unemployment trust fund ) , with the exception of "non - sharable" benefits ( generally , these are former state and local employees' eb benefits ) .

prior to the enactment of p.l .

112-96 , states were permitted to determine which benefit , eb or euc08 , was paid first .

alaska was the only state to pay eb first when this option was available .

since the enactment of p.l .

112-96 and until the euc08 program expired at the end of calendar year 2013 , states were required to pay euc08 benefits before eb benefits .
