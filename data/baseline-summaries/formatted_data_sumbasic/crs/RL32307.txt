the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil worksprojects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of theinterior's bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , most of the department of energy ( doe ) ,and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatorycommission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

the bushadministration's request was $27.938 billion for these programs for fy2005,compared with $27.253 billion appropriated for fy2004 .

108-447 ) increased thefunding to $4.71 billion before the rescission .

the administration asked for $970 million for fy2005 for the department of the interior programs included in the energy and water development bill - - thebureau of reclamation and the central utah project .

this would be a decrease of$11 million from the fy2004 funding level .

budget justifications for fy2005 from the corps of engineers .

notes: a .

includes an across - the - board rescission of .59% included in the fy2004consolidated appropriations act , p.l .

108-199 , enacted on january 23 , 2004. b .

this figure reflects amounts provided by the house appropriations committee ; the committee showed $35.9 million added by p.l .

108-199 .

other sourcesindicate that the supplemental appropriation was less and that the totalconstruction appropriation was $1731.3 .

c. this amount includes the administration's proposed cancellation of $100 million ( $94 million in construction , $5 million in mississippi river flood control , $1million in flood control and coastal emergencies ) in unobligated fy2004balances for work on 41 projects that are "inconsistent with current policy. .

d. "formerly utilized sites remedial action program. .

e. the conference committee for fy2004 appropriations removed all funding for theflood control and coastal emergencies account because the account wasreplenished with $60 million through the legislative branch appropriations actfor fy2004 , p.l .

108-83 .

f. does not include the modified rescission amount of .80% in h.con.res .

528 , which would produce a total of $4,667.9 million .

the president's fy2005 budget request was similar in many ways to the president's fy2004 request .

again for fy2005 , the president's request fundedconstruction projects that could be completed in fy2005 and projects considered bythe administration to be priorities .

the eight priority projects included the newyork and new jersey harbor deepening project , restoration projects in the floridaeverglades and the side channels of the upper mississippi river system , and projectsto meet environmental requirements in the columbia river basin and the missouririver basin .

the president's budget also funded three new projects that weredetermined to have high economic and environmental return .

outside of these threeprojects , there were no other new construction starts , because of the administration'sconcern with the funding needed to complete projects budgeted for construction .

inkeeping with the administration's approach to reducing the agency's constructionbacklog , the president's budget limited funding for planning to five new projects .

the request also focused the operation and maintenance funds for the inlandwaterways and harbors on projects supporting a high volume of traffic .

the corps announced in its budget briefing on february 2 , 2004 , that it did not budget for the continued renourishment of shoreline storm damage reductionprojects , indicating that it considered these costs as maintenance expenses to beborne by the non - federal project sponsors .

this represented a change from thecorps' past involvement with renourishment , often at a 50% federal cost share .

thebudget also generally deemphasized shallow draft harbors and waterways with lowcommercial use .

the president requested no funds for studies and "environmental infrastructure" projects in the following non - traditional mission areas: wastewater treatment,irrigation water supply , and municipal and industrial water supply treatment anddistribution .

by not seeking funding for these activities , the administrationreinforced its interest in focusing federal funding on navigation , flood control , stormdamage reduction , and ecosystem restoration projects .

h.r .

4818 ( p.l .

108-447 ) increases the corps' appropriations over fy2004 and above the president's fy2005 request ; the exact increase depends onthe size of the rescission .

h.r .

4818 ( p.l .

108-447 ) funds someenvironmental infrastructure projects and funds some beach renourishment activities.furthermore , the bill states that the corps shall not implement any changes toexisting shoreline protection policies that have not been specifically authorized bycongress .

the bill does not fund the new study or construction starts requested bythe president .

it does fund some controversial construction projects , including thedallas floodway extension and yazoo basin projects .

according to the conferencereport , congress provided more funds for the popular continuing authoritiesprograms than requested by the administration ; the conference report also continuedthe recent trend of identifying specific priority projects for funding under theseprograms .

h.r .

4818 ( p.l .

108-447 ) contains some authorization language .

although the bill does not contain authorization of the upper mississippiriver - illinois waterway navigation and ecosystem restoration project , it provides$13.5 million in funding to proceed with the planning of the controversial navigationproject .

the bill provides $17.5 million , which is less than the $28 million requestedby the administration , for the upper mississippi river system's environmentalmanagement program , which complements the proposed ecosystem restorationproject .

for the department of the interior , the energy and water development billprovides funding for the bureau of reclamation ( bor ) and the central utah projectcompletion account .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for most of doe'sprograms .

major doe activities in the bill include research and development onrenewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , andnuclear weapons programs .

the administration's fy2005 request for doe programsin the energy and water development bill was $23.148 billion , about $1.18 billionmore than the amount appropriated for fy2004 .

 ( the fy2005 request for doe'sprograms for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , andenergy statistics , included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill,was $1.7 billion. ) .

the house bill ( h.r .

4614 ) would have appropriated$22.478 billion .

the omnibus bill contains $23.003 billion , less the rescission .
