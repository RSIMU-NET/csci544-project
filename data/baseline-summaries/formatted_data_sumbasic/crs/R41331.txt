this report describes the individual mandate as established under the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) .

it also discusses the aca reporting requirements designed , in part , to assist individuals in providing evidence of having met the mandate .

the aca requires most individuals to have health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance .

individuals are required to maintain minimum essential coverage for themselves and their dependents .

some individuals are exempt from the mandate and the penalty , and others may receive financial assistance to help them pay for the cost of health insurance coverage and the costs associated with using health care services .

calendar year 2014 was the first year in which individuals were expected to comply with the individual mandate requirement .

because the penalties are assessed through the federal tax filing process , calendar year 2015 is the first year in which the penalty is assessed ( for calendar year 2014 ) .

although the aca requires most individuals to maintain minimum essential coverage , it provides financial assistance to some individuals to help them meet the requirement .

under the aca medicaid expansion , some states have expanded their medicaid programs to include all non - elderly , nonpregnant individuals with income below 133% of the federal poverty level ( fpl ) , which has increased medicaid enrollment significantly .

as of 2014 , some individuals who do not qualify for medicaid coverage , but who meet other aca requirements , are able to receive subsidies to help pay for the premiums and cost - sharing requirements of health plans offered through an exchange .

the aca requires that certain information be provided to the irs and to individuals , in part to ensure that both parties have knowledge and proof that an individual is meeting the individual mandate .

every entity ( including employers , insurers , and government programs ) that provides minimum essential coverage to any individual must present a return to the irs and a statement to the covered individual .

the person required to provide the return and statement is referred to as the reporting entity .

in general , insurers are the reporting entities for all fully insured health insurance arrangements and plan sponsors are the reporting entities for all self - insured arrangements .

a government agency or unit is the reporting entity for any coverage under a government - sponsored program , including any coverage that is provided through an insurer ( eg , a medicare advantage plan ) .

an insurer does not have to provide a return or a statement for any coverage it offers through an individual health insurance exchange , as the exchange is the reporting entity for such coverage ; however , insurers that offer small group coverage through a small business health options program ( shop ) exchange are the reporting entities for such coverage .

the return provided to the irs must include the following: the name , address , and employer identification number ( ein ) of the reporting entity required to file the return ; the name , address , and taxpayer identification number ( tin ) of the responsible individual and each other individual covered under the policy or program ; the months for which , for at least one day , each individual was covered under the policy or program ; for coverage provided through the group plan of an employer â€” the name , address , and ein of the employer sponsoring the plan ; whether the coverage is a qualified health plan ( qhp ) offered through a shop exchange and the shop's unique identifier ; and any other information as specified in forms , instructions , or published guidance issued by the department of the treasury .

the reporting entity also must provide a statement to each responsible individual covered under the policy or program .

the statement must include the contact information for the person designated as the reporting entity's contact person ; the policy number of the coverage , if any ; and the information included in the return to the irs for the responsible individual and any individuals listed on the return .

reporting entities were required to begin submitting returns in 2014 ; however , in july 2013 the department of the treasury published a notice that delayed the reporting requirement until 2015 .

reporting entities that do not file timely and accurate returns and those that do not provide statements to individuals could be subject to penalties .

minimum essential coverage appendix b .

penalty examples the following are illustrative penalty examples for single individuals and for families of four ( specifically , a married couple with two children under the age of 18 ) .

in all of the examples , the individual or individuals are subject to the individual mandate penalty for an entire calendar year .

the 2014 and 2015 examples use actual tax filing thresholds and penalty caps for the respective year .

the 2014 filing thresholds are $10,150 for a single individual under the age of 65 with no dependents ( single filing status ) and $20,300 for a married couple filing jointly .

the 2014 penalty cap is $204 per month per individual , up to a maximum of five individuals .

the 2015 filing thresholds are $10,300 for a single individual under the age of 65 with no dependents ( single filing status ) and $20,600 for a married couple filing jointly .

the 2015 penalty cap is $207 per month per individual , up to a maximum of five individuals .

neither the tax filing thresholds nor the penalty caps for 2016 have been determined .

because the filing thresholds are linked to an inflation adjustment based on the consumer price index for all urban consumers ( cpi - u ) , they likely will be higher when implemented in 2016 .

the examples for 2016 use estimated filing thresholds .

the congressional research service does not have the information needed to estimate the 2016 penalty caps ; therefore , estimated penalty caps are not used in the 2016 examples .

because the 2016 filing thresholds are estimated and the penalty caps are not used , the numbers for 2016 are meant for illustrative purposes only .

these examples are best used to show the relative scope of the penalties and the relationship between the various components of the formulas for calculating the penalty .

penalty examples: single individual based on the information above , the following are illustrative individual - mandate penalties for a single individual with no dependents who is subject to the penalty for an entire calendar year .

in 2014 , an individual with income above $10,150 ( the tax filing threshold ) but at or below $19,650 will pay the $95 flat amount ; an individual with income above $19,650 but below $254,950 will pay 1% of applicable income ( the difference between the individual's income and $10,150 ) ; the penalty cap will apply to an individual with income at or above $254,950 , so the individual will pay $2,448 .

in 2015 , an individual with income above $10,300 ( the tax filing threshold ) but at or below $26,550 will pay the $325 flat amount ; an individual with income above $26,550 and below $134,500 will pay 2% of applicable income ( the difference between the individual's income and $10,300 ) ; the penalty cap will apply to an individual with income at or above $134,500 , so the individual will pay $2,484 .

in 2016 , an individual with income above the filing threshold ( estimated to be $10,450 in 2016 ) but at or below an estimated $38,250 will pay the $695 flat amount ; an individual with income above an estimated $38,250 and below the amount that will trigger the penalty cap will pay 2.5% of applicable income ( the difference between the individual's income and the filing threshold ) ; an individual with income at or above the amount that will trigger the penalty cap will pay the capped amount .

penalty examples: family of four based on the information above , the following are illustrative individual mandate penalties for a family of four ( married couple with two children under the age of 18 ) who are all subject to the penalty for an entire calendar year .

in 2014 , those with income above $20,300 ( the tax filing threshold ) but at or below $48,800 will pay the $285 flat dollar amount ; those with income above $48,800 but below $999,500 will pay 1% of applicable income ( the difference between the family's household income and the filing threshold ) ; the penalty cap will apply to a family of four with income at or above $999,500 , so the family will pay $9,792 .

in 2015 , those with income above $20,600 ( the tax filing threshold ) but at or below $69,350 will pay the $975 flat dollar amount ; those with income above $69,350 and $517,400 will pay 2% of applicable income ( the difference between the family's household income and the filing threshold ) ; the penalty cap will apply to a family of four with income at or above $517,400 , so the family will pay $9,936 .
