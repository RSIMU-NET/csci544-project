the earned income tax credit ( eitc ) is a refundable tax credit available to eligible workers with relatively low earnings .

because the credit is refundable , an eitc recipient need not owe taxes to receive the benefit .

the credit is authorized by section 32 of the internal revenue code ( irc ) and administered as part of the federal income tax system .

for tax year 2015 ( returns filed in 2016 ) , a total of $68.5 billion was claimed by 28.1 million tax filers , making the eitc the largest need - tested antipoverty cash assistance program .

under current law , the eitc is calculated based on a recipient's earned income , using one of eight different formulas , which vary depending on several factors , including the number of qualifying children a tax filer has ( zero , one , two , or three or more ) and his or her marital status ( unmarried or married ) .

all else being equal , the amount of the credit tends to increase with the number of eligible children the eitc claimant has .

indeed , most of the benefits of the eitc — 97% of eitc dollars for 2015 — go to families with children .

two temporary modifications to the eitc were enacted under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) , extended by p.l .

111-312 and p.l .

112-240 , and made permanent by the protecting americans from tax hikes ( path ) act ( division q of p.l .

114-113 ) .

the first modification was a larger credit for families with three or more children , while the second reduced the eitc's marriage penalty .

this report provides an overview of the eitc , first discussing eligibility requirements for the credit , followed by how the credit is computed and paid .

the report then provides data on the growth of the eitc since it was first enacted in 1975 .

finally the report concludes with data on the eitc claimed on 2015 tax returns , examining eitc claims by number of qualifying children , income level , tax filing status , and location of residence .

a tax filer must fulfill the following requirements to claim the eitc: 1 .

the tax filer must file a federal income tax return .

2 .

the tax filer must have earned income .

3 .

the tax filer must meet certain residency requirements .

4 .

the tax filer's children must meet relationship , residency , and age requirements to be considered qualifying children for the credit .

5 .

childless workers who claim the credit must be between ages 25 and 64 .

 ( this age requirement does not apply to eitc claimants with qualifying children. ) .

6 .

the tax filer's investment income must be below a certain amount .

7 .

the tax filer must not be disallowed the credit due to prior fraud or reckless disregard of the rules when they previously claimed the eitc .

8 .

the tax filer must provide the social security number for themselves , their spouse , if married , and any children for whom the credit is claimed .

additionally , a tax filer with income above a certain dollar amount ( labeled as "income where credit = 0" in table 1 ) will be ineligible for the credit .

given that this income level is dependent on the number of qualifying children and marital status of the tax filer , this requirement is discussed in greater detail in the section of the report entitled " calculating the eitc . .

requirements ( 1 ) through ( 8 ) are discussed in detail below .

the eitc amount is based on formulas that consider earned income , number of qualifying children , marital status , and adjusted gross income ( agi ) .

in general , the eitc equals a fixed percentage ( the "credit rate" ) of earned income until the credit reaches its maximum amount .

the eitc then remains at its maximum level over a subsequent range of earned income , between the "earned income amount" and the "phase - out amount threshold. .

finally , the credit gradually decreases in value to zero at a fixed rate ( the "phase - out rate" ) for each additional dollar of earned income or agi ( whichever is greater ) above the phase - out amount threshold .

the specific values of these eitc parameters ( eg , credit rate , earned income amount , etc. ) .

vary depending on several factors , including the number of qualifying children a tax filer has and his or her marital status , as illustrated in table 1 .

as illustrated in table 1 , the eitc's earned income amounts , credit rates , phase - out rates , and maximum credit amounts vary by the number of qualifying children a tax filer has .

the eitc ranges from a maximum credit of $519 for a tax filer without a child to $6,431 for a tax filer with three or more qualifying children , as illustrated in figure 1 .

the phase - out amount threshold varies by both the number of qualifying children a tax filer has and his or her marital status .

the phase - out amount threshold for those who are married filing joint returns is $5,690 greater than for unmarried filing statuses with the same number of children .

 ( tax filers who file as married filing separately are ineligible for the eitc. ) .

this higher phase - out amount threshold for married tax filers reduces ( but generally does not eliminate ) potential "marriage penalties" in the eitc whereby the credit for a married couple is less than the combined credit of two unmarried recipients .

figure 2 illustrates the eitc amount by earned income level for an unmarried taxpayer with one child for 2018 .

it shows the three distinct ranges of eitc for this family: phase - in range: the eitc increases with earned income from the first dollar of earned income up to earnings of $10,180 .

over this earned income range , the credit equals the credit rate ( 34% for a tax filer with one child ) times the amount of annual earned income .

the $10,180 threshold is called the earned income amount and is the earnings level at which the eitc ceases to increase with earned income .

the income interval up to the earned income amount , where the eitc increases with earned income , is known as the phase - in range .

plateau: the eitc remains at its maximum level of $3,461 from the earned income amount ( $10,180 ) until earnings exceed $18,660 .

the $3,461 credit represents the maximum credit for a tax filer with one child in 2018 .

the income interval with the eitc fixed at its maximum value represents the plateau on figure 2 .

phase - out range: once adjusted gross income ( or if greater , earned income ) exceeds $18,660 , the eitc is reduced for every additional dollar over that amount .

the $18,660 threshold is known as the phase - out amount threshold for a single taxpayer with one child in 2018 .

for each dollar over the phase - out amount threshold , the eitc is reduced by 15.98% .

the 15.98% rate is known as the phase - out rate .

the income interval from the phase - out income level until the eitc is completely phased out is known as the phase - out range .

the eitc is completely phased out ( eitc = $0 ) once the tax filer's agi ( or earned income , whichever is greater ) reaches $40,320 .

the earned income amounts and the phase - out amount thresholds are adjusted each year for inflation .

in practice , eitc claimants use tables published by the irs to calculate their credit amount .

a tax filer can look up the correct amount of his or her eitc based on income , marital status , and number of qualifying children .

the instructions for the federal income tax form show the eitc amounts in tables by income brackets ( in $50 increments ) .

the eitc is provided to individuals and families annually in a lump sum payment after a taxpayer files a federal income tax return .

it may be received in one of three ways: 1. a reduction in federal tax liability ; 2. a cash payment from the treasury if the tax filer has no tax liability , through a tax refund check ; or 3. a combination of reduced federal tax liability and a refund .

the majority ( 86% ) of the aggregate amount of the eitc — $68.5 billion for 2015 — is received as a refund .

in other words , $58.8 billion of the eitc was received as a refund for 2014 , while approximately $9.7 billion offset tax liabilities .

the eitc is taken against all taxes reported on the federal individual income tax return ( form 1040 ) after all nonrefundable credits have been taken .

on the tax form , the eitc can be found in the payments section after the lines for withholding and estimated tax payments .

the eitc benefits families when they file their income taxes .

thus , payments are generally based on the prior year's income , earnings , and family composition .

that is , the eitc earned in 2018 , based on a tax filer's earnings , income , and family composition , will be paid in 2019 .

if the tax filer is owed a refund , and that filer's return includes an eitc , that refund will be made on or after february 15 .

two temporary modifications to the eitc were enacted by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) .

first , arra enacted a temporary larger credit for families with three or more children by creating a new higher credit rate of 45% ( previously , these tax filers were eligible for a credit rate of 40% ) .

second , arra expanded marriage penalty relief by increasing the earned income level at which the credit phased out for married tax filers in comparison to unmarried tax filers with the same number of children .

before arra , the eitc for married tax filers would begin to phase out for earned income $3,000 ( adjusted for inflation ) greater than the level for unmarried recipients with the same number of children .

arra increased this differential to $5,000 ( adjusted for inflation ) .

in 2018 , this marriage penalty relief was equal to $5,690 .

these two changes were originally scheduled to be in effect only for 2009 and 2010 .

the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) extended these arra provisions for two years ( 2011 and 2012 ) .

the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) extended the arra provisions for five more years ( 2013-2017 ) .

the protecting americans from tax hikes ( path ) act ( division q of p.l .

114-113 ) made these two modifications permanent .

the eitc was first enacted in 1975 as a temporary measure meant to encourage economic growth in the face of the 1974 recession and rising food and energy prices .

it was also originally intended to "assist in encouraging people to obtain employment , reducing the unemployment rate , and reducing the welfare rolls. .

over time the list of eitc objectives has grown to include poverty reduction .

today the eitc is the largest need - tested , cash benefit antipoverty program .

this section first provides a historical overview of the growth of the eitc for tax years 1975 to 2015 ; it then examines information on eitc participation for 2015 .

when originally enacted by the tax reduction act of 1975 ( p.l .

94-12 ) , the eitc was a temporary refundable tax credit in effect for 1975 .

for that year , 6.2 million tax filers claimed the eitc and the total eitc amount claimed was $1.25 billion ( in constant 2015 dollars , this equals $5.5 billion ) .

the credit was extended several more times on a temporary basis and made permanent by the revenue act of 1978 ( p.l .

95-600 ) .

legislation enacted in 1986 ( p.l .

99-514 ) , 1990 ( p.l .

101-508 ) , 1993 ( p.l .

103-66 ) , 2001 ( p.l .

107-16 ) , and 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) increased the amount of the credit by changing the credit formula .

for more information on the legislative history of the eitc , see crs report r44825 , the earned income tax credit ( eitc ) : a brief legislative history , by [author name scrubbed] .

before 1990 , the credit amount was calculated as a percentage of earnings ( "the credit rate" ) up until the earned income amount .

the credit then remained at its maximum level before gradually decreasing in value as earned income increased .

legislative changes to the credit made during this time generally increased the amount of the credit in a variety of ways including increasing the credit rate , increasing the earned income amount , increasing the phase - out amount threshold , and decreasing the phase - out rate .

nonetheless , the credit amount depended on earned income .

beginning in 1990 and more substantially in 1993 , the credit formula was revised such that the credit amount varied based on earned income and , to a certain extent , the number of qualifying children .

this essentially increased the credit by family size .

in addition , for the first time in 1993 , congress made workers without qualifying children eligible for the eitc , although the credit was smaller than the credit for claimants with qualifying children .

in 2001 , the credit formula was revised again so that it also varied based in part on marital status .

as a result of this change , often referred to as "marriage penalty relief," certain married tax filers would receive a larger credit than unmarried tax filers with the same number of children .

in 2009 , the marriage penalty relief was expanded further and a larger credit was created for families with three or more children .

these 2009 changes were extended several times and made permanent by p.l .

114-113 .

figure 3 shows the number of tax filers claiming the eitc for 1975 to 2015 .

figure 4 shows the amount of the eitc claimed on these returns , with dollar amounts adjusted for inflation to represent 2015 dollars .

the figures show the effects of the legislative expansions of the eitc , with the credit experiencing growth in the late 1980s through the mid - 1990s and then again in the 2000s .

as shown on figure 4 , throughout the history of the eitc , most credits have been paid in the form of refunds , with a relatively small share of the eitc reducing regular federal income tax liability .

the growth in the total amount of eitc claimed in the late 1980s to the mid - 1990s was due to increases not only in participation , but also in the average credit received by tax filers .

figure 5 shows the average eitc claimed for 1975 to 2015 , in inflation - adjusted ( 2015 ) dollars .

before the 1986 tax reform act ( p.l .

99-514 ) , eitc thresholds were not indexed for inflation , and the average credit lost value each year .

however , the 1986 act increased the monetary parameters of the credit for prior inflation and adjusted the threshold amounts and maximum credits annually for inflation in future years .

the credit formula was also revised in 1990 and then again in 1993 such that the amount of the credit depended to a certain extent on family size .

these changes resulted in an increasing average credit between the late 1980s and late 1990s .

since then , the average credit has largely maintained its real value .

however , increases in the average credit amount in 2001 and 2009 were likely due to legislative changes that included larger credits for some married claimants and for families with three or more children .

the average eitc claimed for 2015 was $2,440 .

for 2015 , $68.5 billion of the eitc was claimed on 28.1 million tax returns .

most tax filers claiming the eitc , and those who received the most eitc dollars , were families with children .

figure 6 shows total eitc dollars claimed for 2015 by number of qualifying children .

for 2015 , 3% of all eitc dollars were claimed by tax filers with no qualifying children and 97% were claimed by tax filers with qualifying children .

of this 97% , 36% were claimed by tax filers with one qualifying child , 40% were claimed by tax filers with two qualifying children , and 21% were claimed by tax filers with three or more qualifying children .

though childless tax filers claimed 3% of all eitc dollars for 2014 , they accounted for 26% of all tax filers that claimed the eitc .

thus , their small share of total eitc dollars reflects , in part , the lower credit amount available to childless filers .

figure 7 shows the number of returns claiming the eitc for 2015 by number of qualifying children .

figure 8 shows the average eitc claimed for 2015 by number of qualifying children .

the average eitc for 2015 increased with the number of qualifying children a tax filer claimed: the eitc was claimed by 7.3 million tax filers with no qualifying children , with an average claim of $294 .

the eitc was claimed by 10.3 million filers with one qualifying child , with an average claim of $2,411 .

the eitc was claimed by 7.1 million filers with two qualifying children , with an average claim of $3,830 .

the eitc was claimed by 3.4 million filers with three or more qualifying children , with an average claim of $4,185 .

though the eitc is targeted toward lower - income earners , tax filers with children may receive the eitc even with income well above the poverty level .

 ( the federal poverty level for a family of three was $20,090 in 2015. ) .

however , the largest eitc benefits are focused on low - income earners near the poverty line , with those with greater earnings receiving reduced benefits .

figure 9 shows the number of tax returns with eitc claims for 2015 by adjusted gross income level .

figure 9 shows that the most typical ( modal ) eitc tax return had an agi between $10,000 and $14,999 , with 6.2 million returns including an eitc in that income range for 2015 .

for that year , close to half ( 48.1% ) of all returns with eitc claims had agis below $15,000 .

this agi is equivalent to earnings less than the $15,080 earned by a full - time ( 40 hour per week ) full - year ( 52 weeks per year ) worker earning the federal minimum wage ( $7.25 per hour ) .

figure 9 also shows the average eitc claimed by agi category .

average eitc benefits first increase with agi , then decline .

this outcome reflects the formula for determining the eitc , which provides an increasing credit up to a maximum amount , then ultimately a reduced credit as it is phased out above a certain income threshold ( see table 1 and figure 2 ) .

it also reflects a difference in the mix of family types claiming the eitc in the various agi categories .

for example , 73% of all filers claiming the eitc with agis of less than $5,000 had no qualifying children .

all those claiming the eitc at agis above $25,000 in 2015 had qualifying children , and hence were eligible for a larger maximum eitc benefit than filers without children .

for detail on returns claiming the eitc by agi and number of qualifying children , see table a - 2 .

the internal revenue service does not provide data on eitc dollars claimed by filing status .

the tax policy center ( tpc ) , however , estimated that in 2015 , 70% of all eitc dollars will be claimed by unmarried tax filers ( head of household and single filing statuses ) , with most ( 60% of all eitc dollars ) claimed by those filing as heads of household .

figure 10 shows estimates for eitc dollars claimed by filing status for 2015 .

for tax year 2015 , the eitc was claimed on 18.7% of all tax returns .

however , the rate at which the eitc is claimed by tax filers varies considerably by state .

in 2015 , the state with the highest percentage of returns claiming the eitc was mississippi , with the credit claimed on 31.6% of all returns .

in contrast , the eitc was claimed on 11.5% of all returns in new hampshire that year .

figure 11 provides a map showing the percentage of all tax returns claiming the eitc by state .

in addition to considerable state variation , the map shows that there is a regional pattern to eitc receipt .

a greater share of returns filed in certain southern states claimed the eitc than returns in other regions of the country .

the eitc was claimed on the smallest percentage of returns in new england as well as some states in the northern midwest .
