on june 29 , 2006 , the senate committee on appropriations reported h.r .

5427 , the energy and water appropriations bill for fy2007 ( s.rept .

109-274 ) .

this bill includes funding for the doe energy efficiency program , which is conducted by the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) .

compared with house - passed funding for fy2007 , the senate committee approved an increase of $66.1 million ( 5% ) for all eere programs .

table 3 shows other differences , most notably increases for buildings and clean cities programs ; and decreases for weatherization , fuel cells , femp , program management , and industry programs .

compared with fy2006 funding , the committee recommends an increase of $211.7 million ( 18% ) for eere r&d and deployment programs .

this reflects support for the advanced energy initiative , including an increase for the hydrogen program ( $34.2 million ) .

the main cuts include the weatherization program ( - $42.6 million ) , industrial programs ( - $9.3 million ) , and program management ( - $9.9 million ) .

regarding earmarks , both the house ( $26.1 million ) and senate ( $15.8 million ) figures are much lower than the $76.4 million enacted for fy2006 .

for the environmental protection agency's climate protection ( energy efficiency ) programs ( h.r .

5386 ) , the senate appropriations committee approved $105.8 million .

also , appropriations bills for the department of agriculture ( h.r .

5384 ) and the department of state ( h.r .

5522 ) fund energy efficiency programs .

the energy efficiency provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .

109-58 , h.r .

6 ) and other bills of the 109 th congress are discussed in the " energy efficiency in the 109 th congress " and " legislation " sections below .

by curbing the demand for petroleum fuels , energy efficiency measures may contribute to energy security by reducing oil import dependence and the risk of oil shortages , energy price shocks , and their attendant impacts on the national economy .

by cutting demand for natural gas , energy efficiency may dampen natural gas prices and reduce the need for liquefied natural gas ( lng ) imports .

also , by curbing the demand for electricity , energy efficiency may reduce the risk of brownouts , blackouts , and other reliability problems .

energy efficiency is seen as a key means to reduce fossil fuel - induced carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) emissions that may contribute to global climate change .

federal efforts to curb emissions through increased energy efficiency may be affected by debates over program appropriations , by the extent to which epact's energy efficiency tax incentives are used , and by the rate at which doe implements epact's equipment efficiency standards .

in the 109 th congress , more than 260 bills with provisions for energy efficiency or renewable energy have been introduced .

a general description of the energy efficiency provisions in these bills , including those enacted into law , is available in crs report rl32860 , energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation in the 109 th congress , by [author name scrubbed] .

the report also groups the bills by policy and issue areas , provides a table that identifies recent action on the bills , and discusses recent action on a month - by - month basis .
