head start , a federal program that has provided comprehensive early childhood development services to low - income children since 1965 , was last reauthorized in 1998 for fiscal years 1999-2003 .

the program has remained alive in subsequent years through the annual appropriations process .

after unsuccessful efforts by the 108 th and 109 th congresses to complete the reauthorization process , the 110 th congress has undertaken the task .

the house and senate have each passed its own version of a reauthorization bill , the senate version adopting the house bill's number ( h.r .

1429 ) and representing only a slightly modified version of the bill reported by the senate health , education , labor , and pensions committee ( s. 556 ) .

on november 9 , 2007 , house and senate conferees filed a conference report ( h.rept .

110-439 ) .

this report does not yet reflect the provisions contained in that agreement .

the improving head start act of 2007 ( h.r .

1429 ) was introduced by representative kildee on march 9 , 2007 .

the following week , the house committee on education and labor debated , amended , and approved the bill ( 42-1 ) , and the committee's written report accompanying the legislation ( h.rept .

110-67 ) was filed on march 23 , 2007 .

that bill was taken to the house floor on may 2 , and was approved ( with nine amendments ) by a vote of 365-48 .

twelve amendments in total were offered on the floor , in addition to a motion to recommit ( which was rejected ) .

the head start for school readiness act ( s. 556 ) was introduced by senator kennedy on february 12 , 2007 , and approved via voice vote by the senate committee on health , education , labor , and pensions ( help ) on february 14 .

the chairman's amended version of the bill was subsequently reported on march 29 , 2007 ; a written report ( s.rept .

110-49 ) was filed april 10 , 2007 .

on june 19 , the senate passed ( by voice vote under a unanimous consent agreement ) its bill , adopting the bill number of the reauthorization bill that passed the house ( h.r .

1429 ) , but substituting its own committee - reported bill language of s. 556 ( with a few technical changes ) .

both reauthorization bills propose to amend head start with the purpose of improving the program's ability to promote low - income children's school readiness by supporting their cognitive , social , emotional , and physical development .

the means for doing so encompass a wide range of provisions , covering issues of program funding , administration , eligibility , accountability , quality , governance , and coordination .

below is an overview of broad areas addressed in the proposed legislation , followed by table 1 , a detailed side - by - side comparison of each bill's provisions with current law ( and , where relevant , current regulations ) .

the areas listed below are not intended to encompass every provision included in each of the respective bills , but rather major areas addressed .

the table does not reflect the provisions agreed to in conference .

 table 1 provides a detailed comparison of the house - and senate - passed versions of h.r .

1429 , and current law .

where applicable , current regulations are included to show whether changes proposed in the reauthorization bills would reflect practical changes to the program .

as stated earlier , the table does not include provisions agreed to in the conference report ( h.rept .

110-439 ) filed on november 9 , 2007 .

the table is structured in the order of current law's sections .

in cases where bills address the same or similar provisions by amending different sections of current law , that has been noted in the table .

the table also notes if a provision was added as an amendment during house floor debate .
