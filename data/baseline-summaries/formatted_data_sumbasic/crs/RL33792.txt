the 110 th congress is considering actions that affect the various uses and management of federal lands administered by the bureau of land management and the forest service .

these actions include legislation , administrative or regulatory proposals , and litigation and judicial decisions .

issue areas include access to energy resources on federal lands ; development of hardrock minerals ; designation of the national landscape conservation system ; wilderness designation ; management of wild horses and burros ; wildfire protection ; forest service implementation of the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) ; and other issues .

many of these issues have been of interest to congress and the nation for decades .

the bureau of land management ( blm ) in the department of the interior ( doi ) and the forest service ( fs ) in the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) manage 449 million acres of land , more than two - thirds of the land owned by the federal government and one - fifth of the total u.s. land area .

the blm manages 255.8 million acres of land , predominantly in the west .

the fs administers 192.8 million acres of federal land , also concentrated in the west .

the blm and fs have similar management responsibilities for their lands , and many key issues affect both agencies' lands .

thus , merging the two agencies often is proposed .

by law , blm and fs lands are to be administered for multiple uses , although slightly different uses are specified for each agency .

in practice , the land uses considered by the agencies include recreation , range , timber , minerals , watershed , wildlife and fish , and conservation .

blm and fs lands also are required to be managed for sustained yield — a high level of resource outputs in perpetuity — without impairing the productivity of the lands .

however , each agency also has unique emphases and functions .

for instance , most rangelands are managed by the blm , and the blm administers mineral development on all federal lands .

most federal forests are managed by the fs , and only the fs has a cooperative program to assist nonfederal forest landowners .

moreover , development of the two agencies has differed , and historically they have focused on different issues .

nonetheless , there are many parallels .
