hyperlinking , in - line linking , caching , framing , thumbnails .

terms that describe internet functionality pose interpretative challenges for the courts as they determine how these activities relate to a copyright holder's traditional right to control reproduction , display , and distribution of protected works .

at issue is whether basic operation of the internet , in some cases , constitutes or facilitates copyright infringement .

if so , is the activity is a "fair use" protected by the copyright act ? .

these issues frequently implicate search engines , which scan the web to allow users to find posted content .

both the posted content and the end - use thereof may be legitimate or infringing .

in 2003 , the ninth circuit court of appeals decided kelly v. arriba soft corp. , which held that a search engine's online display of protected "thumbnail" images was a fair use of copyright protected work .

more recently , courts have considered an internet search engine's caching , linking , and the display of thumbnails in a context other than that approved in kelly .

in field v. google , a u.s. district court found that google's system of displaying cached images did not infringe the content owner's copyright .

and in perfect 10 v. amazon.com inc. , the ninth circuit reconsidered issues relating to a search engine's practice using thumbnail images , in - line linking , and framing , finding the uses to be noninfringing .

they are discussed below .

kelly v. arriba soft corp. is a significant internet copyright case arising from the ninth circuit court of appeals .

there , the court addressed the interface between the public's fair use rights and two of a copyright holder's exclusive rightsâthose of reproduction and public display .

in field v. google , a u.s. district court considered a claim for copyright infringement against the internet search engine , google .

field sought statutory damages and injunctive relief against google for permitting internet users to access copies of images temporarily stored on its online repository , or cache .

in the course of granting summary judgment for google , the court explained the caching process: there are billions of web pages accessible on the internet .

it would be impossible for google to locate and index or catalog them manually .

accordingly , google , like other search engines , uses an automated program ( called the "googlebot" ) to continuously crawl across the internet , to locate and analyze available web pages , and to catalog those web pages into google's searchable web index .

as part of this process , google makes and analyzes a copy of each web page that it finds , and stores the html code from those pages in a temporary repository called a cache .

once google indexes and stores a web page in the cache , it can include that page , as appropriate , in the search results it displays to users in response to their queries .

when google displays web pages in its search results , the first item appearing in each result is the title of a web page which , if clicked by the user , will take the user to the online location of that page .

the title is followed by a short "snippet" from the web page in smaller font .

following the snippet , google typically provides the full url for the page .

then , in the same smaller font , google often displays another link labeled "cached. .

when clicked , the "cached" link directs an internet user to the archival copy of a web page stored in google's system cache , rather than to the original web site for that page .

by clicking on the "cached" link for a page , a user can view the "snapshot" of that page , as it appeared the last time the site was visited and analyzed by the googlebot .

the court emphasized that there are numerous , industry - wide mechanisms , such as "meta - tags," for website owners to use communicate with internet search engines .

owners can instruct crawlers , or robots , not to analyze or display a site in its web index .

owners posting on the internet can use a google - specific "no - archive" meta - tag to instruct the search engine not to provide cached links to a website .

in view of these well - established means for communicating with internet search engines , the court concluded that the plaintiff "decided to manufacture a claim for copyright infringement against google in the hopes of making money from google's standard practice. .

despite its acknowledgment of the plaintiff's rather dubious motives , the court nevertheless discussed the merits of the copyright infringement claims .

specifically , the plaintiff did not claim that google committed infringement when the googlebot made initial copies of field's copyrighted web pages and stored them in its cache .

rather , the alleged infringing activity occurred when a google user clicked on a cached link to the web page and downloaded a copy of those pages from google's computers .

assuming , for the purposes of summary judgment , that google's display of cached links to field's work did constitute direct copyright infringement , the court considered four defenses raised by google , and found in its favor on all counts .

implied license .

first , the court found that the plaintiff had granted google an implied , nonexclusive license to display the work because "[c]onsent to use the copyrighted work need not be manifested verbally and may be inferred based on silence where the copyright holder knows of the use and encourages it. .

field's failure to use meta - tags to instruct the search engine not to cache could reasonably be interpreted as a grant of a license for that use .

estoppel .

the court invoked the facts supporting its finding of an implied license to support the equitable argument that field was precluded from asserting a copyright claim .

the court reiterated that field could have prevented the caching , did not do so , and allowed google to detrimentally rely on the absence of meta - tags .

had google known the defendant's objection to displaying cached versions of its website , it would not have done so .

fair use .

in a detailed analysis , the court concluded that google's cache satisfies the statutory criteria for a fair use: purpose and character of use .

the search engine's use of the protected material is transformative .

rather than serving an artistic function , its display of the images served an archival function , allowing users to access content when the original page is inaccessible .

nature of the copyrighted works .

even assuming the copyrighted images are creative , field published his works on the internet , making them available to world for free ; he added code to his site to ensure that all search engines would include his website in their search listings .

amount and substantiality of the use .

the court found that google's display of entire web pages in its cached links serves multiple transformative and socially valuable purposes .

it cited the u.s. supreme court's decision in sony corp. v. universal studios , inc. and kelly , supra , as examples where copying of an entire work is a fair use .

the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .

although the plaintiff distributed his images on the internet for free , he argued that google's activity undercut licensing fees that he could potentially develop by selling access to cached links to his website .

the court found that there was no evidence of an existing or developing market for licensing search engines the right to allow access to web pages through cached links .

good faith .

in addition to the statutory criteria of 17 u.s.c .

â§ 107 , the court considered equitable factors and found the google operates in good faith because it honors industry - wide protocols to refrain from caching where so instructed .

conversely , the plaintiff deliberately ignored the protocols available to him in order to establish a claim for copyright infringement .

the digital millennium copyright act ( dmca ) .

finally , the court held that google is protected by the safe harbor provision of the dmca , which states that "[a] service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief ... for infringement of copyright by reason of the intermediate and temporary storage of material on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider[.] .

procedural background .

more recently , in perfect 10 v. amazon.com , the ninth circuit revisited and expanded upon several of the issues that it had considered earlier in kelly .

perfect 10 , a company that markets and sells copyrighted images of nude models , filed actions to enjoin google and amazon.com from infringing its copyrighted photographs .

specifically , it sought to prevent google's display of thumbnail images on its image search function , and to prevent both google and amazon from linking to third - party websites that provided full - sized , infringing versions of the images .

the district court found that in - line linking and framing were permissible , non - infringing uses of protected content .

therefore , it did not enjoin google from linking to third - party websites that display full - sized infringing versions of the images , holding that perfect 10 was not likely to prevail on its claim that google violated its display or distribution rights by linking to these images .

but the district court did enter a preliminary injunction against google for its creation and public display of the thumbnail versions of perfect 10's images .

in a separate action , the court declined to preliminarily enjoin amazon.com from giving users access to similar information provided to amazon.com by google .

the court of appeals affirmed the district court's holding with respect to the permissibility of in - line linking and framing .

but it reversed the holding with respect to the use of thumbnail images , finding the use to be fair despite the potential of the thumbnails to encroach upon a potential commercial market for their use .

it left open the questions of possible liability for contributory copyright infringement and / or immunity therefor under the dmca , remanding the case to the district court for appropriate findings .

these decisions are examined below .

it is no coincidence that search engines are frequently - named defendants in online copyright infringement litigation .

their role in internet connectivity is vital .

the infringement liability implications of that role are arguably more complex than a preliminary determination whether an individual website is posting infringing content .

in the dmca , congress amended the copyright act to create a safe harbor for the internet service provider that operates as a "passive conduit" for transmission and exchange of third - party offerings .

as the sophistication of internet mass - offerings grow , from text and images to broader audiovisual formats , the function of the search engines is likely to increase in scope and sophistication as well .

a valuable component is the actual search and indexing function which enables internet users to post and find content .

most prominent search engines are , however , commercial , profit - making entities who benefit from traffic generated by their search capabilities .

providing search capability creates and satisfies an important market , but what impact does it have on emerging ones ? .

as the courts apply traditional copyright principles to the internet , they must factor in its functionality and architecture .

in kelly , the ninth circuit grappled with the concept of displaying thumbnail images as a search tool .

it found the use to be highly transformative , socially valuable , and "fair," but reserved judgment on the questions of in - line linking and framing .

in field , the district court considered caching , finding it to be fair as well .

of great significance to the court was the fact that content owners can control the ability of search engines to search and / or cache their websites .

in perfect 10 , the ninth circuit considered thumbnail displays in a different context: namely , where a search engine displays thumbnails of infringing images and derives advertising revenue that is more closely linked to the posting .

although plaintiff had persuaded the lower court that the thumbnails , though transformative of the full - size images , could or would undermine a developing market for reduced - size images , the court of appeals reaffirmed the fair use analysis derived from kelly .

and , it took up where kelly left off , holding that in - line linking and framing were not displays for copyright purposes .

but the court left open the possibility that a search engine's actual conduct with respect to infringing content could be proven to be contributory infringement .

taken together , these cases indicate a willingness by the courts to acknowledge the social utility of online indexing , and factor it into fair use analysis ; to adapt copyright law to the core functionality and purpose of internet , even when that means requiring content owners to act affirmatively , such as by the use of meta - tags ; and to weigh and balance conflicts between useful functions , such as online indexing and caching , against emerging , viable new markets for content owners .
