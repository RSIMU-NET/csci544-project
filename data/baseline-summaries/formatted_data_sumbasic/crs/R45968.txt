the department of defense ( dod ) operates a military health system ( mhs ) that delivers certain health entitlements under chapter 55 of title 10 , u.s. code .

the defense health agency ( dha ) âa component of the mhsâadministers the tricare program , which offers health care services to approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries , composed of military personnel , retirees , and their families .

beneficiaries may receive health care services in dod - operated hospitals and clinicsâknown as military treatment facilities ( mtfs ) âor through participating civilian health care providers .

dod operates 723 mtfs in the united states and in overseas locations .

each mtf provides a range of clinical services depending on its size , mission , and level of capabilities .

only active duty servicemembers are entitled to care in any mtf .

dependents and retirees may receive care on a space - available basis that takes into account patient capacity , beneficiary category ( eg , servicemember , family member , retiree ) , and enrollment status .

when care is not available at an mtf , beneficiaries may receive care from a civilian health care provider who participates in tricare .

the three main health plan options offered to eligible beneficiaries include tricare prime , tricare select , and tricare for life .

tricare also offers premium - based health plan options for certain beneficiaries , such as qualified members of the selected reserve , retired reservists , young adults , and transitioning servicemembers .

other tricare benefits include a pharmacy program , optional dental plans , and a vision plan for certain beneficiaries .

this report answers frequently asked questions about tricare health plan options tailored for certain reservists , retired reservists , and their families ( i.e. , tricare reserve select and tricare retired reserve ) and certain statutory prohibitions that limit their participation in the plans .

tricare reserve select ( trs ) is a premium - based health plan available worldwide for some members of the selected reserve and their families .

trs was established by section 701 of the ronald w. reagan national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) of fiscal year 2005 ( p.l .

108-375 ) .

tricare retired reserve ( trr ) is a premium - based health plan available worldwide for qualified retired members of the reserve components .

trr was established by section 705 of the ndaa for fy2010 ( p.l .

111-84 ) as a tricare coverage option for so - called gray area reservists , defined as those who have retired but are too young to draw retired pay .

the plans are similar to tricare select ( i.e. , preferred provider option ) , which feature monthly premiums , annual deductibles , and fixed co - pays when receiving care from a network provider or paying a percentage of the allowable charge when receiving care from a tricare - authorized , nonnetwork provider .

eligible beneficiaries residing outside of the united states are also eligible for trs and trr ; however , the availability of network providers may be limited based on geographic location .

by law , the department of defense ( dod ) is required to subsidize the cost of trs .

servicemembers pay 28% of the cost of the program in the form of premiums .

for trr , enrollees pay the full cost of the calculated premium as determined by the secretary of defense .

dod does not subsidize the program costs for trr .

dod annually updates the premiums for each program on an "appropriate actuarial basis. .

monthly trs and trr premiums for calendar years 2019 and 2020 are listed in table 1 .

dod reports that at the end of fy2018 , 383,683 beneficiaries were covered by trs and 9,019 beneficiaries were covered by trr .

members of the selected reserve ( i.e. , drilling reservists ) and their families qualify for trs if the following criteria are met: the reservist is not on active duty orders ; the reservist or their family members are not covered under the transitional assistance management program ; and the reservist or their family members are not eligible for the federal employee health benefits ( fehb ) program .

prior to 2006 , trs availability was limited to members of the selected reserve ( including family members ) after serving on continuous active duty in support of a contingency operation for 90 or more days and signing an agreement to continue serving in the selected reserve for one or more years .

trs coverage was also limited to the lesser of: one year ( in cases where an activated reservist does not continuously serve on active duty for at least 90 days due to an "injury , illness , or disease incurred or aggravated while deployed" ) ; one year for each consecutive period of 90 days of continuous active duty service ; or the number of years agreed upon in the military service obligation agreement .

section 706 of the john warner ndaa for fy2007 ( p.l .

109-364 ) amended 10 u.s.c .

â§1076d to expand trs eligibility , including removal of the military service obligation agreement , active duty service length , and period of coverage requirements .

in revising trs , the law also added a prohibition on members of the selected reserve and their family members from being eligible for trs if they are also eligible for , or enrolled in , "a health benefits plan under chapter 89 of title 5," u.s. code .

this health benefit plan is known as the fehb program .

retired members of the reserve components and their family members qualify for trr if the following criteria are met: the retiree is qualified for non - regular retirement under chapter 1223 of title 10 , u.s. code ; the retiree is under age 60 ; and the retiree or their family members are not eligible for the fehb program .

p.l .

111-84 , which established trr , incorporated a similar prohibition on qualified retired members of the reserve components and their family members from being eligible for trr if they are eligible for the fehb program .

for example , a reservist or qualified retired reservist who is also a civil service or u.s .

postal service ( usps ) employee , annuitant , or family member that is eligible for the fehb program is barred from enrolling in trs or trr .

this restriction does not apply to other tricare programs for which reservists or retired reservists may also be eligible under other criteria ( eg , tricare prime , tricare select , tricare for life , tricare dental program , or the transition assistance management program ) .

in 2019 , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimated approximately 110,000 members of the selected reserve are prohibited from enrolling in trs because they are eligible for fehb .

this represents approximately 13.7% of the total selected reserve force .

cbo also estimated that about "one third would enroll in trs if given the opportunity. .

neither dod nor cbo has published any similar estimates for trr .

the congressional record , the committee and conference reports accompanying the enacting and amending legislation for trs and trr , do not articulate why the prohibitions are in place .

nevertheless , observers have speculated that the prohibition may be related to potential increases in mandatory or discretionary costs associated with certain risk - pool adjustments to fehb and expansion of the tricare program .

as the house of representatives considered the fy2007 ndaa , as reported by the house armed services committee , the office of management and budget issued a statement of administration policy ( sap ) that expressed cost concerns with the proposal to expand to trs .

the sap noted: â¦ the administration strongly opposes section 709 , which expands tricare eligibility to all selected reserve members and their families and dramatically worsens the fiscal situation by increasing the government subsidy for non - mobilized reservists and their families at an estimated cost of $400 million in fy 2007 and $3.6 billion from fy 2007 through fy 2011 .

by fy 2011 , it is estimated that the annual cost for this expanded benefit will reach $1.2 billion .

it is critical for congress to eliminate these unfunded expansions and work with the administration to place the system on a sound fiscal foundation .

reservists , qualified retired reservists , or their family members subject to the statutory prohibitions may obtain health insurance coverage , if eligible , through any of the following health insurance options: fehb ; medicaid ; private individual health insurance ; or employer - sponsored insurance ( eg , personally or as offered through a spouse's employer ) .

reservists serving in a federal active duty status for greater than 30 days are eligible to participate in tricare programs for active duty servicemembers , including tricare prime .

the fehb program establishes several premium rates based on geographic location , coverage option , and federal employee category .

the monthly average premium rates ( non - usps employee and annuitant ) for calendar year 2019 are listed in table 2 .

reservists who are eligible for fehb , for any reason , are disqualified from participation in trs or trr .

reservists not employed by the federal government ( and not eligible for fehb ) may participate in trs or trr .

certain military service organizations ( msos ) perceive and advocate that the removal of the statutory prohibition for trs or trr would create equality among all members of the selected reserves or qualified retired reservists .

these advocacy groups also note that in doing so , all members of the selected reserves would be able to access trs as a "more affordable option" than fehb , which has higher premiums and cost shares .

in a 2018 report to congress on reserve component health care , dod states that reservists have "expressed strong feelings of discontent with the law that disqualifies selected reserve members from purchasing tricare reserve select ( trs ) for themselves or for family members if they are eligible for , or enrolled in , the fehb program. .

dod also noted in its report that reservists "would like congress to repeal the fehb exclusion and dod fully supports its repeal ; " however , dod made no recommendation concerning this issue at the time it produced the report nor has it any time since .

while expanding trs or trr eligibility would have certain cost implications for dod , there are also cost considerations for other federal agencies that fund fehb benefits for their respective federal employees .

in june 2019 , cbo published a cost estimate of a proposal to remove the trs prohibition starting in 2030âsection 703 of the fy2020 ndaa ( h.r .

2500 ; as reported by the house armed services committee ) .

overall , there would be an estimated savings to the federal government .

however , given certain statutory or house pay - as - you - go ( paygo ) rules , increases in mandatory spending must be offset by "direct spending cuts , revenue increases , or a combination of the two," rather than by savings in discretionary spending .

cbo estimates that expanding trs eligibility would produce an increase in mandatory costs , noting that: because members of the selected reserve are younger and healthier than the average federal employee , reservists and their family members who discontinue fehb coverage would cause an increase in premiums for all remaining fehb beneficiaries , including federal retirees and active postal employees , whose premiums are paid from mandatory accounts .

when implemented , cbo estimates this section would increase direct spending by about $40 million each year beginning in 2030 .

concurrently , cbo also estimates there would also be savings in discretionary spending , greater than the increase in mandatory costs: on net , cbo estimates section 703 would eventually reduce discretionary costs to the government by about $250 million per year beginning in 2030 because the cost of trs is less than the government's share of the premium for fehb .

section 703 would also affect spending for other fehb beneficiaries .

dod asserts that reservists and their spouses "show satisfaction with the tricare program in general , and trs in particular. .

beneficiaries enrolled in trs are reportedly satisfied with their tricare plan and the quality of health care provided .

for example , dod observed in the 2014 survey of reserve component spouse s that 48% found "no difference" between trs and civilian health insurance plans .

dod also observed that 32% of survey participants believed that trs provides "better" or "much better" health care than civilian health plans .

similar results can be found in certain mso - conducted surveys of beneficiaries .

while many trs enrollees express a general satisfaction with their tricare plan , some beneficiaries have described certain challenges , such as: difficulty in finding health care providers and facilities that accept tricare ; maintaining continuity of care for a family member when a reservist is activated and ordered to active duty ; and having to reenroll in trs after a reservist transitions from active duty to the selected reserve .

since the creation of trs and trr , congress has considered a number of proposals to eliminate the statutory prohibitions described above ( see table 3 ) .

to date , none of the proposals have been enacted .
