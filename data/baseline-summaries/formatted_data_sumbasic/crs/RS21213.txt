rs21213 - - colombia: summary and tables on u.s. assistance , fy1989-fy2004 updated may 19 , 200 .

while the united states has been providing counternarcotics ( cn ) assistance to colombia at least as far back as the mid - 1970s , former president george h.w .

bushdramatically increased cn aid to colombia through his 1989 "andean initiative. .

grant aid to colombia hadincreased gradually , albeit not evenly , through the1980s , as colombia evolved from a major supplier of marijuana to the united states , to nearly the sole supplier ofcocaine .

by the end of the 1980s , with coca leafcultivation and cocaine production rising in the andean region , and colombia suffering increased political violencefrom the medellin drug - trafficking cartel , theformer bush administration established its new cn program .

under this region - wide initiative , the united statessubstantially increased state department supportfor colombian cn efforts , and provided colombian security forces , primarily the police , with equipment throughforeign military financing grants and dodequipment drawdowns .

as part of the effort to bring military resources to bear on the "war against drugs," in 1991,congress enacted "section 1004" of the 1991national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) ( p.l.101-510 ) .

this provides the dod with authority to providetransportation , reconnaissance , training , intelligence,and base support when requested by foreign law enforcement agencies for cn purposes .

funding for colombia dropped in the first two years of the clinton administration budgets .

it began to increase in fy1997 , with increased attention to eradicationefforts .

until fy1998 , however , the numbers fell short of the bush years .

 ( 1 ) in 1998 , congress established a new authority , section 1033 of the1998ndaa ( p.l.105-85 ) , for the u.s. military to provide non - lethal equipment , and to maintain and repair counter - drug equipment .

table 2 details funding for the eleven yearsfrom fy1989 - fy1999 , which totals $1,066.7 million ( i.e. , $1.07 billion ) .

the 1998 election of a new colombian president , andres pastrana , led to a reevaluation of u.s. policy and greater cooperation .

during pastrana's october 1998state visit , president clinton announced that the united state would provide nearly three times more assistance tocolombia during fy1999 than it had the previousyear .

much of this , however , was the $173.2 million in congressionally - mandated supplemental appropriationsfunding ( p.l .

105-277 ) for helicopter and aircraft upgrades , radar , andpolice assistance that the administration had not requested .

in fy2000 , the funding again rose substantially withthe "plan colombia" legislation .

in july 2000 , congress approved the clinton administration's request for $1.3 billion in fy2000 state department and dod emergency supplemental appropriations ( p.l .

106-246 ) forthe region - wide "plan colombia," of which $860.3 was earmarked for colombia .

nearly half of the colombiafunding was dedicated to the "push into southern colombia" program toset up and train two new colombian army counternarcotics battalions ( cacbs ) , which combined with an existingone set up earlier by the united states to form a brigade of some2,700 .

the brigade assists the colombian national police ( cnp ) in the fumigation of illicit narcotics crops and thedismantling of laboratories , beginning with coca fumigation in thesouthern provinces of putumayo and caquet√° , where coca cultivation was spreading rapidly .

congress alsoprovided substantial assistance for economic development , displacedpersons , human rights monitors , and administration of justice and other governance programs , all intended to helpcolombia counter the many threats to its stability and integrity fromthe trafficking of illegal narcotics .

with its fy2002 budget request , the bush administration expanded the scope of clinton's "plan colombia" policy through its andean regional initiative ( ari ) , with continuing highlevels of support for existing "plan colombia" programs in colombia , and increased assistance to states borderingor close to colombia .

congress provided $380.5 million , nearly all ofthe administration's requested $399 million , for colombia in state department counternarcotics funding in thefy2002 foreign operations appropriations ( p.l .

107-115 ) .

 ( 2 ) as inprevious years , the appropriations bill included human rights and other conditions , and a cap on the numberdeployed of military personnel and of private contractors who are u.s.citizens .

in february 2002 , through requests for fy2002 emergency supplemental appropriations and fy2003 regular appropriations , the bush administration sought authority and funding toexpand the scope of military assistance .

in both requests , it asked for foreign military financing ( fmf ) funds to trainand equip colombian soldiers to defend oil pipelines and otherinfrastructure from attacks by leftist guerrillas , in addition to funding for plan colombia programs .

thesupplemental request also sought funding to train colombian security forces inanti - kidnapping techniques .

in addition , the supplemental submission proposed to broaden the authorities of thedefense and state departments to use fy2002 and fy2003 assistanceand unexpended plan colombia ( p.l .

106-246 ) aid to support the colombian government's "unified campaignagainst narcotics trafficking , terrorist activities , and other threats to itsnational security. .

in the month before colombia's new president , alvaro uribe , took office in august 2002 , congress provided almost all of the requested supplemental funding and expanded the scopeof military assistance permitted with those and previous - fiscal year funds .

with the fy2002 supplementalappropriations ( section 305 , p.l .

107-206 ) , congress provided authority forthe administration to use counternarcotics and other funds to support colombia's "unified campaign" againstnarcotics trafficking and against activities by organizations designated asterrorist organizations , naming specifically the two major leftist guerrilla groups , the revolutionary armed forcesof colombia and the national liberation army , and the rightist unitedself - defense forces of colombia , as well as in emergency circumstances .

congress , however , did not provideexpanded authority for activities involving any other national securitythreats .

congress extended the authority for state department fy2003 funding in the omnibus fy2003appropriations bill ( p.l .

108-7 , under the heading "andean counterdruginitiative" ) , passed in february 2003 , which included annual state department appropriations , and for dod fundingin the fy2003 defense appropriations bill ( section 8145 , p.l.107-248 ) .

congress approved just $5 million shy of the $537 million the bush administration requested in cn ( $433.2 million ) and fmf ( $93 million ) funding .

in the fy2003supplemental appropriations ( p.l .

108-11 ) , congress included $105 million for colombia: $34 million in statedepartment cn funding , $34 million in dod cn funding , and $37.1million in fmf funding .

both bills condition aid on the observance of human rights and environmental and otherrestrictions .

for fy2004 , the bush administration has requested $573 million for colombia , including $463 million in andean counterdrug initiative ( aci ) funds , and $110 million in foreignmilitary financing .

it has also requested military funding for colombia that , for the first time since plan colombiawas adopted , is not requested for a very specific purpose .

theadministration request states that fmf for colombia is intended "to support counter - terrorism operations andprotect key infrastructure such as the oil pipeline. .

table 1 shows aid to colombia from fy2000 through fy2003 and the fy2004 request .

table 2 shows aid from fy1989-fy1999 .

tables 1 and 2 include direct u.s. foreign assistance ( i.e. , the categories usually counted as u.s. foreign aid , which are in italics ) as well as the costs of goods and services provided tocolombia from other u.s. government programs supporting cn efforts there .

these figures were taken frompublically - available documents or provided directly by the departments ofstate and defense .

the united states also provides a small amount of dod excess defense articles ( eda ) tocolombia .

these charts provide as comprehensive a picture as possible of u.s. assistance to colombia , but there are limitations .

for instance , some funds are spent in colombia on counternarcoticsand other activities that are considered part of u.s. programs: for instance , the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) spends its own funds on joint operations in colombia .

otherfunds are provided through regional programs of usaid and other programs which are not counted as assistanceon a country - by - country basis .

no attempt was made to estimate suchfunds .

also , there are inconsistencies among various sources .

because of these and other constraints on gatheringdata , the amount of assistance provided to colombia may be largerthan the amounts cited in these tables .

figures on state department inc ( international narcotics control ) , aci ( andean counterdrug initiative ) , usaid , fmf , and imetfunding from statedepartment congressional presentations , budget justification documents , and allocation information provided bythe department of state .

figures on inc air wing ( fy2000-fy2004 ) provided by the state department: figures provided may 5 , 2003 .

 ( inc air wing funding supports the sprayeradication efforts .

fy2000 figure includes $5.5 million in support of thecolombian army. ) .

figures on dod 1004 , 1004 / 124 , and 1033 funding provided april 11 , 2002 , for fy2000-2002 ; and april 18 , 2003 , for fy2003 and fy2004 .

both inc air wingand dod funding are taken from regional accounts , therefore the fy2003 and fy2004 allocations are estimates,and can be shifted to respond to developing needs in other areas .

a fy2000 and thereafter , non - dod plan colombia funds are all assigned to the state department inc ( fy2000 and fy2001 ) or aci ( fy2002 and thereafter ) account ; the statedepartment transfers them to the other agencies carrying out programs in colombia with those funds .

these includethe department of justice and usaid .

the usaid fy2000 andfy2001 figures are economic support funds ( esf ) .

these usaid figures do not include funds provided to usaidfrom the inc account .

table 2 .

u.s. aid to colombia fy1989-fy1999 ( obligations and authorizations , $ millions ) sources: data is drawn from a number of sources , not all of which are consistent .

these include: various editions of the u.s. overseas loans and grants and assistance frominternational organizations "green book," prepared by the us aid budget office ; various editions of the foreignmilitary sales , foreign military construction sales , and militaryassistance facts book , prepared by the department of defense security cooperation agency ; information provideddirectly by the departments of state and defense that are notrecorded in these publications ; and by the general accounting office ( gao ) for 1996-1998 .

 ( see gao - 01-26 ) where contradictions existed , gao data was preferred .

because of apossible lack of data or inaccuracies , some yearly totals may be understated or overstated , particularly prior tofy1997 .

a in these years , there was assistance in this category of less than $50,000 .

b although it is likely that section 1004 assistance was provided to colombia as far back asfy1992 , there is no public breakdown of such assistance until fy1997 .

that is the first yearin which dod provided a publicly - available breakdown by country and authority for funding from its centralcounternarcotics account .

c not included in totals .
