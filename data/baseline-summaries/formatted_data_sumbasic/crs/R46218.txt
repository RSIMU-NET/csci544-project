b order officials are dually responsible for facilitating the lawful flow of people and goods , while at the same time preventing unauthorized entries and stopping illicit drugs and other contraband from entering the united states .

as such , policy discussions around border security often involve questions about how illicit drugs flow into the country .

these include questions about the smugglers , types and quantities of illicit drugs crossing u.s. borders , primary entry points , and methods by which drugs are smuggled .

further , these discussions often center on the shared u.s. - mexico border , as it is a major conduit through which illicit drugs flow into the united states .

mexican transnational criminal organizations ( tcos ) are a dominant influence in the u.s. illicit drug market and "remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the united states ; no other groups are currently positioned to challenge them. .

they produce and transport foreign - sourced drugs into the united states and control lucrative smuggling corridors along the southwest border .

drug intelligence and seizure data provide some insight into drug smuggling into the country .

generally , intelligence suggests that more foreign - produced cocaine , methamphetamine , heroin , and fentanyl flow into the country through official ports of entry ( poes ) than between the ports .

seizure data from u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) follows this pattern as well .

conversely , more foreign - produced marijuana has historically been believed to flow into the country between the ports rather than through them .

however , cbp seizure data indicate that , like cocaine , methamphetamine , heroin , and fentanyl , more marijuana was seized at poes than between them in fy2019 .

while indicators suggest that large amounts of illicit drugs are flowing through poes and that drug seizures are more concentrated at the ports , it is the flows between them that have been a primary topic of recent policy discussions around border security .

this report focuses on the smuggling of illicit drugs between poes .

it briefly describes how these drugs are smuggled between the ports and then illuminates the discussion of how border barriers may shift or disrupt smuggling methods and routes .

notably , there are no data that capture the total quantity of foreign - produced illicit drugs smuggled into the united states at or between poes ; drugs successfully smuggled into the country have evaded seizure by border officials and are generally not quantifiable .

in lieu of these data , officials , policymakers , and analysts sometimes rely on certain drug seizure data to help understand how and where illicit drugs are crossing u.s. borders .

by weight , marijuana continues to be the illicit drug most - seized by border officials both at and between poes , though total annual marijuana seizures have declined both at and between the ports in recent years .

historically , border officials have reported seizing more marijuana between poes than at them .

however , more marijuana , by weight , was seized at the ports than between them in fy2019 .

of the 556,351 pounds of marijuana seized by cbp in that year , 289,529 pounds ( 52% ) were seized at the ports , and 266,822 pounds ( 48% ) were seized by the border patrol between the ports .

while marijuana remains the primary drug seized by the border patrol between poes , the annual quantity seized , in pounds , has declined since fy2013 ( see figure 1 ) .

conversely , the amount of methamphetamine seized by the border patrol has increased annually since fy2013 , and seizures of cocaine , heroin , and fentanyl have fluctuated .

smugglers employ a variety of methods to move illicit drugs into the united states between poes , through land , aerial , and subterranean routes .

these methods include the use of underground tunnels , ultralight aircraft and unmanned aerial systems ( uass ) , maritime vessels , and backpackers , or "mules. .

as noted , the smuggling between the official poes has received heightened attention in policy discussions about border security .

specifically , there has been some debate about how physical barriers along the southwest border between the poes may deter or alter the smuggling of foreign - produced , illicit drugs into the country .

since the early 1990s , there have been efforts to build barriers along the southwest border , in part , to deter the unauthorized entry of migrants and smugglers .

more recently , in debates about physical barriers along the southwest border , the prevention of drug smuggling and trafficking has been cited as a key goal and a reason to expand and enhance the physical barriers .

for instance , the january 25 , 2017 , executive order 13767 stated that it is executive branch policy to "secure the southern border of the united states through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border , monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration , drug and human trafficking , and acts of terrorism. .

analysts suggest that smugglers may respond ( if they have not already , given the hundreds of miles of border barriers already in place ) by moving contraband under , over , or through the barriers , as well as around themâincluding by changing their concealment techniques to move illicit drugs more effectively through poes .

mexican traffickers utilize subterranean , cross - border tunnels to smuggle illicit drugsâprimarily marijuanaâfrom mexico into the united states .

since the first one was discovered in 1990 , tunnel construction has increased in sophistication .

tunnels may include amenities such as ventilation , electricity , elevators , and railways , and tunnel architects may take advantage of existing infrastructure such as drainage systems .

for instance , in august 2019 officials discovered a sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel running more than 4,300 feet in length ( over three - quarters of a mile ) and an average of 70 feet below the surface from tijuana , mexico , to otay mesa , caâthe longest smuggling tunnel discovered to date .

cbp and immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) have primary responsibility for investigating and interdicting subterranean smuggling .

cbp has invested in technology and services to help close certain capability gaps such as predicting potential tunnel locations as well as detecting and confirming existing tunnelsâincluding their trajectoriesâand tunneling activities .

reportedly , among the challenges in detecting tunnels is the variance in types of soil along the southwest border , which requires different types of detection sensors .

ice , cbp , and other agencies coordinate through initiatives such as the border enforcement security task force ( best ) program , where they have focused tunnel task forces in various border sectors .

the government accountability office ( gao ) recommended in 2017 that cbp and ice further establish standard operating procedures , including best practices applicable to all border sectors , to coordinate their counter - tunnel efforts .

policymakers may question whether current agency coordination is sufficient or whether the agencies have implemented or should implement gao's recommendation .

traffickers have moved contraband over border barriers through a variety of mechanisms , from tossing loads by hand and launching bundles from compressed air cannons to driving vehicles on ramps up and over certain types of fencing , as well as employing ultralight aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems ( uass ) and drones .

while ultralights are used to transport bulkier marijuana shipments , "uass can only convey small multi - kilogram amounts of illicit drugs at a time and are therefore not commonly used , though [officials see] potential for increased growth and use. .

for instance , in august 2017 , border agents arrested a smuggler who used a drone to smuggle 13 pounds of methamphetamine over the border fence from mexico into california .

border officials have tested several systems to enhance detection of ultralights and uass crossing the border .

currently , cbp uses a variety of radar technology , including the tethered aerostat radar system .

these technologies are not , however , focused specifically on detecting illicit drugs being smuggled into the country over barriers ; rather , they are more broadly used to help detect unauthorized movement of people and goods .

policymakers may examine technologies acquired and used by border officials , including whether they allow officials to keep pace with the evolving strategies of smugglers moving illicit drugs over the u.s. bordersâspecifically , over border barriers .

in addition , they may examine whether , as gao has recommended , cbp is assessing its performance in interdicting uass and ultralights against specific performance targets to better evaluate the outcome of using these technologies .

various forms of physical barriers exist along the southwest border , generally intended to prevent the passage of vehicles and pedestrians .

barrier styles and materials include expanded metal , steel mesh , chain link , steel and concrete bollards , and others .

smugglers have found ways to defeat them .

they have cut holes and driven vehicles through fencing and , in at least one instance , have bribed border officials to provide keys to the fencing and inside knowledge about unpatrolled roads and sensor locations .

more recently , smugglers have reportedly sawed through steel and concrete bollards on the newly constructed border barrier ; "after cutting through the base of a single bollard , smugglers can push the steel out of the way , creating an adult - size gap" through which people and drugs can pass .

some have noted that border barriers may deter some portion of illegal drug smuggling , while an unknown portion will be displaced to areas without fencing .

specifically , along the southwest border , barriers may shift some portion of smuggling traffic to other areas of the land border between the united states and mexico as well as to the ocean .

some of these alternate areas may have terrain that acts as some sort of a barrier , presenting different challenges than those from constructed border barriers .

these challenges may , in turn , deter or alter drug smuggling .

in addition , there have been reports that the newly constructed border barrier in the san diego border sector has coincided with an increase of maritime smuggling along that coast .

smugglers use small open vessels ( "pangas" ) , which can travel at high speeds .

they also use recreational boats and small commercial fishing vessels that can be outfitted with hidden compartments to "blend in with legitimate boaters. .

in addition to moving illicit drugs across water or open areas of the land border without manmade barriers , the addition or enhancement of border barriers could lead some smugglers to move their contraband through poes .

the most recent data from cbp indicate that , in pounds , more illicit drugsâspecifically marijuana , cocaine , methamphetamine , heroin , and fentanylâare already being moved through poes than between them .

policymakers may question whether any drug smuggling displaced to the poes as a result of additional or augmented border barriers is a substantive change .

a question policymakers may ask is what effect , if any , increased miles or enhanced styles of border barriers may have on drug smuggling between the poes .

specifically , they may question whether additional border barrier construction will substantially alter drug smugglers' routes , tactics , speed , or abilities to breach these barriers and bring contraband into the country .

a comprehensive analysis of this issue is confounded by a number of factors , the most fundamental being that the exact quantity of illicit drugs flowing into the united states is unknown .

without this baseline , analysts , enforcement officials , and policymakers rely on other data , albeit selected or incomplete , to help inform whether or how border barriers may affect illicit drug smuggling .

border barriers are only one component of tactical infrastructure employed at the border .

infrastructure , in turn , is only one element ( along with technology and personnel ) of border security .

isolating the potential effects of changes in border barriers from those of other infrastructure investments , as well as from the effects of changes in technology and personnel , is a very difficult task .

the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has made efforts to estimate the effectiveness of border security on the southwest border between poes ; however , the department recognizes inevitable shortcomings of these estimates due , in part , to unknown flows of people and goods .

further , its estimates of border security effectiveness do not make precise attributions of effectiveness to personnel , technology , or infrastructureâor even more specifically , the portion of infrastructure that is border barriers .

there are also factors beyond the immediate personnel , technology , and infrastructure of border security efforts that may affect drug smuggling .

these include "the demand and supply for drugs , the type of drug being shipped , terrain and climate conditions , and smuggler counterintelligence functions. .

and , it may be difficult to separate the results of border security efforts from the effects of those external factors on drug smuggling .

moreover , changes in drug smuggling cannot always be directly linked to changes in border security efforts .

policymakers may continue to question how dhs is identifying and evaluating any potential changes in drug smuggling between the poes .

more specifically , they may examine whether or how dhs is linking observed changes in drug seizure dataâsometimes used as one proxy for drug smugglingâto specific border security efforts such as expanded border barriers .

they may also consider how any return on investment in border barriers ( measured by effects on illicit drug seizures ) compares to the relative return from other border security enhancements .

relatedly , policymakers may continue to examine how dhs defines "success" or "effectiveness" of border barriers in deterring or altering drug smuggling .

for instance , is an effective barrier one that deters the smuggling of illicit drugs altogether , or might it be one that slows smugglers , changes their routes , or alters their techniques so that border officials have more time , opportunity , or ability to seize the contraband ? .

in addition , policymakers may question whether or how border barriers contribute to gathering intelligence that can be used by the broader drug - control community and whether that potential outcome is a measure of effectiveness .
