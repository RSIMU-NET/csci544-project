the child tax credit was created in 1997 by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( p.l .

105-34 ) to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children .

like other tax credits , the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit .

initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families .

a nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero , while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability , providing a cash payment primarily to low - income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax .

over the past 20 years , legislative changes have significantly changed the credit , transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper - middle class , to a refundable credit that more low - income families are eligible to claim .

this report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits .

for a complete legislative history of the credit , see crs report r45124 , the child tax credit: legislative history , by [author name scrubbed] .

the child tax credit allows taxpayers to reduce their federal income tax liability ( the income taxes owed before tax credits are applied ) by up to $2,000 per qualifying child .

if the value of the credit exceeds the amount of tax a family owes , the family may be eligible to receive a full or partial refund of the difference .

the refundable portion of the credit is sometimes referred to as the additional child tax credit or actc .

the total amount of their refund is calculated as 15% ( the refundability rate ) of earnings that exceed $2,500 ( the refundability threshold ) , up to the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit ( $1,400 per child ) .

the credit phases out for higher - income taxpayers .

the child tax credit can offset a taxpayer's alternative minimum tax ( amt ) liability .

currently , the maximum credit per child , refundability threshold , and phaseout thresholds are not indexed for inflation .

from 2018 to 2025 , the maximum amount of the actc is indexed for inflation .

table 1 provides an overview of key provisions of the child tax credit under current law and how they will change , as scheduled under p.l .

115-97 .

estimates from the internal revenue service ( irs ) and tax policy center highlight several key aspects of the child tax credit: the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has grown over time: data from the irs indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment .

these estimates do not include the impact of recent legislative changes made by p.l .

115-97 , which , all else being equal , will expand the total cost of this tax benefit .

in 2018 , the majority of the tax benefit will go to taxpayers with income between $75,000 and $500,000 : the tax policy center ( tpc ) estimates that the majority of child tax credit dollars in 2018 will go to taxpayers with more than $75,000 of income , with nearly one - third of the benefit going to taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000 .

in comparison , a relatively small share will go to very - low - income or very - high - income taxpayers .

in 2018 , over 90% of taxpayers with children and income between $30,000 and $500,000 will receive the child tax credit .

the tax policy center ( tpc ) estimates that across most income groups , the vast majority of taxpayers with children will receive the child tax credit in 2018 .

about half of the lowest - income taxpayers will receive the credit and no taxpayers with children and income over $1 million will receive the credit .

in 2018 , taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000 will on average receive the largest credit .

the tax policy center ( tpc ) estimates that taxpayers with children and income between $100,000 and $200,000 will on average receive a credit of over $3,000 in 2018 .

taxpayers with children with income under $20,000 will receive on average a credit of less than $1,000 , while the wealthiest taxpayers with children will receive on average a credit of $10 .

irs estimates of the amount of total child tax credit dollars ( inflation adjusted to 2015 dollars ) received by taxpayers indicate that this tax benefit has more than doubled in size since enactment , from aggregate receipt of $22 billion in 1998 to approximately $54 billion in 2015 , as illustrated in figure 2 .

a significant component in the growth of the child tax credit has been the growth in the refundable portion of the credit , which now comprises approximately half of child tax credit dollars received by taxpayers .

 ( for an overview of the legislative changes that have influenced the expansion of both the refundable and nonrefundable portions of the credit , see crs report r45124 , the child tax credit: legislative history , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

the most recent irs data available are for the 2015 tax year ( i.e. , 2015 income tax returns filed in 2016 ) , and hence do not include the impact of the legislative changes made to the credit by p.l .

115-97 .

as previously discussed , these legislative changes are currently scheduled to be in effect from 2018 through the end of 2025 .

the joint committee on taxation has estimated that the modification to the child tax credit formula will cost an estimated $573.4 billion between 2018 and 2026 , or on average $64 billion a year .

 ( these estimates include the budgetary cost of the $500 nonrefundable credit for non - child tax - credit - eligible dependents. ) .

jct also estimates that the new ssn requirement will save $29.8 billion between 2018 and 2026 , or on average $3 billion per year .

the tax policy center ( tpc ) estimated the distribution of aggregate child tax credit by income level for 2018 under current law ( i.e. , including the changes made by p.l .

115-97 ) .

these estimates include the $500 credit for non - child tax - credit - eligible dependents .

tpc estimates that nearly one - third of all child tax credit dollars ( 31% ) will go to taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000 , as illustrated in figure 3 .

slightly more than one - quarter of all child tax credit dollars ( 26.5% ) will go to taxpayers with income under $50,000 .

lower - income taxpayers will generally receive a credit of $1,400 or less per child , depending on their earnings .

in contrast , higher - income taxpayers with sufficient income tax liability will receive a credit of $2,000 per child .

for example , a single parent with two children and $15,000 of income will be eligible for a $1,875 credit ( received entirely as the refundable child credit or actc ) , less than the maximum actc for two children of $2,800 ( 2x $1,400 ) and less than the maximum credit for two children of $4,000 ( 2 x $2,000 ) .

the highest - income taxpayers will not receive a credit due to the credit phaseout .

tpc estimated the share of all taxpayers and taxpayers with children that would receive the child tax credit in 2018 .

the estimates indicate that among taxpayers with children , almost all taxpayers will receive the child tax credit .

more than 90% of taxpayers with children and income between $40,000 and $500,000 will receive the child tax credit .

in contrast , about half ( 51% ) of taxpayers with children and income under $10,000 will receive the child tax credit in 2018 , and less than one - fifth ( 18% ) of taxpayers with income between $500,000 and $1 million will receive the credit , as illustrated in figure 4 .

fewer low - income families with children will benefit from the child tax credit since taxpayers with income under $2,500 ( the refundability threshold ) will not be eligible for the refundable portion of the credit .

in contrast , due to the phaseout of the credit at higher income levels , virtually no taxpayers with income over $1 million will be eligible to claim it .

tpc estimated the average child tax credit amount by income level for all taxpayers and taxpayers with children in 2018 .

their estimates indicate that taxpayers with children and income between $100,000 and $200,000 will receive the largest credit on average â€” an estimated $3,100 .

taxpayers with income under $20,000 will receive on average a credit of less than $1,000 , while the wealthiest taxpayers with children ( income over $1 million ) will on average receive a credit of $10 .

lower - income taxpayers are eligible to receive a credit of up to $1,400 per child , although they may receive less depending on their earned income .

in contrast , higher - income taxpayers , with sufficient income tax liability , will be eligible for up to a $2,000 credit per child .

the highest - income taxpayers will be ineligible for the credit due to the phaseout .
