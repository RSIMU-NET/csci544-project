national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) are a core component of the clean air act ( caa ) .

naaqs do not regulate emission sources directly ; rather , they define the level of pollution in ambient ( outdoor ) air above which health and welfare effects occur .

the statute requires that , based on a review of the scientific literature , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) set ( 1 ) "primary" standards at a level "requisite to protect the public health" with an "adequate margin of safety" and ( 2 ) "secondary" standards at a level "requisite to protect the public welfare. .

naaqs have been promulgated for six principal pollutants classified by epa as "criteria pollutants": sulfur oxides measured in terms of sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) , nitrogen dioxide ( no 2 ) , carbon monoxide ( co ) , ozone , lead , and particulate matter .

this report provides an overview of the naaqs implementation process in the context of the 1997 standards for fine particulate matter ( pm 2.5 ) , which consists of particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter .

the epa and states are in the process of finalizing the implementation of the naaqs for particulates promulgated in 1997 , delayed because of court challenges and other factors .

the epa's 1997 revisions to the particulate matter standards ( also referred to as the particulates naaqs ) included separate requirements for pm 2.5 for the first time .

the pm 2.5 naaqs have been the source of significant concern and national debate .

congress has been particularly interested in epa's promulgation and implementation of the caa standards , and has held numerous hearings on particulate matter ( and ozone ) naaqs established in 1997 .

epa's and states' experiences following the promulgation of the pm 2.5 naaqs 13 years ago could provide relevant insights as epa and states encounter issues in the initial stages of implementing the pm 2.5 naaqs as revised in october 2006 and as the agency proceeds with its current review of the particulates naaqs .

as noted earlier in this report , several areas previously designated nonattainment for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs currently have air quality that attains the level set by the standards based on certified ambient air monitoring data for the period 2006-2008 .

epa identifies these areas through clean data / attainment determinations published in the federal register .

pursuant to 40 cfr 51.1004 , this action by epa suspends requirements for these areas to submit attainment demonstrations , associated reasonably available control measures , reasonable further progress plans , contingency measures , and other planning sips related to attainment of the1997 pm 2.5 naaqs as long as the areas continue to meet the standard .

epa has indicated that as of june 2010 , 19 of the 39 areas ( includes multiple states and counties ) originally designated nonattainment for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs were in attainment with the standard based on a preliminary assessment of air quality monitoring data for the three - year period 2006 to 2008 .

according to the february 2010 epa report entitled our nation's air: status and trends through 2008 , nationally , annual and 24-hour pm 2.5 concentrations were 17% and 19% percent lower , respectively , in 2008 compared to 2001 .

based on a comparison of results from pm 2.5 monitoring locations ( 565 sites ) for two three - year periods , 2001-2003 and 2006-2008 , epa reported that almost all measured sites showed a decline or little change in measured pm 2.5 concentrations .

of the 565 monitoring sites , epa reported that 16 sites in california , illinois , indiana , michigan , ohio , utah , and west virginia showed the greatest decreases in annual pm 2.5 concentrations , and five sites in california , montana , oregon , pennsylvania , and utah showed the greatest decrease in 24-hour pm 2.5 concentrations .

four monitoring sites located in montana , arizona , and wisconsin showed annual pm 2.5 concentrations at levels greater than 1 µg / m 3 in , but none were above the annual pm 2.5 naaqs standard for the most recent three - year period ( 2006-2008 ) .

nineteen sites located throughout all regions of the united states showed an increase in 24-hour pm 2.5 concentrations greater than 3 µg / m .

3 seven of these sites , located in or near metropolitan areas in arizona , california , georgia , montana , virginia , and washington , were above the 2006 24-hour pm 2.5 naaqs standard for the most recent three year period .

for both the 24-hour and annual pm 2.5 standards , most of the areas that showed the greatest improvement in concentration levels when comparing the two three - year periods were the ones that generally had the highest in earlier years .

despite the reported overall progress , in 2008 nearly 37 million people lived in counties with measured concentrations exceeding both the annual and the 24-hour ( based on epa's 2006 revised standards ) pm 2.5 national air quality standards , according to the february 2010 epa report .

a number of events , most notably the d.c .

circuit court's july 2008 decision that would have vacated the epa 2005 clean air interstate rule ( cair ) in its entirety , have directly affected the timely implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs .

although , on december 24 , 2008 , the d.c .

circuit subsequently modified its original decision by temporarily reinstating the rule until epa develops an alternative , the court's actions have raised a number a questions regarding implementation of the pm naaqs .

also impacting implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs are epa's final 2006 revisions of the pm naaqs and subsequent final designation of nonattainment areas in november 2009 , and actions regarding implementation of the agency's eight - hour ozone naaqs .

finally , epa has initiated the next round of periodic review of the pm naaqs and announced its intent to expedite that review , targeting february 2011 for proposing any changes to the standards .

all of these issues have garnered attention in congress .

concerns regarding the potential impacts of the ozone and particulate standards have led to several attempts by congress over the years to modify the implementation requirements .

attempts in recent years were generally attached to larger pieces of legislation , such as the energy and transportation bills , as well as proposed multi - pollutant bills to reduce emissions from coal - fired power plants .

although pm 2.5 has not been one of the primary pollutants specified in the multi - pollutant legislation previously considered , certain provisions of some of the bills could have potentially contributed to reducing pm 2.5 concentrations .

the d.c .

circuit's july 2008 decision to vacate cair put into play again the issue of a multi - pollutant strategy with respect to the electric utility industry — a framework based on a consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emission trading .

such an approach would not resolve all the issues surrounding cair , and would raise issues of its own: should multi - pollutant legislation supplement or be a substitute for the current regulatory regime ? .

how stringent should the emission caps be ? .

what is an appropriate schedule for their introduction ? .

how should they relate to existing caa provisions ? .

should carbon dioxide be included with so 2 , nox , and mercury control programs ? .

should requirements be limited to the electric utility industry ? .

should epa be provided with the authority to implement cair or other cost - based , market - oriented approaches to address naaqs ? .

should there be comprehensive revision to the caa to address the full scope of ozone and pm 2.5 naaqs nonattainment and related issues , as well as other pollutant emissions from coal - fired power plants , and emerging environmental issues such as climate change ? .

these questions and related issues related to the cair were at the center of discussion during a july 29 , 2008 , hearing held by the senate committee on environment and public works subcommittee on clean air and nuclear safety , and on july 22 , 2010 , the committee held a hearing on epa's proposed alternative transport rule .

congress could consider a more surgical legislative vehicle aimed specifically at providing epa with the authority to implement some form of cair or other cost - based , market - oriented approaches to address naaqs .

the court's december 23 , 2008 , ruling and epa's subsequent august 2010 proposed alternative transport rule seem to have lessened interest in such an approach .

at the other extreme , congress might consider a more comprehensive revision to the caa to address not only ozone and pm 2.5 naaqs nonattainment , but also other pollutant emissions and emerging environmental issues such as climate change .

implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs impacts a number of counties throughout the united states .

epa's final nonattainment designations included 39 areas , comprising 205 counties within 20 states ( and the district of columbia ) nationwide , with a combined population of almost 90 million .

a number of concerns have been raised regarding the potential impacts , and numerous questions have been triggered regarding the specifics of the implementation process for the 1997 standards .

similar concerns are likely to stimulate debate as epa and states encounter issues in the initial stages of implementing the pm 2.5 naaqs as revised in october 2006 and as the agency proceeds with its current review of the particulates naaqs .

already delayed considerably , implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs faced further uncertainty as a result of the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c .

circuit's july 11 , 2008 , decision ( north carolina v. epa ) that would have vacated the clean air interstate rule ( cair ) .

epa projected that cair , in conjunction with other federal measures such as recent auto and truck emission standards , would be sufficient to demonstrate attainment in a large portion of monitored nonattainment counties by 2015 , prior to the development and implementation of local measures .

however , the court's subsequent december 23 , 2008 , ruling temporarily reinstating cair until epa promulgates a replacement rule , allowed implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs to continue in the interim .

epa anticipates finalizing the proposed alternative to cair published on august 2 , 2010 , in spring of 2011 , eliciting additional concerns with respect to the ongoing implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs in the interim .

epa promulgated revisions to the naaqs for particulate matter on october 17 , 2006 , primarily a tightening of the 1997 standard for pm 2.5 .

the tightening of the pm 2.5 standards increased the number of areas in nonattainment , and areas already designated nonattainment under the 1997 standard may need to adopt more stringent control measures to reach attainment .

sips for the new 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs will not be due until december 2012 , and attainment will not be required before december 2014 .

under the caa , states are required to meet the new standard "as expeditiously as practicable," but no later than five years from the effective date of final nonattainment designations , unless granted an extension .

citing the historical delays associated with implementing the 1997 standards , some stakeholders have advocated leapfrogging to implementation of the 2006 standards instead .

however , opponents contend that an approach relying on the schedule for the 2006 revised particulates naaqs would further delay the projected benefits of reducing exposures to pm 2.5 .

delays in finalizing the nonattainment designations for the 2006 pm 2.5 naaqs delayed the effective date of these designations , and subsequently implementation .

in addition , the 2006 revised particulates naaqs have sparked their own controversies , and judicial challenges have been upheld in part ( other challenges were denied ) by the court and remanded to the epa for reconsideration .

while the court did not specifically vacate the 2006 pm standards and their implementation will proceed , epa's actions in response to the decision could have implications in the future .

in part , in response to the court's decision , epa initiated the next round of review of the pm naaqs , and has announced its intent to expedite that review .

although 2006-2008 air quality data indicate that 19 of the 39 nonattainment areas for 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs have come into attainment , there are a number of states and cities that remain in nonattainment .

deadlines for states to submit their sips for the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs have elapsed , as has the april 5 , 2010 , deadline for reaching attainment ( unless granted an extension ) .

in light of these expired deadlines and given the many issues surrounding the particulates naaqs in general , the final phase of implementing the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs will likely remain an issue of considerable debate for many stakeholders and interest groups , as well as congress .

because of legal challenges , the lack of a national monitoring network , and other factors , implementation of the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs has been delayed repeatedly since it was promulgated .

the timeline presented in table a - 1 below reflects the most recent key milestone dates for implementing the 1997 pm 2.5 naaqs , including actual completions .

these milestones are driven primarily by statutory requirements .

it follows an epa milestone schedule outlined in an april 21 , 2003 , memorandum to epa regional administrators that also provided the nonbinding guidance for implementation of the pm 2.5 area designations .

recognizing potential efficiencies associated with states and tribes being able to harmonize control strategies , the initial pm 2.5 schedule was intended to be similar to that for the eight - hour ozone program .

the pm 2.5 naaqs requirement for three years of monitoring data to determine whether areas were meeting the established limits was one factor responsible for delaying implementation .

comprehensive monitoring data sufficient to make this determination and the attainment designations were not available in 1997 .

recognizing this dilemma , in the 1998 transportation equity act for the 21 st century ( tea - 21 ; p.l .

105-178 , title vi ) , congress revised the statutory deadline requirements for the new naaqs , predicated on a previously released epa interim implementation policy .

tea - 21 required states to submit designation recommendations within one year after receipt of three years of data meeting defined federal protocols , and required epa to promulgate designations within one year after state recommendations were due , but not later than december 31 , 2005 .

as discussed earlier in this report , operation of the network of monitors was phased in from 1999 through 2000 , making three - year monitoring data available at different points , depending on area location .

rather than a staggered designation schedule , which would likely have hampered cross - coordination of implementation plans , epa proposed a single date for state and tribal recommendations and final epa designations .

the deadlines of february 15 , 2004 , for governors to submit their pm 2.5 designation recommendations and december 31 , 2004 , for epa to promulgate designations for each state , were the result of congress amending the caa in the fy2004 omnibus appropriations ( p.l .

108-199 ) .

in addition to the delay in establishing a monitoring network , the 1997 naaqs standards were challenged in district court by the american trucking associations , the u.s. chamber of commerce , and several other state and business groups .

an initial may 1999 opinion by the district court partially in favor of the plaintiffs was reversed by the supreme court in february 2001 .
