the federal employees health benefits ( fehb ) program provides private health insurance to federal employees , retirees , and their dependents .

it provides more than $40 billion in health care benefits annually .

in a typical year , fehb provides health insurance coverage to about 8.2 million federal employees , retirees , and their dependents .

participation in fehb is voluntary .

about 85% of federal employees participate , and about 90% of retirees participate .

coverage options available to eligible individuals include individual or family coverage in an approved health benefits plan .

beginning in calendar year 2016 , individuals will have a third coverage option: self plus one coverage for themselves and one eligible family member .

generally , available health benefits plans fall into two broad categories: fee - for - service ( ffs ) or health maintenance organizations ( hmos ) .

ffs plans tend to be available nationwide , and hmos tend to be available locally .

premiums are shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree .

benefits and cost sharing vary among fehb plans , but all plans must cover basic services such as hospital and physician care and may require cost sharing in the form of deductibles , co - payments , or coinsurance .

prior to the creation of fehb in 1959 , federal employees were not able to obtain health insurance through the federal government ; instead , federal employees who wanted health insurance could purchase coverage voluntarily on their own or through the few union and employee association plans that offered plans to federal employees .

by 1950 , it was common for employers in the private sector to offer health insurance and pay at least a portion of their employees' health insurance premiums .

as early as 1951 , president truman's commission on the health needs of the nation recommended that the federal government offer health insurance coverage for its employees .

after debate on whether and how the government should pursue this option , congress passed the federal employees health benefits act of 1959 ( fehba ; p.l .

86-382 ) .

fehba generally established parameters for eligibility ; election of coverage ; the types of health plans and benefits that may be offered ; and the level of the government's share of premiums .

it also established an employees health benefits fund to pay for program expenses and put forth provisions for studies , reports , and audits .

in addition , fehba outlined the role of the office of personnel management ( opm ) .

by law , opm has the authority to contract with insurers and to prescribe regulations to manage fehb , among other duties .

fehba has been amended many times since its passage .

the general model of fehb , consisting of enrollees choosing between multiple types of coverage offered by competing private insurers , has not changed .

employees and retirees have always shared the cost of premiums with the federal government , and , in general , they have always had access to the same plans at the same cost .

however , many other aspects of fehb have been modified .

for example , the formula for determining the government's share of premiums has changed several times , and the government's share of premiums generally has increased .

in addition , eligibility , services , and benefits generally have been expanded in a number of ways .

congress , in its legislative authority , often has some part in modifying fehb , either in proposing changes to the program or reacting to proposed changes .

congress can place conditions on the use of federal funds , and it has done so to make changes to fehb .

for example , in 1983 congress passed a law that prohibited using appropriated federal funds to cover abortions , except when the life of the woman was in danger .

this provision was renewed with few changes every year except 1994 and 1995 , when the 103 rd congress excluded the provision .

the reinstated provision prohibited the use of funds except when the life of the woman was in danger or in cases of rape or incest ; this provision has been included in subsequent appropriations bills each year ( as of the date of this report ) .

table 1 summarizes laws that have enacted policy changes to fehb by placing conditions on the use of federal funds .

over the years , the government's share of premiums has increased overall .

in the legislation that created fehb , the government's share was set at 50% of the premium and had to fall within a specified dollar range .

that provision changed very little until 1971 , when the "big six" formula was created .

the formula was equal to the simple average of the premiums of six health plans offered in fehb that met the criteria specified in statute .

the government's share originally was set at 40% of the simple average of the big six premiums , and it increased to 50% in 1974 .

the big six formula was in place with few changes until 1997 .

passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 ( p.l .

105-33 ) introduced the formula for setting the government's share of premiums that is in effect today .

the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans , not to exceed 75% of the premium for any one plan ( calculated separately for individual and family coverage ) .

fehb - eligible participants specified in the enacting legislation included current federal employees and retirees who retired after july 1 , 1960 .

family members of employees and retirees also were eligible .

 ( see the text box , "eligibility under the federal employees health benefits act ( p.l .

86-382 ) ," for a complete list of eligibility under the enacting legislation. ) .

since fehba's enactment , eligibility to enroll in fehb generally has been extended to more categories of federal employees , retirees , and their current and former family members .

in 1978 , fehb was extended to part - time employees , and in 1988 it was extended to certain temporary workers .

in 1988 , congress also authorized temporary continuation of coverage ( tcc ) , whereby employees separated from service for reasons other than gross misconduct can continue coverage in fehb .

tcc enrollees must pay the entire fehb premium , both the government's and the employees' shares , as well as a 2% administrative fee .

in general , tcc is available to separating employees and their dependents for up to 18 months after the date of separation .

however , there are exceptions , such as the availability of 36 months of coverage for children aging out of their parents' plans .

fehb was established five years prior to medicare , and in the early years there was little interaction between the programs largely because , in general , federal employees and retirees were not eligible for medicare based on their federal employment .

this situation changed in 1982 when congress passed the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act ( p.l .

97-248 ) , which applied medicare's hospital insurance tax to federal employment , thereby enabling federal workers to be eligible for medicare based on their federal employment .

the following are detailed summaries of selected laws or provisions of laws that established , amended , or changed the federal employees health benefits ( fehb ) program .

federal employees health benefits act of 1959 ( p.l .

86-382 ) , september 28 , 1959 effective july 1 , 1960 , p.l .

86-382 established the fehb program for the federal workforce .

the act established the general parameters for the program , including eligibility and enrollment procedures ; the types of benefits that may be provided ; the level of the government's share of premiums ; and the role of the office of personnel management ( opm ) .

eligible participants specified in the enacting legislation included current federal employees and retirees who retired after july 1 , 1960 , either on an immediate annuity with at least 12 years of service or for a disability .

retirees also were required either to be enrolled in an fehb plan for at least five years immediately prior to retirement or to have enrolled at the earliest opportunity to do so .

family members of employees and retirees also were eligible .

opm was allowed to contract or approve the following types of health benefit plans to participate in fehb: service benefit plan — one government - wide plan ( offering two levels of benefits ) under which payment is made by an insurer under contracts with providers for the benefits described indemnity benefit plan — one government - wide plan ( offering two levels of benefits ) under which an insurer agrees to pay certain sums of money for the benefits described employee organization plans — plans providing health benefits to members of the organization as of july 1 , 1959 , that are sponsored or underwritten and administered , in whole or in part , by employee organizations ; employee organization plans are available only to employees and retirees ( and members of their families ) who at the time of enrollment are members of the organization comprehensive medical plans — either group - practice prepayment plans , which offer benefits on a prepaid basis provided by physicians practicing as a group in a common center or centers , or individual - practice prepayment plans , which offer health services on a prepaid basis provided by individual physicians who agree to accept the payments provided by the plans as full payment for covered services rendered by them under p.l .

86-382 , the government's share of premiums in fehb plans was dependent on the type of plan and the type of enrollee .

for the service benefit plan and the indemnity plan , the government's share was 50% of the lowest rate charged by a carrier , and for an employee or retiree with individual coverage , the biweekly government share could be not less than $1.25 and not more than $1.75 ; for an employee or retiree with family coverage , the biweekly government share could be not less than $3.00 and not more than $4.25 ; for a female employee or retiree ( whose husband is not a dependent ) with family coverage , the biweekly government share could be not less than $1.75 and not more than $2.50 .

for employees and retirees enrolled in either employee organization plans or comprehensive medical plans , the government's share was 50% of the biweekly premium as long as the biweekly premium was less than $2.50 for individual coverage and less than $6.00 for family coverage ; for a female employee or retiree ( whose husband is not a dependent ) with family coverage , the government's share was 30% of the premium ( as long as the biweekly premium was less than $6.00 ) .

patient protection and affordable care act ( p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) , march 23 , 2010 p.l .

111-148 , as amended — also known as the aca — contains many provisions that apply to health insurance coverage generally ; fehb plans must comply with a number of these provisions .

some of the provisions have no meaningful effect on fehb because fehb plans already meet the requirements of these provisions , whereas others confer new requirements on the plans .

opm has provided fehb plans with guidance on how to implement provisions in the aca ; in some cases , opm has expanded the scope of provisions in the act .

for example , opm requires fehb plans to implement some provisions prior to the effective dates specified in the aca .

the act stipulated that adult children up to the age of 26 can remain on or enroll in their parent's health insurance plan .

this provision became effective for fehb plans beginning january 2011 .

as a result of extending dependent coverage to the age of 26 , tcc is available for three years when the child ages out of fehb at the age of 26 .

similarly , the opportunity for certain disabled children to remain on their parent's plan is tied to the age of 26 ; if a disability affected a child prior to the age of 26 , the child may remain a dependent on his or her parent's plan indefinitely .

the aca required new plans to offer certain types of preventive care and screening with no out - of - pocket costs .

fehb plans historically have covered many of the preventive care services specified in the act , and since 2011 they have had to waive cost sharing for these services .

for all preventive care as required by the aca , plans may choose to waive cost sharing only when beneficiaries use in - network providers , so that if beneficiaries use out - of - network providers they still may be responsible for cost sharing under the terms and conditions of the plan .

the act required plans and / or plan sponsors ( eg , employers ) to provide applicants and enrollees with a summary of benefits and coverage ( sbc ) and a uniform glossary of terms .

the sbc is supposed to provide consumers with simple and straightforward information about a plan's benefits and coverage , and the uniform glossary of terms is intended as a resource to help consumers understand common health insurance terms .

opm required all fehb plans to provide an sbc and a uniform glossary of terms for plan year 2013 .

the aca prohibited plans from establishing lifetime limits on the dollar value of certain health benefits for any participant or beneficiary .

additionally , the act required plans to establish restricted annual limits on the dollar value of benefits prior to january 1 , 2014 , when annual limits were prohibited similar to lifetime limits .

historically , most fehb plans have not imposed lifetime limits , but some fehb plans have imposed limits on certain benefits .

beginning in plan year 2013 , opm expected all fehb plans to eliminate those limits on specified benefits .

the act included requirements related to plans allowing individuals to participate in approved clinical trials .

fehb plans were expected to comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials beginning in plan year 2013 .

the act prohibited plans from having preexisting condition exclusions .

this provision was effective for all individuals in 2014 .

fehb plans have always been prohibited from having preexisting condition exclusions , so the provision does not have a meaningful effect on fehb plans .

another requirement in the aca that is applicable to fehb plans involves the reporting of a medical loss ratio , which is the ratio of plan - incurred claims , including any expenditures that improve the quality of health care , to a plan's total premium revenue .

beginning in 2011 , the act required large group plans , including fehb plans , to provide an annual rebate to each enrollee on a pro rata basis if the ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended on clinical claims and health quality costs ( after any applicable adjustments for taxes and regulatory fees ) is less than 85% .

carriers who owe rebates are required to issue rebates directly to opm .

the rebate is deposited into the contingency reserve of the health plan and can be used to reduce the cost of the following year's health insurance premiums for the plan .

starting in 2011 , the act modified the definition of qualified medical expenses , which affects flexible spending accounts ( fsas ) , health savings accounts ( hsas ) , and health reimbursement arrangements ( hras ) .

the act does not allow over - the - counter ( otc ) medicines to be covered by these tax - advantaged accounts unless the medications are prescribed by a physician .

the only exception is insulin .

other eligible otc items that are not medicines or drugs , such as bandages , do not require a prescription .

in addition , the aca raised the penalty from 10% to 20% for those under the age of 65 who make a nonqualified withdrawal from an hsa .

beginning in 2013 , the act lowered maximum allowed annual contributions to a health care flexible spending account ( hcfsa ) under fehb from $5,000 to $2,500 .

the threshold is indexed to inflation for subsequent years .

since may 1 , 2012 , eligible indian tribes , tribal organizations , and urban indian organizations have been allowed to purchase fehb for their tribal employees .

the aca required that the tribe or tribal organization pay the government's share of the premium , at a minimum , with the enrollee paying the remaining share .

the act only allowed tribes and tribal organizations to purchase this coverage for employees ; coverage is not available to retirees .

the act imposed some administrative requirements on employers that affect federal agencies .

for taxable years beginning after december 31 , 2010 , it required employers to provide the aggregate cost of applicable employer - sponsored coverage on an employee's w - 2 .

the requirement became mandatory in 2012 .

beginning in 2014 , the act required insurers , self - insuring employers , government agencies , and employers , to file a return including the name of each individual for whom they provide minimum essential coverage , the number of months of coverage , and any other information required by the secretary of hhs .

the effective date of this requirement was delayed until 2015 .

the act generally specifies that the only health plans the federal government may make available to members of congress and certain congressional staff ( with respect to their service as members or staff ) are either created under the aca or offered through an exchange .

beginning january 1 , 2014 , members and designated congressional staff were no longer able to purchase fehb plans as active employees ; however , if they enroll in a health plan offered through a small business health options program ( shop ) exchange , they remain eligible for an employer contribution toward coverage .

members and designated congressional staff who are eligible for retirement are allowed to enroll in an fehb plan upon retirement .

for more details on the implementation of this provision , see crs report r43194 , health benefits for members of congress and designated congressional staff .

the act includes a number of provisions to raise revenues , which may have an impact on fehb plans .

beginning in 2014 , the aca imposed an annual fee on health insurance plans based on their market share , which could affect most fehb carriers .

additionally , the act imposed a new patient - centered outcomes research institute ( pcori ) fee on insurers , which was imposed on fehb plans for the first time in 2012 ( and will end in 2019 ) .

starting in 2018 , the act will impose a 40% excise tax on health insurers and health plan administrators for coverage that exceeds certain thresholds .

the health insurance coverage subject to the excise tax includes the employer and employee premium payments for health insurance coverage ( including self - insured plans ) , the premiums paid by the employee and the employer for dental and vision coverage ( if this supplemental coverage is not part of a stand - alone package ) , and payments toward tax - advantaged health - related accounts such as fsas , hsas , hras , and msas .

the thresholds are $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage , and they will be indexed to inflation in subsequent years .

the amount by which an individual's total health insurance coverage exceeds $10,200 in 2018 ( or $27,500 for a family ) will be subject to the 40% excise tax .

the aca required the director of opm to enter into contracts with health insurance issuers to eventually offer at least two multistate plans ( msps ) through each exchange in each state ( without regard to statutes requiring competitive bidding ) .

such plans will provide individual or group coverage , in the case of small employers .

while administering msps , the director of opm cannot reduce financial or personnel resources related to the administration of fehb .

enrollees in an msp will be treated as a separate risk pool from fehb .

the director can establish separate units or offices within opm to ensure that the administration of msps does not interfere with the administration of fehb .

the director can appoint additional personnel to carry out activities under this section but must ensure the msp program is separate from fehb .

finally , fehb plans are not required to offer an msp .

bipartisan budget act of 2013 ( p.l .

113-67 ) , december 26 , 2013 p.l .

113-67 provided that fehb enrollees may select "self plus one" coverage in addition to individual and family coverage .

the government's share of premiums for self plus one coverage will be determined in the same way premiums for individual and family coverage are determined: opm will find the weighted average premium of all plans in fehb each year and pay either 72% of this average or 75% of any given plan's premium , whichever is smaller .

for the first contract year in which the self plus one option is offered , opm will determine the weighted average premium for self plus one coverage based on an actuarial analysis .
