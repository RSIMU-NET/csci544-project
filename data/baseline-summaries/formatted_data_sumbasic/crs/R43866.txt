the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) is an agency of the u.s. department of commerce ( doc ) with a statutory mission to facilitate domestic and international telecommunications and information policy activities .

the ntia works with other executive branch agencies to develop the administration's position on key policy matters .

ntia further acts as a representative of the administration in policy areas that include international negotiations regarding global agreements on the internet and spectrum management , and domestic use of spectrum resources by federal agencies .

ntia is headed by the assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information , who is appointed by the president and acts as a principal advisor to the president on telecommunications and information policy matters ; is the principal executive branch spokesman to congress , the industry , state and local governments , and the public on such matters ; is the key coordinator of the federal government's own communication systems ; and is responsible for assisting in the formulation of the nation's overall telecommunications and information policy .

the ntia receives funding from both appropriations and reimbursable obligations , including sources such as fees charged to federal agencies for spectrum management services and reimbursable projects in telecommunications technology research .

for budget appropriations purposes , the ntia organizes its programs into four major program categories for salaries and expenses: domestic and international policies , spectrum management , advanced communications research , and broadband programs .

its budget report to congress also includes information about ntia obligations to support public safety , notably for the administration of the first responder network authority ( firstnet ) , an entity established by congress in 2012 as an independent agency within the ntia .

the ntia fulfills many roles .

as the agency responsible for managing spectrum used by federal agencies , the ntia often works in consultation with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) on matters concerning spectrum access , technology , and policy .

the fcc regulates private sector , state , local , and tribal spectrum use .

because many spectrum issues are international in scope and negotiated through treaty - making , the ntia and the fcc collaborate with the department of state in representing american interests .

the ntia also participates in interagency efforts to develop internet policy and coordinate internet - focused initiatives across the federal government .

the ntia and the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) have adjoining facilities on the doc campus in boulder , co , where they collaborate on research projects with each other and with other federal agencies , such as the fcc .

beginning in 2009 , the ntia administered $4.7 billion in broadband grants funding provided by the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) through its broadband technology opportunities program ( btop ) .

the ntia collaborated with nist , the fcc , and the department of homeland security in providing expertise and guidance to grant recipients using btop funds to build new networks for broadband communications .

ntia is scaling down administration of its btop grants through 2020 and ramping up its broadbandusa program , through which ntia advises and assists communities with broadband deployment .

in performing its various roles , the ntia administers policies and programs through six main offices .

the office of spectrum management ( osm ) .

osm formulates and establishes plans and policies focused on the effective , efficient , and equitable use of spectrum both nationally and internationally .

through the development of long - range spectrum plans , osm works to address future federal government spectrum requirements , including public safety operations .

the osm also handles the assignment of spectrum to meet the needs of federal agencies , provides spectrum certification for new federal agency telecommunication systems , and supports efforts to repurpose federal spectrum for nonfederal use .

the office of policy analysis and development ( opad ) .

opad is the domestic policy division of the ntia .

opad supports ntia's role as principal adviser to the executive branch and the secretary of commerce on telecommunications and information policies by conducting research and analysis and preparing policy recommendations .

the office of international affairs ( oia ) .

oia develops and implements policies to enhance u.s. companies' ability to compete globally in the information and communications technology ( ict ) sectors .

in consultation with other u.s. agencies and the u.s. private sector , oia participates in international and regional fora to promote policies that open ict markets and encourage competition .

oia supports the doc's internet policy task force and ntia's work with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers ( icann ) and internet policies with international scope .

the institute for telecommunication sciences ( its ) .

its is the research and engineering laboratory of the ntia .

its provides technical support to ntia in advancing telecommunications and information infrastructure development , enhancing domestic competition , and promoting more efficient and effective use of the radio spectrum .

current areas of focus include research , development , and testing of technologies to support first - responder communications ; test and demonstration networks for emerging communications devices ; and resolution of interference issues .

the office of telecommunications and in formation applications ( otia ) .

otia administers grant programs that further the deployment and use of technology in america , and the advancement of other national priorities .

in the past , otia awarded grants from the public telecommunications facilities program , which was terminated by congress in fy2011 .

the otia was also responsible for administering btop grants .

the office of public safety communications ( opsc ) .

opsc was created by the ntia at the end of 2012 to administer some provisions of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-96 ) , title vi , also known as the spectrum act .

the office also provides administrative and other support functions for firstnet .

the obama administration's fy2017 budget request for the ntia was $50.8 million for salaries and expenses across the four major program categories: domestic and international policies , spectrum management , advanced communications research , and broadband programs ( see table 1 at the end of this section ) .

this request was $1.6 million more than the fy2016 request of $49.2 million , and $11.3 million more than the fy2016 enacted amount of $39.5 million .

for fy2017 , as reported by the senate committee on appropriations , s. 2837 , the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , would have provided $39.5 million for salaries and expenses , equal to the fy2016 funding level .

as reported by the house committee on appropriations , h.r .

5393 , the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , would have provided $36.3 million .

the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-223 ) , provided funding for the ntia from october 1 , 2016 through december 9 , 2016 , at the fy2016 funding rate subject to a 0.496% across - the - board decrease .

the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-254 ) provided funding at about 99.8% of the fy2016 funding level for the ntia through april 28 , 2017 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , signed by the president on may 5 , 2017 , provides $32.0 million to the ntia for salaries and expenses , which is $7.5 million ( 19% ) less than the fy2016 enacted amount .

for fy2018 , the white house's march 2017 budget blueprint signaled support for ntia's role in multi - stakeholder forums on internet governance and digital commerce , and agency efforts on efficient use of federal spectrum .

the blueprint does not specify any proposed funding cuts for ntia , though an overall decrease of $1.5 billion from the fy2017 level authorized by p.l .

114-254 is proposed for the department of commerce .

proceeds from auctions of spectrum licenses as specified in the spectrum act are directed first into the public safety trust fund ( the fund ) , created by the act .

some revenue in the public safety trust fund is designated for specific purposes , primarily public safety .

the spectrum act gives the ntia responsibilities to support firstnet in planning , building , and managing a new , nationwide broadband network for public safety communications .

the law provides for specific transfers from the fund for various uses , including up to $2 billion for establishing firstnet .

the law also provides $115 million from the fund for ntia and the national highway traffic safety administration to carry out the next generation 9-1-1 implementation grants program .

all of the funding obligations of the spectrum act have been met with proceeds from auctions held in 2014-2015 .

balances remaining in any fund created by the act are to revert to the treasury in 2022 to be used "for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. .

enacted budget amounts for fy2010-fy2017 are listed in table 2 .

in fy2010 , the public telecommunications facilities program ( ptfp ) represented half of the ntia's budget appropriations , receiving $20.0 million in funding to support broadcast and non - broadcast projects .

congress terminated grant funding for the ptfp in fy2011 .

the ntia fy2011 budget request to congress proposed supporting public broadcasters through the corporation for public broadcasting in lieu of continuing the ptfp .

though funding for the ptfp was eliminated , the total enacted budget appropriations amount for the ntia in fy2011 increased by 4% to $41.6 million ; the total amount supported administrative expenses and salaries .

according to the ntia , the increase of $21.6 million from fy2010 to fy2011 in funding for salaries and expenses was largely attributable to the costs of administration of the $4.7 billion program for broadband deployment , as required by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) .

between fy2012 and fy2015 , ntia's funding requests related to broadband grant programs administration declined by over half .

in fy2012 , requests for funding to administer grant programs totaled $32.3 million , 70% of the budget request .

for fy2013 , $25.8 million in funding was requested to administer btop .

the fy2014 request for broadband grant program oversight declined slightly to $24.7 million , roughly 40% of the total budget request .

and in fy2015 , the requested appropriation for broadband programs was halved from the fy2014 requested amount to $12.2 million .

the fy2015 request of $51.0 million for ntia would have been an increase of $5 million over the enacted fy2014 budget amount of $46.0 million .

the requested increase was attributed by the ntia to an increased focus on policy oversight in two key areas: formulating domestic and international policies and expanding the availability of broadband communications .

new programs identified in the fy2015 budget request included the center for advanced communications , a cooperative effort with nist to advance spectrum sharing and innovation .

further , the ntia proposed $7.5 million to fund an internet policy center to provide analysis and recommendations related to all aspects of the internet .

for fy2015 , congress appropriated $38.2 million for ntia salaries and expenses ; however , that amount was supplemented by $4.7 million in unobligated balances carried forward from the previous year , allowing for a fy2015 budget of nearly $42.9 million .

significant increases were also proposed for advanced communications research and for domestic and international policies in the fy2016 budget request , though enacted funding amounts did not reach requested levels .

for advanced communications research , the fy2016 budget request of $12.6 million would have increased funding by $4.8 million ( 61.5% ) over the fy2015 enacted budget and included eight new ftes in the center for advanced communications .

fy2016 enacted funding was $10.1 million , a 30% increase over the fy2015 enacted budget .

the request for domestic and international policies in fy2016 was $15.2 million , double the fy2015 enacted amount of $7.6 million .

the enacted amount for fy2016 was $9.1 million , a 35.8% increase over the fy2015 enacted level .

reimbursable funding .

in addition to appropriations listed in the tables , the ntia receives funding from reimbursable obligations , including sources such as fees charged to federal agencies for spectrum management services and reimbursable projects in telecommunications technology research .

reimbursable funding for fy2015 was reported as $36.1 million ( 139 ftes ) , with $29.3 million for spectrum management fees .

fy2016 estimates for reimbursable funding totaled $57.7 million ( 160 ftes ) , with almost $47.0 million from spectrum management fees .

according to ntia's fy2017 budget request , reimbursable funding for fy2017 is projected to be $44.1 million ( 170 ftes ) , with $35.6 million from spectrum management fees .

the senate committee report ( s. 239 ) on appropriations for fy2017 would have required the ntia to submit a report to the committee "detailing the collection of reimbursements from other agencies. .

personnel .

for fy2017 , projected employment for all programs — using both appropriated funds and reimbursable obligations — would have been 347 ftes if fully funded .

this would have been an increase over the total number of 320 total ftes for all ntia programs in fy2016 , and 260 total ftes in fy2015 .

for programs positions funded through appropriations , the fy2017 budget request included 177 ftes , compared to 160 ftes in fy2016 and 121 ftes in fy2015 .
