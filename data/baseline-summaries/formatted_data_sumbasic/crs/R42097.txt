t he standing qualifications to be president of the united states are set out in the constitution , at article ii , section 1 , clause 5 , and state three specific requirements: one must be at leas t 35 years old , a resident "within the united states" for 14 years , and a "natural born citizen. .

the constitutional provision states as follows: no person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the united states , at the time of the adoption of this constitution , shall be eligible to the office of president ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen years a resident within the united states .

questions from time - to - time have arisen concerning whether one who is a u.s. citizen "at birth" because of the operation of federal law , is also a "natural born" citizen for purposes of the presidential eligibility clause .

such questions often concern persons born abroad to parents who are u.s. citizens , or persons born abroad when only one parent is a u.s. citizen who had resided in the united states .

although such individuals born abroad may clearly be u.s. citizens "at birth" by statute , would such persons also be "natural born citizens," or is eligibility to the presidency limited only to "native born" citizens ? .

additionally , questions have been recently raised by some as to whether one born "in" the united states of one or more alien parents — and who is thus clearly a u.s. citizen "at birth" by the fourteenth amendment , as well as by federal law and common law — was intended to be considered a "natural born" citizen for purposes of the presidential eligibility clause .

the constitution does not define the term "natural born citizen," nor are the notes from the debates at the constitutional convention of 1787 instructive as to any specific collective intent of the framers concerning the meaning of the term .

furthermore , the supreme court has never needed to address this particular issue within the specific context of a challenge to the eligibility of a candidate under article ii , section 1 , clause 5 , the only place in the entire constitution that the phrase appears , although federal courts have discussed the concept extensively with respect to other issues of citizenship .

consequently , although there are numerous supreme court cases , as well as other federal and state case law , discussing the phrase and its meaning from which conclusions may be drawn , there has still been certain speculation on the scope of the language .

according to the supreme court , words and phrases used , but not defined , within the constitution , should generally "be read in light of british common law," since the u.s. constitution is "framed in the language of the english common law. .

although the english common law is not "binding" on federal courts in interpreting the meaning of words or phrases within the constitution , nor is it necessarily to be considered the "law" of the united states ( as it is for the individual states specifically incorporating it ) , it can be employed to shed light on the concepts and precepts within the document that are not defined there , but which are reflected in the corpus of british law and jurisprudence of the time .

as noted by chief justice ( and former president ) taft , writing for a unanimous supreme court , the framers of the u.s. constitution "were born and brought up in" the english common law , they "thought and spoke in its vocabulary," and that english common law was thus what the "statesmen and lawyers of the convention" employed for the meaning of the terms in the constitution "confident that they could be shortly and easily understood. .

the term "natural born" in the context of citizenship appears to derive from the british concept that those born with a "natural liege" ( allegiance , tie , or connection ) to the nation or to the sovereign , were ( under english terminology ) "natural born" subjects under the law in england and in the american colonies at the time of independence .

there appears to be little scholarly debate that the english common law at the time of independence included at least all persons born on the soil of england ( jus soli , that is , "law of the soil" ) , even to alien parents , as "natural born" subjects ( unless the alien parents were diplomatic personnel of a foreign nation , or foreign troops in hostile occupation ) .

as noted by the supreme court of the united states , this "same rule" was applicable in the colonies and "in the united states afterwards , and continued to prevail under the constitution" with respect to "natural born" u.s. citizenship .

although the british common law at the time of independence with regard to jus soli was apparently clear , there were varying opinions as whether those born abroad of english subjects were "natural born" subjects under the common law , or were considered "natural born" subjects merely by long - standing statutory law .

some commentators have claimed that the statutory provisions of english law , first appearing during the reign of edward iii in 1350 , were "incorporated" into , or in the alternative , "reflected" the already established english common law .

regardless of the technical state of the common law in england with respect to children born abroad , however , there appear to be significant arguments that the corpus of english law applicable within the american colonies , known to the framers and adopted in the states , was broader than merely the "law of the soil. .

legal commentators have contended that the body of english law carried forward in the united states relating to citizenship included both the strict common law notion of jus soli , as well as that part of the law of descent ( jus sanguin i s ) included in long - standing british law ( including as "natural born" subjects those born abroad of an english father ) , and that this was part of the "common understanding" of the term "natural born" to the framers at the time of the drafting of the constitution .

considering the history of the constitutional provision , the clause's apparent intent , the english common law expressly applicable in the american colonies and in all of the original states , the common use and meaning of the phrase "natural born" subject in england and the american colonies in the 1700s , and the subsequent action of the first congress in enacting the naturalization act of 1790 ( expressly defining the term "natural born citizen" to include those born abroad to u.s. citizens ) , it appears that the most logical inferences would indicate that the phrase "natural born citizen" would mean a person who is entitled to u.s. citizenship "by birth" or "at birth. .

such interpretation , as evidenced by over a century of american case law , would include as natural born citizens those born in the united states and subject to its jurisdiction regardless of the citizenship status of one's parents , and would also appear to include those born abroad of one or more parents who are u.s. citizens ( as recognized by statute ) , as opposed to a person who is not a citizen by birth and is thus an "alien" required to go through the legal process of naturalization to become a u.s. citizen .

the weight of scholarly legal and historical opinion , as well as the consistent case law in the united states , also supports the notion that "natural born citizen" means one who is a u.s. citizen "at birth" or "by birth. .

the constitution of the united states of america , analysis and interpretation , notes that "[w]hatever the term 'natural born' means , it no doubt does not include a person who is 'naturalized,'" and , after discussing historical and legal precedents and arguments , concludes that "[t]here is reason to believe ... that the phrase includes persons who become citizens at birth by statute because of their status in being born abroad of american citizens. .

in addition to examining the common law meaning of the term "natural born" as it related to citizenship , there are other interpretive analyses that might be employed in an attempt to understand the "meaning to the framers" of the term "natural born" citizen when the term was adopted in the constitution in 1787 .

if , as noted by the supreme court in an opinion authored by justice story , the "common law of england is not to be taken , in all respects , to be that of america," there may be accorded some significance to an analysis of what the term "natural born" citizen was commonly understood to mean in the american colonies at the time of the revolution and framing of the constitution .

it is , of course , always a somewhat speculative exercise to attempt to discern the "common understanding" of a group of individuals who may be geographically , professionally , and politically diverse , particularly during a period many years removed from the current time .

the fact that no discussion appears in the notes of the federal convention of 1787 on the presidential eligibility clause , and the fact that the actual debates and discussions in the convention were held in secret with no official journal of the debates being kept ( other than for recording votes ) highlight the problems in such speculation .

that being said , however , one might argue that there existed what might be called a "common" or "general understanding," or at least common "usage" of the term "natural born," as it related to those who were considered "natural born" subjects of england in the american colonies at the time of independence , and "natural born" citizens at the time of the adoption of the constitution .

the "state of the law" in colonial america concerning who was a "natural born" subject of england under english laws , both common law as well as statutory laws , was certainly known to the framers since , as noted by the supreme court , "these statutes applied to the colonies before the war of independence. .

from examination of historical documents , it appears that the term "natural born" as it related to citizenship under english law and jurisprudence was a term widely known and used in the american colonies in the 1700's , and was employed in the context and understanding of british common law as well as british statutory law .

for example , more than a decade before john jay had employed the term in his "hint" to general washington at the convention of 1787 , the first continental congress of the american colonies , meeting in philadelphia beginning in september of 1774 , adopted a resolution asserting that the common law of england was fully applicable to the colonies in america , as were such statutory laws of england as would be relevant to their circumstances , and expressly included in the resolution an assertion of the rights of their ancestors to be considered "natural - born subjects within the realms of england. .

as noted in elliot's compilation and analysis of documents related to independence , on the same day [14 th of october , 1774] , congress unanimously resolved , "that the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of england , and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the course of that law. .

they further resolved , "that they were entitled to the benefit of such of the english statutes as existed at the time of their colonization , and which they have , by experience , respectively found to be applicable to their several and local circumstances. .

they also resolved , that their ancestors , at the time of their immigration , were "entitled to all the rights , liberties , and immunities , of free and natural - born subjects within the realms of england. .

it is thus clear that the delegates to the first continental congress in 1774 , among whom were several framers of the constitution at the federal convention of 1787 , as well as other notable "founding fathers" ( including john jay ) , were already familiar with and employed the term "natural born" in the context of and within the understanding of british common law and statutory law concepts of the rights and privileges of citizenship .

of relevance to any meaning and "common understanding" of the term "natural born" within the american colonies and at the time of the drafting of the constitution is the legal treatise on the laws of england referred to as "blackstone," for its author william blackstone .

published in 1765 , this treatise was not only available , but was widely known to the framers at the time of the drafting of the constitution .

as noted by the supreme court of the united states , "blackstone's commentaries was widely circulated in the colonies ...," and that "undoubtedly the framers of the constitution were familiar with it. .

as discussed in the earlier section of this report on the common law , blackstone explained that "natural born" subjects in england and the american colonies included all those born "in" the lands under british sovereignty .

concerning specifically the issue of children born abroad of english subjects , blackstone explains clearly that such children are then ( in 1765 ) considered under the law of england as "natural born" subjects , and have been considered as such for most purposes since at least the time of edward iii ( 1350 ) , because of the development of statutory law in england to "encourage also foreign commerce. .

as stated by blackstone in his 1765 treatise , [a]ll children , born out of the king's ligeance , whose fathers were natural - born subjects , are now natural born subjects themselves , to all intents and purposes , without any exception ; unless their said fathers were attainted , or banished beyond sea , for high treason ; or were then in the service of a prince at enmity with great britain .

the "commonly understood" meaning of the term "natural born" in the united states at the time of the drafting of the constitution might thus be broader than the early , strict english "common law" meaning of that term .

as noted by charles gordon , former chief counsel of the immigration and naturalization service , whether the body of english law in the 1770s was from early common law , from statutory law , or from the common law modified over the years by statutory law , these provisions "were part of the corpus of the english law in existence at the time of the revolution , which was substantially recognized and adopted by our forefathers. .

this common usage and popular understanding to the framers of the term "natural born" subject ( as employed in england ) , and the term's apparent evolution and broadening of meaning through statutory law , has thus led several other legal commentators and historians to conclude: "the constitutional framers had a broad view of the term 'natural - born' and considered all foreign - born children of american citizen parents eligible for the office of the presidency" ; or , as stated by another: "[t]he delegates meant to apply the evolved , broader common law meaning of the term when they included it in the presidential qualifications clause. .

presidential historian michael nelson has also averred that the term appeared to have a common meaning at the time of the drafting of the constitution which involved within its concept both the common law definition and mode of acquisition of citizenship ( through jus soli ) , as well as the common understanding of the long - standing broadening of such term by the operation of english statutory law to include those subjects who may have traveled abroad for purposes of commerce , or otherwise .

as noted by nelson ( and pointed out by others ) , a more restrictive meaning to include only those born within the boundaries of the united states would mean that john jay , who may have recommended the precise term to the convention , would have intended to exclude from eligibility his own children who were born in spain and france while jay was representing the united states abroad: the provision for "natural born citizen" probably was aimed at immigrants , although the term is so unusual as to be vague.... [b]ut [it] had deep roots in british common law .

in medieval times it had embodied the doctrine of jus soli: a natural born citizen was one born within the realm ( on the soil , so to speak ) .

but with increased commerce and travel , parliament , starting in 1350 , seemed to expand the definition of natural born to incorporate the doctrine of jus sanguinis .

now babies born of british citizens abroad or at sea were included as well .

one can presume only that jay and the delegates meant to apply the evolved , broader common law meaning of the term when they included it in the presidential qualifications clause .

certainly jay did not mean to bar his own children born in spain and france while he was on diplomatic assignments , from legal eligibility to the presidency .

with respect to the common or general meaning of the term "natural born" to the framers of the constitution in the context of those born abroad to u.s. citizens , it may be significant to note that the first congress , under its express constitutional authority "to establish an uniform rule of naturalization," enacted the naturalization act of 1790 .

the first of several such acts , this 1790 statute stated that [t]he children of citizens of the united states , that may be born beyond the sea , or out of the limits of the united states , shall be considered as natural born citizens: provided , that the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the united states... .

this early congressional act provides some argument that the term "natural born" citizen was seen to include more than merely the "native born," that is , those born in the country ( in accordance with the common law principle of jus soli ) , but also to include the long - standing english statutory recognition of citizenship by descent through one's father when an individual is born abroad , that is , all of those who are citizens "at birth" or "by birth. .

the significance of such a statute passed by the first congress was , of course , the fact that many of the framers of the constitution were members of that first congress , as well as the fact that the first congress's understanding of the meaning of the terms of the constitution was most contemporaneous in time with the document's adoption .

one author has noted that of the "committee of eleven," which first proposed to the convention of 1787 the eligibility requirement of being a "natural born" citizen , 8 of the 11 committee members were in that first congress , and none stated objections to or disagreement with the characterization of the term "natural born" by statute by the congress .

the supreme court has expressly noted the weight of authority of early actions of the first congress in explicating portions of the constitution because of the make - up of that congress , and its proximity in time to the convention .

as noted by the court , an act "passed by the first congress assembled under the constitution , many of whose members had taken part in framing that instrument , ... is contemporaneous and weighty evidence of its true meaning. .

one of the more noted political and constitutional scholars on the american presidency , edward s. corwin , has explained that "natural born" citizens eligible to be president clearly include all of those born "on the soil" of the united states and subject to its jurisdiction , under the common law principles of jus soli applicable in the united states , but also would appear to include those born abroad of u.s. citizens under the principle of jus sanguinis , as adopted by congress by statute .

corwin noted that congress has the authority as the legislative body of a sovereign nation "to determine who shall and shall not be admitted to the body politic": but who are "natural - born citizens" ? .

by the so - called jus soli , which comes from the common law , the term is confined to persons born on the soil of a country ; and this rule is recognized by the opening clause of the fourteenth amendment , which declares to be citizens of the united states "all persons born or naturalized within the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. .

on the other hand , by the so - called jus sanguinis , which underlay early germanic law and today prevails on the continent of europe , nationality is based on parentage , a principle recognized by the first congress under the constitution in the following words: the children of citizens of the united states that may be born beyond the sea , or outside of the limits of the united states , shall be considered as natural - born citizens of the united states ; provided that the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the united states .

by succeeding legislation the general clause of this provision has been continued in force to this day .

the question arises , whence did congress obtain the power to enact such a measure ? .

by the constitution the congress is authorized to pass "an uniform rule of naturalization," that is , a uniform rule whereby aliens may be admitted to citizenship ; while the provision under discussion purports to recognize a certain category of persons as citizens from and because of birth .

the provision must undoubtedly be referred to the proposition that , as the legislative body of a nation sovereign at international law , congress is entitled to determine who shall and who shall not be admitted to the body politic .

should , then , the american people ever choose for president a person born abroad of american parents , it is highly improbable that any other constitutional agency would venture to challenge their decision ... .

it may be noted that some have argued that the relevant common meaning of natural born citizen that was prevalent in 18 th century america should not be the one that was actually applicable in the american colonies during that time from british statutory and common law , and which was adopted specifically by the states after independence in 1776 ( and which , as noted by justice story , formed the "foundation" for american jurisprudence ) , but rather should be recognized as one derived from what has been described as a "philosophical treatise" on the law of nations by a swiss legal philosopher in the mid - 1700s .

this particular treatise , however , in the editions available at the time of the drafting of the u.s. constitution , did not actually use , either in the original french or in english interpretations at that time , the specific term "natural born citizens. .

it was not until after the adoption of the constitution in the united states did a translator interpret the french in emmerich de vattel's law of nations to include , in english , the term "natural born citizens" for the first time , and thus that particular interpretation and creative translation of the french , to which the vattel enthusiasts cite , could not possibly have influenced the framing of the constitution in 1787 .

furthermore , and on a more basic level , the influence of the work of vattel on the framers in employing the term "natural born" in relation to domestic citizenship within the constitution is highly speculative at best , is without any direct historical evidence , and is contrary to the mainstream principles of constitutional interpretation and analysis within american jurisprudence .

although it appears that there is one single reference by one delegate at the federal convention of 1787 to vattel ( in reference to several works of different authors to support an argument for equal voting representation of the states in the proposed congress ) , there is no other reference to the work in the entire notes of any of the framers published on the proceedings of the federal convention of 1787 , and specifically there is no reference or discussion of the work at all in relation to citizenship at the convention , in the federalist papers , or in any of the state ratifying conventions .

it would appear to be somewhat fanciful to contend that in employing terms in the u.s. constitution the framers would disregard the specific and express meaning of those precise terms in british common law , the law in the american colonies , and subsequently in all of the states in the united states after independence , in favor of secretly using , without comment or explanation , a contrary , non - existent english translation of a phrase in a french - language treatise on international law .

in a state case cited with approval by the u.s. supreme court , an extensive legal analysis of the question of natural born citizenship under the law of the united states by assistant vice chancellor sandford , in new york in 1844 , found that the laws in all of the american colonies , and then in all of the states after independence , followed the english common law principles of jus soli , that is , that birth in the territory governed citizenship at birth , regardless of the nationality or citizenship of one's parents .

sandford found that it would be "inconceivable" that the framers , in drafting the constitution , would abandon without explicit comment or explanation in the document , the existing law in all of the colonies , and then in all of the states , of who were natural born citizens in favor of an "international" or "natural" law theory of citizenship by "descent" ( through one's father ) , an argument pressed by one of the litigants relying , in part , on vattel .

addressing specifically the question of the use of the term "natural born citizen" in the federal constitution as one of the qualifications for president , vice chancellor sandford found the following: it is a necessary consequence , from what i have stated that the law which had prevailed on this subject , in all the states , became the governing principle or common law of the united states .

those states were the constituent parts of the united states , and when the union was formed , and further state regulation on the point terminated , it follows , in the absence of a declaration to the contrary , that the principle that prevailed and was the law on such point in all the states , became immediately the governing principle and rule of law thereon in the nation formed by such union... .

the term citizen , was used in the constitution as a word , the meaning of which was already established and well understood .

and the constitution itself contains a direct recognition of the subsisting common law principle , in the section that defines the qualification of the president .

"no person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president," &c. the only standard which then existed , of natural born citizen , was the rule of the common law , and no different standard has been adopted since .

suppose a person should be elected president who was native born , but of alien parents , could there be any reasonable doubt that he was eligible under the constitution ? .

i think not .

the position would be decisive in his favor that by the rule of common law , in force when the constitution was adopted , he is a citizen .

moreover , the absence of any avowal or expression in the constitution of a design to affect the existing law of the country on this subject , is conclusive against the existence of such design .

it is inconceivable that the representatives of the thirteen sovereign states , assembled in convention for the purpose of framing a confederation and union for national purposes , should have intended to subvert the long - established rule of law governing their constituents on a question of such great moment to them all , without solemnly providing for the change in the constitution ; still more that they should have come to that conclusion without even once declaring their object .

the treatise in question by emmerich de vattel was a work concerning the "law of nations," which we would now classify generally as "international law. .

however , the concept of citizenship within a particular country is one governed not by international law or law of nations , but rather is governed by municipal law , that is , the internal law of each country .

vattel's writings on citizenship by "descent" reflected in many circumstances what the law or practice may have been in certain european nations at the time — that is , that citizenship followed the nationality or citizenship of one's father , as opposed to the place of birth .

this concept , although prevalent on the european continent was , even as expressly noted in vattel's work itself , clearly not the law in england or thus the american colonies , and clearly was not the concept and common understanding upon which u.s. law was based .

james madison , often referred to as the "father of the constitution," expressly explained in the house of representatives in the first congress , in 1789 , that with regard to citizenship the "place" of birth , and not "parentage" was the controlling concept adopted in the united states .

additionally , the supreme court in 1971 simply and succinctly explained , after citing historical legal precedent: "we thus have an acknowledgment that our law in this area follows english concepts with an acceptance of the jus soli , that is , the place of birth governs citizenship status except as modified by statute. .

again in 1998 , the supreme court expressly recognized jus soli , the place of birth , as controlling in the united states , noting that in this country "citizenship does not pass by descent" except as provided by congress in statute .

the "common" understanding of the term "natural born" citizen during the revolutionary period , the time of the drafting of the constitution , and in the generation after , was that of one who was a citizen "at birth" ( and the principal factor in the united states , as in england , was the place of birth within the country , rather than that of ancestry , lineage , or descent , except as provided in statute ) .

this common understanding and usage has continued up until this day as the term "natural born" citizen has entered the popular , legal lexicon as defined as: "a citizen by birth , as distinguished from a citizen who has been naturalized," and the meaning of "natural born" in common , general usage as "having a specified status or character by birth. .

the evidence of historical intent , general understandings , and common law principles underlying american jurisprudence thus indicate that the most reasonable interpretation of "natural born" citizens would include those who are considered u.s. citizens "at birth" or "by birth," either by the operation of the strict "common law" of jus soli derived from english common law ( physically born in the united states and subject to its jurisdiction , without reference to parentage or lineage ) , or under existing federal statutory law incorporating long - standing concepts of jus s an guin i s , the law of descent , including those born abroad of u.s. citizen - parents .

this general historical understanding and interpretation is supported , as well , by specific federal case law in the united states , and in official legal opinions of u.s. officers .

the constitutional history , the nearly unanimous consensus of legal and constitutional scholars , and the consistent , relevant case law thus indicate that every child born in and subject to the jurisdiction of the united states ( that is , those who are not children of diplomatic personnel representing a foreign nation or military troops in hostile occupation ) , is a "natural born citizen" eligible to be president under the qualifications clause of the constitution , regardless of the nationality or citizenship of one's parents .

the legal issues regarding "natural born" citizenship and birth within the united states without regard to lineage or ancestral bloodline have been well settled in judicial decisions in this country for more than a century , and such concepts date back to , and even pre - date , the founding of the nation .

the weight of more recent federal cases , as well as the majority of scholarship on the subject , also indicate that the term "natural born citizen" would most likely include , as well as those native born citizens born in the u.s. , those born abroad to u.s. citizen - parents , at least one of whom had previously resided in the united states , or those born abroad to one u.s. citizen parent who , prior to the birth , had met the requirements of federal law for physical presence in the country .

the technical constitutional meaning ( influenced by the corpus of british law , both common law and long - standing statutory law ) , as well as the meaning of the term in both the general legal lexicon and its common usage , appear to have converged on a seeming consensus that "natural born" means having a particular attribute or nature "at birth," as opposed to subsequently obtaining such attribute .
