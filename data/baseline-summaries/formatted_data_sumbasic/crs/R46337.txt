the sale of u.s - origin armaments and other "defense articles " has been a part of national security policy since at least the lend - lease programs in the lead - up to u.s. involvement in world war ii .

historically , presidents have used sales of defense articles and services to foreign governments and organizations to further broad foreign policy goals , ranging from sales to strategically important countries during the cold war , to building global counterterrorism capacity following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .

the sale of u.s. defense articles to foreign countries is governed by a broad set of statutes , public laws , federal regulations , and executive branch policies , along with international agreements .

an interconnected body of legislative provisions , authorizations , and reporting requirements related to the transfer of u.s. defense articles appears in both the national defense authorization acts ( ndaa ) and in the state department , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) appropriations acts .

these laws reflect the roles that both the department of state and the department of defense ( dod ) take in the administration of the sale , export , and funding of defense articles to foreign countries , which can be found in both title 22 ( foreign relations ) and title 10 ( armed services ) of the united states code .

congress enacted the current statutory framework for the sale and export of defense articles to other countries mainly through two lawsâthe foreign assistance act of 1961 ( faa ) , 22 u.s.c â§2151 , et seq. , and the arms export control act of 1976 ( aeca ) , 22 u.s.c .

â§2751 , et seq .

among other provisions , the faa established broad policy guidelines for the overall transfer of defense articles and services from the united states to foreign entities ( foreign countries , firms , and / or individuals ) to include both sales and grant transfers , while the aeca also governs the sales of defense articles and services to those entities .

this report describes the major statutory provisions governing the sale and export of defense articlesâforeign military sales ( fms ) and direct commercial sales ( dcs ) âand outlines the process through which those sales and exports are made .

fms is the program through which the u.s. government , through interaction with purchasers , acts as a broker to procure defense articles for sales to certain foreign countries and organizations , also called eligible purchasers .

in dcs , the u.s. government does not act as a broker for the sale , but still must license it , unless export of the item is exempt from licensing according to regulations in the international traffic in arms regulations ( itar ) , contained in subchapter m , 22 cfr 120-130 , described below .

the president designates what items are deemed to be defense articles or defense services , and thus subject to dcs licensing , via the u.s .

munitions list ( usml ) .

all persons ( other than u.s. government personnel performing official duties ) engaging in manufacturing , acting as a broker , exporting , or importing defense articles and services must register with the state department according to itar procedures .

the state department is required under the aeca to notify congress 15 to 30 days prior to all planned fms and dcs cases over a certain value threshold .

congress can , pursuant to the aeca , hold or restrict such sales via a joint resolution .

the report also provides a select list of specific legislative limitations on arms sales and end use monitoring requirements found in the arms export control act .

future updates will consider policy implications and issues for congress .

the broad set of statutes , public laws , federal regulations , executive branch policies , and international agreements governing the sale of u.s. defense articles to foreign countries include the following .

the united states participates in two international agreements that broadly affect the transfer of u.s. defense articles: the missile technology control regime and the wassenaar arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dual - use goods and technologies .

other international agreements , such as the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons ( npt ) , the convention on the physical protection of nuclear material , the chemical weapons convention , and the biological and toxin weapons convention , may limit exports of defense - related material , but only material linked to the development of nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .

the fms program is the u.s. government - brokered method for delivering u.s. arms to eligible foreign purchasers , normally friendly nations , partner countries , and allies .

the program is authorized through the aeca , with related authorities delegated by the president , under executive order 13637 , to the secretaries of state , defense , and commerce .

the state department ( dos ) is responsible for the export ( and temporary import ) of defense articles andâ services governed by the aeca , and reviews and submits to congress an annual congressional budget justification ( cbj ) for security assistance .

this also includes an annual estimate of the total amount of sales and licensed commercial exports expected to be made to each foreign nation as required by 22 u.s.c â§2765 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) .

dod generally implements the fms program as a military - to - military program and serves as intermediary for foreign partners' acquisition of u.s. defense articles and services .

using what is commonly called the total package approach , u.s. security assistance organizations must offer , in addition to specific defense articles , a sustainment package to help the buyer maintain and operate the article ( s ) effectively and in accord with u.s. intent .

dod follows the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement ( dfars ) , except where deviations are authorized .

acquisition on behalf of eligible fms purchasers must be in accordance with dod regulations and other applicable u.s. government procedures .

this arrangement affords the foreign purchaser the same benefits and protections that apply to dod procurement , and it is one of the principal reasons why foreign governments and international organizations might choose to procure defense articles through fms .

fms requirements may be consolidated with u.s. requirements or placed on separate contracts , whichever is more expedient and cost - effective .

purchasers must agree to pay in u.s. dollars , by converting their own national currency or , under limited circumstances , though reciprocal arrangements .

when the purchase cannot be financed by other means , credit financing or credit guarantees can be extended if allowed by u.s. law .

fms cases can also be directly funded by dos using foreign military financing appropriations .

if a partner is unable to purchase , or wishes to avoid purchasing , a newly - manufactured u.s. defense article , it may request transfer of excess defense articles from dod to its designated recipient .

eda refers to dod and united states coast guard ( uscg ) - owned defense articles that are no longer needed and , as a result , have been declared excess by the u.s. armed forces .

this excess equipment is offered at reduced or no cost to eligible foreign recipients on an "as is , where is" basis .

as such , eda is a hybrid between sales and grant transfer programs .

dod states that the eda program works best in assisting friends and allies to augment current inventories of like items with a support structure already in place .

all fms eligible countries can request eda .

an eda grant transfer to a country must be justified to congress for the fiscal year in which the transfer is proposed as part of the annual congressional justification documents for military assistance programs .

there is no guarantee that any eda offer will be made on a grant basis ; each eda transfer is considered on a case - by - case basis .

eda grants or sales that contain significant military equipment or with an original acquisition cost of $7 million or more require a 30-calendar day congressional notification .

title to eda items transfers at the point of origin , except for items located in germany ; those eda items transfer title at the nearest point of debarkation outside of germany .

all purchasers or grant recipients must agree that they will not transfer title or possession of any defense article or related training or other defense services to any other country without prior consent from dos pursuant to 22 u.s.c .

â§2753 and 22 u.s.c .

â§2314 .

the decision - making and execution involved in a transfer of defense articles or services includes myriad stakeholders , from the president and congress to small , two - person security cooperation organizations in embassies around the world .

having granted to the president authority to carry out arms sales and exports , congress oversees its conduct .

in further delegation of authority , the secretaries of state and defense , through their departments , carry out functions outlined in statute , federal regulations , and executive orders .

the arms export control act ( aeca ) directs the president to establish a program that provides for the end - use monitoring for all defense articles and defense services sold , leased , or exported under the act .

the program is required to provide reasonable assurance that the recipient is complying with the requirements imposed by the u.s. government with respect to use , transfers , and security of the articles and services , as well as that such articles and services are being used for the purposes for which they were provided .

the executive branch has two formal eum programs: blue lantern is for direct commercial sales , while golden sentry is for foreign military sales .

if exported defense articles require specialized physical security and accounting , the golden sentry program conducts specialized enhanced eum .

section 1 of the aeca states , "an ultimate goal of the united states continues to be a world which is free from the scourge of war and the dangers and burdens of armaments ; in which the use of force has been subordinated to the rule of law ; and in which international adjustments to a changing world are achieved peacefully .

in furtherance of that goal , it remains the policy of the united states to encourage regional arms control and disarmament agreements and to discourage arms races. .

the aeca proceeds to acknowledge and allow that arms transfers and cooperation are necessary to "maintain and foster the environment of international peace and security essential to social , economic , and political progress. .

these two paragraphs appear to draw a distinction between the policy aims of arms production and transfer on the one hand and , on the other , the burden [emphasis added] thereof as separate from economic endeavor and progress .

current administration policy contained in nspm - 10 is to "bolster the security of the united states and our allies and partners," while preventing proliferation by exercising restraint and continuing to participate in multilateral nonproliferation arrangements such as the missile technology control regime and the wassenaar arrangement .

it explicitly commits the u.s. government to continue to meet the requirements of all applicable statues , including the aeca , the faa , the international emergency economic powers act , and the annual ndaas .

it also prioritizes efforts to "increase trade opportunities for united states companies , including by supporting united states industry with appropriate advocacy and trade promotion activities and by simplifying the united states regulatory environment. .

the document adds "a dynamic defense industrial base" as a named employment source and stipulates "economic security" as a requirement for national security and defense .

congress may consider whether current sales and exports of defense articles and services , at current levels , bolster the security of the u.s. and its allies , while simultaneously fostering u.s. industry and innovation .

overall , should the goals of increasing trade opportunities for u.s. companies be an explicit goal of u.s. arms sales policy ? .

in light of the potential differences between 10 u.s.c .

â§ 2151 and the current united states conventional arms transfer policy , congress may consider whether to reformulate the goals of the arms export control act in light of the contemporary national security situation , whether and to what extent economic security comprises a facet of national security including any effect on the defense industrial base ( dib ) and the national technical industrial base ( ntib ) , and whether to determine the value of u.s. national arms production and export as part of overall u.s. exports and the degree to which desirability of arms production contributes to real long term economic growth .

in fy2018 , foreign entities purchased $47.71 billion in fms cases and the value of privately contracted dcs authorizations licensed by the state department totaled $136.6 billion ( see table 1 and table 2 , above ) .

congress may consider if this amount of annual arms sales is consistent with the intent of statute governing these sales .

the faa expresses , as u.s. policy , "the efforts of the united states and other friendly countries to promote peace and security continue to require measures of support based upon the principle of effective self - help and mutual aid. .

the aeca states that "all such sales be approved only when they are consistent with the foreign policy of the united states , the purposes of the foreign assistance programâ¦ , and the economic and financial capability of the recipient country , with particular regard being given , where appropriate , to proper balance among such sales , grant military assistance , and economic assistance as well as to the impact of the sales on programs of social and economic development and on existing or incipient arms races. .

section 1 of the aeca further limits u.s. arms sales , as policy , to levels extant when it was enacted: it is the sense of the congress that the aggregate value of defense articles and defense services - ( 1 ) which are sold under section 2761 or section 2762 of this title ; or ( 2 ) which are licensed or approved for export under section 2778 of this title to , for the use , or for benefit of the armed forces , police , intelligence , or other internal security forces of a foreign country or international organization under a commercial sales contract ; in any fiscal year should not exceed current levels .

congress may consider whether and how it measures the relation between the 1976 level of arms sales and any contemporary level .

some critics of current eum programs point to a potential disparity between the number of defense articles exported and the number of eum investigations completed .

for example , in the state department's blue sentry program in fy2018 , ddtc authorized 35,779 export license applications .

dos initiated 466 blue lantern checks ( 268 pre - license , 89 post - shipment , and 109 containing both pre - license and post - shipment checks ) in over 70 countries .

this represents approximately 1.3 percent of adjudicated license applications .

the state department employed five full - time employees and six contractors to administer the program .

some analysts have argued that such a small staff could not possibly track everything that happens to billions of dollars' worth of defense articles transferred to dozens of foreign countries each year .

acting assistant secretary of state for political - military affairs tina kaidanow testified that under current programs , there are a number of steps that the u.s government can take to endure proper end use of exported defense articles .

she noted further that most u.s defense manufacturers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the itar , with personnel dedicated to ensuring such compliance while working closely with the state department to address any compliance issues that may arise .

since the enactment of the foreign assistance act ( faa ) in 1961 , congress has amended both the faa and the aeca , as well as title 10 u.s.c .

 ( governing dod ) in order to limit the sale and export of u.s. defense articles to certain foreign countries .

additional limitations have been enacted in the annual state / foreign operations and related programs appropriations acts , and through the national defense authorization acts .

the following illustrative examples are not intended to be comprehensive .

restrictions based on human rights violations section 502b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the faa ( 22 u.s.c .

2304 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) prohibits , absent the exercise of a presidential waiver , security assistance to any country where the government engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights .

"security assistance" is defined here to include "sales of defense articles or services , extensions of credits ( including participations in credits ) , and guaranties of loans" under the aeca .

the u.s. "leahy laws," section 620m of the faa and 10 u.s.c .

â§ 362 , prohibit u.s. security assistance to foreign security force units when credible evidence exists that the unit has committed a gross violation of human rights .

however , these laws do not define security assistance , and in practice the executive branch applies them only to u.s. - funded transactions , excluding fms or dcs .

the child soldiers prevention act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-547 , 22 u.s.c â§2370c - 1 ) , prohibits assistance to and licensing for direct commercial sales of military equipment to the government of a country that is clearly identified as having governmental armed forces , police , or other security forces , or government - supported armed groups , that recruit or use child soldiers .

the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 , p.l .

106-386 , amended section 502b of the faa to require that the president report to the congress on countries found to be involved in extreme forms of trafficking of persons .

the act prohibits nonhumanitarian and nontrade - related aid , including security assistance , to countries that do not comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking in persons , subject to presidential waiver .

restrictions on countries supporting terrorism section 40 of the aeca ( 22 u.s.c .

â§2780 ) prohibits exporting or otherwise providing , directly or indirectly , any munitions item to a country whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism .

section 40a ( 22 u.s.c .

â§2781 ) prohibits any defense article or defense service from being sold or licensed for export to any county the president determines is not cooperating fully with united states antiterrorism efforts .

the prohibitions contained in this section do not apply with respect to any transaction subject to reporting requirements under title v of the national security act of 1947 , 50 u.s.c .

â§3091 et seq .

restrictions on the process of foreign military sales section 830 of the fy2017 national defense authorization act , p.l .

114-328 , required the secretary of defense to prescribe regulations to require the use of firm fixed - price contracts for foreign military sales .

restrictions and limitations on specific countries and regions libya: section 404 of the international security and cooperation act of 1985 , p.l .

99-83 , which amended the faa ( 22 u.s.c .

â§2439aa - 8 ) , authorized the president to prohibit any goods or technology , including technical data or other information , from being exported to libya .

middle east countries , excluding israel: section 36 ( h ) ( 1 ) of the aeca , p.l .

90-629 , 22 u.s.c â§2776 ( h ) ( 1 ) , requires any certification relating to a proposed sale to middle east countries , excluding israel , to include a determination that the sale or export of the defense articles or defense services will not adversely affect israel's qualitative military edge over military threats to israel .

west bank and gaza: section 699 of the fy2003 foreign relations authorization act , p.l .

107-228 , prohibits the sale of defense articles or defense services to any person or entity whom "the president determines , based on a preponderance of the evidence , â¦ has knowingly transferred proscribed weapons to palestinian entities in the west bank or gaza," for two years after congressional notification .

iraq: the fy2008 ndaa , section 1228 , p.l .

110-181 , required the president to implement a policy to control the export and transfer of defense articles into iraq , with no defense articles to be provided to the government of iraq until the president certified to congress that a registration and monitoring system was in place .

arab league boycott of israel: section 564 of the foreign relations authorization act , fiscal years 1994 and 1995 , p.l .

103-236 , stated , "no defense article or defense service may be sold or leased by the united states government to any country or international organization that , as a matter of policy or practice , is known to have sent letters to united states firms requesting compliance with , or soliciting information regarding compliance with , the arab league secondary or tertiary boycott of israelâ¦" saudi arabia and kuwait: section 104 of the dire emergency supplemental appropriations and transfers for relief from the effects of natural disasters , for other urgent needs , and for incremental costs of "operation desert shield / desert storm" act of 1992 , p.l .

102-229 , prohibited any funds appropriated in the act to conduct , support , or administer any sale of defense articles or defense services to saudi arabia or kuwait until that country paid in full their commitments to the united states made during operation desert shield / storm .

restrictions on defense articles related to nuclear , biological , and chemicalâ weapons the aeca has a series of provisions limiting the export of defense items related to nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons ( 22 u.s.c .

â§2799aa ) .

those controls are explained in detail in crs report r41916 , the u.s .
