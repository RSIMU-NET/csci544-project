congress periodically establishes agricultural and food policy in a multiyear omnibus farm bill .

provisions in the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( 2008 farm bill ; p.l .

110-246 ) generally expired beginning on september 30 , 2012 .

but the american taxpayer relief act ( p.l .

112-240 ; january 2 , 2013 ) extended all 2008 farm bill provisions that were in effect on september 30 , 2012 , for one additional year — that is , for fy2013 and the 2013 crop year .

parts of the 2008 farm bill expired again in october 2013 and , technically , implementation of an outdated permanent law would have been imminent for dairy in january 2014 , had it not been for the stated resolve to complete the conference negotiations .

after the passage of the agricultural act of 2014 ( 2014 farm bill ; p.l .

113-79 ) on february 7 , 2014 , expiration will not be an issue again until 2018 .

expiration of the 2008 farm bill was an issue because the 112 th congress made limited progress on a farm bill in 2012 .

the senate passed s. 3240 , but the house committee - reported bill ( h.r .

6083 ) never reached the floor .

concern over budgetary reductions complicated the bills' progress .

this impasse led to the one - year extension in p.l .

112-240 .

similar difficulties faced the farm bill in 2013 .

the senate passed s. 954 on june 10 , 2013 .

the house rejected a committee - reported bill ( h.r .

1947 ) on june 20 , mostly over disagreements about the nutrition title .

the house passed a "farm - only" bill ( h.r .

2642 ) on july 11 without the nutrition title , and on september 19 passed a stand - alone nutrition bill ( h.r .

3102 ) .

the house subsequently adopted a resolution ( h.res .

361 ) that combined the texts of h.r .

2642 and h.r .

3102 into one bill ( h.r .

2642 ) for purposes of a conference committee with the senate .

the final 2014 farm bill was not conferenced and enacted until february 7 , 2014 .

what happens if congress does not enact a new farm bill ? .

does the fiscal year , calendar year , or crop year matter ? .

will some programs cease to operate ? .

what is "permanent law" and what does it affect ? .

do the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) and crop insurance benefits end ? .

this report answers these and other questions about the expiration of a farm bill .

the farm commodity price and income support programs raise farm income by making payments and reducing financial risks from uncertain weather and market conditions .

government - set target prices offer payments when market prices fall below support levels .

originally , the last year for the 2008 farm bill's commodity programs was the 2012 crop year — that is , crops harvested during 2012 and marketed during the following year .

dairy price supports and export incentives were to expire on december 31 , 2012 , and the milk income loss contract ( milc ) on september 30 , 2012 .

the one - year extension in the american taxpayer relief act ( p.l .

112-240 ) covered the 2013 crop year for all covered commodities as they were available for the 2012 crop year .

the extension continued the farm commodity programs that were in effect in 2012 , including the $5 billion per year "direct payment" payment program , which paid farmers a fixed amount regardless of price or yield conditions .

it also extended the dairy price support program until december 31 , 2013 , and the milc program until september 30 , 2013 .

the new effective deadlines for enacting the farm bill were january 1 , 2014 , for dairy , and when the first supported commodity would have been harvested in the 2014 crop year .

in december 2013 , the house passed a one - month extension of the farm bill that would have extended program authorities until january 31 , 2014 ( h.r .

3695 ) .

the intent was to avoid the uncertainty of permanent law for dairy programs while conference negotiations were completed .

the senate did not act on the extension .

from january 1 , 2014 , until enactment of the 2014 farm bill on february 7 , 2014 , the dairy program technically had reverted to the outdated 1949-era permanent law , though usda did not implement it since conference negotiations were proceeding .

usda had indicated that a short - term extension was not be necessary if a new farm bill was completed in january , since the rollout of procedures to implement permanent law would take a month or more .

in 2013 , usda administered more than 20 agricultural conservation programs .

these programs addressed natural resource concerns on private agricultural and forested lands through technical and financial assistance .

many conservation programs had different expiration dates for program and funding authority ( table 2 ) .

because of this and appropriations peculiarities , they were affected differently by the 2008 farm bill expiration and extension .

for many conservation programs , program authority is permanent under the food security act of 1985 , but the authority to receive mandatory funding expires .

the one - year 2008 farm bill extension allowed programs with expired mandatory funding authority to continue until september 30 , 2013 , if the program had baseline beyond fy2012 .

the conservation reserve program's ( crp's ) funding and program authority expired at the end of fy2012 and was extended to the end of fy2013 in the one - year farm bill extension .

because crp had baseline beyond fy2012 , the program continued in fy2013 at the original authorized rate of enrollment — up to 32 million acres at any one time .

without reauthorization or a further extension of mandatory funding and program authority , expired conservation programs were unable to sign new contracts or enroll additional acres after september 30 , 2013 .

all existing contracts and agreements stayed in force for the contract period , and payments continued to be made .

other expired mandatory conservation programs had limited baseline beyond fy2012 as a result of previous reductions in annual appropriations .

for example , the wetlands reserve program ( wrp ) had authority under the 2008 farm bill to enroll no more than 3.04 million acres before fy2012 , and did not include budgetary baseline beyond fy2012 .

temporary reductions in fy2011 and fy2012 annual appropriations acts limited usda's ability to enroll the authorized level of acres .

this resulted in limited baseline being carried forward into fy2013 , whereas it would have otherwise been expended by the end of fy2012 .

with the one - year extension , wrp was able to use this additional baseline to enroll a limited number of acres within its original authorized acreage cap .

a different set of mandatory conservation programs had no baseline beyond fy2012 and therefore required offset funding in order to be continued ( eg , healthy forest reserve program and voluntary public access and habitat incentives program , vpahip ) .

other budget enforcement rules and appropriations dynamics affected particular farm bill conservation programs .

the congressional budget office used the last year of authorization to determine the 10-year funding baseline for the farm bill reauthorization .

because the fy2012 agriculture appropriations act ( p.l .

112-55 ) reduced spending for select mandatory conservation programs and could have reduced the multi - year budget baseline , it extended the funding authority expiration date for five of these programs , including agricultural management assistance ( ama ) , the conservation stewardship program ( csp ) , the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) , the farmland protection program ( fpp ) , and the wildlife habitat incentives program ( whip ) .

this allowed appropriators to score savings in fy2012 , but not affect the overall farm bill baseline since program authority for many of the reduced programs was extended to 2014 .

thus , even without a reauthorization of the 2008 farm bill , the five programs continued to operate .

several conservation programs also have permanent program authority , but are authorized to receive discretionary funds appropriated annually .

funding for these programs varies and is based on appropriated levels .

some discretionary programs with authorization to receive appropriations expired at the end of fy2013 .

similar to other discretionary programs with expired authority , the program can continue as long as it receives appropriated funding .

table 2 separates the conservation programs by funding authority type — mandatory and discretionary .

other farm bill provisions affecting agricultural conservation also expired .

the adjusted gross income requirement that limited eligibility for conservation programs , no longer applied to conservation programs during the expiration period .

however , compliance activities and regional equity funding requirements continued for programs authorized beyond september 30 , 2013 .

as discussed earlier , expiration and extension of snap ( and the related nutrition programs in the 2008 farm bill ) hinge on whether funding is available .

the nutrition authorizations in the 2008 farm bill expired after september 30 , 2012 , and were extended another year by p.l .

112-240 .

they expired again after september 30 , 2013 , yet operations for the most part were able to continue under the short - term appropriations continuing resolution ( p.l .

113-46 ) and the full - year fy2014 appropriation ( p.l .

113-76 ) .

the impact on operations is based on factors related to their authorizing statutes , appropriations actions , and the terms of a farm bill extension ( if applicable ) .

the 2008 farm bill reauthorized a number of domestic food assistance programs , including the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap , formerly food stamps ) , the emergency supplemental food assistance program ( tefap ) , the commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) , the food distribution program on indian reservations ( fdpir ) , the senior farmers' market nutrition program , the bill emerson hunger fellowship program , community food projects , nutrition assistance block grants for american samoa and puerto rico , and hunger - free communities grants .

with regard to expiration or extension , these programs fell into one of three categories: 1 .

programs that were permanently authorized and funded , 2 .

programs that can be continued solely by appropriations action , or 3 .

programs or authorities which would have expired without extension or reauthorization .

these categories are elaborated upon below .

the majority of farm bill nutrition programs ( and the majority of nutrition spending ) falls in the second categor .

several agricultural trade and international food aid programs would have expired without the new farm bill .

the trade programs with mandatory funding that were affected were export credit guarantees ( including those for emerging markets ) , facilities credit guarantees , export market promotion ( the market access program and the foreign market development program ) , dairy export subsidies , and technical assistance for specialty crops .

without new mandatory program authority , the commodity credit corporation would not have been able to enter into agreements to guarantee u.s. commercial banks against defaults by foreign purchasers of u.s. agricultural commodities , fund grants to trade associations for the promotion of u.s. agricultural exports in foreign markets , or fund activities to address sanitary and phytosanitary ( sps ) barriers to u.s. agricultural exports .

the international emergency and non - emergency food aid programs that were affected were the food for peace act , which is reauthorized in the farm bill , and the related agricultural technical assistance ( the farmer - to - farmer program ) in sub - saharan african and caribbean countries .

authority to provide commodities and pay transportation costs under the food for progress program was affected , as was authority to replenish stocks of the bill emerson humanitarian trust — a reserve of commodities and cash used to meet unanticipated food aid needs .

the authorization of appropriations for the mcgovern - dole international food for education and child nutrition program was affected , though the annual appropriation continued to fund this discretionary program .

appendix a .

farm bill legislative action since 1965 presidential vetoes presidential vetoes of farm bills are not common .

two complete farm bills have been vetoed as stand - alone measures ( 1956 and 2008 ) , the latter being vetoed twice .

another farm bill was vetoed as part of a larger budget reconciliation package ( 1995 ) .

the first veto of a farm bill was in 1956 when president eisenhower vetoed h.r .

12 , the first version of the agricultural act of 1956 .

the second and third vetoes were in 2008 by president george w. bush .

the 2008 farm bill was vetoed and overridden twice .

after the initial veto of the bill ( h.r .

2419 ) , congress overrode the veto and enacted p.l .

110-234 , but accidentally enrolled the law without title iii ( the trade title ) .

congress immediately reintroduced the same bill with the trade title as h.r .

6124 .

president bush vetoed this version as well , and congress again overrode the veto to enact p.l .

110-246 , a complete 2008 farm bill that included the trade title .

the overrides in 2008 were the only time that a farm bill was enacted by overriding a veto .

a 1995 budget reconciliation package that included the first version of what became the 1996 farm bill was vetoed by president clinton , but the veto was not necessarily due to the farm bill .

appendix b. suspensions of "permanent law" and proposals to repeal it the "permanent law" provisions for the farm commodity programs were enacted primarily in the agriculture adjustment act of 1938 and the agricultural act of 1949 .

subsequent farm bills into the 1970s continued to use and amend the permanent law provisions .

as more modern farm bills evolved away from using the permanent law provisions , those provisions have been suspended for the duration of each farm bill , rather than being repealed .

if no action is taken when a farm bill expires , then the suspension of permanent law also expires .

an "expiration of the suspension" would allow the essentially mothballed policies of permanent law to resume .

some see the existence of permanent law — and the undesirable policy and budget consequences that could result — as an assurance that the farm commodity programs will be revisited every time a farm bill expires .

suspension throughout the 1950s and 1960s , farm bills generally used and amended the 1938 and / or 1949 acts .

amendments sometimes were made permanent and sometimes only applied to specific years .

as farm commodity policy continued to evolve away from parity - based price supports and quotas , farm bills in the 1970s gradually began to move away from using the permanent law provisions .

yet , the 1970 and 1973 farm bills , for example , generally were written into the 1938 and / or 1949 farm bills , as amended , with provisions that were applicable only for the new period of the farm bill .

thus , while those farm bills might not have directly suspended permanent law in the same way that more modern farm bills have , they nonetheless supplanted some portion of the permanent law parity - based support system for the life of the farm bill , albeit from within the body of the permanent law itself .

beginning with the 1977 farm bill , direct suspension or nonapplicability language began to be used regarding the permanent laws .

this approach has continued through the 2014 farm bill .

repeal proposals to repeal permanent law have been relatively rare , though some have passed the floor in each chamber .

for example , proposals to repeal permanent law advanced perhaps the farthest during the development of the 1996 farm bill .

repeal provisions may have had saliency then because of a perceived intent of the "freedom to farm" reform plans .

if agricultural market transition act ( amta ) payments were to end in 2002 at the end of the farm bill , then the existence of permanent law could have been an obstacle .

whether or not repeal was a condition of the plan during its development , repeal was dropped in favor of continued suspension during conference negotiations in 1996 .

more specifically regarding the 1995-1996 developments , the initial bill considered by the house agriculture committee in 1995 would have continued to suspend permanent law ( h.r .

2195 , title iv ) .

after failing in committee , the text of that bill , including the suspension provision , was incorporated into a broader house - passed budget reconciliation package ( h.r .

2491 , §1105 ) .

however , the senate - passed version of the 1995 reconciliation package included a provision to repeal permanent law ( s. 1357 , §1101 ) .

the conference agreement for the reconciliation package adopted the senate approach for repeal ( h.r .

2491 , §1109 ) .

the conference agreement passed both the house and senate , but was vetoed , albeit not because of the farm bill provisions .

the next year , a stand - alone 1996 farm bill was introduced and passed in the house with the provision to repeal permanent law ( h.r .

2854 , §109 ) .

the repeal provision also was in the senate - reported bill ( s. 1541 , §19 ) .

however , the senate - passed version ( s. 1541 , §109 ) did not repeal permanent law but continued to suspend permanent law .

the conference agreement for the 1996 farm bill ( h.r .

2854 , §171 ) followed the senate - passed version and continued the suspension of permanent law .

other bills from 1995 to 2001 proposed repealing permanent law , but were not formally considered .

in 1995 , several bills were introduced to restructure government agencies .

first , a bill was introduced to abolish usda , eliminate all price support authorities including those of permanent law , and transfer certain powers to the department of commerce ( h.r .

1354 , s. 586 ) .

a broader government - wide restructuring bill also was introduced that would have repealed permanent law ( h.r .

1923 ) .

a separate agricultural reform bill was introduced that would have phased down agricultural supports and eventually repealed permanent law ( h.r .

2010 ) .

two other bills to repeal permanent law were introduced in 1995 ( h.r .

2523 and h.r .

2787 ) .

in 1997-1998 , h.r .

502 and s. 2573 would have repealed permanent law .

other bills to repeal permanent law were h.r .

328 in 1999 and s. 1571 in 2001 .

none of these bills advanced beyond being referred to committee .

other bills in various congresses have been introduced with targeted repeal provisions for certain commodities , but not comprehensive repeal .

these bills are not discussed here .

in the 112 th congress during consideration of the 2012 farm bill , an amendment was submitted , but not actually introduced on the floor , to replace the suspension of permanent law with the repeal of those provisions ( s.amdt .

2379 to s. 3420 ) .

in 2013 , the house - passed farm bill ( h.r .

2642 ) would have repealed the 1938 and 1949 permanent laws ( §1602 ) .

in their place , the house - proposed farm commodity program would have become the permanent law since it would have applied to "the 2014 crop year and each succeeding crop year" ( §§1107 , 1202 , 1204 , 1205 , 1206 , 1301 ) .

the senate bill ( s. 954 ) continued the long - standing suspension of permanent law , as did the initial house - rejected bill ( h.r .

1947 ) .

the enacted 2014 farm bill continues to suspend permanent law ( p.l .

113-79 , §1602 ) .
