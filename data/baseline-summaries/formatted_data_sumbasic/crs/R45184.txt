this report provides context for congress about the u.s. teen birth rateâor the number of births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19 each yearâand its changes since the 1950s .

over this period , the teen birth rate has generally been in decline .

this decline has been most significant in recent years , with the rate reaching a record low in 2018 .

multiple factors have likely contributed to the decrease , though the influence of any single factor is not fully known .

reduced teen sexual activity , particularly among younger adolescents , could be one explanation .

increases in use of contraceptives , including highly effective and multiple methods , among sexually active teens could be another .

other factors , such as broader social and economic trends , may also be at play .

despite the decline in the teen birth rate , congress continues to be interested in the issue of teen birth because of its high social and economic costs for both individual families and society more generally .

further , disparities persist in teen birth rates among racial and ethnic subgroups and across states .

this report accompanies crs report r45183 , teen pregnancy: federal prevention programs , which discusses congress's current approach of supporting programs that seek to prevent pregnancy among teens .

data on births are distinct from data on pregnancies .

the teen birth rate refers to the number of live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19 .

the teen pregnancy rate includes the number of pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19 , which encompasses live births , abortions , and fetal losses .

birth data account for nearly every birth in the united states , whereas pregnancy data are based on estimates of miscarriages and abortion numbers that draw on various reporting systems and surveys .

the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , the federal government's lead public health agency , reports birth data on an annual basis ( most recently for 2018 ) .

the cdc and the guttmacher institute publish teen pregnancy rates .

these rates are usually published a year or two after birth data because of the time required to incorporate data from the various data sources .

this report focuses on the teen birth rate .

the cdc tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers .

in 2018 , there were approximately 3.8 million births in the united states .

about 180,000 of these births ( 4.7% ) were to teenagers aged 15 to 19 .

figure 1 shows the u.s. teen birth rate from 1950 through 2018 ( the rate excludes the territories ) .

the rate ticked up in the baby boom era of the 1950s , peaking in 1957 at 96.3 .

it then decreased in most years from the 1960s through the 1980s .

from 1991 onward , the teen birth rate declined except in two years , 2006 and 2007 .

the rate dropped by 72% from 1991 ( 61.8 ) to 2018 ( 17.4 ) .

in other words , about 6% of teens aged 15 to 19 gave birth in 1991 compared to less than 2% in 2018 .

the greatest decline in the teen birth rate occurred in recent years .

for example , from 2007 to 2018 , the rate declined by about 58% .

the 2018 teen birth rate of 17.4 was a historical low since cdc began collecting and reporting birth data in the 1940s .

the cdc began tracking subgroup data for teens in 1960 , when the teen birth rate was highest for both teens aged 15 to 17 ( 43.9 per 1,000 ) and teens aged 18 to 19 ( 166.7 per 1,000 ) .

figure 1 indicates that the birth rate was higher in each year for the older teens compared to the younger teens .

the 2018 birth rates for 15- to 17-year - olds ( 7.2 per 1,000 ) and 18- to 19-year - olds ( 32.3 per 1,000 ) were the lowest on record .

repeat teen births have also declined over time .

cdc found the number of subsequent teen births among youth aged 15 to 19 declined nationally by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015 ( the most recent analysis available ) .

the prevalence of teen births that were repeat births was highest among hispanic youth , followed by non - hispanic black and non - hispanic white youth .

over this same period , the largest declines in the number of repeat births were among black teens ( 21.8% ) , followed by hispanic ( 16.8% ) and white ( 13.9% ) teens .

teen mothers have also been less likely to be married than in previous years .

in 2018 , the birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 was 16.0 per 1,000 .

this is compared to 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 .

despite the overall decline in the teen birth rate , the rates for certain racial and ethnic groups remain relatively high .

teen birth rates in 2018 varied based on race and ethnicity , with three groupsâhispanic ( 26.7 ) , non - hispanic black ( 26.2 ) , and non - hispanic american indian / alaska native ( 29.4 ) teensâhaving more than double the teen birth rate for non - hispanic white ( 12.2 ) and non - hispanic asian or pacific islander ( 4.0 ) teens .

figure 2 shows the teen birth rate by race and hispanic origin over three key years: 1991 , when the teen birth rate started a long - term decline ; 2007 , the most recent year when the teen birth rate had ticked back up slightly ; and 2018 , the most recent year for which cdc compiled historical teen birth rate data by race and ethnicity .

in nearly each year from 1991 through the recent period , the teen birth rate decreased for all racial and ethnic groups ; however , the rates declined more for certain groups compared to others .

from 2007 to 2018 , birth rates fell by 55% for non - hispanic white teens , 40% for non - hispanic american indian / alaska native teens , 58% for non - hispanic black teens , 73% for non - hispanic asian / pacific islander teens , and 65% for hispanic teens .

while the birth rates for two groups ( non - hispanic black and hispanic ) had a greater decline than the rate for white teens , their birth rates remained higher .

in 2018 , the birth rate for teens aged 15 to 19 varied considerably by state and territory .

the state with the lowest reported rate was massachusetts ( 7.2 ) ; the state with the highest reported rate was arkansas ( 30.4 ) .

figure 3 shows a map with 2018 teen births rates in four data categories for the 50 states , the district of columbia , and three of the territories .

eighteen states had rates of less than 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19: california , colorado , connecticut , maine , maryland , massachusetts , minnesota , new hampshire , new jersey , new york , oregon , pennsylvania , rhode island , utah , vermont , virginia , washington , and wisconsin .

ten states had the highest teen birth rates ( 25 or higher ) : alabama , arkansas , kentucky , louisiana , mississippi , new mexico , oklahoma , tennessee , texas , and west virginia .

the rates for the territories ranged from 19.3 in puerto rico to 34.4 in guam .

from 2007 ( when the birth rate last ticked up ) to 2018 , the teen birth rate decreased in each state or territory by between 19% and 67% .

teen birth rates have also declined in rural areas over time but remain relatively higher than rates in urban areas .

while the u.s. teen birth rate has decreased over time , it has been higher than that of most other industrialized countries .

for comparison , the u.s. teen birth rate of 18.8 was about 50% higher than the rate of the united kingdom , 12.6 , in 2017 ( based on the most recent international data available ) .

the reasons for the high teen birth rate in the united states relative to other industrial countries have not been fully explored .

economic conditions and income inequality within and between countries may play a role .

further , the research literature , which is somewhat dated and limited , indicates that use of contraceptives among teens appears to be greater in other developed countries compared to the united states .

researchers suggest that multiple trends have driven down u.s. teen pregnancy and teen birth rates .

they point to certain factors as the reason for declines over the 1990s through 2007 .

research indicates that over this period , the risk of teen pregnancy decreased primarily because of improved contraceptive use , including an increase in the use of certain contraception methods ( eg , condoms ) , an increase in the use of multiple methods of contraception , and substantial declines in foregoing contraception .

in addition , some of the risk of pregnancy decreased among younger teens , those ages 15 to 17 , because of decreased sexual activity .

a primary factor for more recent declines in the risk of teen pregnancy has also been the increasing use of contraceptives among sexually active teens .

from 2007 through 2014 , teens increased their contraceptive use , including the use of any method , the use of long - acting reversible contraceptives ( larcs ; eg , intrauterine devices , or iuds , and birth control implants ) , and the use of the withdrawal method along with another method .

broad economic and social variables may influence teen behaviors , such as whether they will abstain from sex or use contraceptives .

behavioral changes may have been driven by a confluence of factors , such as expanded educational and labor market opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology .

some observers theorize that the long - term downward trend in teen birth rates is attributable to the recession that began in 2007 .

they contend that during economic downturns the decrease in teen birthsâlike the decrease in overall birthsâis partly due to teenagers being more careful as they witness the economic difficulties faced by their families .

despite this rationale , the teen birth rate continued to diminish after the recession ( as well as during periods of economic expansion in the 1990s ) .

another possible explanation for the decline is the role of social media and increased use of the internet in teens' knowledge about sex and birth control .

one analysis found that there were more rapid declines in rates of teen childbearing in places where the mtv show 16 and pregnant was more widely viewed .

the study extrapolated that teens changed their behavior ( eg , increasing the use of contraceptives ) after viewing the show .

still , teen birth rates declined even after ratings for the show peaked .

some observers contend that teen pregnancy prevention programs , such as those supported with federal funding , could potentially play a role in the declining birth rate for teenagers .

however , the extent to which these programs have caused a decline in the teen birth rate is not fully known .

teen pregnancy has high costs for the families of teen parents and society more generally .

teenage mothers and fathers tend to have less education and are more likely to live in poverty than their peers who are not teen parents .

for example , nearly one - third of teen girls who have dropped out of high school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a reason , about 7 out of 10 teen mothers who have moved out of their family's household live below the poverty level , and more than 60% of teen mothers receive some type of public benefits within the first year after their children are born .

lower levels of education reduce teen parents' potential for economic self - sufficiency .

at the same time , being impoverished and having less education can also increase the likelihood of teens becoming pregnant in the first place .

these poorer outcomes may be explained in part by underlying differences between those who give birth as teens and those who delay childbearing: teen mothers often come from more disadvantaged backgrounds ( eg , family more likely to receive public welfare benefits , parents have lower levels of education ) than their counterparts who have children at a later age .

in addition , teen sexual activity even among those who do not become pregnant can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) , which can led to long - term health issues .

adolescents aged 15 to 19 have certain stis at a rate that is among the highest of sexually active individuals .

further , teen childbearing can also affect the offspring of teen parents .

children of teenage mothers have poorer outcomes than children of mothers who give birth in their early 20s or later .

they are generally more likely to ( 1 ) have chronic medical conditions , ( 2 ) use public health care , ( 3 ) have lower school readiness scores , ( 4 ) do poorly in school , ( 5 ) give birth during their teen years ( females ) , and ( 6 ) be incarcerated ( males ) .

in addition to the consequences for teens and their families , teen childbearing has societal impacts .

one study examined these societal impacts , specifically estimating the cost savings to public programs that were associated with avoiding unintended pregnancies during the teen years .

the power to decide did a simulation analysis to estimate the number of births to teenagers that had been averted due to the decrease in teen fertility rates from 1991 to 2015 .

the analysis then estimated total savings of $4.4 billion for this period , taking into consideration the cost savings to medicaid that would have been associated with labor and delivery , postpartum care for the mother , and infant care ; and receipt of temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , and special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) benefits .

additional research of decreased or delayed teenage pregnancy and childbearing could help to inform the impacts for teen parents , their children , and society more generally .
