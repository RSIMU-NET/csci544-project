on april 8 , 2008 , the house armed service committee's subcommittee on air and land forces heard testimony from a gao official on the army's decision to broaden the fcs lsi role from development to production .

he stated that: by committing to the lsi for early production , the army effectively ceded a key point of leverage it had held — source selection — and is perhaps the final departure from the army's initial efforts to keep the lsi's focus solely on development .

on april 17 , 2007 the coast guard announced that it would gradually assume the lsi role for the deepwater program .

media reports stated that the department of justice is investigating parts of the deepwater program .

in addition , secretary of defense robert gates has announced that the fcs program will be restructured into smaller weapons programs , and the role of the lsi will be eventually assumed by the u.s. army .

problems with the fcs and deepwater programs raised concerns regarding the use of private - sector lsis for executing large , complex defense acquisition programs .

given the size , scope , and costs associated with the fcs program , congress mandated that dod hold an fcs milestone review , following the preliminary design review .

since the inception of the fcs program , gao has performed audits of the program's cost , schedule , and performance .

one of gao's concerns was that the actual performance of the completely integrated fcs will be demonstrated very late in the program , and could result in a significant cost increase to the government.. congressional hearings on the deepwater program raised a number of oversight issues .

the dod inspector general ( ig ) reported on the increased deepwater costs due to design deficiencies and mismanagement , and raised questions about a lack of accountability and responsibility on the part of the lsi and coast guard management .

also , the defense acquisition university had questioned the overall deepwater lsi approach and recommended fundamental changes to the program , including a revised acquisition strategy that "does not rely on a single industry entity or contract to produce or support all or the majority of u.s. coast guard capabilities. .

potential options , in addition to maintenance of the status quo , regarding how and when lsis might be used in acquisition programs are listed below .

some of these options could be combined .

reduce the possible need for lsis by pursuing separate procurement programs rather than sos programs ; require that certain conditions be met before a private - sector lsi can be used on an acquisition program ( analogous to conditions set for use of the multi - year procurement program ) ; require that lsi arrangements include features to ensure transparency , prevent conflicts of interest , prohibit self - certification , require independent assessments , and facilitate meaningful periodic competitions of the lsi role ; institute additional or stricter reporting requirements for programs being executed by lsis ; require dod and other federal agencies to share lessons learned regarding programs executed with private - sector lsis ; prohibit the use of private - sector lsi's in future acquisition programs ; reduce the possible need for private - sector lsis by building back up the defense civilian and military acquisition workforces , and have dod assume the role of the lsi , and require that dod manage all sos programs ; and implement the recommendations of the recent gansler commission on improving the acquisition workforce .

on september 30 , 2010 , the house and senate conferees for the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 coast guard authorization act ( h.r .

3619 ) resolved their differences and the bill was sent to the president on october 4 , 2010 .

one provision in the bill , section 564 , would prohibit the use of lead system integrators within the coast guard for all acquisition contracts awarded , task or deliver orders issued after the enactment of this bill , and require the use of full and open competition for any future acquisition contract .

this provision was first introduced on march 23 , 2009 in the house as the coast guard acquisition reform act of 2009 .

p.l .

111-23 , the weapons system acquisition reform act of 2009 , required the secretary of defense to revise the dfars to reflect any organizational conflicts of interest that may arise from the use of private - sector lsis .

on january 20 , 2010 , dod published a final rule that both prohibits the use of future lsis and sets the conditions for a limited use of lsi's for certain award of new contracts for lsis .

this final rule implements section 802 of the fy2008 national defense authorization act .

p.l .

110-417 , the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for 2009 , included a provision amending existing public law by clarifying the status of the lead system integrator function for the u.s. army's fcs program .

section 112 of the bill provided a provision that clarified the length of time that the contractor can remain the lsi .

the provision required the secretary of the army to certify to congressional defense committees when the prime contractor is no longer serving as the lead systems integrator , and notes that any modification to the existing fcs contract , when expressly for the purpose of commencing full - rate production of any major systems or subsystems , shall be considered a new contract .
