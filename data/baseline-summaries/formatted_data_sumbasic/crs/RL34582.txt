from a peak in early 2002 through the first half of 2008 , the ( inflation adjusted ) trade - weighted dollar exchange rate , for the most part , steadily depreciated , falling a total of about 25% ( see figure 1 ) .

the dollar's fall over this six - year period was moderately paced at about 3% to 4% annually .

for the next nine months , as the wider economy was reeling from the effects of the financial crisis and recession , the dollar sharply appreciated , increasing more than 11% on a trade - weighted basis .

for reasons that will be discussed later in the report , this appreciation was a market response to the great uncertainty associated with those economic troubles .

as economic conditions began to stabilize in mid - 2009 , the dollar began to depreciate again and fell about 16% through mid - 2011 and more or less returned to its prerecession trend of depreciation .

however , a second bout of market uncertainty caused by the european sovereign debt crisis caused the dollar to appreciate more than 5% through the end of 2011 .

in early 2012 , the dollar resumed its depreciation , down about 2% through february 2012 and , with the return of some degree of financial normalcy in europe , the trend depreciation some believe may resume .

the dollar's fall from early 2002 through early 2008 as well as the recent depreciation has not been uniform against individual currencies , however .

for example , in the earlier period , it fell 45% against the euro , 24% against the yen , 18% against the yuan , and 17% against the mexican peso .

in the period since the trough of the business cycle in mid - 2009 , the dollar fell 13% against the euro , 11% against the yen , less than 3% against the yuan ( all of which occurred recently ) , and 8% against the peso .

these differing amounts of depreciation are partly a reflection of the countries' willingness to let their currencies fluctuate against the dollar .

the euro is free floating , the yen has been moderately managed ( mostly before 2005 but more deliberately since september 2010 ) , and the yuan is actively managed ( its value rigidly fixed to the dollar before 2005 and from mid - 2008 until mid - 2010 ; since then allowed to rise moderately against the dollar ) .

but the pattern also reflects significant structural asymmetries in flows of global assets and global goods , as well as differences in business cycles , inflation rates , shocks affecting the different economies , and an unwinding of imbalances that were present in 2002 .

the weakening of the dollar raises concern in congress and among the public that the dollar's decline is a symptom of broader economic problems , such as a weak economic recovery , rising public debt , and a diminished standing in the global economy .

have recent policy actions such as quantitative easing by the federal reserve ( fed ) and fiscal stimulus passed by the 111 th congress had an effect on the dollar ? .

how might failure by the 112 th congress to raise the federal debt ceiling or address the country's long - term government debt problem affect the exchange rate ? .

is there a positive side to dollar depreciation ? .

economic theory suggests that the dollar's path can be influenced by a variety of factors that could confer to the united states both benefits and costs , and in some circumstances a depreciating currency can be , on balance , beneficial .

this report examines the several factors that are likely to influence the dollar's medium - term path ; why further depreciation could occur ; what effects a depreciating dollar could have on the economy , including the pace of economic recovery ; and how alternative policy measures might influence the dollar's path .

since the break - up of the bretton woods international monetary system in 1973 , the exchange rate of the dollar has been largely determined by the market â€” the supply and demand for dollars in global foreign exchange markets .

dollars are demanded by foreigners to buy dollar denominated goods and assets .

 ( assets include bank accounts , stocks , bonds , and real property. ) .

dollars are supplied to the foreign exchange markets by americans exchanging them for foreign currencies typically needed to buy foreign goods and assets .

since the mid - 1990s , the united states has had a growing trade deficit in goods transactions , generating a net increase in the supply of dollars on the foreign exchange markets , thereby exerting downward pressure on the dollar's exchange rate .

at the same time , the united states has had an equal - sized surplus in asset transactions , reflecting a net increase in the demand for dollars on the foreign exchange market , thereby exerting upward pressure on the dollar's exchange rate .

in most circumstances , however , there is a strong expectation that asset - market transactions will tend to be dominant and ultimately dictate the exchange rate's direction of movement .

this dominance is the result of gross asset - market transactions occurring on a scale and at a speed that greatly exceeds what occurs with goods - market transactions .

electronic exchange makes most asset transfers nearly instantaneous and , in most years , u.s. - international asset transactions were two to three times as large as what would be needed to simply finance that year's trade deficit .

in 2007 , near the peak of the last economic expansion , the u.s. capital account recorded $1.5 trillion in purchases of foreign assets by u.s. residents ( representing a capital outflow ) and $2.1 trillion in purchases of u.s. assets by foreign residents ( representing a capital inflow ) .

so while the united states could have financed the $702 billion trade deficit in goods and services in 2007 simply by a $702 billion sale of assets to foreigners , u.s. and foreign investors engaged in a much larger volume of pure asset trading .

economic theory suggests that several economic factors could influence the direction of cross - border asset flows .

standard economic analysis suggests that a sustained depreciation in the value of the dollar in international exchange has several likely effects , positive and negative , on the u.s. economy .

other impacts of a depreciating dollar are more problematic , but are potential risks .

as already discussed , the dollar's exchange rate largely reflects fundamental economic forces , particularly those that influence the demand for and supply of assets on international financial markets .

currently , an examination of those forces highlights a large and potentially destabilizing imbalance in the global economy: in the united states persistent large trade deficits and the accumulation of foreign debt , and in the rest of the world large trade surpluses , weak domestic demand , and the accumulation of dollar denominated assets .

most economists would argue that this is a condition that carries more than a negligible risk of generating financial instability and eventual global economic crisis .

to achieve an orderly correction of these imbalances that assures more stable exchange rates and leaves all the involved economies on sounder macroeconomic footing , mainstream economic thinking suggests that the needed rebalancing can be most efficiently achieved by a coordinated international policy response , the salient elements of which are in the united states , raising the national saving rate via substantial increases in the saving rates of households and government and through that reducing the u.s. trade deficit to a "sustainable" size ; in japan and europe , generating faster economic growth primarily propelled by domestic spending rather than net exports ; in asia ( excluding japan and china ) , fostering a recovery of domestic investment and reducing the outflow of domestic saving ; and in china ( and other surplus economies that fix their exchange rates to the dollar ) , allowing their currencies to appreciate and channel more of their domestic savings into domestic spending .

a key attribute of such a rebalancing of global spending would likely be further depreciation of the dollar .

this outcome illustrates that an orderly depreciation of the dollar can be , on balance , a beneficial attribute of policy adjustments and economic changes that would ultimately improve economic conditions in the united states and abroad .

there is some evidence that a global rebalancing is in progress .

in the united states , the saving rate of households is up and the federal government seems to be moving toward raising public saving by reducing its long - term deficit problem .

in china , the yuan has appreciated and the government's recently released five - year plan points to that country undertaking policies to raise its domestic consumption and narrow its global trade surplus .
