the program activities of most federal agencies are generally funded on an annual basis through the enactment of 12 regular appropriations acts .

when those annual appropriations acts are not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year ( i.e. , by october 1 ) , one or more continuing appropriations acts may be enacted to provide temporary funding to continue certain programs and activities until action on regular appropriations acts is completed .

such funding is provided for a specified period of time , which may be extended through the enactment of subsequent crs .

a continuing appropriations act is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution or cr because it has typically been in the form of a joint resolution rather than a bill .

but there is no procedural requirement as to its form .

continuing appropriations are also occasionally provided through a bill .

if appropriations are not enacted for a fiscal year through a regular appropriations act or a cr , a "funding gap" occurs until such appropriations are provided .

when a funding gap occurs , federal agencies may be directed to begin a "shutdown" of the affected programs and activities .

agencies are generally prohibited from obligating or expending federal funds in the absence of appropriations .

congress has enacted one or more crs in all but three of the 43 fiscal years since fy1977 .

further information is available in table 2 of this report .

in total , 186 crs were enacted into law during the period covering fy1977-fy2019 , ranging from zero to 21 in any single fiscal year .

on average , about four crs were enacted each fiscal year during this interval .

table 3 and figure 1 of this report provide more information on this aspect of crs .

this report provides an overview of the components of crs and information about congressional practices related to their use .

the first section of this report explains six of the typical main components of crs: coverage , duration , funding rate , restrictions on new activities , anomalies , and legislative provisions .

the second section discusses the enactment of regular appropriations acts prior to the start of the fiscal year and the number of crs enacted , beginning with fy1977 , which was the first fiscal year that began on october 1 .

the third section provides information on the variation in the number and duration of crs enacted each fiscal year after fy1997 — the most recent fiscal year in which all regular appropriations were enacted before the start of the new fiscal year .

finally , the fourth section of this report discusses the features of the 15 "full - year crs" that provided funding through the remainder of the fiscal year .

for further information , see table 4 in this report .

a list of all crs enacted between fy1977 and fy2019 is provided at the end of this report in table 5 .

this report has been updated from the previous january 2016 version to include information on fy2017 , fy2018 , and fy2019 .

congress has included six main components in crs .

first , crs provide funding for certain activities ( coverage ) , which are typically specified with reference to the prior or current fiscal year's appropriations acts .

second , crs provide budget authority for a specified duration of time .

this duration may be as short as a single day or as long as the remainder of the fiscal year .

third , crs typically provide funds based on an overall funding rate .

fourth , the use of budget authority provided in the cr is typically prohibited for new activities not funded in the previous fiscal year .

fifth , the duration and amount of funds in the cr , and purposes for which they may be used for specified activities , may be adjusted through anomalies .

sixth , legislative provisions — which create , amend , or extend other laws — have been included in some instances .

although this section discusses the above components as they have been enacted in crs under recent practice , it does not discuss their potential effects on budget execution or agency operations .

for analysis of these issues , see crs report rl34700 , interim continuing resolutions ( crs ) : potential impacts on agency operations .

as mentioned previously , regular appropriations were enacted after october 1 in all but four fiscal years between fy1977 and fy2019 .

consequently , crs have been needed in almost all of these years to prevent one or more funding gaps from occurring .

table 2 provides an overview of the enactment of regular appropriations bills and the use of crs between fy1977 and fy2019 .

all appropriations were enacted before the start of the new fiscal year four times during this period: fy1977 , fy1989 , fy1995 , and fy1997 .

over half of the regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year were enacted before the start of the new fiscal year in only one instance ( fy1978 ) .

in all other fiscal years , fewer than six regular appropriations acts were enacted on or before october 1 .

in addition , in 15 out of the 43 years during this period , no regular appropriations bills were enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year .

ten of these fiscal years have occurred in the interval since fy2001 .

crs were enacted in all but three of these fiscal years ( fy1989 , fy1995 , and fy1997 ) .

in fy1977 , although all 13 regular appropriations bills became law on or before the start of the fiscal year , two crs were enacted to provide funding for certain activities that had not been included in the regular appropriations acts .

crs have been a significant element of the recent annual appropriations process .

as shown in table 3 , a total of 117 crs were enacted into law from fy1998 to fy2019 .

while the average number of such measures enacted per year was about five , the number enacted ranged from two measures ( for fy2009 , fy2010 , and fy2013 ) to 21 ( for fy2001 ) .

during the past 22 fiscal years , congress provided funding by means of a cr for an average of almost five months ( 143 days ) each fiscal year .

taking into account the total duration of all crs for each fiscal year , the period for which continuing appropriations were provided ranged from 21 days to 365 days .

on average , each of the 117 crs lasted for about 39 days ; 53 of these were for seven days or fewer .

three full - year crs were used during this period , for fy2007 , fy2011 , and fy2013 .

in the first four instances ( fy1998-fy2001 ) , the expiration date of the final cr was set in the first quarter of the fiscal year on a date occurring between october 21 and december 21 .

the expiration date in the final cr for the next three fiscal years ( fy2002-fy2004 ) and fy2019 , however , was set in the following session of congress on a date occurring between january 10 and february 20 .

in six of the next 12 fiscal years ( fy2005 , fy2006 , fy2008 , fy2010 , fy2012 , and fy2016 ) , the expiration dates were in the first quarter of the fiscal year on a date occurring between december 8 and december 31 .

for the remaining fiscal years , the final crs were enacted during the next session of congress .

in one instance , the final cr for the fiscal year expired during the month of january ( fy2014 ) .

in three instances , the final cr expired in march ( fy2009 , fy2015 , and fy2018 ) .

three other final crs — for fy2007 , fy2011 , and fy2013 — provided funding through the end of the fiscal year .

figure 1 presents a representation of the duration of crs for fy1998-fy2019 .

as the figure shows , there is no significant correlation between these two variables .

for example , six crs were enacted for both fy1998 and fy1999 , but the same number of measures lasted for a period of 57 days for fy1998 and only 21 days for fy1999 .

the largest number of crs enacted for a single fiscal year during this period — 21 for fy2001 — covered a period lasting 82 days at an average duration of about four days per act .

the smallest number enacted — two each for fy2009 , fy2010 , and fy2013 — covered 162 days , 79 days , and 365 days , respectively .

figure 1 also shows considerable mix in the use of shorter - term and longer - term crs for a single fiscal year .

for example , for fy2001 , 21 crs covered the first 82 days of the fiscal year .

the first 25 days were covered by a series of four crs lasting between five and eight days each .

the next 10 days , a period of intense legislative negotiations leading up to the national elections on november 7 , 2000 , were covered by a series of 10 one - day crs .

the next 31 days were covered by two crs , the first lasting 10 days and the second lasting 21 days .

the first of these two crs was enacted into law on november 4 , the saturday before the election , and extended through november 14 , the second day of a lame - duck session .

the second cr was enacted into law on november 15 and expired on december 5 , which was 10 days before the lame - duck session ended .

the remaining five crs , which ranged in duration from one to six days , covered the remainder of the lame - duck session and several days beyond ( as the final appropriations measures passed by congress were being processed for the president's approval ) .

table 5 provides more detailed information on the number , length , and duration of crs enacted for fy1977-fy2019 .

as indicated previously , this represents the period after the start of the federal fiscal year was moved from july 1 to october 1 by the congressional budget act .

full - year crs have been used to provide annual discretionary spending on a number of occasions .

prior to the full implementation of the congressional budget act in fy1977 , full - year crs were used occasionally , particularly in the 1970s .

full - year crs were enacted into law for four of the six preceding fiscal years ( fy1971 , fy1973 , fy1975 , and fy1976 ) .

following the successful completion of all 13 regular appropriations acts prior to the start of fy1977 , full - year crs were used in each of the 11 succeeding fiscal years ( fy1978-fy1988 ) to cover at least one regular appropriations act .

three years later , another full - year cr was enacted for fy1992 .

most recently , full - year crs were enacted for fy2007 , fy2011 , and fy2013 .

table 4 identifies the 15 full - year crs enacted for the period since fy1977 .

nine of the 15 full - year crs during this period were enacted in the first quarter of the fiscal year — three in october , two in november , and four in december .

the six remaining measures , however , were enacted during the following session between february 15 and june 5 .

the full - year crs enacted during this period also varied in terms of length and the form of funding provided .

full - year crs prior to fy1983 were relatively short measures , ranging in length from one to four pages in the statutes - at - large .

beginning with fy1983 and extending through fy1988 , however , the measures became much lengthier , ranging from 19 to 451 pages .

the greater page length of full - year crs enacted for the period covering fy1983-fy1988 may be explained by two factors .

first , full - year crs enacted prior to fy1983 generally established funding levels by formulaic reference .

beginning with fy1983 , however , congress began to incorporate the full text of some or all of the covered regular appropriations acts , thereby increasing its length considerably .

none of the full - year crs enacted between 1985 and 1988 used formulaic funding provisions .

secondly , the number of regular appropriations acts covered by full - year crs increased significantly during the fy1983-fy1988 period .

for the period covering fy1978-fy1982 , the number of regular appropriations acts covered by crs for the full fiscal year ranged from one to six ( averaging about three ) .

beginning with fy1983 and extending through fy1988 , the number of covered acts ranged from five to 13 , averaging about 10 .

the next two full - year crs , for fy1992 and fy2007 , returned to the earlier practice of using formulaic references and anomalies to establish funding levels .

both crs provided funding only through this means .

as a consequence , the length of these measures was considerably shorter than the fy1983 through fy1988 full - year crs .

the two most recent full - year crs , for fy2011 and fy2013 , in some respects were a hybrid of the earlier and recent approaches .

the fy2011 full - year cr provided funding for 11 bills through formulaic provisions and anomalies .

it also carried the full text of one regular appropriations bill in a separate division of the act ( the fy2011 department of defense appropriations act ) .

similarly , the fy2013 cr contained the texts of five regular appropriations bills in divisions a through e of the act — the fy2013 agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act ; the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act ; the department of defense appropriations act ; the department of homeland security appropriations act ; and the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act .

in addition , division f was characterized as providing continuing appropriations for the remaining seven regular appropriations bills through formulaic provisions and anomalies .

unlike previous years , the formula for providing continuing appropriations was based on the amount provided in fy2012 rather than a rate .
