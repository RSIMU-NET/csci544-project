in recent years , members of congress have monitored the course of north korea - japanrelations because japan plays a potentially critical role in addressing the military threat posed bynorth korea , particularly its nuclear weapons program .

 ( 1 ) most important , japan has told north koreait is prepared to offer a large - scale economic aid package - - on the order of $5 billion - $10 billion - - to compensate for the japanese occupation of the korean peninsula from 1910-1945 .

during theaugust 2003 six - party talks in beijing among north korea , the united states , south korea , china,japan , and russia , the japanese delegation reportedly reiterated its position that significant aid wouldbe forthcoming if north korea abandoned its nuclear program and cooperated on the issue ofjapanese citizens kidnapped by north korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s .

japan also is important to the north korean situation because it is a significant source of north korea's foreign exchange .

not only is japan north korea's third - largest trading partner , but thejapanese market also is a major destination for the north korean government's suspected drug - running operationsand of remittances from korean permanent residents in japan .

congress also has an interest in japan - north korea relations because japan's bilateral issues with north korea influence u.s. policy .

the united states has long cited pyongyang's harboringof japanese red army terrorists - - who face charges in japan of hijacking a plane in 1970 - - as areason for north korea's inclusion on the u.s. terrorism list , which by law prohibits north koreafrom receiving many forms of u.s. economic assistance and some trading rights .

 ( 2 ) at japan's urging,the united states reportedly also has linked delisting to north korea's cooperation with japan onthe abduction issue .

finally , japan arguably has been the strongest supporter in east asia of the bush administration's policy of pressuring north korea to abandon its nuclear program .

although japanshares the objections of other regional states to the use of preemptive military force , it is morewilling than china , south korea , and russia to employ coercive diplomatic measures againstpyongyang .

japan's position thus is important to the u.s. effort to deal with the north koreannuclear program multilaterally , rather than bilaterally ( u.s. - north korea exclusively ) , as northkorea had insisted .

indeed , since the late 1990s , the rising perception of the north korean threat hasprompted and enabled japanese leaders to broaden substantially the country's security posture .

japan has long been one of north korea's largest economic partners , though trade and financialflows have declined in recent years .

after the soviet union ended its support for pyongyang , japanemerged as north korea's second - largest trading partner ( after china ) , a position it held until it wasdisplaced by south korea in 2002 .

 ( see figure 1 . ) .

japan's relative share of north korea's trade , 2001-2002 sources: kotra ( korea trade investment promotion agency ) and south koreanministry ofunification .

 ( 34 ) notes: north korea's total trade was approximately $2.6 billion in 2001 and about $2.9billion in2002 .

the figures include foreign countries' assistance to north korea , which is recorded asnorth korean imports .

north korea's main export items to japan are clams , men's suits , mushrooms , and coal .

japan's primary exports to north korea are cars , electrical components , woolen fabrics , and generalmachinery .

many of the electronics components and clothing materials that are sent to north koreaare assembled into finished products and re - exported to the big discount stores that have sprung upthroughout japan over the past decade .

 ( 35 ) additionally , north korea is in default on over ï¿½80 billion ( about $667 million at $1 = ï¿½120 ) in loans from japanese banks , many of which have stoppedhandling transfers to north korea .

below , table 1 shows that bilateral trade has declined significantly since the 1980s , primarilydue to the severe deterioration of north korea's economy that began with the withdrawal of sovietand chinese support in the late 1980s and early 1990s .

by 2000 , the real value of north korea'sexports to japan had fallen to one - third of 1985 levels , and japanese exports to north korea hadplummeted to one - sixth the level of 1980 .

that said , the shrinking of the north korea economy maymean that trade with japan - - particularly exports , which generate hard currency - - is relativelymore important to north korea today than was true in the 1980s .

2001 japanese export figure does not include the 499,999 mt , worth over y112 billion ( $900million ) , of husked brown rice that japan sent to north korea as food aid .

on june 22 , 1965 , japan and south korea signed a treaty of basic relations , normalizingrelations between the two countries for the first time since japan annexed the korean peninsula in1910 .

as part of the final settlement , japan agreed to provide south korea with a total sum of $800million ( 41 ) , which consisted of: a ) an outright grantof $300 million , to be distributed over a 10-yearperiod ; b ) a $200 million loan to be distributed over a 10-year period and repaid over 20 years at3.5% interest ; c ) $300 million in private credits over 10 years from japanese banks and financialinstitutions .

prior to the 1965 agreement , the normalization negotiations between tokyo and seoul had dragged on for over fourteen years , and had triggered strong emotions in both countries .

throughoutthe 1950s , south korean president syngman rhee adopted a confrontational approach toward japan,and successive japanese governments showed little enthusiasm for accepting rhee's demands thatjapan apologize and compensate for its colonization of the korean peninsula .

relations warmed dramatically following a military coup in 1961 , led by general park chung - hee , who established rapid industrialization - - following the japanese model of export - leddevelopment - - as his country's paramount economic goal .

to this end , park was eager for japaneseeconomic assistance , and adopted conciliatory postures on most outstanding issues .

theapproximate size and composition of the compensation package was one of the first issues to beresolved following park's coup .

the south korean side , which at one point had asked for as muchas $2 billion , lowered its demands to $700 million in grant aid before agreeing to the $800 milliontotal package .

reportedly , until late 1962 , japan had offered only $70 million in total compensation,a figure the u.s. state department at the time described as "unrealistically low. .

 ( 42 ) furthermore , thetreaty on basic relations did not contain any reference to a japanese apology .

instead , japan'sreparations payment was characterized as "economic assistance. .

the terms of the treaty enraged many south koreans .

charging that the agreement amounted to a "sellout," korea's opposition parties boycotted the ratification process in the national assembly.violent anti - government protests erupted throughout the country , and the park government imposedmartial law to suppress anti - government protests around the country , the second time in less than ayear troops were mobilized to curtail protests against the government's japan policy .

the agreementalso faced strong but eventually ineffectual opposition in japan , where the socialist party - - whichhad friendly ties with north korea - - argued that the treaty would impede korean unification andwas a prelude to an anti - communist alliance in asia .

 ( 43 ) .

there are a wide range of estimates for the present value of the 1965 japan - south korea settlement .

at the low end is a method that adjusts for inflation in the u.s. economy , yielding avalue of approximately $3.4 billion in 1999 dollars .

 ( 44 ) at the high end is a calculation that producesa value of $20 billion in today's dollars by adjusting for inflation in the japanese economy,appreciation of the yen , accrued interest , and differences in population in north and south korea .

 ( 45 ) one methodology that adjusts for japanese inflation since 1965 and for inter - korean populationdifferences yields a present value of ï¿½418 billion ( $3.8 billion using an exchange rate of ï¿½110 = $1 ) .

if the same disbursement formula used in 1965 were applied today , the ï¿½418 billion would break outas ï¿½157 billion ( $1.42 billion ) in outright grants , ï¿½104 billion ( $950 million ) in concessionarygovernment loans , and ï¿½157 billion ( $1.42 billion ) in private credits .

 ( 46 ) the above figures should be interpreted as rough approximations .

computing the present value of a past sum is an inherently inexact task .

when more than one country is involved , the calculationis made even less precise by long - term changes and short - term fluctuations in exchange rates .

additionally , a calculation might also take into account differences between japan's occupation ofnorth korea and south korea , including the extent of the claims for damage by the occupationauthorities .

finally , the adjustments are made for the total figure of $800 million , even though theactual value of japan's compensation package was lower: over 60% ( $500 million ) of thesettlement was disbursed as government loans and private credits , which are less valuable to therecipient than outright grants .

thus , the calculations presented provide only a preliminarycomparative baseline , with many qualifications .

on the other hand , the 1965 settlement occurred before the revelation that japan had forcibly used tens of thousands of korean "comfort women" to provide sexual services to japanese soldiersduring world war ii .

north korea periodically has insisted that japan's compensation take intoaccount the comfort women's plight .
