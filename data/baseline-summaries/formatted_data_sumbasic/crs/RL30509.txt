the creation , legislative authority , and principal activities of the major agencies covered by the cjsappropriationslegislation for each fiscal year are described below .

brief descriptions of most of the related agencies covered bythelegislation are also included in this section .

the second session of the 106th congress addressed a number of issues during the cjs appropriations processforfy2001 .

major issues or concerns included: building more prisons ; extending the 1994 crime act fundingauthorizationbeyond september 30 , 2000 ; increasing funding for drug - related efforts among the department of justice ( doj ) agencies ; increasing funding for community law enforcement ; combating cybercrime ; funding of doj's legal action againstthetobacco industry ; changing the focus and levels of appropriations for doj's office of juvenile justice anddelinquencyprevention ; providing funding for programs that would reduce gun and youth violence ; reducing pending caseloadsinimmigration - related claims , particularly green card and naturalization applications ; meeting the statutory mandatethat theborder patrol be increased by 1,000 agents in fy2001 , and accounting for the shortfall in hiring in fy1999 ; determiningthe level of detention capacity necessary to comply with the statutory mandate that certain criminal aliens bedetained untildeported ; and restructuring ins internally as proposed by the administration or dismantling or restructuring theagency bylegislation ; the downsizing of commerce department programs , processing and releasing the 2000 decennial censusresults , the use of federal funds to support industrial technology , implementing the modernization of the nationalweatherservice , and the monitoring of foreign compliance with trade agreements and u.s. trade laws ; improving embassysecuritythrough a doubling of funding as well as a request for an advance appropriation to cover the period fy2002 tofy2005 ; whether to lift a statutory ban on judges receiving honoraria ; whether to increase funding to compensatecourt - appointeddefense attorneys in federal criminal cases ; how to contain the growing costs of the judiciary's defender servicesaccount ; and the merits of providing a cost - of - living pay increase for federal judges .

as noted earlier in this report , the government performance and results act ( gpra ) passed by congress in1993 ( p.l.103-62 ) requires that agencies develop strategic plans that contain goals , objectives , and performance measures forallmajor programs .

in its report on the fy1999 cjs appropriations bill ( s. 2260 ; s.rept .

105-235 , pp .

5-6 ) , thesenate appropriations committee made the following evaluation regarding agency compliance with gprarequirements: the committee has received a number of strategic plans from different organizations receiving appropriated funds within the bill .

the committee found weaknesses with the fiscal year1999performance plans of the departments of commerce and state and the small business administration .

thecommittee wasespecially troubled by the lack of results - oriented , measurable goals in the performance plans .

the committee isalsoconcerned that the plans did not uniformly display clear linkages between performance goals and the programactivities inagencies' budget requests .

also , some plans did not sufficiently describe approaches to produce credibleperformanceinformation .

the committee considers the full and effective implementation of the results act to be a priority forallagencies under its jurisdiction .

we recognize that implementation will be an interactive process , likely to involveseveralappropriations cycles .

the committee will consider agencies' progress in addressing weaknesses in strategic andannualperformance plans in tandem with their funding requests in light of their strategic goals .

this effort will helpdeterminewhether any changes or realignments would facilitate a more accurate and informed presentation of budgetaryinformation.agencies are encouraged to consult with the committee as they consider such revisions prior to finalizing anyrequests .

the plan prepared by the department of justice was given high marks by the committee .

it stated that: "the plan wasreceived in a timely fashion and contained objective , measurable performance goals .

the strength of theperformanceplans was its presentation of reasonably clear strategies for its intended performance goals. .

 ( 54 ) in its report on its version of the cjs bill , the house appropriations committee in 1998 noted that "performance planshave generally been of mixed utility in considering the fiscal year budget request. .

the committee requested thateachagency consult with it early in the process of formulating the budget and performance plan for fy2000 , to improvetheplan's usefulness to the committee when it examines the fy2000 request ( h.rept .

105-636 , p .

8. ) .

in its report onthefy2000 cjs appropriations , the senate appropriations committee stated that it had "...sent a memorandum to allorganizations subject to gpra funded within this act .

it requested information about the agencies' experiencesresultingfrom the act .

the committee reiterates that all responses be provided no latter than july 1 , 1999. .

 ( 55 ) brief descriptions ofthe latest versions of the strategic plans of the major agencies covered by cjs appropriations arecontained in thediscussions of the fy2000 budget requests of individual agencies included in this crs report .

in his budget forfy2001,president clinton made the following observations regarding the gpra process , stating that it: ...requires agencies to measure performance and results - not just funding levels - so that we can better track what taxpayers are getting for their dollars .

agencies are not only working todevelop anduse performance measures in program management but are also working to integrate this information into budgetandresource allocations , so that we can better determine the cost of achieving goals .

the task is not simple .

theagencies mustdefine the specific goals , determining the proper level of resources , assess which programs are working , and fixthose thatare not .

progress will depend on gpra becoming more than a paper exercise .

over the next year , omb will workwith allagencies to better integrate planning and budgeting and systematically associate costs withprograms .

a review of the final reports of the house and senate appropriations committees on the fy2001 cjs appropriations bill ( h. rept .

106-680 and s. rept .

106-404 ) finds that neither committee made any general comments regarding agencycompliance with gpra requirements .

the table below shows funding trends for the major agencies included in cjs appropriations over the periodfy1997-fy2001 .

as seen in the table below , funding increased , in current dollars , for the department of justice by$4,022 million ( or 27.5% ) ; for the department of commerce by $5,009 million ( or 37.6% ) ; ( 56 ) for the judiciary by $906million ( or 29.7% ) ; and for the department of state by $1,930 million ( or 49% ) .
