president obama's fy2014 budget request for energy and water development was released in april 2013 .

the request totaled $34.4 billion .

on june 18 , 2013 , the house energy and water development subcommittee approved a fy2014 bill totaling $30.4 billion .

the bill , h.r .

2609 , passed the house with amendments on july 10 .

the senate energy and water development subcommittee reported out a bill june 25 , totaling $34.4 billion , and the full appropriations committee approved the bill , s. 1245 , on june 27 .

on october 16 , 2013 , congress passed the continuing appropriations act , 2014 , h.r .

2775 , p.l .

113-46 , extending funding for all federal programs , including energy and water development , through january 15 , 2014 , at the fy2013 post - sequestration spending level .

on december 26 the president signed h.j.res .

59 ( p.l .

113-67 ) , which contained the bipartisan budget act establishing less stringent spending caps for fy2014 and fy2015 than the bca , thus easing the way for an appropriations agreement .

on january 17 , 2014 , the president signed h.r .

3547 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-76 ) , containing appropriations for all 12 fy2014 appropriations bills , including energy and water development programs ( division d ) .

 table 1 indicates the status of the fy2014 funding legislation .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

the energy and water development bill provides funding for the civil program of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , an agency in the department of defense with both military and civilian responsibilities .

under its civil works program , the corps plans , builds , operates , and maintains a wide range of water resources facilities .

the corps attracts congressional attention because its projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects , in addition to their water resource development purposes .

a number of recent changes have affected corps appropriations , including earmark moratoriums in both houses in the 112 th and 113 th congress and reductions for some projects and classes of projects compared to previous years .

additionally , in recent years flooding events on the mississippi and missouri rivers and in the northeastern united states affected a number of corps projects which received supplemental funds .

in addition to the regular appropriation for the corps , congress appropriated $1.724 billion in supplemental funding for response and recovery related to 2012 flooding and $5.35 billion in supplemental funding related to hurricane sandy .

 ( see table 4 . ) .

in most years , the president's budget request for the corps is below the agency's enacted appropriation .

however , in fy2013 the final amount provided by congress to the corps was less than the administration's request .

congress provided the corps with $4.718 billion ( post sequestration , post rescission ) , or $13 million less than the $4.731 billion requested by the administration .

fy2014 returned appropriations to the pattern of congress providing more to the corps than requested by the president .

the president's fy2014 budget request for the corps was $4.826 billion , not accounting for proposed rescission of prior year funds .

in its markup , the house appropriations committee recommended $4.876 billion for the corps , or about $50 million more than the amount requested by the administration for fy2014 .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $5.272 billion for the corps , or $546 million more than the administration's request .

p.l .

113-76 provided more than any of these ; under the enacted bill , the agency's civil works appropriations for fy2014 totaled $5.468 billion .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and energy efficiency , nuclear power , fossil energy r&d , the strategic petroleum reserve , energy statistics , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs .

the fy2013 continuing resolution , p.l .

113-6 , funded doe programs at $25.1 billion , including the sequestration requirements of the budget control act that went into effect march 1 , 2013 .

the administration's request for doe programs for fy2014 totaled $28.9 billion .

h.r .

2609 , as passed by the house july 10 , 2013 , totaled $24.9 billion for doe programs .

s. 1245 , as reported out by the senate appropriations committee june 27 , would have funded doe programs at $28.2 billion .

the final appropriations bill , p.l .

113-76 , appropriated $27.3 billion for doe .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

for fy2014 the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) was appropriated $1.0559 billion ( $125.2 million net , including the inspector general's office ) , $0.9 million above the request and $17.8 million above the fy2012 funding level .

major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users .

the house bill and the senate appropriations committee recommendation had provided the requested amount .

the nrc budget request included $240.5 million for new reactor activities , $24.9 million below the fy2012 level .

until 2007 , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s .

however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities and other generating companies to apply for licenses for 30 new reactors .

several of those applications were subsequently withdrawn or suspended , though , as falling natural gas prices reduced the competitiveness of nuclear power .

nrc issued combined construction and operating licenses for four new reactors at two sites in georgia and south carolina in early 2012 .

nrc's proposed fy2014 budget included no funds for licensing doe's previously planned yucca mountain nuclear waste repository .

because the obama administration wants to cancel the yucca mountain project and filed a motion to withdraw the license application on march 3 , 2010 , the nrc's fy2011 appropriation was used to close out its licensing activities .

as discussed in the nuclear waste section of this report , the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered nrc on august 13 , 2013 , to continue reviewing the yucca mountain license application , using $11.1 million in leftover funding .

similarly , the house appropriations committee had directed nrc to use prior - year funds to complete the yucca mountain license application , and contended that nrc was required by law to find additional resources as needed .

for regulation of operating reactors , nrc's fy2014 budget request included $571.9 million , $37.2 million above the fy2012 level .

those activities include reactor safety inspections , license renewals and modifications , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises .

the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan increased congressional and public concern about the safety of u.s. nuclear power plants .

nrc established a task force 10 days after the accident to review nrc's regulatory system .

nrc issued the first regulatory orders resulting from that review on march 12 , 2012 , and is currently working on additional regulations .

the energy policy act of 2005 permanently extended a requirement that 90% of nrc's budget be offset by fees on licensees .

not subject to the offset are expenditures from the nuclear waste fund to pay for waste repository licensing , spending on general homeland security , and doe defense waste oversight .

the offsets in the fy2014 appropriation result in a net appropriation of $125.2 million , $3.2 million below the fy2012 enacted level .
