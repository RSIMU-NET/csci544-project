this report briefly poses and answers several frequently asked questions in relation to the floor proceedings used to elect a speaker of the house .

for a more detailed treatment of these election procedures , as well as data on elections of the speaker in each congress since 1913 , see crs report rl30857 , speakers of the house: elections , 1913-2017 .

for a list of all speakers of the house and their periods of service , as well as additional discussion of selection procedures , see crs report 97-780 , the speaker of the house: house officer , party leader , and representative .

upon convening at the start of a new congress , the house elects a speaker by roll call vote .

if a speaker dies , resigns , or is removed during a congress , the house elects a new speaker at that time .

in the most recent cases of an election held during the middle of a congress , the practice has been to elect a new speaker using the same process as at the start of a congress .

when a speaker is selected at the start of a new congress , the clerk of the house presides ; the clerk may also preside over an election to replace a speaker who had died during a congress .

a sitting speaker could preside over the election of his or her successor .

however , under clause 8 ( b ) ( 3 ) of house rule i ( adopted in the 108 th congress ) , the speaker must provide the clerk a list of members designated to act as speaker pro tempore in the case of a vacancy in the office .

it is possible that a member on this list could preside over an election in the case of a vacancy during a congress .

in current practice , each house party caucus selects , prior to the floor vote , a candidate whose name is placed in nomination immediately before the vote .

typically , the election commences with a member from each party caucus placing in nomination the party's candidate for speaker .

other names may also be placed in nomination on the floor .

since 1839 , the election has been by roll - call vote , a quorum being present .

votes are cast v iva voce , meaning that each voting member states aloud the surname of the candidate whom he or she favors for speaker .

the presiding officer appoints several members as tellers , who tally the votes .

members are not required to vote for one of the candidates nominated by each major party ( or even for some other candidate formally nominated on the floor ) ; they may vote for any individual .

although the u.s. constitution does not require the speaker to be a member of the house , all speakers have been members .

however , some individuals not serving in the house have received votes .

the long - standing practice of the house is that electing a speaker requires a numerical majority of the votes cast by members "for a person by name. .

this does not mean that an individual must necessarily receive a majority ( currently 218 ) of the full membership of the house , because some members may not be present to vote ( or may instead answer "present" ) .

if no candidate receives the requisite majority of votes cast , the roll call is repeated .

no restrictions are imposed on who may receive votes in the subsequent ballots .

 ( for instance , no candidate is eliminated based on receiving the fewest votes in the floor election , and a member's vote is not limited to individuals who received votes in previous ballots. ) .
