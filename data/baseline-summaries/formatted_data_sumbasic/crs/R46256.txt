the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is the federal agency charged with improving the nation's health safety net .

hrsa provides access to health care services for those who are uninsured , isolated , or medically vulnerable , and educates health care providers on maternal and child health issues .

hrsa's main role in maternal health is through its maternal and child health bureau ( mchb ) .

the mchb , in this context , encourages health promotion , promotes risk prevention , and disseminates information to health care professionals with the goal of reducing u.s. cases of severe maternal morbidity ( smm ) and maternal mortality .

according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) of hhs s evere maternal morbidity refers to a medical condition such as eclampsia and health failure that adversely affects the maternal health outcome of labor and delivery , resulting in either short - term or long - term consequences for pregnant and postpartum women .

u.s. maternal death refers to "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy , but excludes those from accidental or incidental causes. .

cdc estimates the u.s. rate of smm by measuring u.s. cases of smm per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations .

according to the cdc , the overall u.s. smm rate increased by 190.9% between 1993 and 2014 , from 49.5 smm to 144.0 smm .

the cdc estimates the prevalence of u.s. maternal deaths by calculating the u.s. maternal mortality ratio ( mmr ) , which is the number of u.s. maternal deaths per 100,000 live births .

according to the cdc , the u.s. mmr increased by 32.8% from 13.1 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2004 to 17.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018 .

to address u.s. cases of smm and maternal mortality , the fy2019 appropriations report language for the department of defense and labor , health and human services , and education appropriations act , 2019 , and continuing appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l .

115-245 ) , among other things , reserved funds within the special projects of regional and national significance ( sprans ) for hrsa to administer maternal health programs .

sprans is a competitive grant program for research and training programs and services related to maternal and child health and to children with special health care needs .

the fy2019 appropriation provided $109.6 million to sprans , which explicitly included $26 million for hrsa to maintain and establish new maternal health programs .

using the sprans authority , hrsa allocated $3 million to the previously existing alliance for innovation on maternal health ( aim ) program and for the establishment of the alliance for innovation on maternal health ( aim ) âcommunity care initiative .

additionally , hrsa allocated $23 million to establish the state maternal health innovation ( mhi ) program .

in fy2019 , hrsa also established the rural maternity and obstetrics management strategies ( rmoms ) program and the supporting maternal health innovation ( mhi ) program .

the appropriations report language authorizes hrsa to use $1 million of the $23 million appropriated , for the purchase and implementation of telehealth and to support coordination of rural obstetric care .

to assist congress as it considers measures on u.s. maternal health programs , this report provides an overview of the previously existing aim program and the four new maternal health programs that hrsa established in fy2019 .

for each of the five maternal health programs , the report provides an overview of the program , discusses the main core activities or functions of the program , provides the program's criteria of eligibility and reporting requirements , and discusses the program's funding allocations .

the alliance for innovation on maternal health ( aim ) program aims to improve u.s. maternal health outcomes , including maternal safety , by diminishing the number of preventable smms and maternal deaths .

the initiative funds one cooperative agreement to support continuity of care for pregnant and postpartum women who receive maternal health care services at birthing facilities and hospitals .

hrsa established the aim program in 2014 .

since 2014 , the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog ) , which is a medical professional organization for obstetricians and gynecologists , has been the sole grantee of the aim program .

during the aim program's most recent four - year performance period .

acog was responsible for engaging and building partnerships with national stakeholders , promoting the adoption and implementation of hospital - focused maternal safety bundles by state - based teams , and evaluating the delivery of provider education on interconception health .

according to hrsa , a maternal safety bundle refers to "a set of small , straightforward evidence - based practices , that when implemented collectively and reliably in the delivery setting have improved patient outcomes and reduced maternal mortality and [smm]. .

hospital - focused maternal safety bundles are designed for health care providers in birthing facilities and hospitals .

the best practices contained in the maternal safety bundles are grouped into four administrative activities: ( 1 ) readiness , ( 2 ) recognition and prevention , ( 3 ) response , and ( 4 ) reporting / systems learning .

listed below are the current eight hospital - focused maternal safety bundles .

for example , the text box below describes the maternal mental health: depression and anxiety safety bundle .

the eight hospital - focused maternal safety bundles , according to hrsa , "include data metrics , are shown to be clinically effective , and are currently being adopted by states for inpatient use. .

as of january 2020 , according to hrsa , an estimated 1,300 hospitals in 27 states participate in the initial aim program .

the current aim program has a five - year period of performance of september 1 , 2018 , through august 31 , 2023 .

the alliance for innovation on maternal health ( aim ) âcommunity care initiative is a designed to improve u.s. maternal health and safety .

the initiative funds one cooperative agreement to support continuity of care for pregnant and postpartum women who receive maternal health care services at medical facilities outside of birthing facilities and hospitals .

the aimâcommunity care initiative builds on the work of the initial aim program .

together , both aim programs aim to expand the implementation and adoption of maternal safety bundles to all 50 u.s. states , the district of columbia , and u.s. territories , as well as tribal entities .

the aimâcommunity care initiative focuses on two priority areas: supporting the development and implementation of nonhospital maternal safety bundles for health care providers in outpatient settings and community - based organizations , and addressing preventable smm and maternal deaths among pregnant and postpartum women who receive care outside of birthing facilities and hospitals .

the initial aim program , which focuses on hospital - based services , began developing two nonhospital maternal safety bundles: ( 1 ) postpartum care basics for maternal safety: from birth to the comprehensive postpartum visit , and ( 2 ) postpartum care basics for maternal safety: transition from maternity to well - woman care .

the aimâcommunity care initiative is responsible for further developing these two maternal safety bundles .

the award recipient is to aim to advance the two nonhospital maternal safety bundles by developing data metrics , testing the bundles' effectiveness in outpatient settings and community - based organizations , and implementing the bundles in medical facilities outside of birthing facilities and hospitals .

the initiative recipient is to collaborate with key stakeholders , including other hrsa grant recipients that address maternal and child health issues , on ways to address preventable smm and maternal deaths among pregnant and postpartum women who receive care outside of birthing facilities and hospitals .

in addition , the awardee is to collaborate with the recipient of the supporting maternal health innovation program ( discussed in the " supporting maternal health innovation ( mhi ) â program " section of this report ) .

the two recipients are to work in partnership to develop resource materials for nonhospital - focused maternal safety bundles .

after developing the resources , the supporting mhi recipient is to assist the aimâcommunity care initiative recipient with disseminating resource materials and other evidence - informed strategies to communities that experience disparities in u.s. maternal morbidity and mortality .

the aimâcommunity care initiative has a five - year period of performance of september 30 , 2019 , through september 29 , 2024 .

the rural maternity and obstetrics management strategies ( rmoms ) program is a maternal health care pilot program that funds up to three cooperative agreements for the development , implementation , and testing of models that aim to improve access to and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities .

rmoms program recipients serve communities based on factors such as disparities in ethnicity / race , socioeconomic status , primary language , access to maternal health care , and coordinated / continuing maternal and obstetrics care .

according to hrsa , the rmoms program has four goals: 1. improve maternal and neonatal health care outcomes , 2. develop sustainable financing models , 3. develop a network whereby coordination of maternal and obstetric care is sustainable within a rural region , and 4. increase access to and the delivery of preconception , pregnancy , labor and delivery , and postpartum health care services .

the fy2019 rmoms program has a four - year performance period , september 1 , 2019 , through august 31 , 2023 .

the program occurs in two phases .

phase one .

the first phase occurs during the first year of the performance period .

during this year , rmoms program recipients develop baseline data , models , and work plans .

in addition , the program recipients participate in the development of network capacity building and infrastructure .

rmoms program recipients collaborate with hrsa to assess the program's impact using specific measures and data elements , including access , workforce proficiency , cost and cost - effectiveness , clinical outcomes , quality of care , and healthy behaviors .

the models are designed to address the four rmoms focus areas described below in the " four rmoms focus areas " section of this report .

in addition , each model addresses payment and reimbursement options , workforce skills required of maternal health care providers , and women's access to maternal health care services , including telehealth .

according to hrsa , telehealth refers to "the use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to support long - distance clinical health care , patient and professional health - related education , public health , and health administration. .

â  ( of the $23 million that congress provided to sprans for the establishment of new maternal health grants in fy2019 , congress reserved $1 million for the purchase and implementation of telehealth and to , support coordination of rural obstetric care. ) .

rmoms program award recipients are to develop and submit to hrsa three - year work plans , which include the baseline data and strategic plans to implement the model .

phase two .

the second phase occurs during the remaining second through fourth years of the pilot program .

during these years , rmoms program award recipients implement the models based on the recipients' work plans .

in addition , the recipients are to provide mothers and infants with case management and care coordination services .

the recipients would collaborate with hrsa to identify the data elements to monitor and measure through the model .

the state maternal health innovation ( mhi ) program is a maternal health program that funds up to nine cooperative agreements for state - focused demonstration projects , with the goal of improving u.s. maternal health outcomes .

state mhi award recipients are to establish demonstration projects within a state or group of states .

the demonstration projects are responsible for converting recommendations on smm and maternal mortality into actionable items that can be implemented by the states or groups of states .

recommendationsâsuch as providing maternal women with continuous team - based support , improving quality of maternity health care services , and engaging in productive collaborationsâderive from hrsa's maternal mortality summit , held in june 2018 .

state mhi program recipients are required to collaborate with other hrsa program awardees of programs such as aim , the healthy start program ( healthy start ) , and maternal , infant , and early childhood home visiting ( miechv ) programs in their state .

the fy2019 state mhi program has a five - year performance period , september 30 , 2019 , through september 29 , 2024 .

the supporting maternal health innovation ( mhi ) program funds up to one cooperative agreement to help states , stakeholders , and recipients of hrsa - administered awards reduce and prevent u.s. cases of smm and maternal mortality , and improve u.s. maternal health outcomes .

states and stakeholders include state health agencies , community - based organizations , and pregnant and postpartum women and their families .

hrsa recipients include those of the initial aim program , aimâcommunity care initiative , healthy start , and mch services block grant program .

supporting mhi program award recipients aim to achieve the following three program objectives by calendar year 2024: ensure that 75% of hrsa award recipients report improvement in their ability to implement evidence - informed strategies , with the goal of reducing and preventing maternal morbidity and mortality .

support the state mhi program by ensuring that 75% of hrsa award recipients that aim to improve maternal health outcomes can access the peer - to - peer learning opportunities and resources available through the state mhi program .

support the aimâcommunity care initiative by ( 1 ) increasing the dissemination of resource materials to support the adoption of nonhospital - focused maternal safety bundles , and ( 2 ) increasing the dissemination of evidence - informed strategies in communities that experience disparities in u.s. maternal morbidity and mortality .

the fy2019 supporting mhi program has a five - year performance period , september 30 , 2019 , through september 29 , 2024 .

the state mhi program funds a single project that undertakes two core functions: ( 1 ) providing capacity - building assistance , and ( 2 ) establishing a national resource center .

the supporting mhi project provides capacity - building assistance to the state - focused demonstration projects under the state mhi program and to the recipients under the rmoms program .

in this context , capacity - building assistance refers to technical assistance , training , and dissemination of information .

the supporting mhi program grantee provides the state mhi program and the rmoms program with technical assistance in the form of programmatic , scientific , and mentoring support .

both programs receive training assistance to develop and deliver curricula .

the programs also receive support to disseminate evidence - informed strategies to communities that experience disparities in u.s. maternal morbidity and mortality .

the supporting mhi recipient is to provide capacity - building assistance on 10 topic areas , listed below .

the supporting mhi program award recipient is to gather the community of learners for the state mhi program recipients .

the goal of convening the community of learners is to encourage peer - to - peer learning , including collective problem - solving and brainstorming sessions on ways the state mhi program recipients can effectively implement program activities .

in addition , the supporting mhi program recipient is to help the state mhi program recipients assess their progress in meeting program goals and planning and facilitating annual in - person meetings for the recipients .

the supporting mhi program recipient is responsible for establishing a national resource center where states , hrsa award recipients , and key stakeholders can access guidance on reducing and preventing u.s. cases of smm and maternal mortality .

the resource center offers assistance with trainings / technical issues , partnership building , policy analysis , and dissemination of information .

trainings and technical assistance are provided to stakeholders and hrsa award recipients on topic areas similar to the 10 topic areas described above .

hrsa award recipients under this program may include grantees of healthy start , the miechv program , and the mch services block grant program .

the supporting mhi program recipient , through the resource center , would collaborate with stakeholders that serve underserved populations to encourage partnership building .

key stakeholders and hrsa award recipients may reach out to the resource center for assistance with developing partnerships with national maternal health organizations ( eg , acog , the association of women's health , black mamas matter alliance , society for maternal fetal medicine , and telehealth resource centers ) .

the resource center offers policy analysis assistance to stakeholders and hrsa award recipients .

for example , the aimâcommunity care initiative award recipient can receive assistance in determining whether any of the nonhospital maternal safety bundles are evidence - informed and could reduce u.s. cases of smm and maternal mortality .

in addition , the resource center develops and maintain a public - facing web - based clearinghouse where key stakeholders can access pertinent resources , such as training materials and evidence - informed practices .

the website must have the capability to host the state mhi program recipient's online platform .

the supporting mhi program is also responsible for creating and implementing national guidance on reducing u.s. cases of maternal morbidity and mortality .

education and training are the foci of the national guidance .

the national guidance provides learning opportunities to key stakeholders on the following nine topic areas: the national guidance is intended to help key stakeholders with related activities , such as creating tools for collaborations , disseminating information about the project , and providing culturally competent technical assistance to key stakeholders that provide maternal health services to populations that experience disparities in u.s. maternal morbidity and mortality .

domestic public and private entities are eligible to apply for the supporting mhi program .

eligibility extends to tribes , tribal organizations , community - based organizations , and faith - based organizations .

eligible applicants must be aware of the different hrsa award recipients that address u.s. maternal health outcomes .

the supporting mhi program awardee is required to provide hrsa with annual progress reports , performance reports , and a final report narrative .

by 2024 , according to hrsa , the award recipient must submit annual reports on progress made toward achieving the three program objectives listed under the " supporting maternal health innovation ( mhi ) â program " section in this report .

the performance reports must examine measures such as technical assistance , health equity in maternal health outcomes , state capacity for advancing the health of maternal and child health populations , perinatal and postpartum care , depression screening , and adequate health insurance coverage .

the final performance report must include the project's abstract , expenditure data for the final year of the performance period , and the final scores for the performance measures .

each state mhi awardee must submit its final report narrative to hrsa within 90 days from the end of the performance period .

hrsa may annually award approximately $2.6 million to the sole recipient , as the agency did in fy2019 .

this funding is dependent upon the availability of appropriated funds , satisfactory recipient performance , and the interest of the federal government .

the supporting mhi program recipient can use the funds for administrative and facility costs .

there are no cost - sharing or matching requirements for this program .

according to hrsa , the total program costs incurred by the supporting mhi satisfies a cost - sharing or matching requirement .
