when congress considers legislation , it takes into account the proposal's potential budgetary effects .

this helps members to weigh the legislation's merits , and to consider whether it complies with the budgetary rules that congress has created for itself .

while information on the potential budgetary effects of legislation may come from numerous sources , the authority to determine whether legislation complies with congressional budgetary rules is given to the house and senate budget committees .

in this capacity , the budget committees generally rely on estimates provided by the congressional budget office ( cbo ) and the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) .

as described in the following section , cost estimates provided by cbo and jct are guided by certain requirements that congress has articulated in different forms .

these requirements are not completely prescriptive , however , and as a result both cbo and jct adopt practices and conventions that guide the creation of cost estimates .

generally , cbo and jct estimates include projections of the budgetary effects that would result from a proposed policy and incorporate anticipated individual behavioral responses to the policy .

the estimates , however , do not typically include the macroeconomic effectsâeffects on the overall size of the economyâof those individual behavioral responses .

congress has sometimes required that jct and cbo provide estimates that incorporate such macroeconomic effects .

these estimates are often referred to as dynamic estimates or dynamic scores .

this report provides information on the authorities and requirements under which cost estimates are prepared , as well as a summary of the debate surrounding dynamic cost estimates , and previous rules and requirements related to dynamic estimates .

currently , no congressional rules explicitly require dynamic estimates , and congress may examine what rules changes , if any , are needed in the area of dynamic estimates .

this report , therefore , includes information on options for the creation of dynamic scoring rules , and general considerations for congress related to dynamic estimates .

cost estimates provided by cbo and jct are guided , in part , by certain requirements that have been articulated by congress in different forms , as described below .

generally , cbo and jct estimates include projections of the budgetary effects that would result from proposed policy changes , and incorporate anticipated individual behavioral responses to the policy .

the estimates , however , do not typically include the macroeconomic effects of those individual behavioral responses ( such as changes in labor supply and the capital stock ) that would alter gdp .

for example , if an increase in the corporate tax rate caused corporations to use more debt , conventional estimates would take into account the loss of revenue since the returns from debt are taxed more lightly than the returns from equity , and this loss in revenue would offset the revenue gain calculated by multiplying the change in the tax rate by corporate income .

the conventional estimate would not , however , take into account the lost revenue from a reduction in income if the rate increase caused a decline in investment , which affects production .

these estimates without macroeconomic effects are sometimes imprecisely referred to as "static," but are referred to in this report as conventional estimates because they take into account many behavioral responses .

in contrast , a dynamic score aims to account for legislation's macroeconomic effect , by incorporating changes to ( 1 ) aggregate demand for goods and services to increase output in an underemployed economy and / or ( 2 ) aggregate supply of goods and services ( supply - side effects ) to increase potential output .

for example , dynamic scoring can include fiscal stimulus effects that increase aggregate demand .

these effects occur when the economy is underemployed ( for example , during and after a recession ) , and increased spending either by the government or from taxpayers after a tax cut can expand the economy through multiplier effects and cause output to move closer to potential output .

these effects are referred to subsequently as demand - side effects .

supply - side effects occur if potential output is altered due to changes in investment or savings that increase the capital stock , labor supply , or productivity .

the crowding - out ( or - in ) effect occurs when an increase ( or decrease ) in the deficit reduces ( or increases ) funds available for private investment and hence reduces ( or increases ) the capital stock .

currently , no house or senate rules explicitly require the preparation or use of dynamic estimates , and congress may choose to examine what rules changes , if any , are needed in the area of dynamic estimates .

while committees and members continue to have the ability to request that cbo or jct provide dynamic estimates for certain policies or legislative proposals , at some point congress may choose to reinstitute explicit rules related to such dynamic estimates .

these requirements could be articulated as formal direction from the committees of jurisdiction or leadership to jct and cbo .

alternatively , as was done previously , these requirements might be included in chamber rules or in budget resolutions , or might be included in a standing order or in statute .

if congress were to reinstitute explicit rules related to dynamic estimates , it may choose to consider many facets of such potential rules: will there be a threshold for the creation of such estimates ? .

should the proposal also allow the legislation to be designated as "major" by either majority or minority committee and / or chamber leadership ? .

should cbo and jct provide dynamic estimates only for "major proposals," such as those that have a large estimated budgetary impact ? .

if so , what will be the threshold for major ? .

past rules have used a measure equal to 0.25% of gdp .

would the effect on gdp be measured by the entire legislation , or would it be triggered by an individual provision or group of provisions ( such as revenue raisers or revenue losers in a tax bill ) that met the threshold ? .

the latter approach would capture revenue - neutral legislation that nevertheless made significant changes that could affect gdp .

should rules for dynamic estimates apply to spending as well as revenue proposals since both have the potential to cause notable macroeconomic effects ? .

and if the rule applies to spending , will it apply to discretionary spending that varies from the baseline as well as direct / mandatory spending ? .

what information should be included in such estimates ? .

practices prior to 2015 provided insight into how sensitive the results were to choice of model and parameters .

the jct has also continued to present information on the parameters of its models that lead to behavioral responses .

the justification for assigning model weights might also be addressed in more detail .

should dynamic estimates be used only for informational purposes , or also for enforcement purposes ? .

dynamic estimates allow congress to weigh the merits of the legislationâshould they also be used to determine whether the legislation complies with the budgetary rules that congress has created for itself ? .

should additional resources be provided to cbo and jct so that they might develop greater capacity for providing dynamic estimates ? .
