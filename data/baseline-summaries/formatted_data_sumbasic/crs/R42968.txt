on june 2 , 2014 , the united states supreme court overturned carol bond's conviction under the chemical weapons convention implementation act as a matter of congressional intent rather than congress's constitutional authority .

the court concluded that congress could not have intended the act to reach "run of the mill" local crimes like mrs .

bond's .

it had been anticipated that the court might take the opportunity to clarify the scope of congress's legislative authority under the treaty power .

it elected instead to emphasize , for purposes of statutory interpretation , the constitution's structural constraints on federal intrusions into the domain of the states .

on numerous occasions , carol bond , a microbiologist , coated the car door handles and mailbox of her husband's paramour with a mixture of toxic chemicals .

although mrs .

bond's efforts were clumsily done , the victim did on one such occasion sustain a minor chemical burn on her thumb .

mrs .

bond was eventually implicated and indicted in federal court for possession and use of a chemical weapon in violation of 18 u.s.c .

229 ( 1 ) ( a ) .

reserving the right to appeal , she pled guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for six years .

on appeal , mrs .

bond argued that the implementing statute under which she was convicted was either unconstitutional or inapplicable .

the united states court of appeals for the third circuit initially ruled that she lacked standing to raise the constitutional issue , since the tenth amendment exists for the protection of state , not individual , rights .

the supreme court disagreed and returned the case to the court of appeals for a decision on the merits .

mrs .

bond's constitutional claim was grounded on the argument that the legislation is an intrusion upon sovereign prerogatives of the states with respect to local criminal offenses .

the government has responded that ( 1 ) the authority to negotiate and ratify the chemical weapons convention comes within the president's constitutional treaty making power ; ( 2 ) enactment of legislation to implement the convention comes within congress's authority to make laws necessary and proper to carry into execution the president's treaty making power ; and ( 3 ) mrs .

bond's conduct was condemned by a literal reading of the implementing legislation's criminal proscriptions .

the supreme court unanimously agreed that mrs .

bond's conviction must be overturned .

for a majority of the court , the primacy of the states over criminal matters provided a presumption of statutory construction that could not be rebutted in mrs .

bond's case .

for the three concurring justices — scalia , thomas , and alito — the constitution does not permit the federal government to outlaw mrs .

bond's conduct based on the treaty power .

a majority of the supreme court preferred not to use mrs .

bond's conviction as a vehicle to define the scope of congress's legislative authority under the treaty power .

it may be that there is no majority view of the scope of the treaty power .

it may be that a majority would prefer to clarify the scope of treaty power without having to find that the federal government has overstepped its constitutional bounds .

it may be that a majority considered the bond case an aberration , and found the fact pattern of "this curious case" ill - suited to demonstrate the bounds of the treaty power .

it may be a majority of the court finds the missouri v. holland declaration a satisfactory statement of the law .

it may be a majority preferred to resolve the case on statutory grounds so as not to call in question other treaty implementing legislation .

it may be , as court opinion stated , that a majority would simply prefer to resolve cases using principles of statutory rather than constitutional construction , whenever possible .

it may be that several of these factors were in play .

the only thing that can be said with certainty is that the third circuit's opinion has been reversed , and the case remanded there for disposition consistent with the supreme court's opinion .
