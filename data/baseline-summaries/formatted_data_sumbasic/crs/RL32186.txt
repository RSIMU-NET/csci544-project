 ( 2006 ) .

subsection 224 ( a ) of the usa patriot act ( the act ) indicates that various sections in title ii of the act are to remain in effect only until march 10 , 2006 .

subsection 224 ( b ) creates two exceptions for matters that straddle the termination date , one for foreign intelligence investigations and the other for criminal cases .

even a quick reading of section 224 raises a number of questions .

what is the substance of the temporary sections that disappear on march 10 , 2006 ? .

what is the breath of the subsection 224 ( b ) exceptions ? .

what is the fate and impact of amendments to the expiring sections or to related provisions of law , enacted after passage of the act but before march 10 , 2006 ? .

what is the substance of the sections in title ii that continue on unimpaired by virtue of their inclusion in the "other - than" list of the subsection 224 ( a ) ? .

these questions are among those likely to be asked as twilight approaches .

the 9 / 11 commission noted the coming sunset , and expressed the belief that as a general matter , "[b]ecause of the concerns regarding the shifting balance of power to the government .

 .

.a full and informed debate on the patriot act would be healthy," 9 / 11 commission report , 394 ( 2004 ) .

the expiring sections deal with the power of federal authorities to conduct searches and seizures , generally searches and seizures relating to communications .

in most instances , they allow authorities to move more quickly ; they reduce the required layers of administrative and judicial approval ; they permit searches and seizures of a wider range of targets thus making these tools available earlier in an investigation ; and they allow authorities to coordinate their activities .

in doing so , they make it more likely that terrorism and crime will be prevented and that terrorists and criminals will be caught and punished .

they accomplish these things , however , by easing or removing safeguards designed to protect individual privacy and to prevent government abuse .

and so , they increase the risk that government authority will be abused and that the privacy of those who are neither terrorists nor criminals will be invaded .

the debate over sunset is a debate of where the balance should be struck .

to further complicate the debate , in some instances the expiring sections curtail rather than expand governmental authority ; bolster rather than erode the safeguards against governmental overreaching or abuse of authority .

the usa patriot act sections were originally set to sunset on december 31 , 2005 .

by then , both houses had passed legislation that amended and extended the expiring sections ( h.r .

3199 ) and a conference report resolving their differences had been issued , h.rept .

109-433 ( 2005 ) .

in order to provider further time for consideration , the expiration date has been extended twice , first until february 3 , 2006 , p.l .

109-160 ( 2006 ) , and more recently until march 10 , 2006 , h.r .

4659 , p.l .

109-____ ( 2006 ) .

subject to the exceptions of subsection 224 ( b ) , the new sections of law and the amendments to existing law , created by the sections of the act that expire on march 10 , 2006 , will cease to exist after that date .

the same is true for any subsequent amendments to the expiring sections .

they expire along with their hosts .

pre - existing provisions of law , repealed or amended by the expiring sections , will be revived automatically , unless they themselves have been repealed or amended by intervening legislation ( as several have ) .

the impact of subsection 224 ( b ) is somewhat more difficult to discern .

it provides two standards: one with respect to "any particular foreign intelligence investigations that began" before sunset and a second with respect to "any particular offense or potential offense that began or occurred" before sunset , p.l .

107-56 , â§224 , 18 u.s.c .

2510 note .

the first seems fairly straightforward .

the authority granted by an expiring provision of the act may be exercised after sunset or may continue to be exercised after sunset , with respect to any foreign intelligence investigation initiated before sunset .

the second comes with questions .

what is a "potential offense" ? .

does the phrase refer to pre - sunset circumstances whose criminality is determined in a post - sunset investigation ? .

or does the phrase also include post - crimes that evolved out of pre - sunset circumstances which themselves constituted neither crimes nor elements of a crime ? .

as a general rule , when congress uses ordinary words , it is presumed to have intended them to have their commonly understood meaning .

the word "potential" usually contemplates the incomplete , the unfulfilled , the undeveloped , or the unawakened possibility , rather than the suspected or uncertain possibility .

that might suggest the term was intended at least in part to apply to post - sunset crimes that grow out pre - sunset circumstances .

although hardly a term of art , earlier federal courts have used the term to describe possible past offenses in some cases , and to describe possible future offenses in others .

congress in subsection 224 ( b ) , however , is not referring to all "potential offenses," but only to those "that began or occurred" before sunset .

offenses occurring entirely after sunset cannot be said to have begun or occurred beforehand .

thus , although it is scarcely beyond debate , congress appears to have added the term "potential offense" out of an abundance of caution lest the exception be read to extend only to investigations of conduct whose criminality was known prior to sunset but not of pre - sunset conduct whose innocence or criminality was only ultimately determined after sunset .

the expiring law enforcement sections of title ii of the usa patriot act involve three communications - related aspects of federal law: wiretapping ; stored electronic communications and communication transaction records ; and pen registers and trap and trace devices .

federal law prohibits the interception of telephone , face to face , and electronic communications ( wiretapping ) , subject to certain exceptions including a procedure for judicially supervised law enforcement interceptions , 18 u.s.c .

2510-2520 ( title iii ) .

with the approval of senior justice department officials , federal law enforcement authorities may apply for a court order approving the use of wiretapping in connection with the investigation of certain serious federal crimes , 18 u.s.c .

2516 , 2517 , 2518 .

the orders must be narrowly drawn , of short duration , and based upon probable cause to believe that they will generate evidence relating to the predicate offenses under investigation , id .

when the orders expire , those whose communications have been intercepted must be notified , 18 u.s.c .

2518 .

the procedure for law enforcement access to the content of wire and electronic communications stored with communications providers and to provider transaction records is somewhat less demanding , although it generally requires a court order , warrant , or subpoena , 18 u.s.c .

2701-2702 .

pen registers and trap and trace devices surreptitiously capture the identity of the sender and recipient of communications .

the procedure for a court order approving law enforcement installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device is less demanding still , 18 u.s.c .

3121-3127 .

federal law affords foreign intelligence officials authority comparable to that enjoyed by law enforcement officials in some respects .

there is a rough comparability between surveillance ( wiretap ) authority under the fisa and under title iii , compare , 50 u.s.c .

1801-1811 , with , 18 u.s.c .

2510-2522 ; there is a rough comparability between fisa physical search authority and search warrant authority in a law enforcement context , compare , 50 u.s.c .

1821-1829 , with , f.r.crim.p .

41 ; and there is a rough comparability between fisa trap and trace or pen register orders and their law enforcement counterparts , compare , 18 u.s.c .

3121-3127 , with , 50 u.s.c .

1841-1846 .

there are , however , significant differences .

one of the most perplexing aspects of the law in the post - 9 / 11 universe is the relationship of the statutory procedures and prohibitions governing wiretap and related investigative tools in the criminal law enforcement world ( title iii et al. ) .

to those in the foreign intelligence world ( fisa ) .

title iii and its auxiliaries are focused on crime ( probable cause to believe that predicate offense has , is or will occur ; relevancy to a criminal investigation ) whether the offender is an american or not ; fisa is focused on foreign powers and the agents of foreign powers ( probable cause to believe that the target is a foreign power or an officer , employee , spy , saboteur , or terrorist acting on behalf of a foreign power ) whether criminal activity is involved or not .

the difficulty flows from the fact that an international terrorist may appropriately be the target of a order under title iii et al. , or fisa , or both .

subsection 224 ( a ) cites several sections and subsections of title ii that are not subject to its declaration of sunset .

they are: section 203 ( a ) ( authority to share grand jury information ) ( permitting the disclosure of matters occurring before a federal grand juryâthat involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or foreign intelligence informationâto federal law enforcement , intelligence , protective , immigration , national defense , or national security officials ) , f.r.crim.p .

6 ( e ) ( 3 ) ( d ) ; section 203 ( c ) ( procedures ) ( directing the attorney general to establish procedures for the disclosures authorized in section 203 ( a ) [grand jury matters] and 203 ( b ) [relating to similar disclosure of information secured through the execution of a court order authorizing the interception of wire , oral or electronic communications for law enforcement purposes] that identify a "united states person" ) , 18 u.s.c .

2517 note ; section 205 ( employment of translators by the federal bureau of investigation ) ( authorizing the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) to expedite the hiring of translators to support counterterrorism investigations and operations ) , 28 u.s.c .

532 note ; section 208 ( designation of judges ) ( authorizing the expansion of the fisa court from 7 to 11 judges and insisting that at least 3 of the judges reside within 20 miles of the district of columbia ) , 50 u.s.c .

1803 ; section 210 ( scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications ) ( expands the authority for subpoenas directing communications service providers to disclose customer - identifying information to include information concerning customer payment sources ( eg , credit card or bank account ) , 18 u.s.c .

2703 ; section 211 ( clarification of scope ) ( makes it clear that when cable companies provide internet or other communications services they are subject to the same law enforcement access procedures that apply to other communications service providers and not to the cable provider procedures that require customer notification when law enforcement access is to be afforded ) , 47 u.s.c .

551 ; section 213 ( authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant ) ( authorizes sneak and peek warrants , i.e. , warrants that call for delayed notification of their execution for a reasonable period if notification would have adverse consequences and that only permit the seizure of tangible property when reasonably necessary ) , 18 u.s.c .

3103a ( b ) ; section 216 ( modification of authorities relating to the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices ) ( ( 1 ) modifies the pen register / trap and trace device procedureâthe procedure for court orders authorizing law enforcement installation and use of pen registers or trap and trace devices ( essentially surreptitious caller id devices that identify only the source and destination of telephone calls ) âto apply to electronic communications ( eg , e - mail addresses and internet url's ) ; and ( 2 ) permits execution of the orders anywhere within the united states , rather than only in the judicial district in which the order is issued ) , 18 u.s.c .

3121 , 3123 ; section 219 ( single - jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism ) ( amends the federal rules of criminal procedure to permit magistrates in terrorism cases to issue search and arrest warrants to be executed outside of the judicial district in which they are sitting ) , f.r.crim.p .

41 ( b ) ( 3 ) ; section 221 ( trade sanctions ) ( makes it clear that the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act does not limit the application of criminal and civil sanctions available for violation of various anti - terrorism provisions ) , 22 u.s.c .

7210 ; and section 222 ( assistance to law enforcement agencies ) ( confirms that those who help law enforcement authorities execute an order approving the installation and use of trap and trace devices or pen registers are entitled to reasonable reimbursement and that nothing in the act is intended to impose technical obligations or requirements upon them ) , 18 u.s.c .
