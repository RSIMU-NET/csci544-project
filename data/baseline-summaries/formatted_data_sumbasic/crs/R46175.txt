the republic of kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 , nearly a decade after the end of a brief but lethal conflict between serbian forces and a kosovo albanian insurgency led by the kosovo liberation army ( kla ) .

since 2008 , kosovo has been recognized by more than 100 countries .

the united states and most european union ( eu ) member states recognize kosovo .

serbia , russia , china , and various other countries ( including some eu member states ) do not .

the united states has strongly supported kosovo's state - building and development efforts , as well as its ongoing dialogue with serbia to normalize their relations .

kosovo regards the united states as a security guarantor and key ally .

congress has maintained interest in kosovo for many decadesâfrom concerns over serbia's treatment of ethnic albanians in the former yugoslavia to the armed conflict in kosovo in 1998-1999 after the yugoslav federation disintegrated .

many members were active in debates over the u.s. - and nato - led military intervention in the conflict .

after serbian forces withdrew in 1999 , many members backed kosovo's independence .

today , many in congress continue to support kosovo through country - or region - specific hearings , congressional visits , and foreign assistance funding levels averaging around $50 million per year since 2015 .

looking ahead , members may consider how the united states can support the kosovo - serbia dialogue , kosovo's euro - atlantic ambitions , transitional justice processes , the ongoing political crisis arising from the march 2020 government collapse , and regional security .

current key issues in kosovo's domestic situation include the march 2020 collapse of the government ; responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic ; managing relations with the country's ethnic serb minority , particularly in northern kosovo ; and economic growth .

kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 with u.s. support .

serbia does not recognize kosovo and relies on russia in particular for diplomatic support .

many believe that the lack of normalized relations between kosovo and serbia impedes both countries' prosperity and progress toward eu membership and imperils western balkan stability .

the eu and nato have played key roles in kosovo ; these institutional relationships continue to evolve alongside kosovo's state - building processes .

the united states enjoys broad popularity in kosovo due to its support during the miloå¡eviä era , its leadership of nato's 1999 intervention in the kosovo war , its backing of kosovo's independence in 2008 , and its subsequent diplomatic support .

the united states supports kosovo's euro - atlantic ambitions .

kosovo regards the united states as a security guarantor and critical ally , and many believe the united states retains influence in domestic policymaking and politics .

the trump administration has signaled growing interest in securing a deal to resolve the kosovo - serbia dispute and stepping up u.s. engagement in the western balkans more broadly .

u.s. officials assert that the full normalization of kosovo - serbia relations is a "strategic priority. .

in august 2019 , u.s. secretary of state michael pompeo appointed deputy assistant secretary of state matthew palmer as his special representative for the western balkans .

shortly thereafter , president donald trump appointed u.s .

ambassador to germany ( now also acting director of national intelligence ) richard grenell as special presidential envoy for serbia and kosovo peace negotiations .

many officials in kosovo and serbia have welcomed the prospect of a greater u.s. role in efforts to normalize relations .

in january 2020 , u.s. officials announced two new kosovo - serbia agreements on transportation links , pursuant to a strategy that focuses on economic growth and job creation as foundations for the normalization process .

in march 2020 , the white house hosted informal talks between president thaã§i and president vuäiä .

u.s. efforts currently center on bringing the two parties back to negotiations .

as mentioned , u.s. officials criticized the reciprocity principles that acting prime minister kurti announced in april 2020 alongside the conditional lifting of tariffs .

the direct u.s. role in brokering the recent transportation agreements and greater u.s. involvement in efforts to normalize kosovo - serbia relations is largely a departure from the approach taken under previous administrations , which strongly supported eu - led efforts to normalize relations but did not play a formal , direct role .

news of the january 2020 u.s. - brokered agreements reportedly came as a surprise to some european officials , who in turn have underscored the eu's long - standing role in the normalization process and appointed an eu special representative for the dialogue .

some analysts , while welcoming greater u.s. involvement , assert that the united states is more effective in engaging the western balkans when its actions and positions are aligned with those of its european allies ; they contend that recent gaps between the united states and allies such as germany on the kosovo - serbia dialogue , as well as on the march 2020 no - confidence session , have undercut overall engagement efforts .

some observers and several members of congress have expressed concern over recent u.s. policies toward kosovo's government , such as pausing implementation of a $49 million millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) threshold program and delaying the development of its proposed compact program , until kosovo rescinds the tariffs .

some kosovo officials expressed dismay over what they describe as u.s. pressure on kosovo to lift tariffs against serbia without equivalent pressure on serbia to cease its campaign to undercut kosovo's international legitimacy .

on april 13 , 2020 , the chairman of the house committee on foreign affairs and the ranking member of the senate committee on foreign relations released a joint letter to secretary pompeo that welcomed greater u.s. diplomatic engagement in efforts to normalize relations between kosovo and serbia but expressed concern over what they described as "heavy - handed" treatment of the weeks - old kurti government .

they urged greater cooperation with the eu and restarting implementation of kosovo's mcc threshold program .

separately , acting prime minister kurti alleged that u.s. officials had aided efforts to unseat his government in the march 2020 no - confidence session in hopes that a more pliable government in pristina would quickly reach a deal with serbia .

u.s. officials have underscored that the united states is "committed to working with any government formed through the constitutional process" and rejected speculation that the united states was brokering a "secret plan for land swaps. .

the united states is a significant source of foreign assistance to kosovo ( see figure 2 ) .

u.s. assistance aims to support the implementation of agreements from the kosovo - serbia dialogue and to improve transparent and responsive governance , among other goals .

additional assistance is provided through a $49 million millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) threshold program that launched in 2017 , with focus on governance and energy efficiency and reliability .

threshold programs are intended to help countries become eligible to participate in a larger compact program ; in december 2018 and again in december 2019 , the mcc board determined that kosovo was eligible to participate in a compact .

as discussed above , mcc assistance is currently on hold .

the united states and kosovo cooperate to combat transnational threats and bolster security .

like elsewhere in the western balkans , kosovo is a transit country and in some cases a source country for trafficking in humans , contraband smuggling ( including illicit drugs ) , and other criminal activities .

observers consider kosovo to have a relatively strong legal framework to counter trafficking , smuggling , and other transborder crimes .

at the same time , the united states and the eu have urged officials in kosovo to better implement the country's domestic laws by more strenuously investigating , prosecuting , and convicting traffickers , as well as by improving victim support .

combatting terrorism and violent extremism is a core area of u.s. - kosovo security cooperation .

kosovo is a secular state with a moderate islamic tradition , but an estimated 400 kosovo citizens traveled to syria and iraq in the 2010s to support the islamic state amid the terrorist group's growing recruitment efforts .

as this policy challenge emerged , the united states assisted kosovo with tightening its legal framework to combat recruitment , foreign fighter travel , and terrorism financing , as well as strengthening its countering violent extremism strategy .

the united states provides support to kosovo law enforcement and judicial institutions to combat terrorism and extremism .

the state department's antiterrorism assistance program , for example , has provided training or capacity - building support for the kosovo police's counterterrorism directorate and for the border police .

kosovo and the united states agreed to an extradition treaty in march 2016 .

in april 2019 , the united states provided diplomatic and logistical support for the repatriation of about 110 kosovo citizens from syriaâprimarily women and childrenâwho had supported the islamic state or were born to parents who had .

some repatriated persons were indicted on terrorism - related charges .

kosovo has a sister - state relationship with iowa that grew out of a 2011 state partnership program ( spp ) between the iowa national guard and the kosovo security force .

that relationship has been hailed as a "textbook example" of the scope and aims of the spp .

congressional interest in kosovo predates yugoslavia's disintegration .

through resolutions , hearings , and congressional delegations , many members of congress highlighted the status of ethnic albanian minorities in yugoslavia , engaged in heated debates over intervention during the clinton administration , urged the george w. bush administration to back kosovo's independence , and supported continued financial assistance .

congressional interest and support continues .

in the 116 th congress , several hearings have addressed kosovo in part or in whole , including an april 2019 house foreign affairs committee hearing on kosovo's wartime victims and recent hearings on western balkan issues held by the senate armed services committee and the senate foreign relations committee's subcommittee on europe and regional security cooperation .

given kosovo's geography , history , and current challenges , the country also factors into wider u.s. foreign policy issues in which congress remains engaged .

such issues include transitional justice , corruption and the rule of law , combatting human trafficking and organized crime , u.s. foreign assistance , security in europe , and eu and nato enlargement .
