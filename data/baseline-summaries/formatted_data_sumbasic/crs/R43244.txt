since the 65 th congress ( 1917-1918 ) , the number of women serving in congress generally increased incrementally , and on a few occasions , decreased .

in an exception to these incremental changes , the elections in 1992 , which came to be known popularly as the "year of the woman," represented a jump in the number of women in congress .

as a result of this 1992 election , whereas the 102 nd congress ( 1991-1992 ) concluded with 34 women , on the first day of the 103 rd congress ( 1993-1994 ) , the number of women in congress increased 58.8% , to 54 women .

more recently , the 115 th congress concluded with 115 women , and on the first day of the 116 th congress , the number of women in congress increased 13.9% , to 131 women .

figure 1 shows the changes in the number of women serving in each congress .

approximately 30% of women senators entered the senate initially through an appointment .

of the 17 women who entered by appointment , 10 served less than one year .

since the ratification of the seventeenth amendment to the constitution in 1913 , nine years prior to the first appointment of a woman to fill a senate vacancy , 200 senators have been appointed .

of these appointees , 91.5% ( 183 ) have been men , and 8.5% ( 17 ) were women .

as the number of women in congress has increased in recent decades , and following the large increase in women following the 1992 elections in particular , numerous studies of congress have examined the role and impact of these women .

central to these studies have been questions about the following: the legislative behavior of women in congress , including whether the legislative behavior of female members differs from their male counterparts .

for example , what has the increase in women in congress meant for descriptive representation ( i.e. , when representatives and those represented share demographic characteristics , such as representation of women by women ) and substantive representation ( i.e. , representation of policy preferences and a linkage to policy outcomes ) ? .

this also includes examinations of whether women members sponsor more "women's issues bills" or speak more frequently on the house floor about women .

these examinations also include questions regarding whether there are any differences in roll call voting behavior between men and women members of congress , with a focus on successive members in the same district , in the same party , or in the chamber overall .

the "effectiveness" of female legislators , particularly in comparison to male legislators .

these studies have examined bill sponsorship and cosponsorship ; women's success in shepherding sponsored bills or amendments into law ; committee work ; success in securing federal funds ; consensus building activities and efforts to form coalitions ; effectiveness while in the majority and minority ; and their impact on the institution overall .

the path that leads women to run for office , comparative success rates of female compared with male candidates , and career trajectory once in congress .

this includes professional backgrounds and experience , barriers to entry , and fundraising ; the so - called widow effect , in which many women first secured entry to congress following the death of a spouse ; and reelection efforts and influences on decisions regarding voluntary retirement or pursuing other office .
