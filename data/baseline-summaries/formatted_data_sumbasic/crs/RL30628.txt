on october 18 , the senate agreed to the conference report ( h.rept .

106-948 ) on h.r .

4461 , the fy2001 agriculture appropriations bill , by a vote of 86-8 .

it was signedinto law october 28 ( p.l .

106-387 ) .

title ix of this bill allows the export of food and medicine tocuba and other countries against whom the united states has imposed economic sanctions forforeign policy purposes .

in the case of cuba , however , no u.s. assistance or financing may beprovided by any u.s. entity , public or private , for such sales .

 ( the president may waive theprohibition of u.s. assistance for commercial exports to iran , libya , north korea , or sudan fornational security or humanitarian reasons. ) .

sales of food and medicine to cuba may only be paidfor by cash in advance or through third country financing .

the bill also codified existing embargoregulations by prohibiting both the importation of merchandise from cuba and travel for tourismto cuba .

 ( for more , see sections on "travel restrictions" and on"food and medical exports"below. ) .

in the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 ( p.l .

106-386 ) , sections 2002 and 2003 direct the secretary of the treasury to pay compensatory damages for certain claimsagainst cuba ( and iran ) .

as provided for in this bill , president clinton waived such payments inthe interest of national security when he signed the bill into law on october 28 , 2000 .

with the cutoff of assistance from the former soviet union , cuba experienced severe economicdeterioration from 1989-1993 , although there has been some improvement since 1994 .

estimatesof economic decline in the 1989-93 period range from 35-50% .

the economy reportedly grew 0.7%in 1994 , 2.5% in 1995 , and 7.8% in 1996 .

while the cuban government originally was predictinga growth rate of 4-5% for 1997 , growth for the year was just 2.5% , largely because of disappointingsugar production .

for 1998 , the government's goal was for a growth rate of 2.5-3.5% , but anotherpoor sugar harvest , a severe drought in eastern cuba , and the effects of hurricane georges resultedin an estimated growth rate of just 1.2% .

in 1999 , the economy grew 6.2% , and a growth rate of 5%is projected for 2000 .

socialist cuba has prided itself on the nation's accomplishments in health and education .

for example , according to the world bank , the literacy rate is 94% and life expectancy is 76 years,compared to 79% and 68 years average for other middle - income developing countries .

the unitednations children's fund ( unicef ) reports that cuba's infant mortality rate ( per 1,000 live births ) was just 7.9 in 1996 , the lowest rate in latin america and among the world's top 20 countries forthis indicator .

nevertheless , the country's economic decline has reduced living standardsconsiderably and resulted in shortages in medicines and medical supplies .

when cuba's economic slide began in 1989 , the government showed little willingness to adopt any significant market - oriented economic reforms , but in 1993 , faced with unprecedented economicdecline , cuba began to change policy direction .

since 1993 , cubans have been allowed to own anduse u.s. dollars and to shop at dollar - only shops previously limited to tourists and diplomats .

self - employment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993 , most in the service sector,and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations .

other cuban economic reformsincluded breaking up large state farms into smaller , more autonomous , agricultural cooperatives ( basic units of cooperative production , ubpcs ) in 1993 ; opening agricultural markets in september1994 where farmers could sell part of their produce on the open market ; opening artisan markets inoctober 1994 for the sale of handicrafts ; allowing private food catering , including home restaurants ( paladares ) in june 1995 ( in effect legalizing activities that were already taking place ) ; approvinga new foreign investment law in september 1995 that allows fully owned investments by foreignersin all sectors of the economy with the exception of defense , health , and education ; and authorizingthe establishment of free trade zones with tariff reductions typical of such zones in june 1996 .

inmay 1997 , the government enacted legislation to reform the banking system and established a newcentral bank ( bcc ) to operate as an autonomous and independent entity .

despite these measures , the quality of life for many cubans remains difficult , characterized by low wages , high prices for many basic goods , shortages of medicines , and power outages .

moreover,some analysts fear that the government has begun to backtrack on its reform efforts .

regulationsand new taxes have made it extremely difficult for many of the nation's self - employed ( at one pointestimated at more than 200,000 , but now estimated at 160,000 or lower , out of a total labor force ofsome 4.5 million ) .

some home restaurants have been forced to close because of the regulations .

some foreign investors in cuba have also begun to complain that the government has backed out ofdeals or forced them out of business .

 ( 1 ) .

although cuba has undertaken some limited economic reforms , politically the country remainsa hard - line communist state .

fidel castro , who turned 73 on august 13 , 1999 , has ruled since the1959 cuban revolution , which ousted the corrupt government of fulgencio batista from power .

castro soon laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime by consolidating power and forcingmoderates out of the government .

in april 1961 , castro admitted that the cuban revolution wassocialist , and in december 1961 , he proclaimed himself to be a marxist - leninist .

from 1959 until1976 , castro ruled by decree .

a constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the communist party as the leading force in the state and in society ( with power centered in a politburo headed by fidel castro ) .

theconstitution also outlined national , provincial , and local governmental structures .

executive poweris vested in a council of ministers , headed by fidel castro as president .

legislative authority isvested in a national assembly of people's power , currently with 601 members , that meets twiceannually for brief periods .

while assembly members were directly elected for the first time infebruary 1993 , only a single slate of candidates was offered .

elections for the national assemblywere held for a second time in january 1998 .

voters again were not offered a choice of candidates.from october 8-10 , 1997 , the cuban communist party held its 5th congress ( the prior one was heldin 1991 ) in which the party reaffirmed its commitment to a single party state and reelected fidel andraul castro as the party's first and second secretaries .

pope john paul ii visited cuba from january 21-25 , 1998 , and conducted a series of open - air masses across the country that were televised in cuba .

numerous catholic groups from the unitedstates traveled to cuba for the pope's visit as did thousands of journalists from around the world .

while much of his visit was spent on pastoral issues , such as encouraging cubans to come back tothe church , the pope also made more political statements .

he criticized the u.s. embargo as "unjustand ethically unacceptable," but also criticized the cuban government for denying freedom to thecuban people .

he asked the government to release "prisoners of conscience," and vatican officialsgave cuba a list of more than 200 prisoners .

on february 12 , 1998 , the vatican announced that cubahad freed dozens of detainees , noting that this step represented a prospect of hope for the future .

there was much speculation about what effect the pope's trip to cuba might have on the political situation .

the trip did not spark unrest from those opposed to the regime , nor did thegovernment take any actions to loosen the tight political control of the state and party .

over thelonger - term , however , the pope's visit could result in elevating the profile of the catholic churchin such a way that it emerges as an important actor in cuba's civil society .

an enhanced profilecould improve its chances to influence the policies and actions of the government .
