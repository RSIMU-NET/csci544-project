from fy2006 through fy2010 , congress relied on the department of defense ( dod ) to fund small - scale security and stabilization activities carried out by the state department and usaid to prevent or stabilize conflict situations abroad .

the "section 1207" authority used for this funding expired at the end of fy2010 .

congress first provided dod with "section 1207" authority in 2005 .

section 1207 of the national defense authorization act [ndaa] for fiscal year 2006 , p.l .

109-163 , provided authority for dod to transfer to the state department up to $100 million in defense articles , services , training or other support in fy2006 and again in fy2007 to use for reconstruction , stabilization , and security activities in foreign countries .

this authority was first extended through fy2008 by section 1210 of the fy2008 ndaa ( p.l .

110-181 ) and again extended through fy2009 by section 1207 of the fy2009 duncan hunter ndaa ( p.l .

110-417 ) .

the fy2009 duncan hunter ndaa provided special authority for up to $50 million to be spent under section 1207 for georgia , in addition to the up to $100 million authorized for other countries .

congress extended the $100 million transfer authority for one last time , through fy2010 , in action on the fy2010 ndaa ( p.l .

111-84 ) .

section 1207 authority was used to fund activities of the state department's office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization ( s / crs , established in 2004 ) and activities implemented by other agencies that were coordinated by s / crs , including activities of usaid .

these funds have supported activities in 14 countries and in two regions .

 ( for further information on these countries and projects , see the text below and table 1 at the end of this report. ) .

according to a united states institute of peace ( usip ) report , section 1207 was introduced "in response to requests from defense secretary donald rumsfeld and secretary of state condoleezza rice to help jump start s / crs by providing authorization and funding for projects that would involve interagency coordination .

this action was taken in recognition of the fact that congress was unable to pass a state department authorization bill that would authorize s / crs to conduct a comparable program and "because of the perception that it was easier to obtain funding from congress" in the dod bill rather than the state department bill .

at the beginning , there was some confusion about the appropriate uses of section 1207 and questions about the desirability of funding state department activities through the dod budget .

hasc and sasc reports on the their respective versions of the fy2009 ndaa ( h.r .

5658 and s. 3001 ) both state separate concerns about section 1207 authority , reflecting a perceived need to clarify intended purposes and restate the original congressional intention that section 1207 was to be a temporary authority .

in its report accompanying s. 3001 ( s.rept .

110-335 , may 12 , 2008 ) , sasc stated that dod had "inappropriately restricted" the uses for which section 1207 services or funds can be provided to the state department .

pointing to the secretary of defense's april 15 , 2008 , testimony at a hasc hearing that section 1207 authority "is primarily for bringing civilian expertise to operate alongside or in place of our armed forces," sasc stated that the legislative intent of section 1207 authority was broader , and was meant "to enable the secretary of defense to support the provision by the secretary of state of reconstruction , security , or stabilization assistance to a foreign country. .

sasc further stated such assistance could include "providing early civilian resources to avert a crisis that could otherwise subsequently require u.s. military forces to assist or intervene. .

in may 2009 , dod seemed to reply to this statement in its fy2010 budget request summary justification document , in which it asserts that section 1207 funding is "for reconstruction , security , or stabilization assistance â€” primarily to put civilian professionals alongside warfighters , or to provide early civilian resources to avert crises that could require u.s. military forces to intervene. .

in its report accompanying h.r .

5658 ( h.rept .

110-652 , may 16 , 2008 ) , hasc stated that the committee "reaffirms that the resources provided under this authority are intended to meet immediate , short - term needs. .

the committee reiterated the concern that had been expressed in the conference report accompanying the original section 1207 legislation ( h.rept .

109-360 , december 15 , 2005 ) that dod should not provide long - term funding in order to enable the department of state to "fulfill its statutory requirements. .

this concern , according to h.rept .

110-652 , applied to both long - term development programs and to the broader security assistance initiatives "that would be better suited for traditional foreign military financing authorities. .

in addition to some members of congress , some outside analysts believe that section 1207 activities would have been better funded through the state department and / or usaid .

 ( dod has never requested that section 1207 be made permanent law , although it did , as mentioned above , request in 2008 that congress extend the authority for five fiscal years. ) .

while noting the utility of dod section 1207 funding , which enables the u.s. government "to meet critical needs and to take advantage of key opportunities," the usip report mentioned above urges that in the future congress appropriate such quick reaction funding to the state department .

"the dod could still participate in deciding on project proposals , but the money would be guaranteed and could be made available more quickly .

this would require coordinating the efforts of various congressional committees , but it would restore the traditional role of the dos [department of state] in funding u.s. foreign assistance. .

in action on the fy2010 defense authorization and appropriations acts , and the fy2010 state department , foreign operations , and related appropriations act , armed services authorizers , defense appropriators , and foreign operations appropriators expressed the sense that the state department should have responsibility for stabilization and reconstruction funding .

however , some attributed continued funding under dod to a lack of state department capacity to handle the funding .

conferees on the fy2010 ndaa stated that "congress has always intended for this transfer authority to be temporary and are disappointed that the department of state has not yet achieved the capacity to fulfill its statutory requirements .

the conferees urge the administration to work toward this goal as rapidly as possible .

they further recommend that the administration examine ways to maintain this coordination [between dod and state department] in the absence of this authority" ( h.rept .

111-288 , october 7 , 2009 ) .

similarly , in action on their versions of the fy2010 ndaa ( h.r .

2647 and s. 1390 ) , the house and senate armed services committees both stressed the temporary nature of section 1207 authority .

house armed services committee members wrote: "while the projects undertaken with funds provided by this authority are worthy , the committee is concerned that insufficient progress has been made in building the capacity within the department of state to assume the statutory and fiscal responsibility necessary to fulfill its statutory requirements... .

the committee stresses that it has always been a temporary authority and urges the administration to develop capacity within the department of state so that this transfer authority is no longer required" ( h.rept .

111-166 , p. 413 ) .

the senate armed services committee also "reaffirms its view that section 1207 is a temporary authority" ( s.rept .

111-35 , p. 193 ) .

foreign operations appropriators expressed similar sentiments .

in creating a new usaid complex crises fund , conferees on the state department , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations of the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( division f , p.l .

111-117 , signed into law december 16 , 2009 ) , urged the state department and usaid to develop additional capacity in order to replace section 1207 dod funding with additional funding complex crisis funding .

"usaid and the department of state should continue to establish and bolster crisis prevention and response capabilities in order to assume most , if not all , of the functions currently funded" by dod under section 1207 authority , they wrote .

however , the conferees also specified that "usaid and the departments of state and defense shall continue to consult on the formulation and implementation of stabilization and security assistance , as appropriate , whether through the utilization of section 1207 or funds appropriated by this act. .

earlier , in action on its version of the fy2010 state department , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations bill ( s. 1434 ) , the senate appropriations committee ( sac ) would have created a larger fund in the state department budget .

it stated that the purpose of the fund , to be used together with other funds in the bill , was to assist the state department's effort to "assume most if not all of the functions currently funded" by section 1207 ( s.rept .

111-44 , p. 46 ) .

further , the committee expressed its intention that dod and the state department "coordinate formulation and implementation of security and stabilization assistance , as appropriate , whether through the utilization of section 1207 or the new capabilities [that sac would have provided] within the department of state" ( s.rept .

111-44 , p. 47 ) .

in action on the fy2010 department of defense appropriations act ( p.l .

111-118 ) , defense appropriators also signaled that they did not expect to again provide dod funds for section 1207-type activities .

they did expect , however , that dod would remain involved in future planning for such activities even though they would be funded by other agencies .

in their report ( h.rept .

111-380 ) , conferees on the bill recommended an allocation of $97.09 million ( from the overall defense security cooperation agency appropriation ) to serve as a bridge fund while the complex crises fund was put in place .

that fund "will enable usaid and the department of sate to meet emergent requirements that fall under their purview without relying on the department of defense," the conferees wrote .

nevertheless , they directed the secretaries of defense and state and the director of usaid "to maintain and strengthen the interagency process created from the section 1207 program when formulating , reviewing , and approving future projects that would have been funded through section 1207. .
