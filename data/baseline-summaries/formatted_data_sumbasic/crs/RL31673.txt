the air force f - 22 fighter , also known as the raptor , is "the most capable fighter aircraft ever built , period. .

procurement of f - 22s began in fy1999 , and a total of 195 ( 177 production aircraft , 16 test aircraft , and 2 development aircraft ) were procured through fy2009 .

ongoing issues for congress regarding the f - 22 program include questions regarding the f - 22's supply of oxygen to its pilots , the possible resumption of production , the reliability and maintainability of in - service raptors , the f - 22 modernization program , and the potential sale of f - 22s to other countries .

congress's decisions on all these issues could affect department of defense ( dod ) capabilities and funding requirements , the u.s. tactical aircraft industrial base , and u.s. relations with other countries .

the administration's proposed fy2013 defense budget requests $283.9 million in fy2013 procurement funding for modification of in - service aircraft and $36.7 million to facilitize air logistics centers to perform f - 22 maintenance .

the administration's proposed fy2013 defense budget also requests a new start program , funded at $140.1 million in research and development , for the increment 3.2b software ; and $371.7 million in fy2013 research and development funding for f - 22a squadrons .

the house armed services committee , in its report ( h.rept .

112-479 of may 11 , 2012 ) accompanying h.r .

4310 , recommends authorizing the requested amounts for f - 22 without amendment .

the senate armed services committee , in its report ( s.rept .

112-173 of june 4 , 2012 ) on s. 3254 , recommends authorizing the requested amounts for f - 22 without amendment .

the report includes the following related provisions: treatment of certain programs for the f - 22a raptor aircraft as major defense acquisition program ( sec .

142 ) the committee recommends a provision that would require that the air force report f - 22a modernization and upgrade programs under the system of the selected acquisition reports ( sar ) .

the committee was informed that , with new production of the f - 22a coming to an end , the air force intends to stop reporting within the sar system on the f - 22a , despite the fact that there could be as much as $11.7 billion remaining to be spent on defined f - 22a upgrade programs .

the committee believes the category `major defense acquisition programs' is not limited only to programs that are acquiring brand new weapon systems , and that any f - 22a program for modifications or upgrades , if it would otherwise meet the statutory definition of a major defense acquisition program , should be treated that way .

the committee believes there is ample justification for continuing to track f - 22a modernization past the end of new production .

 ( 1 ) in april 2012 , the government accountability office ( gao ) issued a report on the program to modernize the f - 22a raptor fleet , estimated to cost almost $10.0 billion through 2023 .

in this report , gao noted that similar efforts to modernize air force and navy tactical fighters in the past involved building upgrades into newly produced jets , resulting in entirely new , fresh airplanes .

 ( 2 ) in another report , issued in may 2012 , gao found that the total projected cost to modernize the f - 22a raptor fighter jet more than doubled from $5.4 billion to $11.7 billion since the program started and the schedule for delivering full capabilities slipped 7 years from 2010 to 2017 .

 ( 3 ) upgrades to the f - 22a are much more complicated than those made to other legacy fighters , giving rise to likelihood of schedule slips and cost growth .

 ( 4 ) with these factors in mind , gao believes that many of the air force's f - 22a raptors may not get their long - promised capability upgrades until they will have , in some cases , expended as much as 20 percent of their service lives .

this could limit the amount of utility the air force will be able to extract from this enormously expensive modernization program .

f - 22a raptor sustainment in addition to the near - term modernization , sustainment over the life cycle of a weapon system represents a significant expenditure of resources .

on average , about two - thirds of the total life cycle cost of a major defense system lies in post - production — in its operation and sustainment over its useful life .

if that rule were to hold true , with a charge of roughly $79.0 billion to buy the f - 22a , the air force could be facing a demand for roughly $160.0 billion in f - 22a sustainment costs .

moreover , under its `structures retrofit program' , over the next few years the air force will need more than $100.0 million to retrofit the f - 22a fleet just to ensure these aircraft can fly for the full 8,000 hours for which they were designed .

over just the last 2 years , the air force issued sole - source contracts for sustainment of the f - 22a fleet to the prime contractor totaling almost $1.4 billion .

the air force recently completed an f - 22a sustainment strategy review that concluded that a joint contractor / government approach could save more than $1.0 billion in sustainment costs over the life of the aircraft .

the committee believes that the air force must transition its sustainment strategy to adopt the least expensive sustainment strategy now , while continuing to be aggressive in exploring opportunities to compete f - 22a sustainment work .

f - 22a raptor pilot air - supply problems the air force has been having problems with the oxygen - supply for its f - 22a raptor pilots .

the committee is aware of , and has been closely monitoring , these problems .

the air force has documented 11 reported incidents of hypoxia - like symptoms in 10,000 sorties ( about 0.1 percent ) since late 2011 , with 6 of these incidents having occurred as recently as february and march 2012 .

since reports of pilots experiencing hypoxia - like symptoms in flight first arose , the secretary of the air force , among other actions , directed the air force scientific advisory board ( sab ) to conduct a quick - look study ; gather and evaluate information ; and recommend any corrective actions on aircraft using on - board oxygen generation systems .

unfortunately , to date , the air force has not been able to identify conclusively a root cause for the problem .

but , the committee has been assured that the air force has put in place measures intended to ensure that these aircraft are safe to fly , including new commercial oxygen status sensors and emergency oxygen handles in the aircraft .

for this reason , after having grounded the fleet after initial reports of hypoxia - related symptoms in its pilots late last year , the air force returned the f - 22a to flying under its full mission envelope and , in fact , deployed it to southwest asia and the united arab emirates in late april .

despite that a small number of pilots have asked not to fly the f - 22a or to be reassigned because of this issue , air force leadership has conveyed to the committee that , while the air force continues to investigate this problem , these aircraft are safe to fly today .

notably , the navy had similar problems with f - 18s ; there were 64 incidents from 2002 to 2009 , resulting in 2 deaths .

ultimately , however , the navy overcame these problems .

the committee remains hopeful that the air force will be similarly successful .

in the meantime , the committee will continue to exercise close oversight of this problem and how the air force addresses it .

the committee directs the secretary of the air force to explain , no later than 90 days after enactment of this act , how the air force has implemented or will implement each of the recommendations provided by the sab .

if the secretary disagrees with any of these recommendations , he should explain why and describe what other corrective actions he may be taking to respond to the concern underlying that recommendation .

finally , as the air force continues to investigate this matter , the committee will view as unacceptable any act of retaliation against any f - 22a raptor pilot who raises concerns about the safety of this aircraft or declines to fly it on that basis .

in its report ( h.rept .

112-493 of may 25 , 2012 ) on h.r .

5856 , the house appropriations committee recommends authorizing $333.9 million in fy2013 for modification of in - service f - 22s , an increase of $50.0 million from the administration's request .

the committee's report states: f – 22 backup oxygen system the committee is concerned by the continuing problems with hypoxia - type events involving the f – 22 and the air force's inability to determine a remediable root cause for this problem .

as the military's only operational fifth generation fighter , the f – 22 is critical to the implementation of the national defense strategy .

due to the small size of the f – 22 fleet , and the utmost importance of preserving the safety and readiness of f – 22 pilots , the committee strongly supports air force efforts to address this problem .

the committee understands that the air force is in the final stages of selecting a design for an automated backup oxygen system as a mitigation measure .

the committee's recommendation therefore includes $50,000,000 only for the procurement and installation of a backup oxygen system for the f – 22 .

the committee further directs the air force to provide regular updates to the committee on physiological events involving f – 22 pilots , impacts on flight operations , and the progress of efforts to discover and implement solutions .

section 8057 would prohibit the use of funds made available in the bill from being used to approve or license the sale of the f - 22 to any foreign government .

this is the so - called obey amendment on the f - 22 program that has been included in annual dod appropriation acts since fy1998 .

the senate appropriations committee , in its report ( s.rept .

112-196 of august 2 , 2012 ) on h.r .

5856 , recommends a $4.4 million addition to the administration's request for fy2013 procurement funding for the modification of in - service f - 22s .

the recommended $4.4 million addition includes a recommended reduction of $17.5 million for "engine modifications – excessive cost growth," and a recommended addition of $21.5 million for "backup oxygen system. .

 ( page 145 , line 39 ) the committee included the following language regarding oxygen systems: f – 22 automatic backup oxygen system [abos] . — the fiscal year 2013 budget request includes no funds for the f – 22 abos .

the committee notes that following submission of the fiscal year 2013 budget request , the air force was directed by the secretary of defense to take additional measures to ensure the health and safety of the airmen and maintainers operating the f – 22 , to include expediting the installation of an automatic backup oxygen system .

the committee understands that the fiscal year 2013 funding requirement for the procurement of abos is $21,500,000 and that the air force intends to defer other , previously funded critical reliability improvements to the f – 22 in order to accelerate the procurement and installation of abos .

the committee does not agree with this strategy and recommends an additional $21,500,000 in fiscal year 2013 to execute the accelerated abos schedule without negatively impacting other reliability projects .

section 8038 of h.r .

5856 , as reported by the committee , would retain and modify the annual provision regarding foreign sales of the f - 22 .

the text of the provision as reported by the committee is as follows: sec .

8038 .

none of the funds made available in this act may be used to approve or license the sale of the f - 22a advanced tactical fighter to any foreign government: provided , that the department of defense may conduct or participate in studies , research , design and other activities to develop a future export version of the f - 22a that protects classified and sensitive information , technologies and u.s. warfighting capabilities .
