under the constitution , the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states .

almost all of the highest - level political appointee positions in the federal government are filled by these officers .

three distinct stages mark the appointment process — selection and nomination by the president , consideration of the nomination by the senate , and , if the nominee is confirmed , official appointment by the president .

during the confirmation process in the senate , a nomination is usually first referred to one ( or sometimes more than one ) committee .

if the committee or committees report the nomination to the full senate , or are discharged from further consideration of the nomination , it is placed on the senate's executive calendar and may be called up for floor consideration .

the following pages briefly describe the referral process and identify , for each committee to which referrals have been made , the positions that fall within the committee's jurisdiction .
