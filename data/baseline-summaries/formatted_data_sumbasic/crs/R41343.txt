112-8 — on april 15 , 2011 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ) , was enacted into law .

p.l .

112-10 provides $48.6 billion for vha , a 7.8 % increase over the fy2010-enacted amount of $45.1 billion and 0.3% less than the president's request of $48.8 billion for fy2011 ( table 1 ) .

moreover , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 , provides an advance appropriation of $50.6 billion for medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities accounts to be available in fy2012 .

this is the same as the administration's request for the same three accounts ( table 1 ) .

the remainder of this report is structured into three major areas .

the first area of the report includes sections providing an overview of the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the va health care system , eligibility for va health care , and a description of the veteran patient population .

the second area includes sections describing the formulation of the veterans health administration ( vha ) budget , funding for the vha , the fy2010 budget summary , and the fy2011 vha budget .

the third area of the report discusses major areas of congressional interest as they pertain to the fy2011 budget .

the history of the present day va can be traced back to july 21 , 1930 , when president hoover issued executive order 5398 consolidating separate veterans' programs and creating an independent federal agency known as the veterans administration .

on october 25 , 1988 , president reagan signed legislation ( p.l .

100-527 ) creating a new federal cabinet - level department of veterans affairs to replace the veterans administration effective march 15 , 1989 .

the va provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules including hospital and medical care , disability compensation and pensions , education , vocational rehabilitation and employment services , assistance to homeless veterans , home loan guarantees , administration of life insurance as well as traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers , and death benefits that cover burial expenses .

the department carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals ( bva ) .

the veterans health administration ( vha ) is responsible for health care services and medical and prosthetic research programs .

the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) is responsible for , among other things , providing compensations , pensions , and education assistance .

the national cemetery administration ( nca ) is responsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries ; providing grants to states for establishing , expanding , or improving state veterans cemeteries ; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons , among other things .

the va has also announced that it has begun the process of transforming itself "into a 21 st - century organization. .

the department has established six high priority performance goals to support this transformation: ( 1 ) reducing the disability claims backlog ; ( 2 ) eliminating veteran homelessness ; ( 3 ) automating the gi bill benefit system ; ( 4 ) establishing a virtual lifetime electronic record ( vler ) ; ( 5 ) improving mental health care ; and ( 6 ) deploying a veterans relationship management system .

the va's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts .

mandatory funding supports disability compensation , pension benefits , education , vocational rehabilitation , and life insurance , among other benefits and services .

discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services including medical care .

figure 1 provides a breakdown of fy2010 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary programs .

in fy2010 the total va budget authority was approximately $110 billion ; discretionary budget authority accounted for about 48.3% ( $53.0 billion ) of the total , with about 85% of this discretionary funding going toward supporting va health care programs including medical research .

for details on vha appropriations from fy2005 through fy2010 , see appendix e .

the veterans health administration ( vha ) operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system .

while medicare , medicaid , and the children's health insurance program ( chip ) are also publicly funded programs , most health care services under these programs are delivered by private providers in private facilities .

in contrast , the va health care system could be categorized as a veteran - specific national health care system , in the sense that the federal government owns the medical facilities and employs the health care providers .

the va's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined veterans integrated service networks ( visns ) ( see figure 2 ) .

although policies and guidelines are developed at va headquarters to be applied throughout the va health care system , management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the visns .

as of fy2010 , vha operates 153 hospitals ( medical centers ) , 135 nursing homes , 783 community - based outpatient clinics ( cbocs ) , 6 independent outpatient clinics , and 299 readjustment counseling centers ( vet centers ) .

in 2009 , va began a pilot mobile vet center ( mvc ) program to improve access to services for veterans in rural areas , and the department has deployed 50 mvcs .

vha also operates 10 mobile outpatient clinics .

congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to the visns based on the veterans equitable resource allocation ( vera ) system , which generally bases funding on patient workload .

visns , in turn , allocate funds to the medical centers within their networks .

prior to the implementation of the vera system , resources were allocated to facilities based primarily on their historical expenditures .

while a thorough description of vera is beyond the scope of this report , generally vera has two types of funds known as general purpose funds and specific purpose funds .

general purpose funds encompass about 80% of vha total budget allocations to the visns .

the department generally allocates 94% of the congressional appropriation to the 21 visns within the first 45 days after enactment of the appropriation bill , with another 3% distributed within 90 days of enactment , and the remainder going to the visns over the remaining months of the fiscal year .

general purpose funds are comprised of 11 elements .

these elements include basic care ; complex care ; adjustments for long stay patients ; adjustments for high cost patients ; geographic price adjustments ; research support ; education support ; equipment ; non - recurring maintenance ; priority group 8 expansion ; and mental health initiatives .

prior to fy2010 , mental health initiatives were funded through the specific purpose fund .

beginning with fy2010 budget funding previously associated with the mental health initiatives , and funded through the specific purpose fund , has been incorporated into the overall mental health funding amount , and is now funded through the general purpose fund .

table 2 provides vera general purpose fund allocations for the 21 networks in fy2010 .

it should be noted that vera funding is not driven by veteran patient population alone , but is adjusted for differences in patient mix , high cost patients , and geographic costs , among other factors .

under vera each network is provided an allocation that takes into account these unique characteristics and is also adjusted to account for those veterans who receive care in more than one network .

the specific purpose funds are given to the 21 visns during the fiscal year for specific activities including funding for prosthetics , state veterans nursing home per diems , clinical trainee salaries , readjustment counseling , homeless grant and per diem program , preventive and primary care transformation initiatives , and other specific purpose allocations to the program offices such as the foreign medical program which reimburses certain medical expenses of those veterans traveling abroad .

the vha pays for care provided to veterans by private - sector providers on a fee basis under certain circumstances .

this program pays non - va health care providers to treat eligible veterans when medical services are not available at va medical facilities or in emergencies when delays are hazardous to life or health .

fee basis care includes inpatient , outpatient , prescription medication , and long - term care services .

inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the civilian health and medical program of the department of veterans affairs ( champva ) .

the vha also provides grants for construction of state - owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities and collaborates with the department of defense ( dod ) in sharing health care resources and services .

apart from providing direct patient care to veterans , vha's other statutory missions are to conduct medical research , to serve as a contingency backup to the department of defense ( dod ) medical system during a national security emergency , to provide support to the national disaster medical system and the department of health and human services as necessary , and to train health care professionals in order to provide an adequate supply of health personnel for va and the nation .

in fy2010 approximately 8.4 million of the 23.1 million living veterans in the nation were enrolled in the va health care system ( table 3 ) .

from fy2007 through fy2010 the total number of enrollees has increased by 7.7% .

of the total number of enrolled veterans in fy2010 , va anticipated treating approximately 5.5 million unique veteran patients .

for fy2011 , vha estimates that it will treat about 5.6 million unique veteran patients ( table 4 ) , and of these va anticipates treating more than 439,000 operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) veterans , an increase of over 20,000 ( or 5% ) above the fy2010 level .

in fy2011 , oef and oif patients would represent 7.2% of the overall va patients served .

vha also provides medical care to certain non - veterans ; this population is expected to increase by over 11,000 patients or 2.2 % over the fy2010 level .

in total , including non - veterans , vha is to treat nearly 6.1 million patients in 2011 , an increase of 2.9 % over the number of patients treated in fy2010 ( table 4 ) .

between fy2007 and fy2010 , the number of patients treated by va has grown by 10% ( table 4 ) .

the total number of outpatient visits , including visits to vet centers , reached 74.6 million during fy2009 and is projected to increase to approximately 78.5 million in fy2010 and 82.7 million in fy2011 .

vha estimates that in fy2010 it will spend approximately 57.8% of its medical services account obligations on outpatient care .

historically , the major determinant of vha's budget size and character was the number of operating beds — which was controlled by congress .

the preliminary budget estimate , to a large extent , was based on the funding and activity of the previous year .

vha developed system - wide workload estimates , by type of care , by forecasts submitted by field stations .

unit costs were derived from the field stations' reports of the estimated distribution of expenses by type of care .

costs associated with new programs were estimated by va central office and added to the budget estimate .

the costs associated with staffing improvements , pay increases and inflation were also added to this estimate .

therefore , it could be stated that the principal assumption at each phase of the budget formulation process was that the preceding year's budget was the starting point .

in 1996 , congress enacted the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development and independent agencies appropriations act of 1997 ( p.l .

104-204 ) .

this act required vha to develop a plan for the allocation of health care resources to ensure that veterans eligible for medical care who have similar economic status and eligibility priority have similar access to such care , regardless of where they reside .

the plan was to "account for forecasts in expected workload and to ensure fairness to facilities that provide cost - efficient health care. .

in response to the above - mentioned congressional mandate , as well as the mandate in the health care eligibility reform act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-262 ) that required the vha to establish a priority - based enrollment system , vha established the enrollee health care projection model in 1998 .

the vha's the enrollee health care projection model ( ehcpm ) , which has evolved over time , develops estimates of future veteran enrollment , enrollees' expected utilization of health care services , and the costs associated with that utilization .

these 20-year projections are by fiscal year , enrollment priority , age , veterans integrated service networks ( visn ) , market , and facility .

the vha budget is formulated using the model projections .

vha's budget request to congress begins with the formulations of the budget based on the ehcpm to estimate the demand for medical services among veterans in future years .

these estimates are then used to develop a budget request that is then included with the total va budget request to congress .

the vha is funded through multiple appropriations accounts that are supplemented by other sources of revenue .

although the appropriations account structure has been subject to change from year to year , the appropriation accounts used to support the vha traditionally include medical care , medical and prosthetic research , and medical administration .

in addition , congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities through a larger appropriations account for construction for all va facilities .

in fy2004 , "to provide better oversight and [to] receive a more accurate accounting of funds," congress changed the vha's appropriations structure .

the department of veterans affairs and housing and urban development and independent agencies appropriations act , 2004 ( p.l .

108-199 , h.rept .

108-401 ) , funded vha through four accounts: ( 1 ) medical services , ( 2 ) medical administration ( currently known as medical support and compliance ) , ( 3 ) medical facilities , and ( 4 ) medical and prosthetic research .

provided below are brief descriptions of these accounts .

on february 26 , 2009 , the president submitted a preliminary budget outline for fy2010 , and submitted his full fy2010 budget proposal to congress on may 7 , 2009 .

the administration requested a total of $45.1 billion for vha ( excluding collections ) .

this was a 7.5% increase over the fy2009 enacted level .

including total available resources ( including medical care collections ) , the president's budget would have provided approximately $48 billion for vha .

on july 10 , the house passed its version of the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations act , 2010 ( h.r .

3082 , h.rept .

111-188 ) .

the house - passed bill provided a total of $45.1 billion for vha .

h.r .

3082 also provided $48.2 billion in advance appropriations for vha to be available in fy2011 .

on november 17 , the senate passed h.r .

3082 as amended .

h.r .

3082 as amended by the senate provided a total of $45.2 billion for vha , a $160.0 million increase over the house passed amount , and $157.6 million over the president's request .

the consolidated appropriations act was signed into law on december 16 , 2009 ( p.l .

111-117 , h.rept .

111-366 ) .

division e of the consolidated appropriations act 2010 included a compromised version of the house and senate passed versions of military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act , 2010 .

the consolidated appropriations act provided a total of $45.1 billion for vha , same as the administration's request for fy2010 , and 7.4% over the fy2009 enacted amount .

p.l .

111-117 included an advance appropriation of $48.2 billion for the medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities accounts to be available in fy2011 .

it has been reported that "many severely injured service members depend on family members for daily caregiving. .

according to the 2007 report of the president's commission on care for america's returning wounded warriors , of a random sample of 1,730 oef and oif veterans , 21% of active - component , 15% of reserve - component , and 24% of retired service members had a family member or friend who had been forced to leave a job to care for an oif or oef veteran full - time .

in response to these findings , and testimony from family members , congress enacted the caregivers and veterans omnibus health services act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-163 ) .

among other things , this law would establish a program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers of any veteran who is undergoing medical discharge from the armed forces , has a serious injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on or after september 11 , 2001 , and is in need of personal care services .

according to the house and senate appropriations committee reports to accompany the fy2011 milcon - va appropriations bills , funding has been included to implement the caregiver provisions in p.l .

111-163 for eligible veterans .

since 2001 , more than 2.1 million u.s. troops have deployed in support of operations enduring freedom ( oef ) and iraqi freedom ( oif ) .

of this number , around 1.1 million oef and oif veterans have left active duty and become eligible for va health care , and 47.4% of separated oef and oif veterans have sought va health care .

while the majority of these veterans function well , according to some studies , approximately 10% - 20% evidence psychological difficulties significant enough to warrant treatment .

while posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) has received the most publicized attention to date , service in oef and oif is also associated with generalized anxiety , depression , substance abuse , physical health problems , aggression , risk - taking behavior , and suicide .

providing adequate resources to treat mental health conditions of veterans is a major area of interest for congress .

for example , in its view and estimates letter to the house budget committee , the house committee on veterans' affairs states: [the] committee acknowledges the va's robust investments in mental health ; however , addressing mental health issues continues to be a challenge .

this is evidenced by the rising rates of suicide , incarceration , and homelessness among our veterans .

the committee believes that the va must not only expand existing efforts but also must explore new evidence - based initiatives with a proven track record for yielding positive program results .

in fy2010 vha's budget for mental health care is estimated to be $4.8 billion , and it is estimated to reach $5.2 billion in fy2011 ( table 7 ) .

vha has also increased the number of mental health providers by over 6,000 full - time equivalent ( fte ) in its system from fy2008 through fy2010 ( table 7 ) .

since january 17 , 2003 , the va has not enrolled veterans in priority group 8 unless they had been previously enrolled in another priority group and no longer qualified for enrollment in that previous priority group ( see appendix a ) .

since the suspension was promulgated , veterans advocates have urged congress to lift the suspension on priority group 8 veterans since they believe that all veterans must be able to receive care from the va because they have served their country .

the veterans health care eligibility reform act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-262 ) included language that stipulated that medical care to veterans will be furnished to the extent appropriations were made available by congress on an annual basis .

based on this statutory authority , the secretary of veterans affairs announced on january 17 , 2003 , that va would temporarily suspend enrolling priority group 8 veterans .

those who enrolled prior to january 17 , 2003 , in va's health care system were not to be affected by this suspension .

va claimed that , despite its funding increases , it could not provide all enrolled veterans with timely access to medical services because of the increase in the number of veterans seeking care from va .

the consolidated security , disaster assistance , and continuing appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

110-329 ) was enacted on september 30 , 2008 .

the accompanying report language stated that funding "has been provided within the medical services ; medical support and compliance ; medical facilities ; construction , minor projects ; and information technology systems accounts to support increased enrollment for priority 8 veterans whose income exceeds the current veterans means test and geographic means test income thresholds by 10% or less. .

p.l .

110-329 provided $375 million for fy2009 to fund this increased enrollment .

on january 21 , 2009 , va issued regulations indicating that it plans to enroll an estimated 258,705 new priority group 8 veterans .

va began enrolling new veterans starting june 15 , 2009 .

according to vha , it is estimated that 193,000 veterans will enroll for care by the end of 2010 due to this policy change .

va has stated that in 2011 va will further expand health care eligibility for priority group 8 veterans to those whose incomes exceed the geographic and va means - test thresholds by no more than 15% compared to the levels in effect prior to expanding enrollment in 2009 .

it is estimated that this additional expansion of eligibility for care will result in 99,000 more enrollees in 2011 , bringing the total number of new enrollees from 2009 to the end of 2011 to 292,000 .

the president's budget request for fy2011estimates that by fy2013 nearly 550,000 eligible priority group 8 veterans will be enrolled into the va health care system .

appendix a. va priority groups and their eligibility criteria appendix b. copayments for health care services: 2010 oef / oif / ond combat veterans enhanced eligibility for health care benefits: combat veterans discharged from active duty on or after january 28 , 2003 , are eligible for enrollment in priority group 6 for five years following discharge unless eligible for a higher enrollment priority .

combat veterans discharged from active duty before january 28 , 2003 , who applied for enrollment on or after january 28 , 2008 , were eligible for enrollment in priority group 6 until january 27 , 2011 .

after the special eligibility period ends , these veterans will be reassigned to the appropriate priority group and will be subject to copayments if applicable .

copayments are applicable for priority group 6 combat veteran enrollees for care related to a condition that is congenital or developmental ( eg , scoliosis ) that existed before military service ( unless aggravated by combat service ) or has a specific etiology that began after military service , such as a common cold , etc .
