heads of state and government from nato's 30 member states met in london , united kingdom ( uk ) , on december 3-4 , 2019 .

nato and u.s. officials highlighted the following key deliverables from the london leaders' meeting: completion of a new readiness initiative , under which the alliance would have at its disposal 30 mechanized battalions , 30 air squadrons , and 30 naval combat vessels ready to use within 30 days .

agreement to assess china's impact on nato and transatlantic security .

initiation of a new "forward - looking reflection process â¦ to further strengthen nato's political dimension including consultation. .

more broadly , nato officials sought to highlight nato's achievements and the importance of strong u.s. - european relations to these efforts .

the united states was the driving proponent of nato's creation in 1949 and has been the unquestioned leader of the alliance as it has evolved from a collective defense organization of 12 members focused on deterring the soviet union to a globally engaged security organization of 30 members .

successive u.s .

administrations have viewed u.s. leadership of nato as a cornerstone of u.s. national security strategy that brings benefits ranging from peace and stability in europe to the political and military support of 28 allies , including many of the world's most advanced militaries .

the london meeting came at a tense time for nato , however .

some european allies question the trump administration's commitment to nato and have criticized the administration for a perceived unilateral approach to foreign policy issues , including the october 2019 drawdown of u.s. forces from syria .

many allies also have criticized fellow nato member turkey for its military operations in syria and its acquisition of a russian - made air defense system .

nato secretary general jens stoltenberg acknowledges ongoing tensions within the alliance but stresses that continued transatlantic cooperation has enabled nato to be more active today than it has been in decades .

trump administration officials maintain that the united states remains committed to nato , and in london , president trump stressed that nato "has a great purpose. .

u.s. officials also highlight the administration's successful efforts in 2017 and 2018 to substantially increase funding for the u.s. force presence in europe and note that secretary general stoltenberg has credited president trump with playing a role in securing defense spending increases across the alliance in recent years .

critics of the trump administration's nato policy maintain that renewed russian aggression has been a key factor behind such increases .

at the london meeting , nato leaders stressed their commitment to advancing existing readiness and deterrence initiatives and to confronting emerging security challenges , including by declaring space as an operational domain for nato .

the allies also reinforced their commitment to nato's ongoing mission in afghanistan and other counterterrorism efforts and discussed the implications for nato of china's growing investment in , and engagement with , europe .

deliberations in london drew attention to heightened tension and divergent views within the alliance on a range of issues , including u.s. policy toward nato and europe , turkey's standing as a member of the alliance , eu security and defense policy , and nato's relations with russia .

disagreement within the alliance on whether and how to respond to these and other issues has prompted some , including french president emmanuel macron , to question nato's strategic direction and future .

many officials and analysts on both sides of the atlantic also have suggested that president trump's vocal criticism of nato and the lack of transatlantic coordination on policies related to syria and afghanistan have seriously undermined the alliance .

secretary general stoltenberg and others maintain that disagreement among allies is not a new phenomenon and stress that "europe and north american are doing more together in nato today than we have for decades. .

in an apparent effort to address diverging views within nato , in london , the allies agreed to initiate a "forward - looking reflection process â¦ to further strengthen nato's political dimension including consultation. .

on march 31 , 2020 , secretary general stoltenberg announced the appointment of a group of 10 experts tasked with recommending ways to "reinforce alliance unity , increase political consultation and coordination between allies , and strengthen nato's political role .

the group will be cochaired by former u.s. assistant secretary of state wess mitchell and former german interior and defense minister thomas de maziã¨re .

congress was instrumental in creating nato in 1949 and has played a critical role in shaping u.s. policy toward the alliance ever since .

although many members of congress have criticized specific developments within natoâregarding burden - sharing , for exampleâcongress as a whole has consistently demonstrated strong support for active u.s. leadership of and support for nato .

congressional support for nato traditionally has buttressed broader u.s. policy toward the alliance .

during the trump administration , however , demonstrations of congressional support for nato have at times been viewed primarily as an effort to reassure allies about the u.s. commitment to nato after president trump's criticisms of the alliance .

for example , during the trump administration , both chambers of congress have passed legislation expressly reaffirming u.s. support for nato at times when some allies have questioned the president's commitment .

some analysts portrayed house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's joint invitation to secretary general stoltenberg to address a joint session of congress on april 3 , 2019 , in commemoration of nato's 70 th anniversary as an additional demonstration of nato's importance to congress .

although congress has expressed consistent support for nato and its cornerstone article 5 mutual defense commitment , congressional hearings on nato in the 115 th and 116 th congresses have reflected disagreement regarding president trump's impact on the alliance .

some in congress argue that president trump's criticism of allied defense spending levels has spurred recent defense spending increases by nato members that were not forthcoming under prior administrations , despite long - standing u.s. concern .

other members of congress counter that president trump's admonition of u.s. allies and his questioning of nato's utility have damaged essential relationships and undermined nato's credibility and cohesion .

they contend that doubts about the u.s. commitment to the alliance could embolden adversaries , including russia , and ultimately weaken other allies' commitment to nato .

critics also have lamented the administration's reported lack of coordination with its allies on policies that have significant security ramifications for europe , such as countering the islamic state in syria .

despite disagreement over president trump's impact on the alliance , most members of congress continue to express support for robust u.s. leadership of nato , in particular to address potential threats posed by russia .

many members have called for enhanced nato and u.s. military responses to russian aggression in ukraine , and others have advocated stronger european contributions to collective defense measures in europe .

increasingly , some members of congress have questioned whether nato should take formal action against an ally , such as turkey , which pursues foreign and defense policies that they believe could threaten alliance security .

in light of these considerations , members of congress could focus on several key questions regarding nato's future , including the following: addressing the strategic value of nato to the united states and the united states' leadership role within nato ; examining whether the alliance should adopt a new strategic concept that better reflects views of the security threat posed by russia and new and emerging threats in the cyber and hybrid warfare domains ( nato's current strategic concept was adopted in 2010 ) ; examining nato's capacity and willingness to address other security threats to the euro - atlantic region , including from the mena region , posed by challenges such as terrorism and migration ; examining the possible consequences of member states' failure to meet agreed defense spending targets ; assessing u.s. force posture in europe and the willingness of european allies to contribute to nato deterrence efforts and u.s. defense initiatives in europe , such as the ballistic missile defense program and edi ; examining options to sanction allies that act in ways that jeopardize allied security ; revisiting the allies' commitment to nato's stated "open door" policy on enlargement , especially with respect to the membership aspirations of georgia and ukraine ; and developing a nato strategy toward china , particularly given u.s. and other allies' concerns about the security ramifications of increased chinese investment in europe .
