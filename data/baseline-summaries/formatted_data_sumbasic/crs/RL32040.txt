federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes ( mandatory minimums ) demand that execution or incarceration follow criminal conviction .

among other things , they cover drug dealing , murdering federal officials , and using a gun to commit a federal crime .

they have been a feature of federal sentencing since the dawn of the republic .

they circumscribe judicial sentencing discretion , although they impose few limitations upon prosecutorial discretion , or upon the president's power to pardon .

they have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with a rational sentencing guideline system ; yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in sentencing and a certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous .

this is a brief overview of federal statutes in the area and a discussion of some of the constitutional challenges they have faced .

defendants sentenced to mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment have challenged them on a number of constitutional grounds beginning with congress's legislative authority and ranging from cruel and unusual punishment through ex post facto and double jeopardy to equal protection and due process .

each constitutional provision defines outer boundaries that a mandatory minimum must be crafted to honor ; none confine legislative prerogatives in any substantial way .

federal law regulates the cultivation , manufacture , distribution , export , import , and possession of certain plants , drugs , and chemicals , which it designates as controlled substances and classifies according to medicinal value and potential for abuse under the controlled substances act and the controlled substances import and export act .

the acts contain a number of mandatory minimum penalty provisions .

most involve possession with the intent to distribute ( traffic ) substantial amounts of eight controlled substances which are considered highly susceptible to abuse .

the mandatory minimums are structured so that more severe sentences attend cases involving very substantial quantities , death or serious bodily injury , or repeat offenders .

the penalties of the underlying offense apply to anyone who attempts or conspires to commit any controlled substance offense that carries a mandatory minimum .

the eight trigger substances are heroin , powder cocaine , cocaine base ( crack ) , pcp , lsd , propanamide , methamphetamine , and marijuana .

each comes with one set of mandatory minimums for trafficking a substantial amount and a second , high set of mandatory minimums for ten times that amount .

the first set ( 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( b ) levels ) has the following thresholds: heroin - 100 grams ; powder cocaine - 500 grams ; crack - 28 grams ; pcp - 100 grams ; lsd - 1 gram ; propanamide - 40 grams ; methamphetamine - 5 grams ; marijuana - 100 kilograms .

the second set ( 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( a ) levels ) : heroin - 1 kilogram ; powder cocaine – 5 kilograms ; crack - 280 grams ; pcp - 100 grams ; lsd - 10 grams ; propanamide - 400 grams ; methamphetamine - 50 grams ; marijuana – 1,000 kilograms .

in addition to the volume mandatory minimums for these eight , trafficking in lesser amounts of those substances , or in other schedule i or schedule ii controlled substances , or in various "date rape" drugs carries mandatory minimums if the business results in death or serious bodily injury .

severe mandatory minimum penalties also follow conviction under the continuing criminal enterprise ( "drug kingpin" ) section .

section 848 ( c ) defines a continuing criminal enterprise as one in which an individual derives substantial income from directing five or more others in the commission of various controlled substance felonies .

the offense itself carries a term of imprisonment of not less than 20 years and may be increased to not more than 30 years for repeat offenders .

furthermore , anyone who kills in furtherance of the enterprise is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 20 years and may be put to death .

large scale drug kingpins who traffic in vast amounts of any of the eight 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) substances or who realize vast fortunes from such trafficking receive a mandatory life term of imprisonment upon conviction .

narco - terrorists who traffic in the threshold amounts of the eight 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) substances are punishable by imprisonment for not less than twice the mandatory minimum that would otherwise apply .

as reflected in the chart below , less stringent mandatory minimum sentences await repeat offenders convicted of simple possession and those who traffic controlled substances , not otherwise accompanied by mandatory minimums , to pregnant women , children , or in proximity of a school , playground or other prohibited location .

congress increased the number of federal sex offenses and their attendant mandatory minimum sentences beginning in 1978 with the enactment of the first federal child pornography statutes .

it filled out the complement of federal sex offenses with mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment at fairly regular intervals thereafter .

the current array includes .

aggravated identity theft is punishable by imprisonment for two years , and by imprisonment for five years if the offense involves a federal crime of terrorism .

aggravated identity theft only occurs when the identity theft happens "during and in relation" to one of several other federal crimes .

it has the effect of establishing a mandatory minimum for each of those predicate offenses that would not otherwise exist .

more than half of the judges who responded to a united states sentencing commission survey felt that the two - year mandatory minimum was a generally appropriate sentence .

the sentencing commission's report on mandatory minimum penalties makes little if any mention of the five - year terrorism penalty and instead directs its attention to the two - year identity theft mandatory minimum .

the commission further confines itself to comparatively complimentary observations rather than recommendations , due to the provision's relatively recent emergence and its somewhat unique characteristics .

section 1028a , parsed to its elements , declares: - whoever - during and in relation to - any felony enumerated in — subsection ( c ) [predicate offense] , [or] — section 2332b ( g ) ( 5 ) ( b ) [predicate terrorist offense] - knowingly - transfers , possesses , or uses - without lawful authority - a means of identification - of another person shall , in addition to the punishment provided for such [predicate offense or predicate terrorist offense] , be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years [or a term of imprisonment of 5 years in the case of terrorist predicate offense] .

a defendant convicted of a federal "serious violent felony" must be sentenced to life imprisonment under the so - called three strikes law , 18 u.s.c .

3559 ( c ) , if he has two prior state or federal violent felony convictions or one such conviction and a serious drug offense conviction .

over 60% of the federal district court judges responding to the sentencing commission survey indicated they considered federal mandatory minimum sentences too high .

although the survey asked specifically about sentences under other mandatory minimum statutes , it provided no opportunity for a response focused on section 3559 ( c ) .
