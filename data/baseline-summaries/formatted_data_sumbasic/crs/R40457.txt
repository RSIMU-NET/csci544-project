november 15 - 18 , 2009 — president obama made his first official visit to china .

during the visit , president obama and prc president hu jintao released a joint statement on u.s. and prc interests in the 21 st century .

october 5 , 2009 — the dalai lama arrived in washington as part of a u.s. visit which will not include a meeting with president barack obama .

according to the white house , a meeting with the dalai lama will be postponed until after the president's november trip to china to meet with prc president hu jintao .

october 4 , 2009 — prc premier wen jiabao began a three - day , high - profile "goodwill" visit to north korea .

october 1 , 2009 — the prc celebrated the 60 th anniversary of its founding , with celebrations including a massive military parade showcasing the latest military technology .

september 26 , 2009 — beijing announced it would ease restrictions on foreign investments in the culture industry , to include film , publishing , entertainment , online games , and multi - media .

the administration of president barack obama has inherited from the george w. bush administration a relationship with china that is smoother than in the past , but also has grown significantly more complex , multifaceted , and intertwined .

during the bush administration , washington and beijing cultivated regular high - level visits and exchanges of working level officials , resumed military - to - military relations , cooperated on anti - terror initiatives , and worked closely on the six party talks to restrain and eliminate north korea's nuclear weapons activities .

these and other initiatives of engagement are likely to continue in some fashion under the obama administration .

in addition , the obama administration has indicated that it would like to forge greater cooperation with china on the international financial crisis , global climate change , and a range of security interests .

these issues were the points of focus during secretary of state hillary clinton's first official trip to china in february 2009 .

despite these new avenues of cooperation , ongoing bilateral issues provide a constant set of challenges for u.s. policymakers .

they include difficulties over the status and well - being of taiwan , ongoing disputes over china's failure to protect u.s. intellectual property rights , china's economic and trade policies , and growing concerns about the quality and safety of exported prc products .

the prc's more assertive foreign policy and continued military development also have significant long - term implications for u.s. global power and influence and have been of concern to u.s. policymakers .

some u.s. lawmakers have suggested that u.s. policies toward the prc perhaps should be reassessed in light of these trends .

with this broad array of difficult and challenging policy choices in mind , u.s. - china relations today are defined by a comprehensive list of bilateral and multilateral issues .

some of these remain key irritants in the relationship , while others are rooted in significant inter - dependence and mutual benefit .

likewise , some are characterized by vigorous competition , while others are founded on bilateral and multilateral cooperation .
