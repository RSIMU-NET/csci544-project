with recent high energy prices , the passage of the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .

109-58 ) and the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( p.l .

110-140 ) , and the passage of the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) , there is ongoing congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels .

biofuels — transportation fuels produced from plants and other organic materials — are of particular interest .

ethanol and biodiesel , the two most widely used biofuels , received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives , loan and grant programs , and regulatory programs .

however , many incentives for biofuels production and use expired at the end of 2011 , while many farm - bill related programs will expire at the end of fy2012 .

the ongoing congressional debate over budget deficits and the national debt make the prospect of extending these incentives less likely .

for example , six of the eight tax incentives listed in this report expired at the end of 2011 and the remaining two are set to expire at the end of 2012 .

this report outlines 22 current , expired , or pending federal programs that provide direct or indirect incentives for biofuels .

the programs are grouped below by administering agency .

the incentives for biofuels are summarized in the appendix .

this information is compiled from authorizing statutes , committee reports , and administration budget request documents .

administered by: epa established: 2005 by the energy policy act of 2005 , §1501 ( p.l .

109-58 ) ; expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 , §202 ( p.l .

110-140 ) scheduled termination: none description: the energy policy act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) for automotive fuels .

the rfs was expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 .

the rfs requires the use of renewable fuels ( including ethanol and biodiesel ) in transportation fuel .

in 2011 , fuel suppliers were required to include 13.95 billion gallons of renewable fuel in the national transportation fuel supply ; this requirement increases annually to 36 billion gallons in 2022 .

the expanded rfs also specifically mandates the use of "advanced biofuels" — fuels produced from non - corn feedstocks and with 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuel — starting in 2009 .

of the 36 billion gallons required in 2022 , at least 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuel .

there are also specific quotas for cellulosic biofuels and for biomass - based diesel fuel .

on may 1 , 2007 , epa issued a final rule on the original rfs program detailing compliance standards for fuel suppliers , as well as a system to trade renewable fuel credits between suppliers .

on march 26 , 2010 , epa issued final rules for the expanded program ( rfs2 ) , including lifecycle analysis methods necessary to categorize fuels as advanced biofuels , and new rules for credit verification and trading .

while this program is not a direct subsidy for the construction of biofuels plants , the guaranteed market created by the renewable fuel standard is expected to stimulate growth of the biofuels industry and to raise prices above where they would have been in the absence of the mandate .

various tax credits and other incentives have been available for the production , blending , and / or sale of biofuels and biofuel blends .

however , many of these incentives expired at the end of 2011 .

tax credits vary by the type of fuel and the size of the producer .

several key biofuels incentives had expired or were set to expire ( eg , a tariff on ethanol imported from most countries , as well as tax credits for biodiesel , renewable diesel , and ethanol ) before the passage of the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) .

the incentives included in that law were extended through the end of 2011 , but support for extending these tax incentives beyond 2011 was limited .

manufacturers may gain credits for the sale of alternative fuel vehicles , including ethanol / gasoline flexible fuel vehicles ( ffvs ) .

however , the credits are limited — the maximum fuel economy increase allowed through the use of these credits is 1.2 miles per gallon through model year ( my ) 2014 .

the credits are phased out after my2014 and are completely eliminated after my2019 .
