apec's annual leaders' meeting is the association's paramount event , culminating a year of meetings designed to foster trade and investment liberalization among the 21 apec members .

because apec operates under a system of voluntary action and "open regionalism," in which changes in trade policy are extended not just to apec members , but to all trading partners , these meetings rarely result in concrete , binding "deliverables. .

the leaders' meeting , in particular , usually results in a joint leaders' declaration that enumerates a series of commitments and pledges on steps to be taken to liberalize the trade and investment regimes of the apec members .

in addition , the united states usually has taken advantage of the gathering of the 21 apec leaders to hold bilateral meetings with selected leaders .

although president obama did not attend this year's meeting , secretary of state hillary clinton did meet with the representatives from japan , malaysia , russia , singapore , south korea , and taiwan while in vladivostok .

plans for a meeting with hong kong's new chief executive leung chun - ying were cancelled because he was unable to attend due to important domestic duties .

prior to her arrival at the apec leaders' meeting , secretary clinton met with indonesia's president susilo bambang yudhoyono and china's president hu jintao .

this year's joint leaders' declaration focused on the four themes selected by host member russia: ( 1 ) advancing trade and investment liberalization and regional economic integration ; ( 2 ) strengthening food security ; ( 3 ) establishing reliable supply chains ; and ( 4 ) promoting cooperation to foster innovative growth .

on the issue of regional economic integration , the declaration reaffirmed apec's commitment to the bogor goals , as well as "apec's role as an incubator of a ftaap [free trade area of the asia - pacific]. .

the declaration also noted the completion of a model chapter on transparency , adding to the list of model chapters developed by apec for use by its members when negotiating bilateral or multilateral trade agreements .

on trade and investment liberalization , the document highlighted the agreement of tariff reduction for environmental goods ( see " agreement on environmental goods tariff reductions " below ) .

regarding food security , the leaders' declaration called for the implementation of the niigata declaration of 2010 and the kazan declaration on food security ( see " food security and sustainable agriculture " below ) and a commitment to strengthen efforts to combat illegal trade in wildlife .

the leaders also agreed to promote more reliable supply chains by various means , including reducing the "time , cost , and uncertainty of moving goods and services through the asia - pacific region," in order to achieve the goal of a 10% improvement in supply - chain performance by 2015 .

in addition , the declaration committed the apec members to develop non - discriminatory , market - driven innovation policies that promote greater involvement of small , medium , and micro - sized enterprises ( smmes ) and women in the field of technological innovation .

although as the host for this year's meetings , russia set the overall agenda for the leaders' meeting and the resulting leaders' declaration , the united states delegation had its own priorities to pursue in vladivostok .

below is a summary ( in alphabetical order ) of the five key issues addressed at the apec meetings in vladivostok , according to officials with the u.s. state department and u.s. trade representative's ( ustr's ) office .

during president obama's first term , there seemed to be a subtle shift in the role of apec in u.s. trade policy and its interaction with the ongoing tpp negotiations .

the tpp was initially presented by the united states as a model for establishing a free trade area of the asia - pacific ( ftaap ) as part of apec's efforts to promote trade and investment liberalization in the region .

other apec members have similarly portrayed alternative regional integration models , such as the asean+3 and the asean+6 , as possible paths towards the creation of a ftaap .

more recently , senior u.s. trade officials describe apec as an incubator of new ideas or concepts that can eventually be incorporated into a binding and more formal tpp .

in addition , the annual apec leaders' meeting is often portrayed by u.s. officials as a forum at which the current tpp negotiating nations can present to the other apec members the status of the trade talks .

the 2012 leaders' declaration does not mention the tpp , but does direct apec ministers to take note of "various regional undertakings that could be developed and built upon as a way towards an eventual ftaap," which presumably includes the tpp .

by various accounts , the tpp negotiations have been a source of some tension among the 21 apec members , with some viewing the negotiations as a divisive initiative introduced by the united states .

recent leaders' declarations provide different portrayals of the importance of the ftaap , as well as the tpp .

the 2009 leaders' declarationâthe first following the u.s. announcement of its intention to negotiate the tppârefers in general terms to apec's exploration of "a range of possible pathways" to the creation of an ftaap without explicitly mentioning the tpp .

following the 2010 leaders' meeting held in yokohama , japan , the leaders' declaration was more explicit about the role of the ftaap and its relationship to apec: we will take concrete steps toward realization of a free trade area of the asia - pacific ( ftaap ) , which is a major instrument to further apec's regional economic integration agenda .

an ftaap should be pursued as a comprehensive free trade agreement by developing and building on ongoing regional undertakings , such as asean+3 , asean+6 , and the trans - pacific partnership , among others .

to this end , apec will make an important and meaningful contribution as an incubator of an ftaap by providing leadership and intellectual input into the process of its development , and by playing a critical role in defining , shaping , and addressing the "next generation" trade and investment issues that ftaap should contain .

apec should contribute to the pursuit of an ftaap by continuing and further developing its work on sectoral initiatives in such areas as investment ; services ; e - commerce ; rules of origin ; standards and conformance ; trade facilitation ; and environmental goods and services .

while apec official statements focus on ftaapânot tppâand present ftaap as an instrument to achieve apec's agenda , u.s. officials appear to place a greater priority on the tpp .

for example , secretary clinton highlighted the tpp in her comments to the press in vladivostok , saying , "[a]s leaders meet here in russia , our negotiating partners are engaged in intense diplomacy to advance the trans - pacific partnership , known as the tpp .

th is free trade agreement is central to america's economic vision in asia [emphasis added]. .

for several years , critics in the united states and in asia have questioned the value of apec and its annual leaders' meeting .

despite having helped organize the first apec leaders' meeting in 1993 , former australia prime minister paul keating subsequently referred to apec as a "talk shop of debatable output. .

confidential sources have suggested to crs that given the growth in high - level events in asia at which the president of the united states is expected to attend , the united states could be represented at future apec leaders' meetings by the secretary of state or the vice president .

although president obama did not attend this year due to the conflict with the democratic party's national convention , the obama administration is consulting with indonesia , next year's apec host , to set dates for the leaders' meeting so that the president can attend .

to the extent that apec remains one of the leading economic and trade fora in asia for u.s. foreign policy , congress will continue to have an active interest in apec's major meetings and any resulting commitments .

in addition , congress must appropriate funds to pay the u.s. share to support apec's secretariat and operations .

finally , congress may be asked to approve funding for various apec studies and initiatives agreed to at events such as the annual leaders' meeting .

at this year's leaders' meeting , the 21 apec members pledged to reduce the tariff rates on 54 categories of environmental goods to below 5% by 2015 .

under current u.s. law , 4 of those 54 categories have peak rates above 5% .

as a result , the 113 th congress may consider legislation to bring u.s. tariff rates in compliance with the apec commitment .

as an apec member , the united states contributes to the support of the apec secretariat in singapore , as well as various apec programs .

the 112 th congress provided an estimated $1.023 million to apec - related activities in fy2012 as part of the state department's contributions to international organizations .

president obama has requested $1.028 million for fy2013 .

of that amount , $144,000 is for the 18% share of the apec member assessments provided by the united states .

the rest of the funding is for apec - related activities .

according to the department of state operations congressional budget justification for fiscal year 2013 , apec - related activities involve 17 different federal departments , agencies , and supported organizations in such areas as advancing regulatory reform , enhancing customs procedures , promoting anti - corruption efforts , and improving transportation security .

the 113 th congress will also be asked to provide funding for apec activities , including some related to the key issues discussed in vladivostok .

the following table lists the 54 categories of goods included in the apec agreement to lower tariff rates to 5% or less by 2015 by harmonized system code .

categories with peak tariff rates above 5% according to u.s. law are highlighted in italics .
