the federal pell grant program , authorized by title iv - a - 1 of the higher education act of 1965 , as amended ( hea ; p.l .

89-329 ) , is the single largest source of federal grant aid supporting postsecondary education students .

the program provided approximately $31 billion to approximately 8.2 million undergraduate students in fy2015 .

pell grants are need - based aid that is intended to be the foundation for all federal need - based student aid awarded to undergraduates .

the u.s. department of education ( ed ) data suggest that in fy2015 , pell grants constituted approximately 23% of all hea title iv student aid — including grants , loans , and work opportunities — that benefit postsecondary education students at all levels .

the statutory authority for the pell grant program was most recently reauthorized through fy2017 by the higher education opportunity act of 2008 ( heoa ; p.l .

110-315 ) .

additional legislation , referred to in this report , includes the following: the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) provided substantial discretionary and mandatory supplemental funding for the pell grant program in fy2009 , and when combined with the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act ( p.l .

111-8 ) , also established a $619 increase in the pell grant maximum award for award year ( ay ) 2009-2010 ; the safra act ( enacted as part of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 ; p.l .

111-152 ) established indefinite mandatory appropriations for the pell grant program , changed the method by which future additional mandatory add - on amounts are determined , and provided additional mandatory funds in fy2011 for general use through the end of fy2012 ; the fy2011 continuing appropriations act ( p.l .

112-10 ) amended the hea to eliminate a provision that allowed for a student to receive two scheduled pell grant awards in the same year , and provided additional mandatory funds in fy2012 and select future years for general use in the program ; the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) provided additional mandatory funds for the pell grant program for fy2012 and fy2013 ; the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

112-74 ) amended the hea to make several changes to the eligibility criteria and award rules for the pell grant program , and provided additional mandatory funds in fy2012 and select future years for general use in the program ; and the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 ) permitted individuals enrolled in career pathway programs to receive a reduced pell grant award .

this report reviews how the program works and provides an analysis of recent program costs and funding , recipients ( numbers and characteristics ) , and the role the program plays in the distribution of federal student aid .

in addition , this report highlights some of the current legislative issues pertaining to the program .

the appendices at the end of the report describe the pell grant mandatory add - on calculation ( appendix a ) , pell grant recipient count history ( appendix b ) , and acronyms commonly used in the report ( appendix c ) .

this section of the report provides an overview of the structure of the pell grant program and the process through which grants are made to students .

it describes student eligibility , underlying concepts and award rules for determining students' grants , and the role played by postsecondary institutions in the program .

briefly , the pell grant program provides grants ( i.e. , aid that does not have to be repaid ) to needy undergraduates .

in any year , federal funding is made available to ensure that all eligible students attending eligible institutions receive pell grants .

to apply for a pell grant , students must complete the free application for federal student aid ( fafsa ) , providing requested financial and other information , and submit it to a "central processor" under contract with ed .

the central processor provides each applicant with a student aid record ( sar ) and provides each institution of higher education ( ihe ) designated by the applicant with an institutional student information record ( isir ) .

these documents contain the information submitted on the fafsa and the calculated expected family contribution ( efc ) .

the efc is the amount expected to be contributed by the student and the student's family toward postsecondary education expenses for the upcoming award year .

pell grants are portable , that is , the grant aid follows students to the eligible postsecondary education institutions in which they enroll .

institutions that receive valid sars or valid isirs for eligible pell applicants are required to disburse pell funds to students who successfully enroll in approved coursework .

the size of the grant is based , principally , on the financial resources that students and their families are expected to contribute toward postsecondary education expenses , and the discretionary base maximum award amount that is set in the annual appropriations process and any additional increases to the discretionary base maximum award funded with mandatory appropriations specified for each year in the hea .

this section provides descriptive statistics of pell grant recipients ( numbers and characteristics ) and the institutions that they attend .

the data may inform discussion regarding the extent to which the program achieves the policy goal of improving access to higher education for financially needy individuals .

the pell grant is intended to function as the foundation aid for financially needy undergraduates ; all other need - based and non - need - based federal student aid is to build on the pell grant .

as described earlier , other financial aid received by a student is not taken into account in determining a student's pell grant .

how well does the pell grant currently function as the foundation aid ? .

this section explores this question by analyzing the purchasing power of the pell grant and the distribution of other federal aid to pell recipients .

costs for the pell grant program are award year - specific and are primarily affected by the number of students who apply for and receive aid under the program's eligibility parameters and award rules .

from ay2008-2009 to ay2010-2011 , the program experienced both anticipated and unanticipated increases in program costs in each award year .

beginning in ay2011-2012 , program costs have declined or stabilized when compared to original estimates as a result of ( 1 ) the changes enacted in the fy2011 continuing appropriations act and the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act ; and ( 2 ) declines in enrollment , particularly at public and private for - profit institutions .

this section reviews recent trends in program costs and also presents some of the possible causes behind the changes in program costs since ay2007-2008 .

this section reviews the latest program funding trends .

although the program is currently operating with a surplus , addressing periodic funding shortfalls contributes significantly to changes regarding eligibility and award rules , and to appropriations decisions .

this section explores the concepts of and provides a historic look at discretionary funding surpluses and shortfalls in the program .

additionally , this section provides insight into how funding shortfalls in the program have been addressed in the past .

annual discretionary appropriation bills provide the largest portion of funding for the pell grant program , and this funding typically remains available for use for two fiscal years .

an annual appropriation is usually available for obligation on october 1 of the fiscal year in which the appropriation is made and remains available for obligation through september 30 of the following fiscal year .

thus , while fy2016 funds are provided with the purpose of supporting awards made from july 1 , 2016 , to june 30 , 2017 , these funds are available for obligation from october 1 , 2015 , to september 30 , 2017 , and may support multiple award years .

as mentioned earlier , annual discretionary appropriation bills also establish the base discretionary maximum grant for each applicable award year .

the safra act , the fy2011 continuing appropriations act , the budget control act of fy2011 , and most recently the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act amended the hea to provide specified mandatory appropriations for the pell grant program to augment current and future discretionary appropriations .

that is , these funds , while mandatory from a budgetary perspective , can be used to pay for costs in the program for which annual discretionary appropriations are typically provided .

the concept of providing advance mandatory funding to augment or supplant discretionary funding in the program is relatively new .

prior to fy2007 , mandatory funding had been infrequently provided for the pell grant program , but usually to supplement discretionary funding to pay for accumulated funding shortfalls .

from a budgetary perspective , these recent increases in mandatory appropriations have been offset largely by enacted provisions that have resulted in estimated savings from the federal student loan programs , which are classified as mandatory programs .

additionally , some of the mandatory appropriations provided for the program in the fy2011 continuing appropriations act and fy2012 consolidated appropriations act were offset by enacted provisions that resulted in mandatory savings in the pell grant program .

the safra act also established indefinite mandatory appropriations for the program to provide for increases to the discretionary base maximum award amount in fy2010 and beyond .

that is , mandatory appropriations are available to fund add - on award amounts indefinitely for "such sums as necessary," but the specific amount provided for each year will be determined based on costs associated with the add - on amount specified in the safra act .

for fy2013 through fy2017 , the amount of the mandatory add - on award is , in part , contingent on the amount of the discretionary base maximum award .

in general , if the discretionary base maximum award increases above $4,860 in future years , add - on amounts will also increase , along with the amount of required mandatory appropriations .

in contrast , the amount of required mandatory appropriations would decrease if the discretionary base maximum award falls below the level of $4,860 .

an appropriate timeline for summarizing recent funding could commence with fy2010 , since it marks the first year of the current indefinite mandatory funding sources .

table 7 provides a history of funding for the program from fy2010 to fy2016 .

a distinction is made between discretionary appropriations , mandatory appropriations provided to augment discretionary appropriations , and mandatory appropriations provided to fund the add - on award amounts specified in the safra act .

table 7 also displays the mandatory appropriations that have been provided through fy2021 .

mandatory appropriations that will be necessary to fully fund the add - on award amount are available indefinitely , but the specific amount required in each year cannot be reported until the add - on amount is determined and all funds are disbursed to eligible students .

the annual discretionary appropriation level and base maximum pell grant level are determined in advance of the award year they are intended to support , and are based on estimates of program costs at that time .

the annual appropriation is determined on the basis of estimates of the program costs that are likely to be incurred at the chosen discretionary base maximum award level .

to the extent those estimates of future program costs are inaccurate , the annual appropriation may be too much or too little .

the hea requires the secretary of education , when he has determined that the appropriated funds are insufficient to satisfy all pell entitlements , to notify each chamber of congress of the funding shortfall , identifying how much more funding is needed to meet those entitlements .

table 8 provides a history of annual discretionary appropriations , estimated expenditures , and estimated annual shortfall or surplus levels from fy1973 to fy2016 .

beginning with fy1990 , the estimated cumulative funding shortfall or surplus is also provided .

the annual funding shortfall or surplus differs from the cumulative shortfall or surplus , which may accumulate over multiple award years .

it is also important to note that congress may have provided a reduced appropriation level in a given year when a funding surplus was available for use from the previous year .

conversely , congress may have provided additional appropriations in a given year to pay for an estimated funding shortfall from the previous year .

over the years , federal policymakers and congress have taken a variety of measures to address the vexing issues associated with funding shortfalls in the pell grant program .

funding shortfalls in the pell grant program have , on infrequent occasions in the past , led to reductions in students' awards , recipient caps , the need for supplemental appropriations , or to stagnating award levels from award year to award year .

for the most part , funding shortfalls in the program have been accepted as common occurrences , but the measures employed to deal with them have varied .

the relative size of the estimated funding shortfall in any given year is of particular interest to congress , officials at ed , and student aid advocacy groups .

it is important to note that the pell grant program is often referred to as a "quasi - entitlement" and has for the most part been operated as an appropriated entitlement given the infrequency of reductions in students' awards or imposed recipient caps since the 1990s .

most recent funding shortfalls in the pell grant program have not directly impacted eligible students' awards .

this section provides a brief chronological history of the measures adopted to address funding shortfalls in the program .

from the inception of the program in 1972 until the enactment of the higher education amendments of 1992 ( p.l .

102-325 ) , the secretary of education had statutory authority under the hea to reduce awards to respond to a shortfall in appropriated funds .

reductions were made in awards in eight years using this authority ( the last in ay1990-1991 ) .

after this hea authority was repealed , appropriations legislation for fy1994-fy2001 continued to provide the secretary with reduction authority , but that authority was not used .

fy2002 and subsequent appropriations legislation have not included such language .

the secretary can respond to a shortfall in pell grant funding by allocating funds from the most recently enacted appropriation to pay for obligations incurred in previous award years .

this permits ed to use funds from multiple fiscal years' appropriations to meet one award year's cost .

during the period between fy2002 and fy2006 , a very large funding shortfall accumulated , culminating at $4.1 billion in ay2005-2006 — approximately equivalent to one - third of the ay2005-2006 program expenditure .

in short , the funding shortfall was a result of unexpected and significant growth in the number of pell grant applicants , driven primarily by a weakened economy , and a sustained misalignment between program cost estimates and annual appropriations .

the accumulated shortfalls during this time period , however , did not result in a reduction of awards for any eligible student .

the maximum grant level , on the other hand , remained stagnant at $4,050 from ay2003-2004 through ay2006-2007 .

congress responded to the accumulated shortfall in fy2006 by providing $4.3 billion in mandatory appropriations to eliminate the shortfall that had accumulated through ay2005-2006 .

these mandatory funds were appropriated in the fy2006 appropriations legislation for labor , health and human services , and education ( p.l .

109-149 ) .

refer to table 8 for more information on the annual funding and expenditure levels that led to the $4.1 billion shortfall at the end of ay2005-2006 .

in addition to eliminating the ay2005-2006 funding shortfall , congress took steps in fy2006 to limit the possibility of large accumulated funding shortfalls in the future .

h.con.res .

95 established a permanent rule that applies to the scoring of the pell grant program by the congressional budget office ( cbo ) .

the rule provides that if the appropriations of new discretionary budget authority enacted for the program are insufficient to cover the full costs in the upcoming year — including any funding surplus or shortfall from prior years — the budget authority counted against the bill for the program will be equal to the adjusted full cost ( i.e. , total need ) .

the rule also states that the budget authority for the program will be based on the maximum appropriated award amount and any changes to the eligibility criteria .

prior to the implementation of the fy2006 scoring rule , cbo accounted for budget authority in the pell grant program according to the level provided in each appropriation bill .

while this approach is typical for most discretionary programs , the pell grant program is unique since it operates like an entitlement program and annual appropriations can be used to fund multiple award years .

prior to the adoption of the scoring rule , congress could choose to fund new programs or increase the funding of existing programs subject to discretionary appropriations while providing less funding than required for the pell grant program .

while the scoring rule cannot fully account for the challenges of estimating the cost of the program , it does constrain the accumulation of the funding shortfall by requiring congress to annually reconcile previous years' appropriation levels with updated estimates of previous years' program obligations .

during the period from fy2006 to fy2010 , the program experienced a mix of accumulated funding shortfalls and surpluses .

from fy2006 to fy2008 , cbo estimates that the program's cumulative funding shortfall culminated at $2.7 billion .

in fy2009 , american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) and the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act ( p.l .

111-8 ) provided a combined discretionary funding level of $32.9 billion .

these funds were used to retire the accumulated $2.7 billion funding shortfall in fy2008 ; increase the discretionary base maximum award by $619 to $4,860 in ay2009-2010 ; and provide for a surplus of funds totaling $3.4 billion available for use through fy2011 .

in december 2009 , the consolidated appropriations act of fy2010 ( p.l .

111-117 ) provided $17.5 billion in discretionary funds based on estimates of program costs for ay2010-2011 and the funding surplus in fy2009 as of march 2009 .

between march 2009 and march 2010 , however , the number of students applying for a pell grant in ay2009-2010 increased beyond historic trends as overall economic conditions continued to weaken and college enrollments increased .

in march 2010 , cbo published revised estimates of the program costs for ay2009-2010 and ay2010-2011 , which incorporated the new economic trends and application growth not captured in the previous year's estimates .

revised estimates released by cbo in march 2011 showed a cumulative funding shortfall of $10.7 billion through the end of fy2010 .

in response to this funding shortfall , the safra act provided $13.5 billion in advance mandatory appropriations for general use in the program that were made available october 1 , 2010 , through september 30 , 2012 .

these mandatory appropriations were offset by changes in federal student loan programs and effectively eliminated the estimated $10.7 billion discretionary funding shortfall and created a funding surplus available in fy2011 to augment discretionary funding needs .

although additional mandatory funds were provided in the safra act for use in fy2011 to pay for the fy2010 funding shortfall and augment fy2011 discretionary funding needs , congress was required to consider a significant "funding gap" between the previous year's discretionary funding level in fy2010 of $17.5 billion and the amount needed in fy2011 to maintain the fy2010 award and eligibility parameters in fy2011 .

moreover , congress recognized the implications of a continued funding gap in discretionary appropriations for the subsequent fy2012 and took steps to address these needs in fy2011 .

to address these concerns , congress took the following steps: in april 2011 , the fy2011 continuing appropriations act provided approximately $23 billion in discretionary appropriations for fy2011 .

in addition , a total of $8.8 billion in mandatory appropriations were provided for general use in the program beginning in fy2012 through fy2021 , of which $3.2 billion was made available for use beginning in fy2012 .

these appropriations were offset by estimated mandatory savings from the elimination of a provision that allowed for two scheduled pell grants in one award year .

in august 2011 , the budget control act of 2011 provided an additional $10 billion in mandatory appropriations for general use in the program beginning in fy2012 and an additional $7 billion in mandatory appropriations for general use in the program beginning in fy2013 .

these appropriations were offset with estimated mandatory savings from the elimination of provisions in the william d. ford direct loan ( dl ) program .

the additional mandatory funding provided above , when combined with the additional funds provided in the safra act in fy2010 for use in fy2011 , resulted in an estimated $7.4 billion surplus of mandatory funds that could be used in fy2012 to augment discretionary funding needs .

despite the availability of approximately $7.4 billion in mandatory appropriations to augment discretionary funding in fy2012 , congress was required to consider an approximately $1.3 billion funding gap in fy2012 .

congress responded to this $1.3 billion funding gap by amending the hea to make changes to federal student aid programs and redirecting most of the available savings from these changes to the pell grant program in fy2012 and future years .

changes enacted in the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act that affect the pell grant program are discussed below .

in december 2011 , the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act provided $22.8 billion in discretionary funding for the program for fy2012 .

the discretionary base maximum award for ay2012-2013 was $4,860 , and the total maximum award for which a student was eligible in ay2012-2013 was $5,550 .

these amounts were unchanged from the previous award year .

the fy2012 consolidated appropriations act also provided an additional $3.1 billion in mandatory funding for general use in the program from fy2012 to fy2021 , of which $612 million was available beginning in fy2012 .

these mandatory funds were offset by the estimated mandatory savings from policy riders also included in fy2012 consolidated appropriations act that made changes to federal student aid programs in the hea .

changes that were specific to the eligibility criteria and award rules for the pell grant program included the following: for ay2012-2013 and future years , the qualifying minimum pell grant award was set to 10% of the total maximum pell grant .

for ay2012-2013 and future years , the cumulative lifetime eligibility for pell grant aid was reduced from 18 semesters to 12 semesters .

the following change affected eligibility for need - based federal student aid ( eg , pell grants , subsidized direct loans , etc .

 ) : for ay2012-2013 , the income threshold for determining whether certain students are eligible to receive an automatic zero expected family contribution ( efc ) changed from $31,000 to $23,000 .

income threshold levels for future years will be indexed to inflation .

the following change affected eligibility for most federal student aid programs under title iv of the hea: students will no longer be able to qualify for federal student aid on the basis of passing an ability - to - benefit test or completing six credit hours of postsecondary work .

only students who have a high school diploma ( or equivalent ) are eligible for federal student aid .

only students who first enroll on or after july 1 , 2012 , are affected by this change .

mathematical expression for calculating the pell grant mandatory add - on award amounts for ay2014-2015 ( fy2014 ) through ay2017-2018 ( fy2017 ) expressed as: if db ay ( n - 1 ) ≤ $4,860 , then mi ay ( n ) = ( tm pay ( n - 1 ) x ( 1 + cpi - u cy ( n - 1 ) ) ) – $4,860 if db ay ( n - 1 ) > $4,860 , then mi ay ( n ) = ( tm pay ( n - 1 ) x ( 1 + cpi - u cy ( n - 1 ) ) ) – db ay ( n - 1 ) where db ay ( n - 1 ) = discretionary base maximum award for previous award year ( n - 1 ) ; mi ay ( n ) = mandatory add - on amount for the current award year ( n ) , rounded to the nearest $5 increment ; tm pay ( n - 1 ) = total maximum pell grant award for previous award year ( n - 1 ) ; and cpi - u cy ( n - 1 ) = change ( increase or decrease ) in cpi - u from most recently completed calendar year prior to start of current award year ( n - 1 ) .

example: for example , consider what the mandatory add - on amount would be in ay2017-2018 if ( 1 ) the discretionary base maximum amount is $4,860 in ay2016-2017 ; ( 2 ) the calculated mandatory add - on amount is $985 in ay2016-2017 ; and ( 3 ) the change in the cpi - u from calendar year december 2015 to december 2016 is measured at 2% .

this would be determined as follows: mi ay1617 = ( $4,860 + $985 ) x ( 1 + .02 ) – $4,860 mi ay1617 = ( $5,845 x 1.02 ) – $4,860 mi ay1617 = $5,962 – $4,860 mi ay1617 = $1,102 mi ay1617 = round $1,102 to nearest $5 mi ay1617 = $1,100 source: crs analysis of p.l .
