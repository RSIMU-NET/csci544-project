economic sanctions are one foreign policy tool that can be used to potentially influence the behavior and actions of political leadership in other countries .

oil - related sanctions are one option that could be used to apply economic pressure on certain countries in order to achieve broader geopolitical and foreign policy objectives .

currently , the united states has active economic sanctions imposed on three major oil - producing and exporting countries: iran , russia , and venezuela .

combined , these countries produced approximately 17.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of oil in 2018âapproximately 18% of total world oil productionâaccording to one estimate .

only a portion of these supply volumes might be directly affected by u.s. economic sanctions in the near termâpotentially ranging from 3.3 million to 4.0 million bpd from both iran ( estimated to be 2.8 million bpd ) and venezuela ( estimated to range from 0.5 million to as much as 1.2 million bpd ) .

estimated oil production volumes affected to date have been approximately 1.7 million bpd from iran .

venezuela oil production has likely also been affected , although accurately quantifying volumes is challenging due to monthly oil production declines that had been occurring over a period of years prior to u.s. sanctions affecting oil trade in january 2019 .

a sustained global petroleum supply imbalance of 1% to 2% could contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements ( both upward and downward ) for crude oil and related petroleum products ( eg , gasoline and diesel fuel ) .

to date , oil supply impacts related to economic sanctions have not generally resulted in significant upward price pressure for benchmark oil prices .

generally , sanctions - related supply losses have been counterbalanced by increased production and exports from the united states , russia , and other countries ; petroleum trade flow adjustments ; indications of slowing global oil demand growth rates ; and design elements of oil - related sanctions .

oil sanctions frameworks can include wind - down periods , requirements to consider and certify that global oil supply is adequate to compensate for supply reductions , and engagement with other oil producers before applying certain sanctions .

these design elements are intended to mitigate sanctions - related market and price impacts and to build into the sanctions regime multilateral coordination and cooperation .

oil - related economic sanctions for each respective country discussed in this report differ in terms of design and potential market impacts .

as a result , each framework is likely to have a different effect on oil production , trade , and potentially price levels .

generally , each sanctions framework is structured to reduceâeither immediately or in the futureâoil sales revenue to the subject country .

since 2011 , sanctions targeting iran's oil sector have aimed to eliminate the country's oil export revenue .

sanctions applied to russia's oil sector generally target long - term , high - risk oil production projects .

venezuela sanctions imposed to date prohibit petroleum trade with the united statesâhistorically one of the primary destinations for venezuela's oil exportsâand have the potential to affect venezuela's petroleum trade with other countries .

table 1 provides a general overview of current oil - sector sanctions imposed on iran , russia , and venezuela .

the scope of this report is to assess the possible impact of current u.s. economic sanctions on oil production in and exports from iran , russia , and venezuela .

for each country , this report provides general background and historical information about the oil sector , followed by an overview of each oil - related sanctions framework and a discussion of oil production , supply , and trade impacts resulting from u.s. sanctions .

european union ( eu ) oil sector sanctions imposed on iran and russia are referenced but are not discussed in detail .

selected oil market impact observationsâspecifically price impacts and trade flow adjustmentsâand policy considerations are discussed .

a detailed assessment of how oil - related sanctions might have affected each target country's overall economy and how these effects may have contributed to achieving u.s. foreign policy objectives is beyond the scope of this report .

iran holds the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the worldâbehind venezuela , saudi arabia , and canadaâwith an estimated 156 billion barrels as of the end of 2018 .

a founding member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , commercial crude oil production in iran started in 1913 and iran has been both an oil producer and exporter for more than a century .

iran's oil industry was nationalized in 1951 by prime minister ( pm ) mohammed mossadeq , who expropriated the anglo - iranian oil companyâtoday known as bp .

foreign policy concerns about pm mossadeq's potential pivot toward the soviet union resulted in a u.s. - and british - sponsored intelligence operation that removed mossadeq from power in 1953 .

following that operation , a consortium of u.s. and european oil companies effectively took control of iran's oil production and exports .

crude oil production in iran was at its highest historical rate in the 1970s when it ranged between 5 million and 6 million bpd for much of the decade .

diplomatic relations between the united states and iran in the late 1960s and for most of the 1970s were generally positive , with oil production and trade being one element of the relationship .

during this period , the shah of iran ( iran's political leader at the time ) âin an effort to increase oil revenues for military and domestic policy purposesârequested then - president nixon to eliminate the mandatory oil import quota ( moiq ) system that limited u.s. crude oil import volumes from foreign countries .

in 1969 , the shah also reportedly offered to sell the united states 1 million bpd of crude oil for 10 years at a price of $1 / barrel for the united states to create a strategic oil stockpile .

president nixon declined the shah's request and offer .

as domestic u.s. oil production levels were not keeping pace with increasing u.s. oil demand , president nixon replaced moiq with an import licensing fee system in april 1973 .

iran was not party to the october 1973 oil embargoâinstituted by members of the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries ( oapec ) âan event that contributed to rapidly rising petroleum prices , perceived supply shortages , and the enactment of u.s. laws to ensure domestic availability of oil supply .

the oil market situation in late 1973 created an opportunity for iran to increase oil revenue .

u.s. crude oil imports from iran more than doubled from 1973 to 1978 , when imports reached approximately 550,000 bpd .

however , u.s. - iran relations changed in 1979 when the iranian revolution culminated with the shah abdicating , iran becoming an islamic republic , and ayatollah khomeini rising to power as iran's supreme leader .

oil production in iran started declining in late 1978 , due to a labor strike in opposition to the shah's policies , and the situation led to one of the largest ( 5.6 million bpd ) and longest ( nearly six months ) supply disruptions in history .

this supply loss contributed to one of the highest inflation - adjusted annual oil price periods on record .

russia is one of the largest oil producers and exporters in the world .

in 2018 , crude oil and condensate production in russia was larger than in any other country , at approximately 11.2 million bpd .

the united states ( 11 million bpd ) and saudi arabia ( 10.5 million bpd ) were ranked second and third respectively .

as of the end of 2018 , russia held the sixth largest amount of proven oil reserves with approximately 106 billion barrels .

commercial oil production in russia and the former soviet union dates back to the 1870s when the first wells were drilled in baku ( today the capital of azerbaijan ) .

increasing oil production and exportsâalong with oil refining to make kerosene for artificial lightingâin the late 1800s resulted in the emergence of a major competitor to the global monopoly held by u.s. - based standard oil at that time .

the oil industry continued to grow and expand in the russian empire and growth continued to develop in the soviet union after the 1917 bolshevik revolution .

soviet oil policy decisions in the 1920s and 1950s resulted in depressed global oil prices that are credited with motivating two historical oil industry developments .

the first was an export campaign in the 1920s that contributed to low prices and the signing of the historic achnacarry agreement in 1928 by multiple oil companies with the intent to restrict oil production in order to support oil prices .

the second was an oil market - share campaign in the 1950s that led to lower prices and was one factor credited with motivating creation of opec in 1960 .

by 1987 , the soviet union was the largest oil producer in the world at nearly 12.5 million bpd , more than twice the production of saudi arabia that year .

soviet oil production had declined to 10.3 million bpd in 1991 , the year the soviet union was formally dissolved and the russian federation ( russia ) established .

oil production in the russian federation represented approximately 90% of soviet oil production in 1991 , at 9.3 million bpd .

russia's oil production declined to just over 6 million bpd in 1996 but recovered to 10.8 million bpd by 2013 .

today , oil is a major element of russia's economy ; approximately 46% of federal revenue came from the oil and gas sector in 2018 .

venezuela holds the largest proven oil reserves in the world , estimated at 303 billion barrels as of the end of 2018 .

a founding member of opec , venezuela has produced oil commercially since 1914 .

u.s. oil companies began seeking agreementsâalso referred to as concessionsâto explore for and produce oil in venezuela as early as 1919 .

venezuela was not a participant in the 1973 organization of arab petroleum exporting countries embargo of oil shipments to the united states and other countries .

however in 1976 , consistent with developments in other oil - producing countries during the 1970s , venezuela nationalized its oil industry and created petroleos de venezuela s.a. ( pdvsa ) .

u.s. oil companies , such as exxon , reduced investments in the country leading up to nationalization but continued to be active in venezuela in a limited service - based role following nationalization .

oil production in venezuela was approximately 3.7 million bpd in 1970 .

production declined 2.1 million bpd ( 54% ) from 1971 to 1988 to reach 1.6 million bpd .

in the 1990s , pdvsa embarked on a program referred to as the apertura petrolera âor oil opening .

as part of this program , international oil companiesâincluding u.s. - firms chevron , exxon , and conocoâwere allowed to either control certain oil field operations or establish majority - owned oil production joint ventures with pdvsa .

oil production in venezuela increased to approximately 3.4 million bpd by 1998 .

during his campaign , former venezuelan president hugo chã¡vezâelected in 1998âthreatened to reverse the apertura program .

subsequently , president chã¡vez enacted the hydrocarbons law of 2001 , which restructured venezuela's petroleum sector by requiring pdvsa to have majority ownership of future oil developments and raising royalty payments on existing projects to the venezuelan government .

throughout the chã¡vez presidency , oil companies operating in venezuela were subject to periodic increases in royalty rates and taxes .

these additional payment requirements reduced the financial attractiveness of investing in venezuela's oil sector .

in 2007 , the chã¡vez government enacted a law that required existing oil joint ventures to convert into new entities that would be majority - owned by pdvsa .

some companies ( eg , chevron ) complied with the new requirement .

other companies ( eg , exxon and conoco ) ceased operations and sued pdvsa for damages resulting from unilateral changes to contractual agreements .

oil production in venezuela trended a bit lower but was relatively stable from 2007 through 2013 , in the range of 2.5 million bpd .

following the death of chã¡vez in 2013 , nicolã¡s maduro was elected president of venezuela .

a series of antidemocratic actions and human rights violations by the maduro government resulted in sanctions legislation and executive actions by the united states .

in 2017 , president trump declared a national emergency in e.o .

13808 and the administration imposed financial sanctions on pdvsa , including limiting pdvsa's access to u.s. debt finance .

pdvsa is also prohibited from receiving dividends and cash distributions from its u.s. - based citgo refining subsidiary .

these limitations made it more difficult for pdvsa to purchase oil - related services and oil production equipment .

with the overall u.s. objective to pressure president maduro to transfer government control , the united states recognized juan guaidã³ as interim president of venezuela and imposed sanctions in january 2019 aimed at reducing venezuela's oil revenues .

these sanctions effectively terminate u.s. - venezuela petroleum trade and potentially make it difficult for pdvsa to sell crude oil to and obtain petroleum products from non - u.s. entities .

sanctions - related oil supply losses and trade constraints have had an impact on oil markets .

these impacts have been observed in the form of iran and venezuela supply reductions , as discussed above .

impacts have also been reflected in price relationships for specific crude oil types and adaptive changes to trade flow patterns .

in terms of benchmark prices ( i.e. , west texas intermediate and brent futures contracts that are often quoted in the media ) , potential price escalation that might be expected from iran and venezuela supply reductions appear to have been averted to date by an increase in oil production in other countries , trade flow adjustments , and indications of slowing oil demand growth rates .

higher oil production and export volumes from the united states , russia , and other oil - producing and exporting countries have contributed toward mitigating potential upward price pressure .

sanctions imposed on iran , russia , and venezuela have affected global oil markets , prices , and trade flows .

as u.s. foreign policy objectives toward these countries evolve , sanctions relief , increased sanctions pressure , or both may have additional impacts on supply , prices , and potentially the u.s. oil production sector .

regarding iran , options for additional sanctions that might affect iran's oil sector appear to be limited as the current framework aims to eliminate iranian oil exports .

should sanctions relief be provided to iran , such an action could contribute to a market condition that could result in lower oil pricesâactual price levels would depend on market conditions at such a timeâand could adversely affect u.s. oil production and exports .

regarding russia , some members of congress have called for additional sanctions , and several bills have been introduced in the 116 th congress with certain provisions that could affect russia's oil sector .

finally , the administration has continued to strengthen oil - related sanctions on venezuela through the use of e.o.s and administrative actions .

legislation introduced in the 116 th congress would codify some of these sanctions .

in some cases , u.s. economic sanctions that target oil sectors in iran , russia , and venezuela have observably affected oil markets in several ways , including reductions in supply , changes in price relationships , and adjustments to trade flows .

oil - related sanctions frameworks include design elements that aim to minimize upward price pressure that might result from the imposition of sanctions .

however , design elements that consider possible oil market impacts in the event of oil - related sanctions relief or terminationâthat could contribute to market oversupply and downward price pressureâare not included in current oil - related sanctions frameworks .

arguably , potential sanctions - related price escalation has been counterbalanced by increased global supplies , lower global demand growth rate expectations , and market adjustments in response to oil supply and trade constraints .

should oil market conditions change to a persistent undersupply condition and benchmark prices escalate to levels deemed too high for u.s. consumers , sanctions relief is one available policy option that could possibly be considered to increase oil supply with the goal of rebalancing markets and moderating price levels ; however , such an action could potentially conflict with broader foreign policy objectives .
