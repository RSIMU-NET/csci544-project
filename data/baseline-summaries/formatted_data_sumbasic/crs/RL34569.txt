in 2003 , congress authorized $15 billion for u.s. efforts to combat global hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria from fy2004 through fy2008 with the united states leadership against hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria act of 2003 ( p.l .

108-25 ) ( leadership act ) .

5501 , the tom lantos and henry j. hyde united states global leadership against hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria reauthorization act of 2008 ( lantos - hyde act ) .

it describes the differences , similarities , and possible policy implementation implications of key proposals included in h.r .

5501 at two points during its consideration by the 110 th congress: when it was passed by the house on april 2 , 2008 , and later when it was passed by the senate on july 16 , 2008 .

finally , this report details key changes to programs and funding for u.s. international efforts to fight hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria programs as directed by the 110 th congress in the lantos - hyde act as enacted .

this report does not describe u.s. efforts to combat tuberculosis and malaria .

on january 28 , 2003 , president bush proposed the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) in his state of the union address , requesting $15 billion over five years to combat hiv / aids .

congress authorized $15 billion for u.s. efforts to combat global hiv / aids , tuberculosis ( tb ) , and malaria from fy2004 through fy2008 with the leadership act ( p.l .

108-25 ) , which was enacted on may 27 , 2003 .

the leadership act authorized $15 billion to address hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria globally and to provide u.s. contributions to the global fund from fy2004 through fy2008 .

ogac calculates pepfar funding as the total of enacted funding for u.s. efforts to combat hiv / aids globally , u.s. efforts to combat tuberculosis internationally , and u.s. contributions to the global fund .

prior to fy2006 , ogac - reported pepfar funding also included u.s. efforts to combat malaria .

then in june 2005 president bush introduced the president's malaria initiative ( pmi ) to expand u.s. government efforts to combat malaria globally .

as a result , ogac excluded malaria funding from pepfar calculations beginning in fy2006 .

since that time , u.s. government spending on malaria has been reported separately .

since the leadership act authorization included malaria programs , the funding data in this report includes malaria and pmi funding .

this report details funding separately for hiv / aids , tb , malaria , and u.s. contributions for the global fund .

on may 30 , 2007 , president bush urged congress to extend pepfar from fy2009 through fy2013 with a $30 billion authorization .

the administration estimated that $30 billion would support treatment for 2.5 million people , the prevention of more than 12 million new infections , and care for more than 12 million people , including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children .

the following section focuses on key proposed changes to u.s. programs that combat hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria globally , as suggested by the april 2 , 2008 , version of the lantos - hyde act ( h.r .

5501 ) that was passed by the house and the july 16 , 2008 , version of the lantos - hyde act ( h.r .

5501 ) that was passed by the senate .

the senate - passed version of h.r .

5501 was subsequently voted on and passed by the house on july 24 , 2008 , and enacted into law on july 30 , 2008 .

this section highlights key proposed requirements and funding allocations included in either version of the bill and discusses the debate surrounding the proposals , including debates about possible policy implementation implications .

on july 24 , 2008 , the house passed the senate version of h.r .

5501 , the tom lantos and henry j. hyde united states global leadership against hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria reauthorization act of 2008 ( lantos - hyde act ) .

the lantos - hyde act ( p.l .

110-293 ) was enacted on july 30 , 2008 .

the lantos - hyde act authorizes $48 billion from fy2009 through fy2013 for u.s. efforts to fight hiv / aids , tb , and malaria globally ( table 4 ) .

it also authorizes $2 billion for an emergency fund for indian health and safety from fy2008 through fy2013 , requiring an emergency plan to address the law enforcement , water , and health care needs of indian tribes and directing the expenditure of the funds for particular purposes .

some experts observe that if congress fully appropriated the authorized amount for tb and malaria ( $9 billion total ) and maintained the fy2004-fy2008 funding level for the global fund ( $3 billion ) , then the remaining authorization for hiv / aids activities would be $36 billion from fy2009 through fy2013 .

others note that the lantos - hyde act included a number of provisions permitting "such sums as necessary" to be expended on several programs , including for u.s. contributions to the global fund .

they say these provisions would allow for greater funding than the stated authorization level if congress chose to fully appropriate the authorized amounts .

the lantos - hyde act also directs a number of key changes to u.s. global hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria programs ( table 5 ) .

the first column of the table corresponds to the key reauthorization proposals and debates discussed in the previous section of this report , which discussed possible policy implementation implications .

the second column of the table describes changes directed by the 110 th congress through the lantos - hyde act .
