the fy2008 energy and water development bill was enacted as division c of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

the omnibus funding measure was passed by congress december 19 , 2007 , and signed by the president december 26 , 2007 .

the act provides $31.4659 billion for energy and water programs , about $1 billion below the fy2007 appropriation and about $500 million above the administration's request .

the bush administration's fy2008 budget request was released in february 2007 .

the house appropriations committee reported out its fy2008 energy and water development appropriations bill , h.r .

2641 , on june 6 , 2007 .

the bill as reported did not contain indications of funding for specific projects .

on june 20 the bill was debated on the house floor , but was not voted on pending submission by the appropriations committee of a supplement specifying funding for individual projects .

that supplement was voted out by the committee july 12 , and the house approved the bill july 17 , 2007 .

the senate subcommittee on energy and water development appropriations approved its version of the bill , s. 1751 , on june 26 , and the full senate appropriations committee approved it june 28 .

energy and water development programs were funded for fy2007 in the revised continuing appropriations resolution , 2007 ( h.j.res .

20 , p.l .

110-5 ) .

on march 16 , 2007 , the department of energy ( doe ) submitted its "operating plan" to congress , detailing funding for individual programs not specifically identified in p.l .

110-5 .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2001 to fy2008 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the bill's four titles .

it also lists several "scorekeeping" adjustments of accounts within the four titles , reflecting various expenditures or sources of revenue besides appropriated funds .

these adjustments affect the total amount appropriated in the bill but are not included in the totals of the individual titles .

amounts listed in this report are derived from the administration's fy2008 congressional budget requests , from h.rept .

110-185 , to accompany h.r .

2641 , from the s.rept .

110-127 , to accompany s. 1751 , and from the explanatory statement for the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act ( h.r .

2764 , p.l .

110-161 ) .

tables 4 through 16 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2005-fy2006 .

p.l .

110-161 provided $5.587 billion for the u.s. army corps of engineers ; it was an increase over the administration's budget request of $4.871 billion and 5% above the fy2007 appropriations ( not including supplemental funds ) of $5.340 billion .

the omnibus funding measure rescinded a total of $4.9 million of prior appropriations for the corps .

funding for the corps' civil works program is often a contentious issue between the administration and congress , with final appropriations typically providing more funding than requested , regardless of which political party controls the white house and congress .

generally around 85% of the appropriations for the agency is directed to specific projects .

often congress will direct funding to projects not included in the administration's request .

the department of the interior requested that congress provide an increase in funding for the central utah project ( cup ) completion account and a reduction for the bureau of reclamation ( bor ) for fy2008 .

the total approved by p.l .

110-161 for title ii funding is $1.1509 billion â€” $149.5 million above the president's request .

the energy and water development bill since fy2005 has funded all doe's programs .

major doe activities historically funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs , and now includes programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics , which formerly had been included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

the administration's fy2008 request for doe programs was $24.7627 billion , compared with $24.2282 billion appropriated for fy2007 .

the final omnibus act provides $24.4466 billion , $218 million above fy2007 but $316 million below the request .

the fy2008 total reflects an across - the - board rescission on all doe programs imposed by section 312 of title iii , division c of the act .

section 312 requires all funding levels in the explanatory statement to be reduced by 1.6% of earmarked funds and 0.91% for all other funding .

summary tables at the end of the explanatory statement reflect the section 312 rescission , but the detailed tables do not .

doe is required to submit a report to the appropriations committees within 30 days with detailed numbers reflecting the rescission .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .
