as congress investigates the issues surrounding the september 11 , 2012 , attacks on u.s. facilities in benghazi , libya , some members have questioned whether security funding was adequate or was a factor that may have contributed to inadequate security at that facility .

the state department basic authorities act of 1956 authorizes the department of state to "use appropriated and other funds to provide the maximum security of u.s. government - owned or leased properties and vehicles abroad. .

after several attacks occurred on u.s. facilities and other american interests in beirut , lebanon and kuwait in the early 1980s , congress passed the diplomatic security act of 1986 , further emphasizing the role the secretary of state plays in providing funding for the security of u.s. diplomatic facilities and personnel worldwide ( hereinafter referred to in this report as diplomatic / embassy security ) .

following the august 1998 bombings of u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania , an independent panel , chaired by admiral william crowe , reported that it was "most disturbed by two inter - connected issues: first , the inadequacy of resources to provide protective measures against terrorist attacks ; and second , the relative low priority accorded security concerns throughout the us government by the congress , the department , other agencies in general , and the part of many employees â€” both in washington and in the field. .

responding to that panel , congress , within the secure embassy construction and counterterrorism act of 1999 ( secca ) , established more stringent security requirements and mandated additional training , authorized $900 million to be spent annually for embassy security , construction , and maintenance ( escm ) for the next five years ( fy2000-fy2004 ) , and mandated the secretary of state to convene an accountability review board ( arb ) whenever serious injury , loss of life , or significant destruction of property occurs .

it required co - location of virtually all agency personnel in a country and 100-foot perimeters around diplomatic facilities , but also provided waiver authority for those measures .

after the september 11 , 2012 , attacks on the u.s. facilities in benghazi , a new arb was convened .

its report , referring to the state department's need for risk mitigation at u.s. facilities around the world , states: for many years the state department has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work , with varying degrees of success .

this has brought about a deep sense of the importance of husbanding resources to meet the highest priorities , laudable in the extreme in any government department .

but it has also had the effect of conditioning a few state department managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation .

experienced leadership , close coordination and agility , timely informed decision making , and adequate funding and personnel resources are essential.... one overall conclusion in this [arb] report is that congress must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary resources to the state department to address security risks and meet mission imperatives .

congress annually appropriates funds for the security of diplomatic personnel and facilities within the department of state , foreign operations and related programs appropriation , which is about 1% of the total federal budget .

security funding amounts to about 9% of that appropriation .

 ( see figure 1 below. ) .

congress has not enacted a stand - alone state department appropriation prior to the start of the fiscal year since 1995 and has not passed a stand - alone foreign relations authorization law since 2002 .

both could have been legislative vehicles for debate regarding administration of foreign affairs , including diplomatic / embassy security funding and priorities .

instead , congress has provided ongoing security funding within continuing resolutions ( crs ) that have delayed by several months the full - year appropriation eventually provided .

funding within a cr is usually based on the previous year's funding levels .

furthermore , if spending was not in the previous - year's appropriation ( as was the case with benghazi in 2012 ) , it would not be funded by a cr .

only after the final appropriation is passed by congress and signed into law by the president would state department officials know what level of funding they can allocate on a daily / weekly / monthly basis over the 275 worldwide diplomatic posts ( or 1,600 work facilities ) and over the remainder of the fiscal year .

congress provides funding for diplomatic / embassy security within the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations .

the bulk ( typically more than 90% ) of the funding is provided by two subaccounts: worldwide security protection ( wsp ) , within the diplomatic and consular programs ( d&cp ) account , and worldwide security upgrades ( wsu ) within the embassy security , construction , and maintenance ( escm ) account .

funds within both of these accounts are typically available until expended .

other appropriations are within the subaccounts diplomatic security ( ds ) and counterterrorism ( both within d&cp ) , and diplomatic security ( ds ) within the border security program ( bsp ) .

a brief description of each follows: wsp , the largest component of security - related funding within department of state appropriations , supports numerous security programs addressing the security of life , property , and information , including a worldwide guard force protecting overseas diplomatic missions and residences , as well as domestic facilities .

in fy2015 , for the first time , many ds - related salaries and related costs from ds and other bureaus have been requested under wsp rather than in diplomatic and consular programs as part of what the department calls a security realignment initiative .

wsu , within escm , provides funding for bricks and mortar - type of security .

it funds the department of state's portion of the capital security cost sharing program that combines with funds from other agencies represented overseas for planning , design and construction of secure new embassy compounds .

it also funds ongoing security activities and security - related maintenance .

the bureau of diplomatic security ( ds ) , funded under d&cp , is the law enforcement and security arm of the department of state .

ds protects people , property , and information .

it conducts international investigations , provides threat analysis , and focuses on cyber security , counterterrorism , personnel security , and security technology .

the bureau manages much of the wsp funding .

the bureau of counterterrorism ( ct ) , funded within d&cp , leads the u.s. government in counterterrorism diplomacy and provides an on - call capability to respond to terrorist incidents worldwide .

funding within the border security program ( bsp ) is allocated to ds to fund the protection of consular affairs facilities in the united states .

the subaccount also funds the coordination and investigation of security issues related to u.s. visas and passports .

the appendix presents annual diplomatic / embassy security requests and actual funding levels from fy2008 to the fy2015 request .

base funding ( also referred to as regular or enduring appropriations ) is available to u.s. facilities worldwide .

total security funding includes the base funding plus supplemental and / or overseas contingency operations ( oco ) funding for diplomatic / embassy security that has been available primarily for iraq , but also for afghanistan and pakistan .

supplemental security funds ( excluding those available only for iraq ) were requested and enacted for fy2008 and fy2009 .

oco funds were requested and enacted for fy2012 , fy2013 , fy2014 , and have been requested for fy2015 .

following are some observations derived from the data shown in the appendix and in the related figures 2-5 : the peak years since fy2008 for requests for security funding and funds that congress made available were in fy2013-fy2015 request , the fiscal years following the benghazi attacks .

 ( see figure 2 . ) .

the fy2015 request represents the largest request for total security funding at $4.7 billion , following recent - year increases in base funding .

oco had been nearly half of the request in fy2013 , but in fy2015 , requests for oco are about one - third of the total .

 ( see figure 3 . ) .

fy2013 and fy2014 were peak years for total security funding made available by congress .

in fy2013 , of the total $4.5 billion , nearly 50% was oco funding , largely because congress provided transfer authority of oco funds previously identified for iraq to be used for broader security needs following the benghazi attacks .

in fy2014 , of the total $4.68 billion , 19% was oco .

 ( see figure 3 . ) .

for total security funding , congress provided less than was requested every year except fy2009 and fy2014 .

the fy2013 total security request was $4.6 billion , including the request for transfer authority of oco funds .

that year , congress provided a total of $4.5 billion , including transfer authority .

 ( see figure 4 . ) .

total security funding as a portion of administration of foreign affairs expenditures was highest ( 40% ) in fy2014 and also was the highest ( 32% ) as a portion of total state department funding that same year .

 ( see figure 5 . ) .

figure 2 illustrates the trend line for state department total diplomatic / embassy security expenditures using data from the appendix .

after trending upward between fy2008 and fy2009 , the funding declined to the recent - year low in fy2011and was virtually flat in fy2012 .

in 2009 , the united states was transitioning control of the "green zone" to the iraqi government .

also that year , president obama announced his intention of ending military operations in 2010 .

with the diminishing role of the u.s. military in iraq and increasing security needs in iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan , congress supported more funds for ds , wsp , and wsu than were sought .

congress provided increased security funding in fy2013 , the fiscal year following the benghazi attacks and the first full fiscal year after the troops left iraq in december 2011 , when security efforts became the responsibility of the department of state .

figure 3 illustrates diplomatic / embassy security funding data from the appendix broken out by base and supplemental / oco funding .

fy2010 and fy2011 were the only years without broadly available security supplemental or oco funds .

 ( there may have been some , not shown below , that were exclusively for iraq , however. ) .

the fy2012 budget provided oco funds for wsp , but not wsu .

fy2013 , starting about three weeks after the benghazi attacks , was the peak year for supplemental / oco and total security funding .

the fy2014 estimates show an increase in enduring funds while oco declines .

the fy2015 request includes more oco funds than were available in the fy2014 estimate , while the total funding is slightly more .

some observers question the increased use of oco , in the absence of newly identified needs , as possibly a way to avoid exceeding the international affairs spending caps established by the budget control act of 2011 .

figure 4 shows administration requests for diplomatic / embassy security were greater than actual funding levels ( including oco and transfer authority ) every year except fy2009 and fy2014 .

for the other years , the smallest funding gap compared with the request was $11.0 million in fy2008 .

the largest gaps between the request and actual funding occurred in fy2011 ( $185.4 million ) and fy2012 ( $236.9 million ) .

while congress appropriated other oco funds for security in iraq , they were not broadly available for security in other facilities .

in fy2013 , the administration sought transfer authority to use $1.419 billion of iraq oco funds for wsp and wsu expenses as part of what it termed an increased security proposal .

in fy2014 , the funds made available that exceeded those requested were mostly wsp oco funds for "extraordinary costs of operations in afghanistan , pakistan , iraq , and other areas of unrest. .

figure 5 illustrates the trends regarding the proportion of expenditures that were allocated toward diplomatic / embassy security out of the administration of foreign affairs ( state operations ) budget and the state department total budget .

these trends mirror those of actual dollars spent over the same years , with the proportions decreasing in fy2011and fy2012 , but expanding in fy2009 with the transition in iraq , and fy2013-fy2014 , the years following the benghazi attack .

some budget analysts regard enacted rather than actual funding as more closely reflecting the intent of congress , since actual funding levels include transfers that occurred at the agency .

worldwide security protection ( wsp ) and worldwide security upgrades ( wsu ) make up the bulk of the diplomatic / embassy security budget and are the only diplomatic / embassy security line - items that appear in the administration's budget request , the department of state , foreign operations and related programs house and senate appropriations legislation , and the enacted appropriations laws .

table 1 provides the administration's requests , as well as house - proposed , senate - proposed , and enacted levels for wsp and wsu from fy2008-fy2014 , in reverse order .

in contrast to actuals in the appendix , fy2014 was the only year that wsp and wsu enacted funding levels were greater than those requested .

for fy2013 which began october 1 , 2012 , less than a month after the benghazi attacks , secretary of state hillary clinton requested transfer authority from congress for $1.4 billion of oco funds previously appropriated for iraq as part of what was termed an increased security proposal .

congress agreed to much of that increase , but sequestration mandated by the budget control act of 2011 was applied to the funds , which caused the enacted levels to be about 3% below what would have been appropriated .

the grand total of wsp and wsu funds requested from fy2008-fy2014 is $220.4 million more than what congress enacted .

congress appropriated 6% less funding than was requested in the years leading up to benghazi , but appropriated 6% more in the years following the attacks .

the senate - proposed security funds exceeded house - proposed levels every year except fy2008 .

the senate levels , however , were not always as much as was requested by the administration , nor as much as appropriated , in some years .

fy2008 was the only year that the house - proposed diplomatic / embassy security funding levels were greater than the administration request , the senate - proposed , or enacted levels .

 ( in fy2014 , the house - proposed levels matched the administration request. ) .

also noteworthy is the delay in the passage of every appropriation from fy2008-fy2014 .

when a new fiscal year starts and appropriations have not been passed and signed into law , congress typically passes continuing resolutions ( crs ) to keep the government funded until a budget is passed .

typically , crs base funding levels for budget accounts on the past - year spending levels , perhaps increasing or decreasing by a certain percentage .

congress has consistently enacted international affairs appropriations long after the start of the fiscal year .

delayed appropriations , some have argued , make planning to meet security and other needs challenging .

in recent years , for example , congress approved and sent its final fy2011 and fy2013 budgets to the president in april and march , respectively , six to seven months into the fiscal year .

another concern expressed by foreign affairs budget experts is the combining of several or all appropriations into an omnibus , consolidated , or full - year continuing resolution that occurred every year from fy2008-fy2014 .

passage of stand - alone state - foreign operations appropriations legislation , analysts suggest , provides a greater opportunity for congressional oversight and deliberation on sensitive issues , such as security spending .

 ( see table 1 below. ) .

complexities surrounding the security funds available for benghazi include whether the facility was designated as temporary , the date its lease would be up , and the timing of available funding , among other things .

officials at the department of state may disagree as to what qualifies as a temporary facility and what funds are available to those facilities .

for example , overseas building operations ( obo ) uses temporary to mean those facilities that can be moved , such as trailers and modular structures .

other state department officials may use temporary to mean short - term .

a senate committee report on the benghazi attack found that because the benghazi facility was designated as temporary , no security standards applied to it .

furthermore , additional physical barriers to enter the facility were not in place due to time and money constraints .

the lack of dedicated security resources for benghazi contributed to those constraints , according to the report .

compounding the definitional issue is that the state department lacks a process to re - evaluate security at temporary facilities that are being used longer than first anticipated .

the benghazi facility was first opened in 2011 and was to close later that year .

in december 2011 , the state department decided to extend the benghazi mission until december 2012 .

the department did make note of needed corrective security measures for the mission and made a number of security enhancements [using wsp funds] .

 ( see table 2 below. ) .

according to the benghazi arb report , "obo does not fund security upgrades [escm / wsu] for 'temporary' facilities. .

appearing to support that statement , the senate select committee on intelligence said in its january 15 , 2014 report: "... the uncertain future of the [benghazi] mission facility , due to its one - year expiration in december 2012 , contributed to a lack of continuity for security staff , and constrained decision - makers in washington regarding the allocation of security enhancements to that facility. .

differing views on the definition of "temporary" and the related eligibility for security funding has led to confusion about whether or not the benghazi facility qualified for wsu funding .

according to state department officials , the facilities in benghazi would have been eligible for the compound security program under wsu funding .

although escm / wsu does not fund security upgrades for temporary facilities , it does fund security upgrades for permanent facilities .

for the purposes of funding , the department defines temporary facilities as those that are not permanent structures , such as modular units or structures that can be relocated .

the facilities in benghazi were permanent structures .

based on that definition , lease terms or length of mission would not determine the qualification to use wsu funding .

according to state department officials , obo received no requests to execute or fund a compound security upgrade in benghazi with wsu funding .

with regard to the available funding in fy2012 , according to the department of state , the benghazi facilities were short - term leased residential villas that were used for housing and office space .

the leases for the three villas in benghazi ( $336,000 / year , $168,000 / year , and $336,000 / year ) were funded from fy2012 escm appropriations .

wsp funds were available and were used for security enhancements prior to the attack .

delayed enactment of appropriations also may have had consequences for the implementation of security upgrades .

according to one senate committee report , a state department regional security officer ( rso ) stated that continuing resolutions had two detrimental effects on efforts to improve security in benghazi .

first , the department of state would only allow funds to be expended at a rate of 80 percent of the previous year's appropriations level , so as not to risk a violation of the anti - deficiency act [not obligating more than may eventually be appropriated by congress] .

second , in the absence of a supplemental appropriation or reprogramming request , security funds for benghazi had to be taken 'out of hide' from funding levels for libya because benghazi was not included in the previous budget .
