this report provides a simplified explanation of the meaning of "tax basis," the factors that determine a taxpayer's tax basis , and some of the ways in which tax basis is used .

it is intended to address some situations encountered by individual taxpayers and small businesses .

it does not address tax basis as it applies to corporate assets nor as it applies to shareholders' basis in stock received in exchange for property contributed to a corporation .

the tax basis and sale of inventory is also outside of the scope of this report , as is the basis of property that is converted from personal use to business use .

the basis rules are found in the internal revenue code ( i.r.c. ) .

â§â§ 1011 - 1023 .

this report is only a general overview of a very complex topic .

tax basis is the amount that a taxpayer can use as the cost of property that is sold , abandoned , or given away .

when property is sold , taxpayers must report gain if the amount received for the property is more than the property's tax basis .

gain must be reported even if the property was only used for personal purposes .

when the tax basis is more than the property's sales price , the result is a loss .

however , the loss generally cannot be used on a tax return if the property was only used for personal purposes .

when property is abandoned , a taxpayer who used the property to produce income may be able to deduct the basis of the property on the tax return for the year in which the property is abandoned .

when property is given as a gift to another person , the donor's basis is important because it affects the recipient's basis in the property .

there are basically three ways of acquiring property: purchase , inheritance , and gift .

the basis of property depends on how it was acquired .

a taxpayer's basis in property may be increased or decreased after the property is acquired .

the most common situation in which the basis in property is decreased is when the taxpayer uses the property for work or business and is allowed to take a deduction for tax purposes .

the most common situation in which the basis in property is increased is when the owner improves the property and incurs expenses in making the improvements .

basis determines whether there is a gain or loss when property is sold .

for business - use property , basis is one factor used to determine allowable depreciation .

depreciation for business - use property is based on the property's basis and its "class - life. .

if improvements are made to the property , those improvements are depreciated separately from the original property , but the adjusted basis of the improvements increases the adjusted basis in the property when it is sold .

when property is sold , the gain or loss is determined by subtracting the adjusted basis of the property from the sales price .

if the difference is greater than zero , there is a taxable gain .

if less than zero , there is a loss , but its deductibility for tax purposes will depend upon whether the property was used for business , investment , or personal purposes .

the taxable gain generally is the difference between the sales price and the adjusted basis , but the gain can be reduced by expenses incurred in selling the property .

this is true whether the property was business - use property or only used for personal purposes .

gain calculation example .

a man received a stuffed animal costing $2 as a gift from his parents thirty years ago .

this man has now discovered that this particular toy is considered rare and valuable and decides to sell it on an internet auction site .

the man's adjusted basis in the toy is $2âhis parents' basis when they gave it to him .

the sales price is $150 .

the difference is $148 , but he had to pay $15 to the auction site and $5 to ship the toy to the buyer .

his gain on the sale is $128 ( $150 - $2 - $15 - $5 = $128 ) .

calculating losses is done in a similar way ; however , only losses generated by business - or investment - use property can reduce taxable income .

losses on personal - use property cannot be deducted .

sales expenses increase the amount of loss .

loss calculation exampleâbusiness - use property .

a landscaper owns a large mower that was purchased for $2,500 in july 2005 .

the allowed and allowable depreciation is $1,775 for the period of ownership and use .

thus , the adjusted basis is $775 ( $2,500 - $1,775 = $775 ) .

an advertisement costing $50 was placed in the local paper to sell the mower .

the mower was sold for $500 .

the landscaper's tax return will report a $325 loss from the sale of the mower ( $500 - $775 = - $275 ; - $275 - $50 = - $325 ) .

loss calculation exampleâpersonal - use property .

a couple received a china gravy boat as a wedding present .

the gift cost $150 .

they received no other china in the pattern they had chosen and have realized they will not be using the gravy boat .

so they list the gravy boat on an internet auction site .

when the bidding closes , the winning bid is only $100 .

the fee for the auction site is $10 and it cost another $15 to ship the gravy boat to the buyer .

there is a $75 loss on the sale ( $100 - $150 = - $50 ; - $50 - ( $10 + $15 ) = - $75 ) .

since the gravy boat was personal - use property , the loss cannot be claimed on the couple's tax return ; however , the $100 received is not included in gross income .

 ( this is why money generated by a personal garage sale is generally not includible in income for tax purposes. ) .

gifts , as noted earlier , are complex .

in some cases , property received as a gift may be sold with no resulting gain or loss .

this occurs when the sale price is more than the property's fmv at the time of the gift , but less than the donor's basis .

example of no gain , no loss saleâsale price less than donor ' s basis , but more than fmv at the time of the gift .

refer to the earlier example where son received a desk from mom .

the donor's basis was $400 , but fmv at the time of the gift was $300 .

if son sells the desk for $325 , he will have no gain and no loss: donor's basis is used to calculate gainâ$325 - $400 = - $75 , so there is no gain ; fmv at the time of the gift is used to calculate lossâ$325 - $300 = $25 , so there is no loss .
