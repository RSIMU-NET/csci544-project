established as part of the balanced budget act of 1997 ( p.l .

105-33 ) , the sustainable growth rate ( sgr ) is the statutory method for determining the annual updates to the medicare physician fee schedule ( mpfs ) .

in essence , if actual expenditures are within a "sustainable" expenditure target , payment updates are calculated according to a predetermined formula .

if , however , the actual experience exceeds the sustainable target , future updates are reduced to bring spending back in line with the target over time .

in the first few years of the sgr system , the actual expenditures did not exceed the targets and the updates to the physician fee schedule were close to the medicare economic index ( mei , a price index of inputs required to produce physician services ) .

beginning in 2002 , the actual expenditure exceeded allowed targets , and the discrepancy has grown with each year .

however , with the exception of 2002 , when a 4.8% decrease was applied , congress has enacted a series of laws to override the reductions .

from 2003 through april 2014 , 17 laws have been passed that override the sgr - mandated reductions in the mpfs ( see table 1 ) .

these laws have provided short - term "patches" of as long as two years ( medicare modernization act , mma , p.l .

108-173 , from 2003 through 2004 ) and as short as one month ( the temporary extension act , p.l .

111-144 , from march 1-31 , 2010 , and the physician payment and therapy relief act of 2010 , p.l .

111-286 , from december 1-31 , 2010 ) .

the sgr - override bills passed into law generally have either kept payments at the current level ( by providing for a 0% change ) or increased payment levels from 0.2% to 2.2% ( see table 1 ) .

when actual spending exceeds target spending under the sgr calculation , current statute requires that the overage be recouped to bring actual spending back in line with target spending .

under the sgr system , this additional spending would be recouped by reductions to payment rates in subsequent years .

as cbo explains , if the sgr system were allowed to function as established , "over the long run the cumulative cost would be close to zero , because allowing the sgr formula to be implemented would lead to recapturing the additional spending that occurred during the period when the sgr was overridden. .

the statutory language that established the sgr system also included a limit ( 7% decrease ) on how much payment levels could change from year to year , to temper any potential disruptive impacts .

 ( following such a course was described as a "clawback" approach. ) .

the aggregate effect of several years of overrides meant that the cumulative overage continued to grow , leading to an alternate ( "cliff" ) approach .

with each override , medicare physician expenditures continued to grow faster than the target level , as set forth under the law .

with the aforementioned limit on how much payment levels could change from year to year , the length of time required to recoup the overage grew with each override ( specifically , the period required to recoup the overage and not incur a cumulative cost began to exceed 10 years ) .

beginning with the tax relief and health care act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-432 ) and with each override act since , the legislation has specified that the payment rate update in the year that the override expires "shall be calculated as if that freeze ( or increase ) had not been enacted. .

as cbo notes , "unlike clawback legislation , which limits future rate reductions to no more than 7 percent in any given year , cliff provisions can result in a very large rate reduction in the year following a short - term rate adjustment. .

in recent years , cms actuaries have estimated "cliff" reductions of 27.4% ( for january 1 , 2012 ) , 26.5% ( for january 1 , 2013 ) , and 20.1% ( for january 1 , 2014 ) .

each of these was averted by congressional action .

this has happened three times: the temporary extension act ( p.l .

111-144 ) was signed into law on march 2 , 2010 , after the prior override expired on february 28 , 2010 ; the continuing extension act ( p.l .

111-157 ) was signed into law on april 15 , after the prior override expired on march 31 , 2010 ; and the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act ( p.l .

111-192 ) was signed into law on june 25 , 2010 , after the prior override expired on may 31 , 2010 .

medicare is prohibited from paying electronic claims earlier than the 14 th day after the date of receipt and from paying non - electronic claims earlier than the 29 th day after the date of receipt .

thus , the first two instances required no additional action by congress ; however , the third instance required a provision that made the sgr payment override retroactive to june 1 , 2010 .

there are two primary reasons why this problem persists: ( 1 ) although a number of proposals to replace the sgr system have been proposed , there has been no consensus nor broad support for any long - run alternative until recently ( see below ) , and ( 2 ) the cost of any permanent change has been daunting because the cbo baseline must assume current law , which in recent years has estimated that a reduction in payment rates under the mpfs would occur for several subsequent years .

in addition to the impact on federal outlays , any change in the payment update formula would also have implications for beneficiaries ; because part b beneficiary premiums must cover about 25% of part b program costs , any overall increase in spending results in a proportional increase in premiums .

the lack of a viable alternative payment model has hampered attempts to repeal and replace the sgr system .

repealing the sgr system would require the adoption of an additional method for determining how medicare physician payments would be modified from year to year .

given that the sgr was created to replace another system that failed to constrain the rate of growth in medicare physician expenditures ( medicare volume performance standard , or mvps ) , attempts to create an update methodology that would successfully contain medicare growth have so far been unproven .

while the sgr methodology determines the change in the medicare physician payments from year to year , it does not determine the basis for those payments .

while the current mpfs is a fee - for - service based payment system ( i.e. , doctors are paid for each service they provide ) , an "sgr - type" methodology also could be applied to payments based on alternate payment systems , including bundled payments for episodes of care , capitation payments , performance - or incentive - based payments , or some other payment system .

given the acknowledged shortcoming of fee - for - service based payment , which rewards the volume of care provided while being indifferent to the quality of care , most efforts to repeal the sgr system have been closely tied to medicare physician payment reform .

however , there are few ( if any ) comprehensive alternative payment models that have proven successful at providing incentives for high - quality care while tempering the growth rate of health care expenditures .

for many years , the cost of sgr repeal has contributed to the lack of progress in repealing and replacing the status quo .

for example , in 2007 , cbo testified that , depending on the replacement method for determining year - to - year changes in the payment rates , the 10-year impact on direct federal spending could range from $177.4 billion ( for a 10-year freeze of the payment level ) , to $262.1 billion ( for an automatic increase tied to the medicare economic index [mei] , an index similar to the cpi but based on medical care inputs ) , to $330.5 billion ( for an automatic increase based on mei together with a hold - harmless provision to protect beneficiaries from higher premiums as a result of the higher level of medicare physician spending ) .

in recent years , cbo scores for sgr repeal have been lower ( see next question ) .

repealing or fixing the sgr could be costly from a federal budgetary perspective , although recent cbo estimates of replacement proposals have fluctuated .

 ( see table 2 . ) .

in summary , cbo scores for a 10-year freeze of mpfs payment levels were lower in 2013 and 2014 compared with 2012 estimates , but 2015 estimates have been increasing , even when adjusted for the additional year in the estimate window .

on february 5 , 2013 , cbo released a report stating that its estimate of the cost of overriding the sgr with a 10-year freeze in payments had fallen to $138.0 billion compared with its july 2012 estimate of $273.3 billion .

the cost of "holding payment rates through 2023 at the levels they are [in 2013] would raise outlays for medicare ( net of premiums paid by beneficiaries ) by $14 billion in 2014 and about $138 billion ( or about 2 percent ) between 2014 and 2023. .

cbo provided the following reasoning for the reduced cost: the estimated cost of holding payment rates constant is much lower relative to this baseline than was the case under previous cbo baselines , primarily because of lower spending for physicians' services in recent years .

under the sustainable growth rate , future payment updates depend on the difference between spending in prior years and spending targets established in law .

actual spending has been lower than projectedâand lower than the spending targets inherent in the sustainable growth rateâfor the past three years .

because actual spending has been lower than spending targets , cbo now estimates that payment rates will increase beginning in 2015 .

those higher payment rates narrow the difference between growth under current law and a freeze at current levels , thereby reducing the estimated cost of restricting the payment rates .

cbo's may 2013 baseline projections raised the estimate slightly to $139.1 billion for a 10-year freeze .

in december 2013 , cbo issued another score indicating that a 10-year freeze in mpfs payment levels would add $116.5 billion over 10 years .

a november 2014 document showed a score of $118.9 for a 10-year freeze .

on february 3 , 2015 , cbo released a document showing that the cost of an 11âyear freeze ( 2015-2025 ) in mpfs payment levels would add $137.4 billion to direct spending ; with 1% increases in the payment level each year through 2025 , the score would increase to $191.8 billion .

on march 12 , 2015 , the cbo released a score of the president's fy2016 budget , which included a score of $141.9 billion for an 11-year freeze of mpfs payments .

each of the three committees of jurisdiction passed bills in 2013 that would repeal the sgr system for determining medicare physician payment updates .

on july 22 , 2013 , the energy and commerce committee passed h.r .

2810 , the medicare patient access and quality improvement act of 2013 , by a 51-0 vote .

on december 12 , 2013 , the senate finance committee passed s. 1871 , the sgr repeal and medicare beneficiary access improvement act of 2013 , by unanimous voice vote , and the ways and means committee passed h.r .

2810 , the medicare patient access and quality improvement act of 2013 .

while there are differences among the three bills , they share several overarching concepts .

first , each of the bills would provide an initial period of payment stability: the energy and commerce bill would increase mpfs payments by 0.5% each year from 2014 to 2018 , the senate finance committee bill would freeze the payments ( 0% increase ) for 10 years from 2014 to 2023 , and the ways and means bill would increase payments by 0.5% in 2015 and 2016 .

second , they each establish the development of new payment systems while maintaining fee - for - service payment in a manner similar to the existing system .

third , they each create incentives for physicians to transition to the new payment systems over time , generally by establishing different rates of increase over time for the new payment systems compared to fee - for - service .

while these bills are generally non - specific about the details of the new payment systems , the bills establish criteria for the adoption and dissemination of such models , with attention to the ability of the new payment system to achieve broad provider participation , attract covered beneficiaries , and reduce spending while maintaining quality of care or improving quality of care without increasing spending .

the bills also vary in which non - sgr provisions are included ; s. 1871 includes several health care and human service program extenders ( including provisions in medicare , medicaid , and chip ) .

these are provisions that extend current policies beyond current expiration dates .

h.r .

2810 as reported by the energy and commerce committee includes provisions that would modify evidentiary rules and practices regarding medical malpractice claims .

none of these bills include budgetary offsets .

on february 6 , 2014 , h.r .

4015 and s. 2000 , the sgr repeal and medicare provider payment modernization act of 2014 , were introduced in the house and senate , respectively .

h.r .

4015 and s. 2000 proposed five years of 0.5% payment increases for the medicare physician fee schedule before freezing payments at that level for five additional years .

changes to the payment level in subsequent years would be determined by many factors , including participation in alternative payment models ( apm ) and provider performance in the newly created merit - based incentive payment system ( mips ) for those who choose to remain in the fee - for - service payment system .

mips would subsume some of the current physician payment incentives ( eg , the meaningful use criteria for electronic health records and the value - based payment modifier ) , while others would be sunset ( eg , certain quality reporting incentives ) .

as an incentive for providers to choose to participate in alternate payment models , payment rate increases would be greater for apms ( 1.0% per year beginning in 2024 ) than for the ffs / mips system ( 0.5% per year beginning in 2024 ) .

on march 11 , 2014 , the medicare sgr repeal and beneficiary access improvement act of 2014 ( s. 2110 ) was introduced in the senate .

title i of s. 2110 is identical to s. 2000 , while title ii includes provisions that would extend various medicare , medicaid , and other human services programs .

h.r .

4015 was passed by the house on march 14 , 2014 , and includes an offset through an amendment introduced by then - chairman camp .

the cbo scores for recent bills reflect a range of costs , with title i of s. 1871 ( dealing with the sgr ) adding $111.5 billion to direct federal spending from 2014 to 2023 , while h.r .

2810 as considered by the ways and means committee would add $121 billion .

cbo initially scored h.r .

2810 as reported by the energy and commerce committee as adding $175 billion over the same period , but revised the figure to $146 billion , reflecting subsequently enacted legislation as well as modifications specified in the physician fee schedule final rule for 2014 .

cbo has scored s. 2000 and h.r .

4015 ( as introduced ) as adding $138.4 billion to direct spending from 2014 to 2024 ( 11 years , rather than the typical 10 ) .

s. 2110 , which includes many health care program extenders , would increase direct federal spending by $180.2 billion over 11 years .

on february 3 , 2015 , cbo updated the estimate of h.r .

4015 and s. 2000 as introduced on february 6 , 2014 .

the new estimate , reflecting an 11-year ( 2015-2025 ) window 1 year later than the prior score , increased to $174.5 billion .

only h.r .

4015 , as passed by the house on march 14 , 2014 , includes an offset through an amendment introduced by then - chairman camp .

this proposed offset would delay the penalty for the individual mandate under the aca for five years .

the cbo scored the amended version of h.r .

4015 as reducing direct federal spending by $31.1 billion over the 11 years from 2014 to 2024 , as the delay of the individual mandate penalty would reduce spending by $169.5 billion , more than offsetting the direct cost of the sgr repeal and replace provisions ( $138.4 billion ) .

there is no clear answer to this question , largely because ( 1 ) not all doc fix bills have been offset , and ( 2 ) every doc fix bill has contained additional provisions that added to direct federal spending .

in some cases , the amount of the sgr override was a small percentage of the overall bill ( eg , mma , which created the part d benefit ) .

in recent years , the doc fix bills have included provisions that have extended expiring health care programs .

for instance , s. 2110 contains several health care program extenders , as does s. 1871 , which was reported by the finance committee .

however , s. 2000 , h.r .

2810 , and h.r .

4015 do not include any provisions extending health care programs about to expire .

the override bill that was eventually passed ( the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 ; p.l .

113-93 ) included some health program extenders .

the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 ( p.l .

113-67 ) , division b of the continuing resolution act ( h.j.res .

59 ) , provided for a 0.5% increase in mpfs payments for january 1 , 2014 , through march 31 , 2014 .

the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 ( pama ; p.l .

113-93 ) extended this override , at the existing payment level , through march 31 , 2015 .

on january 21 and 22 , 2015 , the health subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee held a two - day hearing entitled , "a permanent solution to the sgr: the time is now. .

while committee members and witnesses were unanimous in their stated desire to find a permanent replacement for the sgr , there was no consensus on whether the cost should be fully , partially , or not at all offset .

on march 13 , 2015 , the chairs and ranking members of the house ways and means and the energy and commerce committees released a "bipartisan joint committee statement on the sustainable growth rate" that included the following: last year , the ways and means and energy and commerce committees came together , on a bipartisan basis , to propose a permanent alternative to the broken sgr system .

we are now engaging in active discussions on a bipartisan basisâfollowing up on the work done by leadershipâto try to achieve an effective permanent resolution to the sgr problem , strengthen medicare for our seniors , and extend the popular children's health insurance program .

should congress not come to agreement on a bill that the president signs into law ( whether it be the outcome of the current negotiations or a separate bill altogether ) , another temporary patch would be required if congress wants to override the reduction in the mpfs set to occur on april 1 , 2015 .
