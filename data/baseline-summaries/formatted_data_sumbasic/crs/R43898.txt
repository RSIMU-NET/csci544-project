there are dozens of temporary tax provisions in the internal revenue code ( irc ) , many of which had expired at the end of 2014 .

recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions , and , in some cases , made temporary provisions permanent .

the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) , signed into law on january 2 , 2013 , reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most of the tax cuts first enacted in 2001 and 2003 and permanently indexing the alternative minimum tax ( amt ) for inflation .

atra , however , did not eliminate uncertainty in the tax code .

under atra , a number of provisions that had been allowed to expire at the end of 2011 or 2012 were temporarily extended through 2013 .

most of the provisions that expired at the end of 2013 were retroactively extended for one year , through 2014 , in the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-295 ) .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , signed into law on december 18 , 2015 , either made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014 .

collectively , temporary tax provisions that are regularly extended by congress rather than being allowed to expire as scheduled are often referred to as "tax extenders. .

many of these "tax extender" provisions have been temporarily extended multiple times .

the research tax credit , for example , was extended 16 times since being enacted in 1981 , before being modified and made permanent in p.l .

114-113 .

most of the temporary tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014 were previously extended more than once .

in the 114 th congress , much of the debate on tax extenders focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent , or temporarily extended .

in p.l .

114-113 , all expired tax provisions were extended , either temporarily or by being made permanent .

making a number of expired provisions permanent reduced uncertainty in the tax code , by reducing the number of temporary provisions scheduled to expire .

however , as not all expired provisions were made permanent , there are still a number of tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016 .

debate in the second half of the 114 th congress may address whether the provisions set to expire at the end of 2016 should be extended .

this report provides a broad overview of the tax extenders .

additional information on specific extender provisions may be found in other crs reports , including the following: crs report r43510 , selected recently expired business tax provisions ( "tax extenders" ) , by [author name scrubbed] , [author name scrubbed] , and [author name scrubbed] ; crs report r43688 , selected recently expired individual tax provisions ( "tax extenders" ) : in brief , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] ; crs report r43517 , recently expired charitable tax provisions ( "tax extenders" ) : in brief , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] ; crs report r43541 , recently expired community assistance - related tax provisions ( "tax extenders" ) : in brief , by [author name scrubbed] ; and crs report r43449 , recently expired housing related tax provisions ( "tax extenders" ) : in brief , by [author name scrubbed] .

the consolidated omnibus appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) contained , as division q , the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 ( path act ) .

the path act either temporarily extended or made permanent all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014 .

further , the path act also made permanent the enhanced child tax credit , the enhanced american opportunity tax credit , and the enhanced earned income tax credit , which were scheduled to expire in 2017 .

the path act also included a two - year moratorium on the medical device excise tax .

division p of p.l .

114-113 also contained tax - related provisions , including changes to and a two - year moratorium on the high - cost employer - sponsored health coverage excise tax , a one - year moratorium on the annual fee on health insurance providers , extensions of tax credits for wind renewable power facilities and solar energy , and changes to the section 199 deduction for independent oil refineries .

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 , passed late in the 113 th congress , extended expiring tax provisions for one year , retroactively through 2014 .

other legislation considered in the 113 th congress proposed a two - year extension — the expiring provisions improvement reform and efficiency ( expire ) act ( s. 2260 ) .

legislation was also considered that would have made certain expiring provisions permanent — see , for example , the jobs for america act ( h.r .

4 ) and the america gives more act of 2014 ( h.r .

4719 ) .

tax reform legislation introduced in the 113 th congress , the tax reform act of 2014 ( h.r .

1 ) , proposed to make permanent certain provisions that are currently part of the tax extenders , including the research and experimentation ( r&d ) tax credit and increased expensing allowances for certain businesses allowed under internal revenue code ( irc ) section 179 .

in the 114 th congress , the house had passed legislation that would permanently extend certain expired provisions ( america's small business tax relief act of 2015 [ h.r .

636 ] , state and local sales tax deduction fairness act of 2015 [ h.r .

622 ] , america gives more act of 2015 [ h.r .

644 ] , and american research and competitiveness act of 2015 [ h.r .

880 ] ) .

the tax relief extension act of 2015 ( s. 1946 ) , as reported by the senate committee on finance , would have extended the temporary provisions that expired at the end of 2014 for two years , making the provisions available for the 2015 and 2016 tax year .

s. 1946 would have extended all temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 , as well as one provision that expired at the end of 2013 .

the tax code presently contains dozens of temporary tax provisions .

in the past , legislation to extend some set of these expiring provisions has been referred to by some as the "tax extender" package .

while there is no formal definition of a "tax extender," the term has regularly been used to refer to the package of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by congress .

oftentimes , these expiring provisions are temporarily extended for a short period of time ( eg , one or two years ) .

over time , as new temporary provisions have been routinely extended and hence added to this package , the number of provisions that might be considered "tax extenders" has grown .

dozens of temporary tax provisions had expired at the end of 2014 , all of which were extended in p.l .

114-113 ( see table 1 ) .

most of these provisions have been extended as part of previous "tax extender" legislation .

for the purposes of this report , provisions that expired in 2014 have been classified as belonging to one of four categories: individual , business , charitable , or energy .

the following sections provide additional details .

table 1 also includes information on the cost of the extension in p.l .

114-113 , as enacted .

as discussed above , congress has regularly acted to temporarily extend expired or expiring tax provisions .

in addition to temporarily extending expired provisions , p.l .

114-113 also made certain provisions permanent .

as a result , the cost of the tax extenders in p.l .

114-113 was higher than the cost of other tax extenders proposals considered in the 114 th congress that would not have included permanent extensions .

as discussed above , the tax extenders legislation that was passed in december 2015 , as part of p.l .

114-113 , made permanent a number of temporary tax provisions , while temporarily extending other expired tax provisions .

earlier in the 114 th congress , the house had considered proposals to make permanent certain expired tax provisions .

legislation was also reported out of the senate committee on finance that would temporarily extend expired tax provisions .

during the 113 th congress , the house had also considered legislation to make permanent certain expired tax provisions .

before p.l .

114-113 was signed into law , there was other action on extenders in the 114 th congress .

the senate finance committee reported the tax relief extension act of 2015 ( s. 1946 ) , which would retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years , through 2016 .

the house had passed legislation to make permanent eight of the temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 ( see table 3 ) .

america's small business tax relief act of 2015 ( h.r .

636 ) would have made permanent the enhanced expensing allowances under section 179 and also included the text from bills that would extend expired s corporation provisions ( the permanent s corporation built - in gains recognition period act of 2015 [h.r .

629] and the permanent s corporation charitable contribution act of 2015 [h.r .

630] ) .

three expired charitable provisions were part of the america gives more act of 2015 ( h.r .

644 ) : ( 1 ) the enhanced deduction for contributions of food inventory ; ( 2 ) the provision allowing for tax - free distributions from individual retirement accounts ( iras ) for charitable purposes ; and ( 3 ) the special rules for contributions of capital gain real property for conservation purposes .

the american research and competitiveness act of 2015 ( h.r .

880 ) would have modified and made permanent the research tax credit .

legislation had also passed the house that would have made permanent the option to deduct state and local sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes ( h.r .

622 ) .

taken together , these eight measures would have cost $317.5 billion over the 10-year budget window , excluding potential macroeconomic effects .

in addition to the proposals to make permanent expired tax provisions that were passed in the house , the committee on ways and means had reported other legislation during the 114 th congress that would have made permanent other expired provisions ( see table 3 ) .

during the 113 th congress , various bills were considered to either extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions .

ultimately , a one - year "tax extenders" bill was passed and enacted late in the year ( the tax increase prevention act of 2014 [p.l .

113-295] was signed into law on december 19 , 2014 ) .

earlier in the year , the senate finance committee had reported a two - year extenders package , the expiring provisions improvement reform and efficiency ( expire ) act ( s. 2260 ) .

the expire act proposed extending most expiring provisions for two years , through 2015 .

the house also considered legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent during the 113 th congress .

as noted in table 3 , the house passed legislation that would have made permanent nine provisions that are currently part of the tax extenders .

taken together , permanently extending these nine provisions would have reduced revenues by an estimated $511.4 billion over the 10-year budget window .

six of these nine provisions were included in the jobs for america act ( h.r .

4 ) , which also passed the house in the 113 th congress .

three other charitable - related provisions were passed as part of the america gives more act of 2014 ( h.r .

4719 ) .

the committee on ways and means reported legislation during the 113 th congress that would have made two additional international - related extender provisions permanent , although this legislation was not considered in the full house .

several provisions that had expired at the end of 2013 were not extended as part of the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-295 ) .

two of these provisions would have been extended in the expire act , but were not included in p.l .

113-295 : the health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric - drive motorcycles and three - wheeled vehicles .

both of these provisions have been extended in subsequent legislation .

the health coverage tax credit had not been extended as part of past "tax extenders" legislation .

the health coverage tax credit was first enacted , without an expiration date , as part of the trade act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-240 ) .

a january 1 , 2014 , termination date was enacted as part of an act to extend the generalized system of preferences in 2011 ( p.l .

112-40 ) .

the health coverage tax credit was modified and retroactively extended through december 31 , 2019 , as part of the trade preferences extension act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-27 ) , signed into law on june 29 , 2015 .

the other provision that was not extended in p.l .

113-295 , but would have been extended by the expire act , was the credit for electric - drive motorcycles and three - wheeled vehicles .

in recent years , a number of incentives have been available for various alternative technology vehicles .

there are currently incentives available for plug - in electric vehicles .

incentives for most other alternative technology vehicles have expired .

the credit for two - wheeled electric plug - in vehicles was extended through 2016 in p.l .

114-113 .

two other energy - related provisions were not extended past their january 1 , 2014 , termination date: the placed - in - service date for partial expensing of certain refinery property and the credit for energy efficient appliances .

the expire act did not propose extending either of these provisions .

two disaster - related provisions that expired at the end of 2013 — one that provided tax - exempt bond financing authority for facilities in the new york liberty zone and another related to the replacement period for nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by the 2008 midwestern storms — were not extended in p.l .

113-295 .

the expire act also did not include an extension for these disaster - related provisions .
