while the idea of public financing of federal elections was first proposed in 1907 , it was not until the 1950s that bills were first introduced in congress to implement such a plan .

since that time , legislative proposals have been offered in nearly every congress , while the extent of legislative activity around the issue has varied according to the political climate and circumstances .

in two very active periods , bills to extend public financing to congressional elections have passed one or both houses but were never enacted .

in the first period , during the 93 rd congress ( 1973-1974 ) , the senate twice passed bills for public funding in congressional elections , widely seen as a response to the unfolding watergate scandal .

in 1973 , a bill was passed providing full subsidies ( equal to mandatory spending limits ) to major party candidates in house and senate general elections .

in 1974 , a bill was passed providing matching funds in house and senate primaries and full subsidies ( equal to the voluntary spending limits ) to major party candidates in house and senate general elections .

both provisions were later deleted in conference , in view of some strong opposition in the house .

in the second period , the 100 th through 103 rd congresses ( 1987-1993 ) , the house and senate spent considerable amounts of time debating bills that featured the twin ideas of voluntary spending limits and public financing .

in the 101 st , 102 nd , and 103 rd congresses , both chambers actually passed such bills ; the 102 nd congress bill was vetoed by president george h.w .

bush , but the bills in the other two congresses were never reconciled in conference .

in contrast to the first period , when one of the senate - passed bills covered both primary and general elections , bills in the second period offered benefits only for general election candidates .

more broadly , efforts in the more recent period reflected a move toward paring down the level of public treasury funds going to campaigns , in light of a less favorable political climate .

the emphasis in this second period shifted from public funds per se to public benefits .

public benefits were those either financed with public resources — whether directly , as with public subsidies , or indirectly , as with revenue forgone from tax incentives or postal discounts — or mandated by government action , such as requirements for reduced broadcast rates , at no cost to the u.s. treasury .

the common element was that they all constituted incentives to participation in a voluntary system based on campaign spending limits .

surveys indicate that americans generally support campaign finance "reform" ( generally meaning more regulation of money in politics ) and are concerned about the amount of money in campaigns .

nonetheless , public opinion about campaign finance can be contradictory .

these patterns are evident in the relatively limited available data about attitudes on public financing .

historically , surveys reveal that large pluralities or even majorities of americans support public financing in principle , but are hesitant to invest tax dollars to facilitate public financing .

these findings indicate that the wording , source , and timing of individual questions vary greatly and can affect campaign finance polling results , as is always the case with survey research , regardless of topic .

majorities tend to support public financing when asked questions suggesting favorable information about public financing , or in surveys conducted for pro - reform clients .

on the other hand , majorities tend to respond negatively to questions focusing on costs of public financing or taxation .

survey respondents say that they are neutral or positive toward public financing if question wording suggests that public financing can limit the influence of "special interests" or campaign costs .

on the other hand , survey questions that emphasize spending "taxpayer dollars" to support public financing often yield disapproval from respondents .

americans have been more willing in polls to support public financing after perceived scandals , such as during the 1970s and 1990s .

in gallup polling conducted between 1972 and 1996 , between 50% and 65% of respondents favored "provid[ing] a fixed amount of money" for presidential and congressional campaigns , while banning private contributions .

similarly , in a 1997 washington post poll , 49% of campaign contributors answered favorably when asked if they would "favor or oppose having all federal elections financed out of public funds , with strict limits on how much each candidate for president , us senator or congressman could spend" ; 48% were opposed .

in the same poll , but with spending limits omitted from question wording , only 26% responded favorably when asked whether they would "favor or oppose the federal government financing presidential and congressional elections out of tax money. .

the polling data reviewed above illustrate that americans have more consistently supported containing campaign spending — a hallmark of public financing programs — than public funding per se .

for example , in a 1997 new york times / cbs news poll , 60% of respondents said that "limit[ing] the amount of money that campaigns can spend" should be a "top" or "high" priority within campaign finance reform efforts .

in a gallup poll from the same year , 79% of respondents favored "putting a limit on the amount of money" congressional candidates could "raise and spend on their political campaigns. .

however , like all survey questions , answers to spending questions are also affected by wording .

for example , in a 1999 nbc news poll , only 17% of respondents ( but the second - most - common answer ) presented with a list of potential campaign finance concerns said that "unlimited contributions" concerned them most , compared with 37% who were most concerned about "special interests. .

more generally , in a 2002 abc news / washington post poll , 66% of respondents favored "stricter laws controlling the way political campaigns raise and spend money. .

it appears that regular , national polling about public financing has been uncommon since the mid - 1990s .

public financing has been debated in congress and the states for decades .

this suggests that interest in the topic will continue .

as congress considers how , or whether , to change the status quo , state experiences with public financing , as well as the nation's presidential public financing system , offer several potential lessons .

however , the great diversity among state programs makes interpreting those lessons challenging .

at the federal level , the presidential public financing system provides partial matching funds to qualifying candidates in primaries , but far more substantial fixed subsidies to candidates in the general election .

at the state level , which campaigns are eligible for public funding , how much funding is available , what requirements are placed on candidates accepting public funding , and when programs were implemented vary .

the presidential public financing system and those in the states all rely on either fixed subsidies ( in the states , especially clean money models ) or matching funds to distribute public financing .

despite similar ways of delivering funds to candidates , details about each program can vary greatly .

these differences have produced research that describes individual components of public financing programs , but rarely draws systematic comparisons across states .

in addition , only two states — arizona and maine — currently provide full public financing for legislative elections .

 ( others provide partial public financing for legislative elections , but , again , vary widely. ) .

consequently , there are few certainties about how public financing might apply to congressional campaigns .

nonetheless , several potential considerations remain .

state models suggest two approaches to national public financing if congress decides to pursue subsidized congressional campaigns .

first , most public financing programs infuse public money into campaigns in hopes of limiting the impact of private money .

this approach essentially provides candidates with money so that they do not have to raise their own — or can at least raise less .

second , some models , such as nebraska's public funding program , have reportedly encouraged the vast majority of candidates to limit spending on their own .

rather than providing public funding to candidates based on the assumption that they will spend those funds , the nebraska program reserves public financing for candidates whose opponents refuse to abide by relatively low spending limits .

these two approaches suggest a choice for congress between public funding that concentrates primarily on distributing money in anticipation of campaign needs versus creating incentives for candidates to need less money by observing spending limits .

in addition , creating a public financing system requires a choice between funding primary elections or general elections , or both .

most existing state programs have funded both types of elections , although general elections sometimes take priority over primary elections and might be funded differently from primary elections .

while early congressional proposals generally covered primaries as well as general elections , most prominent proposals since the 100 th congress have dealt only with general election financing to reduce both costs and program complexity , and to enhance chances for enactment .

regardless of the chosen approach , public financing does not altogether eliminate private money in politics .

even clean money programs require some private fundraising to establish viability , albeit far less than under private financing .

in addition , some observers fear that public financing creates opportunities for more financial influence from less accountable non - candidate sources — such as independent expenditures and election - related "issue advocacy" by interest groups — compared with the current system of private financing .

public financing systems generally do not regulate fundraising or spending outside candidate campaigns , although legislation could address such issues .

congress might also wish to consider why some public financing programs have been curtailed .

in a few states , decisions by voters and candidates — not state governments — appear to be most responsible for public financing programs falling into disfavor .

experiences in the states suggest that in order to be viable , public financing must have sufficient funding to make participation attractive to candidates .

as with public funds for presidential candidates , if public financing provides too little money — or sets accompanying spending limits too low — to convince candidates that they can wage effective campaigns , major candidates are likely to opt out of the system , ultimately making it relevant only for minor candidates .

 ( in 2004 , for example , both of the eventual major - party nominees for president opted out of matching funds in the primaries. ) .

public support can also be important to enact and maintain public financing .

despite regular congressional interest in public financing since at least the 1950s , disagreements over many of the issues noted in this report have thus far thwarted efforts to adopt public financing in legislative elections .

on a related note , effective public financing requires resources not only adequate to make participation attractive to candidates , but also sufficient to administer and enforce public financing .

as law professor richard briffault has explained , public [campaign] funding requires administrators to determine who qualifies for public funds , to disburse the funds , and to enforce whatever restrictions accompany the funds .

can public administrators handle the job ? .

in fact , administrators have successfully handled the qualification of candidates and disbursement of public funds in presidential elections .

the real question is whether they can enforce the rules — particularly the spending limits — that are likely to accompany public funding .

comprehensive congressional public financing would , therefore , almost certainly require substantial administrative and enforcement resources for the federal election commission .

finally , public financing regulates only one area of campaign conduct .

if congress were to adopt public financing for its elections , other regulations — including those currently in place — would still be required to shape other areas of campaign politics , such as political advertising and party activities .

public financing would also not necessarily affect other factors that shape individual races .

as one pair of scholars wrote in 1995 , public financing of congressional elections , by itself , will not eliminate the problem of uncompetitive elections .

as in wisconsin , public subsidies may increase or prevent further deterioration in the competitiveness of contested congressional races by giving challengers more of a level playing field .

they might not , however , encourage challengers to emerge in districts where the incumbent is perceived as unbeatable .

public financing could have diverse impacts on congressional elections .

data from the states show some evidence that public financing decreases financial disparities between candidates and fosters closer margins of victory .

however , these findings are generally preliminary and are based on specific conditions in specific states .

because public financing limits the amount of private financing of campaigns , it is likely that public financing in congressional elections would reduce the amount of time candidates spend raising money — at least for their own or others' candidate campaigns .

on its own , however , public financing of candidate campaigns would not affect activities by 527s , political parties , or other organizations .

the same is true for leadership pacs , unless they were prohibited by public financing legislation .

evidence from the states also suggests that if congress chooses to fund congressional elections publicly , faith in the system and patience will be required .

as is discussed throughout this report , much about the impact of public financing is simply unknown .

relatively few states offer public financing for legislative elections .

individual components of those programs , such as funding levels , conditions on candidates , and other factors , can vary substantially , making it difficult to compare public financing across states or to draw firm inferences about how state lessons might translate to congressional elections .

it is clear from the presidential public financing program , and state programs , that assessing the impact of public financing takes multiple election cycles .

as more states experiment with legislative public financing , and do so for longer periods of time , potential lessons for adopting congressional public financing will become clearer .

it is also clear that in order to be effective , public financing programs require levels of funding sufficient to make them attractive to serious candidates , and to maintain those levels of funding over time .

similarly , spending limits associated with public financing must be high enough to convince candidates that they can compete in modern campaigns , including in expensive broadcast media markets .
