an automatic annual social security benefit increase is intended to reflect the rise in the cost of living over a one - year period .

the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers ( cpi - w ) , updated monthly by the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , is the measure that can trigger a benefit increase .

the social security cost - of - living adjustment ( cola ) is based on the growth in the index from the highest third calendar quarter average cpi - w recorded ( most often , from the previous year ) to the average cpi - w for the third calendar quarter of the current year .

if the cpi - w triggers a cola , the cola becomes effective in december of the current year and is payable in january of the following year .

 ( social security payments always reflect the benefits due for the preceding month. ) .

a cola trigger mechanism was first adopted in p.l .

92-603 , the social security amendments of 1972 , and triggered colas were first payable in 1975 .

prior to 1975 , congress sporadically approved colas through the adoption of legislation .

on october 11 , 2018 , the social security administration ( ssa ) announced that a 2.8% social security cola would be paid in january 2019 .

the bls release of the september 2018 cpi - w on that day made possible the comparison of the two july - september sets of cpi - w data needed to compute the cola ( one for 2017 and another for 2016 ) .

table 1 shows how the determination for a january 2019 cola is computed under procedures set forth in section 215 ( i ) of the social security act .

since automatic social security benefit colas began in 1975 , there have been three years in which no cola was payable: 2010 , 2011 , and 2016 .

the social security act specifies that a cola is payable automatically if the average cpi - w for the third quarter of the current year is higher than the highest average cpi - w for the third quarter of past years , which is called the "cost - of - living computation quarter. .

from 1975 , when this provision became effective , to 2008 , a new cost - of - living computation quarter was established in each subsequent year , which triggered the payment of a cola each year .

if the average cpi - w for the third quarter of the current year is equal to or less than the average cpi - w for the cost - of - living computation quarter , no cola is payable .

for example , the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2009 was less than the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2008 ( 211.001 and 215.495 , respectively ) .

as a result , an automatic cola in january 2010 was not triggered and the third quarter of 2008 remained the cost - of - living computation quarter ( i.e. , the benchmark ) used to determine if a cola would be payable in january 2011 .

though the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2010 ( 214.136 ) was greater than the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2009 , it did not exceed the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2008 .

the third quarter of 2008 remained the cost - of - living computation quarter for at least one more year and a cola was not payable in january 2011 .

when the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2011 ( 223.233 ) exceeded that for 2008 , a 2012 cola was triggered and the third quarter of 2011 became the cost - of - living computation quarter .

new cost - of - living computation quarters were subsequently established in each year from 2012 to 2014 , when the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 exceeded that for the third quarter of each preceding year .

similarly , since the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2015 ( 233.278 ) did not exceed that of 2014 ( 234.242 ) , no cola was paid in january 2016 .

thus , for the cola payable beginning in january 2017 , the cost - of - living computation benchmark quarter remained the third quarter of 2014 where it was compared with the average cpi - w for the third quarter of 2016 .

see table 2 for a recent history of average cpi - w performance for the third calendar quarter , and how that has affected changes to the cost - of - living computation quarter and the triggering of colas in some years .

social security benefit amounts cannot be reduced if the cpi - w decreases between the measuring periods .

if the performance of the cpi - w does not trigger a cola , benefits remain the same ( prior to deductions for medicare part b and part d premiums ) .

social security colas trigger increases in other programs .

supplemental security income ( ssi ) benefits and railroad retirement "tier 1" benefits ( equivalent to a social security benefit ) are increased by the same percentage as the social security cola or are held constant when a cola is not paid to social security beneficiaries .

railroad retirement "tier 2" benefits ( equivalent to a private pension ) are increased by an amount equivalent to 32.5% of the social security cola .

 ( if no cola is paid to social security beneficiaries , then the railroad retirement tier 2 benefits are not increased. ) .

veterans' pension benefits often are increased in the same amount as social security , but legislation must be passed annually for this purpose .

although colas under the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) and the federal military retirement system are not triggered by the social security cola , these programs use the same measuring period and formula for determining their colas .

the cola for recipients of federal employees' retirement system ( fers ) benefits equals the social security cola if inflation is 2% or less , but is lower than the social security cola otherwise .

some social security program elements , like the taxable earnings base , the retirement earnings test ( ret ) exempt amounts , and the substantial gainful activity ( sga ) earnings level for the blind ( which applies to social security disability beneficiaries ) , are indexed to wages , as opposed to prices , but increase only when a cola is payable .

although changes to those three elements are based on growth in national average wages ( rather than changes in prices ) , these elements can be increased only when a cola is payable .

if a cola is payable , then these amounts increase by the percentage that the national average wage index has increased .

the taxable earnings base , the ret exempt amounts , and the sga for the blind were unchanged in 2010 , 2011 , and 2016 when no cola was payable .

for example , had there been a cola trigger in 2015 , the taxable earnings base would have increased from $118,500 in 2015 to $122,700 in 2016 .

because there was no cola trigger in 2015 , the base instead remained unchanged .

with the 0.3% cola announced in 2016 , the taxable earnings base increased in 2017 as well .

similar to how the cola's reference period is calculated , the increase in the taxable earnings base is calculated on the increase in the average wage index from 2013 to 2015 ( about 7.2% ) .

table 3 shows the history of social security colas since the automatic colas began in 1975 .

table 4 provides a comprehensive summary of all ad - hoc legislative cost - of - living adjustments to social security benefits before automatic adjustments began in july 1975 .

the first increase occurred in october 1950 , 10 years after social security benefits were first issued in 1940 .

at that time , social security benefits were increased by 77% .

after 1950 , smaller increases were granted by separate legislation at irregular intervals .

table 4 shows the percentage increases and the dates from which these increases were paid .

as noted , in 1974 the increase occurred in two steps: an increase of 7% was paid from april 1974 until june 1974 ; and an increase of 11% was paid from july 1974 onward .

both increases used february 1974 as the base level .

authorization for the automatic benefit increase beginning in 1975 appears as part of p.l .
