this report is intended to provide a brief overview and summary of the federal laws , ethical rules , and regulations which may be relevant to the activities of those who lobby the united states congress .

the report provides a summary discussion of the federal lobbying registration and disclosure requirements of the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 ( lda ) ( as amended by the "honest leadership and open government act of 2007" ( p.l .

110-81 , september 14 , 2007 ) ) , the foreign agents registration act , the propriety of contingency fees for lobbying , restrictions on lobbying with federal funds , post - employment ( "revolving door" ) lobbying activities by former federal officials , and house and senate ethics rules which may be relevant to certain contacts by members , officers , and employees of congress with private lobbyists and their clients .

although the term "lobbying" may have developed a somewhat sinister and pejorative connotation over the years , the activities involved in lobbying are intertwined with fundamental first amendment rights of speech , association and petition , and may facilitate the exchange of important information and ideas between the government and private parties .

for those who act in a representative capacity for a client , lobbying the legislature for a change in the state of the law may be an important part of the services provided to the client .

however , because of the substantial potential for undue or wrongful influence from those who are paid to influence the legislative process , there has developed a body of law and rules to regulate lobbying activities , as well as to regulate the activities of public officials in their interactions with those who lobby , particularly with reference to the potentially corrupting effect of large sums of money on the legislative process .

there are several federal statutory laws , as well as rules of the house and senate , which either apply to lobbying directly , or which are relevant to congressional lobbyists because the provisions bear upon a member's or congressional employee's dealings with those who attempt to influence the legislative process .

although the internal house and senate rules apply directly only to those who come within their respective jurisdictions , the new statutory provisions amending the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 require a registered lobbyist to be familiar with the house and senate ethics rules on gifts and reimbursements , prohibit lobbyists from offering gifts the receipt of which would violate those congressional rules , and require lobbyists to certify that no gifts have been offered to members of congress or staff which would be in violation of the chamber's rules .

concerning the regulation of lobbying generally , because of first amendment protections and guarantees , the federal "regulation" of lobbying activities engaged in by private citizens principally takes the form of disclosure and reporting of such activities and the financing behind those activities , as opposed to any specific limitations or restrictions on advocacy .

even when regulation on lobbying merely requires disclosures and reporting , such regulation , in the area of political and public - policy advocacy , may still be subject to careful scrutiny by the courts .

court decisions in this and related areas have looked to determine whether there exists any "chilling" of , or deterrent to the exercise of , citizens' first amendment rights caused by such required disclosures , and if so , whether any theoretical or indirect chilling of speech is counter - balanced by important governmental and societal interests promoted by the regulations , such as transparency and openness in government , and the protection of basic governmental processes from undue influences .

in 1995 congress completely rewrote the 50-year old law ( the federal regulation of lobbying act of 1946 ) which had required certain registrations and disclosures of lobbying activities directed at members of congress .

the "lobbying disclosure act of 1995" now provides more specific thresholds , and clearer and broader definitions of who is a "lobbyist" and what "lobbying" activities and contacts will trigger the requirements for the registration and reporting of persons who are compensated to engage in lobbying .

the lobbying disclosure law was amended substantially in 2007 in the "honest leadership and open government act of 2007," to provide further and more frequent disclosures , information , and reporting from those professional lobbyists covered by the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 .

the new reporting and disclosures will generally apply to the information which is required to be filed in the calendar quarters beginning after january 1 , 2008 .

other information to be included in reports , concerning particularly the interaction of covered lobbyists and government officials in the making or offering of gifts , donations , payments or contributions from such lobbyists and their clients to or on behalf of federal public officials , will be filed semi - annually concerning those six - month periods after january 1 , 2008 .

the 2007 amendments to the lobbying disclosure laws were not intended primarily to increase the number of persons who are required to register and report as "lobbyists" under the lda .

thus , the definitions of who is a covered "lobbyist," and of what are "lobbying contacts" and "lobbying activities"âand therefore who must register and report under the lawâwere not substantively amended by the 2007 act .

rather , the amendments in 2007 were substantially directed at providing more "transparency"âbroader disclosures , more information , and more frequent reportingâon lobbying activities from those "lobbyists" already required to register and report under the law .

additionally , the new lobbying law amendments require lobbyists to be familiar with the restrictions , limitations , and prohibitions in internal house and senate rules on the receipt of gifts from private sources by members and staff of congress , as the new lobbying laws expressly prohibit lobbyists and organizations with employee / lobbyists from offering gifts and travel prohibited by such rules , and requires certification by registrants that no such gifts have been offered .

in addition to the required registrations under the federal lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended , the provisions of the foreign agents registration act ( fara ) may be relevant if one is acting for or on behalf of a foreign government or a foreign political party or entity , or other foreign entity , and is engaging in "lobbying" activities as part of the representation for that foreign client .

under the lobbying disclosure act , as amended , if one is representing the interests of a foreign government or a foreign political party , such agent must continue to register under the foreign agents registration act , but then need not register under the lobbying disclosure act .

however , persons representing private foreign entities , and who lobby in the united states , should register under the lobbying disclosure act rather than the foreign agents registration act .

those properly registered under the lobbying disclosure act are exempt from registering under the foreign agents registration act .

under amendments adopted in 2007 , the registrations and supplemental statements from foreign agents under fara will now be available on - line in a searchable , sortable , and downloadable format .

the foreign agents registration act , as amended by the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , and its amendments , provides that "agents of a foreign principal" must file a registration statement not with the clerk of the house or the secretary of the senate , but with the attorney general listing detailed financial and business information , must file and label all informational materials , and keep detailed books and records open to inspection by public officials .

an "agent" is defined in the law as one who acts "at the order , request , or under the direction or control , of a foreign principal , or of a person any of whose activities are directly or indirectly supervised , directed , controlled , financed , or subsidized in whole or in part by a foreign principal...." the types of activities on behalf of a "foreign principal" that would subject an "agent" to coverage under the act include "political activities" ; acting as a "public relations counsel," publicity agent or political consultant ; collecting or disbursing contributions for the foreign principal ; and representing the interests of the foreign principal "before any agency or official of the government of the united states. .

the term "political activities" also includes activities which may generally be characterized as among those commonly considered to be "lobbying" activities: the term "political activities" means any activity that the person engaging in believes will , or that the person intends to , in any way influence any agency or official of the government of the united states or any section of the public within the united states with reference to formulating , adopting , or changing the domestic or foreign policies of the united states... .

there are several exemptions to the registration and record - keeping requirements of the foreign agents registration act , including exemptions for the official activities of diplomats and consular officers and the activities of certain officials of foreign governments ; exemptions for persons engaging only in "private and nonpolitical activities in furtherance of bona fide trade or commerce" for such foreign principal ; and an exemption for certain legal representation of foreign principals by attorneys in judicial or on - the - record , formal agency proceedings .

a contingency fee arrangement for "lobbying" activities before congress is one in which the payment for such activities is contingent upon the success of the lobbying efforts to influence the legislative process by having legislation adopted or defeated in the united states congress .

there is no statute under federal law which expressly addresses the issue of contingency fees with respect to all lobbying activities before the congress .

contingency fees may be expressly barred , however , under certain circumstances .

there is in federal law , for example , an express prohibition against contingency fee arrangements with respect to seeking certain contracts with the agencies of the federal government .

activities which might generally or colloquially be called "lobbying," but which involve making representations on behalf of private parties before federal agencies to obtain certain government contracts , may thus be subject to the contingency prohibitions .

contingency fees are also prohibited for lobbying the congress by persons who must register as agents of foreign principals under the foreign agents registration act .

the prohibition is upon agreements where the amount of payment "is contingent in whole or in part upon the success of any political activities carried on by such agent. .

the covered "political activities" of such agents under the foreign agents registration act include any activity which the agent "intends to , in any way influence any agency or official of the government of the united states ... with reference to formulating , adopting , or changing the domestic or foreign policies of the united states ...," and thus includes the activities of "lobbying" members and staff of congress on legislation or appropriations .

although there is no general federal law expressly barring all contingency fees for successful lobbying before congress , there is a long history of judicial precedent and traditional judicial opinion which indicates that such contingency fee arrangements , when in reference to "lobbying" and the use of influence before a legislature on general legislation , are void from their origin ( ab initio ) for public policy reasons , and therefore would be denied enforcement in the courts .

explaining the reason for such policy , justice oliver wendell holmes , writing for the court , noted that it was the "tendency" in such contract agreements to provide incentives towards corruption , as such agreements "invited and tended to induce improper solicitations ... intensified ... by the contingency of the reward. .

it should be noted that the laws of 39 states prohibit outright , and the laws of a 40 th state limit the amount of , contingency fees for successful legislative lobbying , and this may further limit the probability of judicial enforcement of a contingency fee contract , even one for lobbying the congress .

while the tradition and practice have been for the courts to look disfavorably upon contingency fee arrangements for successfully influencing public officials in performing discretionary actions , it should be noted that in some instances contingency fee contracts based on the success of legislation have been upheld and enforced in a few courts when the duties contracted for were professional services that did not involve traditional , statutorily defined "lobbying" or the use of personal influence before the legislature , or where the client had a legitimate claim or legal right to be asserted in a matter before the legislature ( eg , "debt legislation" ) .

as noted in the instructions of the clerk of the house and secretary of the senate , if contingency fees are permitted and used in a lobbying agreement with respect to lobbying before the congress , the making of such a contract for a contingent fee "triggers a registration requirement at inception. .

the fee is disclosed in the required reports for the period "that the registrant becomes entitled to it. .

there are general restrictions under federal law and regulations against the use of federal funds for lobbying activities .

federal criminal law states a general prohibition against the use of funds appropriated by congress for the purposes of certain "lobbying" activities and publicity campaigns directed at influencing congress or state or local legislatures on pending legislation .

contractors and grantees of the federal government may not be reimbursed out of federal contract or grant money for their lobbying activities , unless authorized by congress , under the provisions of the federal acquisition regulations ( far ) drafted to encompass the principles set out in an earlier circular from the office of management and budget that applies to non - profit grantees of the federal government .

under the guidelines of provisions known as the "byrd amendment," as amended by the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , federal grantees , contractors , recipients of federal loans or those with cooperative agreements with the federal government , are also prohibited by law from using federal monies to "lobby" the congress , federal agencies or their employees with respect to the awarding of federal contracts , the making of any grants or loans , the entering into cooperative agreements , or the extension , modification or renewal of these types of awards .

federal contractors , grantees and those receiving federal loans and cooperative agreements must also report lobbying expenditures from non - federal sources which they used to obtain such federal program monies or contracts .

charitable organizations , including religious organizations , which are exempt from taxation under section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the internal revenue code ( organizations to which contributions may be tax - deductible for the donor under â§ 170 ( c ) ( 2 ) ) , are limited in the amount of lobbying in which they may engage if they wish to preserve this preferred tax - exempt status from the federal government .

section 18 of the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 places statutory restrictions upon the lobbying activities of certain non - profit organizations which are tax - exempt under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the internal revenue code .

this provision , which is commonly called the "simpson amendment," prohibits section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare organizations from engaging in any "lobbying activities," even with their own private funds , if the organization receives any federal grant , loan , or award .

the legislative history of the provision clearly indicates , however , that a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organization may separately incorporate an affiliated 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , which will not receive any federal funds , and which could engage in unlimited lobbying .

the method of separately incorporating an affiliate to lobby , which was described by the amendment's sponsor as "splitting," was apparently intended to place a degree of separation between federal money and private lobbying while permitting an organization to have a voice through which to exercise its protected first amendment rights of speech , expression and petition: "if they decided to split into two separate 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s , they could have one organization which could both receive funds and lobby without limits. .

it may also be noted that while 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s which receive certain federal funds may not engage in "lobbying activities," the term "lobbying activities" as used in that prohibition is expressly defined in that law to include only direct "lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts," such as preparation , planning , research and other background work intended for use in such contacts .

organizations which engage only in grass roots lobbying and public advocacy , and do not make direct contacts or communications with covered officials , would therefore not appear to be engaging in any prohibited "lobbying activities" as defined under this provision .

there are various "post - employment" or "revolving door" conflict of interest restrictions upon certain officers and employees of the federal government which may work to restrict their lobbying of the congress , or of executive branch agencies or personnel , on particular matters or for a certain period of time after such officials leave office .

in addition to the "switching sides" restrictions which apply generally to all former executive branch employees representing private parties before officers and employees of the executive branch in matters on which the employee had worked or had authority over while with the government , there are certain so - called "cooling off" or "no contact" periods which may apply to any matter before one's former agency , department or branch of government , regardless of whether or not one had worked on it while with the government .

as to those restrictions relevant to lobbying the congress , the statute prohibits former members of the house from making representations , that is , appearances or communications with intent to influence , on any matter before any member , officer , or employee of the entire legislative branch of government for one year after the member leaves office .

senators are now prohibited from such post - employment lobbying of the congress for two years after leaving the senate .

in the house of representatives , the staff of a member , if compensated above a particular rate , may not "lobby" that member or his or her staff for one year after leaving employment , and covered staff of committees may not lobby any members or staff of that committee for one year after leaving employment .

in the senate , covered "senior" senate employees may not lobby the entire senate ( and not just their employing office ) for one year after leaving congressional employment .

the "cooling off" periods for former executive branch officials , however , apply only to lobbying those in the executive branch , and would not restrict such former officials from general lobbying directed at the u.s. congress immediately after their government employment .

in addition to the "cooling off" periods that apply to a broad range of matters , for former government officials , including members of congress , there are restrictions specifically applicable to foreign trade , treaties , or foreign governmental representations .

under such restrictions , no federal employee or official , including a member or employee of congress , who has participated in trade or treaty negotiations on behalf of the united states and had access to certain non - public information may , for one year after leaving office , represent , aid , or advise any other person with respect to such ongoing trade or treaty negotiations .

in addition , those high - level government officials who are subject to the "cooling off" or "no contact" bans , including members of congress and certain congressional staff , are also prohibited , for one year after leaving the government , from lobbying for , representing , aiding , or advising any official foreign entity with the intent to influence the official actions of any officer or employee of a department or agency of the united states , including members of congress .

in addition to statutory laws applicable to lobbyists and lobbying , there are internal congressional rules in both the house and the senate which establish and provide ethical guidelines and standards of conduct for members , officers and employees of those bodies .

while these are internal rules and are not necessarily enforceable against , nor applicable directly to private parties who lobby the congress , changes in 2007 to the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 now provide a statutory relevance concerning some of these ethical standards and rules for a registered lobbyist , registered organization employing one or more employee / lobbyists , and those who lobby on behalf of such organizations .

in the past , ethical guidelines and professional standards for lobbyists expressed by voluntary organizations of professional lobbyists had contained references to complying with the requirements of congressional ethical standards .

the guidelines adopted by the american league of lobbyists , for example , provide in part that "a lobbyist should not cause a public official to violate any law , regulation or rule applicable to such public official. .

now , however , because of the change to the lobbying law in the "honest leadership and open government act of 2007," the conduct of a lobbyist which could bring a member of congress or a congressional staff employee in violation of such internal , congressional rules on gifts and travel reimbursements , may result in criminal and / or civil penalties for the lobbyist .

registrants under lda are now required by law to provide a certification in writing that the person or organization filing ( i ) "has read and is familiar with" the rules of the house and senate regarding gifts and travel , and ( ii ) has not provided , requested or directed that a gift or travel be offered to a member or employee of congress "with knowledge that the receipt of the gift would violate" the respective house or senate rule on gifts and travel .

additionally , there is now a specific prohibition within the federal lobbying law on any registered lobbyist , any organization which employs one or more lobbyists and is required to register , and any employee required to be listed as a lobbyist by a registrant , from making a gift to , or reimbursing or paying travel expenses of , a member or staffer of congress if the person has knowledge that the gift or travel offered may not be accepted under the respective , applicable rules of the house or senate .

the penalties for failing to comply with the lda include civil penalties of fines of up to $200,000 , and criminal penalties for knowing and corrupt failure to comply with the law of up to five years' imprisonment .

intentional false statements or material omissions in required certifications to any agency or department of the federal government concerning a material matter within that federal office's jurisdiction , may also be prosecuted under the general false statements and fraud statute .

as a profession , attorneys may be called upon more often than others to provide legislative representational services for clients .

when lobbying the congress , as in providing other professional services for a client , there are certain ethical rules , guidelines , and considerations which are unique to and need to be recognized and observed by attorneys .

the american bar association has promulgated model rules of professional conduct , which have been adopted in one form or another within the various jurisdictions .

these rules discuss ethical considerations and norms for attorneys in not only representing clients before courts , but also in representing clients in non - adjudicatory matters , such as before a legislature: rule 3.9: advocate in non - adjudicative proceedings a lawyer representing a client before a legislative or administrative tribunal in a non - adjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in a representative capacity and shall conform to the provisions of rules 3.3 ( a ) through ( c ) , 3.4 ( a ) through ( c ) , and 3.5 .

comment: [1] in representation before bodies such as legislatures , municipal councils , and executive and administrative agencies acting in a rule - making or policy - making capacity , lawyers present facts , formulate issues and advance argument in the matters under consideration .

the decision - making body , like a court , should be able to rely on the integrity of the submissions made to it .

a lawyer appearing before such a body should deal with the tribunal honestly and in conformity with applicable rules of procedure .

[2] lawyers have no exclusive right to appear before non - adjudicative bodies , as they do before a court .

the requirements of this rule therefore may subject lawyers to regulations inapplicable to advocates who are not lawyers .

however , legislatures and administrative agencies have a right to expect lawyers to deal with them as they deal with courts .

the ethical rules referenced in rule 3.9 concern , among other items , duties of attorneys not to knowingly make false statements , or to fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when such non - disclosure may further a fraud or criminal act of the client ( rule 3.3 ) , as well as specific prohibitions on improper and undue influence of an officer ( rule 3.5 ) .

the model rules of professional conduct also note that it is "professional misconduct" for a lawyer to "state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official" ( rule 8.4 ( e ) ) .

attorneys should also be aware that in addition to federal post - employment "revolving door" laws , under the american bar association model rules after a lawyer leaves public employment he "shall not represent a private client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee , unless the appropriate government agency consents after consultation. .

this may in some instances limit the representational activities of attorneys for clients before congress when the attorneys have left public employment ; the issue would most likely not arise in the context of general lobbying activities by the attorney , but rather in his or her capacity as counselor for someone subject to such proceedings as committee investigatory proceedings and hearings .
