the department of defense ( dod ) manages the world's largest dedicated infrastructure,covering over 40,000 square miles of land and a physical plant worth over $500 billion .

the militaryconstruction appropriations bill provides a large part of the funding to maintain this infrastructure .

the bill funds construction projects and real property maintenance of the active army , navy &marine corps , air force , and their reserve components ; defense - wide construction ; u.s.contributions to the nato security investment program ( formerly called the nato infrastructureprogram ) ; and military family housing operations and construction .

the bill also provides fundingfor the base realignment and closure ( brac ) account , which finances most base realignment andclosure costs , including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions , andenvironmental cleanup at closing sites .

the military construction appropriations bill is only one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense .

other major legislation includes ( 1 ) the defenseappropriations bill , that provides funds for all military activities of the department of defense,except for military construction ; ( 2 ) the national defense authorization bill , that authorizesappropriations for national defense , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) theenergy and water development appropriations bill,that provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy .

two otherappropriations bills , va - hud - independent agencies and commerce - justice - state , also includesmall amounts for national defense .

in addition , the energy and water development appropriationsbill provides funds for civil projects carried out by the u.s. army corps of engineers .

the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defense appropriation measures described above .

therefore , major debates over defense policy and funding issues,including military construction can be also found in the authorization bill .

since issues in thedefense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine , this report highlights salient parts of theauthorization bill , along with the military construction appropriation process .

the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s when a large defense build - up occurred in response to intercontinental ballistic missile threats and the sovietlaunch of sputnik .

defense construction spending soared , as facilities were hardened , missile siloswere constructed , and other infrastructure was built .

the appropriations committees established themilitary construction subcommittees to deal with this new level of activity .

consequently , theseparate military construction bill was created .

the first stand - alone military construction bill wasin fy1959 , p.l .

85-852 .

previously , military construction funding was provided through annualdefense appropriations or supplemental appropriations bills .

military construction appropriations are the major , but not the sole , source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies .

the defense appropriations bill providessome funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenance accounts .

in addition , fundsfor construction and maintenance of morale , welfare , and recreation - related facilities are partiallyprovided through proceeds of commissaries , recreation user fees , and other income .

most funds appropriated by congress each year must be obligated in that fiscal year .

military construction appropriations are an exception , since these funds are generally made available forobligation for five fiscal years .

consideration of the military construction budget starts when the president's budget is delivered to congress early each year .

for fy2001 , the president requested $8.0 billion in funding for themilitary construction program .
