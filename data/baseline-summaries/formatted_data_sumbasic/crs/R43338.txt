congress uses an annual appropriations process to provide discretionary spending for federal government agencies .

the responsibility for drafting legislation to provide for such spending is currently divided among 12 appropriations subcommittees in each chamber , each of which is tasked with reporting a regular appropriations bill to cover all programs under its jurisdiction .

the timetable currently associated with this process requires the enactment of these regular appropriations bills prior to the beginning of the fiscal year ( october 1 ) .

if regular appropriations are not enacted by that deadline , one or more continuing resolutions ( crs ) may be enacted to provide funds until all regular appropriations bills are completed , or the fiscal year ends .

during the fiscal year , supplemental appropriations may also be enacted to provide funds in addition to those in regular appropriations acts or crs .

amounts provided in appropriations acts are subject to limits , both procedural and statutory , which are enforced through respective mechanisms such as points of order and sequestration .

the timing and policy focus of the fy2014 appropriations process was influenced by at least two significant factors â€” the late resolution of fy2013 appropriations and disagreement regarding the level of funding for fy2014 discretionary spending .

first , annual appropriations actions for fy2013 were not completed until march 26 , 2013 ( consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 ; p.l .

113-6 ) , almost six months into the fiscal year .

in addition , on march 1 , 2013 , the president issued a sequestration order that reduced non - exempt fy2013 discretionary spending .

the dollar amount of these reductions was applied to the amounts subsequently appropriated for fy2013 .

despite ongoing congressional concern related to these reductions , efforts to broadly restructure or eliminate them were unsuccessful , and the lower levels of funding that were available to agencies as a result of the sequester were in effect through the end of the fiscal year .

second , in addition to the issues related to fy2013 spending , the fy2014 appropriations process was affected by a lack of agreement between the house and senate over future constraints on discretionary spending as required by the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ) .

unlike the reductions that occurred in fy2013 , the constraints on fy2014 discretionary spending are implemented through statutory discretionary spending limits .

separate limits apply to defense and nondefense spending .

the first enforcement of these limits was to occur 15 days after congress adjourned its session 2013 sine die .

on december 10 , 2013 , the chairs of the house and senate budget committees announced an agreement as to the level of fy2014 and fy2015 discretionary spending ( the bipartisan budget act ; division a , h.j.res .

59 ) , which was enacted into law on december 26 , 2013 ( p.l .

113-67 ) .

no regular appropriations bills for fy2014 were enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year ( october 1 , 2013 ) , and an interim cr to provide budget authority for the projects and activities covered by those 12 bills did not become law until october 17 , 2013 ( continuing appropriations act , 2014 ; p.l .

113-46 ) .

as a consequence , a 16-day funding gap occurred between october 1 and october 16 , 2013 .

regular appropriations were ultimately enacted through an omnibus measure , which contained the texts of all 12 regular appropriations bills for fy2014 ( the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ; h.r .

3547 , p.l .

113-76 ) .

congressional consideration of three supplemental appropriations measures occurred late in the fiscal year ( h.r .

5230 , s. 2648 , and h.j.res .

76 ) .

of these measures , congress has completed action only on h.j.res .

76 , a measure that provides additional appropriations for military cooperation with the government of israel related to the iron dome program .

this report provides background and analysis with regard to the fy2014 appropriations process .

the first section discusses the status of discretionary budget enforcement for fy2014 , including the statutory spending limits and allocations under the congressional budget resolution .

the second section provides information on the consideration and enactment of regular appropriations and an overview of aggregate discretionary spending .

further information with regard to these appropriations acts is provided in the various crs reports that analyze and compare the components of the current house and senate proposals .

the third section explains congressional action that has occurred on crs before and after october 1 , and the fourth section discusses action on supplemental appropriations measures .

the framework for budget enforcement of discretionary spending under the congressional budget process has both statutory and procedural elements .

the statutory elements of budget enforcement are derived from the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ) , which imposes separate limits on "defense" and "nondefense" discretionary spending that apply to each of the fiscal years between fy2012 and fy2021 .

pursuant to procedures under the bca , the initial limits for fy2014 through fy2021 are to be lowered each fiscal year to achieve certain budgetary savings .

however , the bipartisan budget act amended the bca to set the fy2014 and fy2015 limits at specific levels .

if discretionary spending is enacted in excess of these limits , enforcement will occur through sequestration at specified times after appropriations measures are enacted .

the procedural elements of budget enforcement generally stem from requirements under the congressional budget act of 1974 ( cba ; p.l .

93-344 ; 88 stat .

297 ; 2 usc 60-688 ) .

through this cba process , the appropriations committee in each chamber receives a procedural limit on the total amount of discretionary budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year , referred to as a 302 ( a ) allocation .

the appropriations committee subsequently divides this allocation amongst the 12 subcommittees , referred to as a 302 ( b ) suballocation .

the 302 ( b ) suballocation restricts the amount of budget authority available to each subcommittee for the projects and activities under its jurisdiction , and so effectively acts as a cap on each of the 12 regular appropriations bills .

enforcement of the 302 ( a ) allocation and 302 ( b ) suballocations occur through points of order .

the house and senate currently provide annual appropriations in 12 regular appropriations bills .

these bills provide discretionary spending for the projects and activities of most federal government agencies .

while all of these bills may ultimately be considered and enacted separately , it is also possible for two or more of them to be combined into an omnibus vehicle for consideration and enactment .

alternatively , if some of these bills are not enacted , funding for the projects and activities therein may be provided through a full - year cr .

the deadline for enactment of all regular appropriations bills is october 1 , the beginning of the fiscal year .

during the fy2014 appropriations process , the house appropriations committee reported 10 of the 12 regular appropriations bills , while the senate appropriations committee reported 11 of the 12 regular bills .

the house initially considered five regular appropriations bills on the floor and passed four of them before final action on regular appropriations occurred .

the senate began floor consideration of one regular appropriations bill , but did not complete it .

no regular appropriations were enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year .

on august 20 , 2013 , omb projected that both the house and senate regular appropriations bills would , in total , exceed one or both of the existing bca discretionary spending limits .

after a total amount for defense and nondefense fy2014 discretionary spending was provided through the enactment of the bipartisan budget act , the house and senate appropriations committees announced an agreement on regular appropriations for fy2014 .

this agreement was enacted as the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( h.r .

3547 ; p.l .

113-76 ) on january 17 , 2014 .

for up - to - date information on the status of regular appropriations measures , see the crs fy2014 status table , available at http: / / www.crs.gov / pages / appropriationsstatustable.aspx .

because neither regular appropriations nor a broad continuing resolution ( cr ) to provide temporary funding for the previous fiscal year's projects and activities was law on october 1 , a funding gap commenced on that date for affected projects and activities .

one day before that funding gap , a narrow cr was enacted that funded fy2014 pay and allowances for ( 1 ) certain members of the armed forces , ( 2 ) certain dod and dhs civilian personnel , and ( 3 ) other specified dod and dhs contractors ( the pay our military act ; h.r .

3210 ; p.l .

113-39 , 113 th congress ) .

during the funding gap , consideration of appropriations was limited to a number of narrow crs to provide funds for specified projects and activities , of which only one was enacted ( the department of defense survivor benefits continuing appropriations resolution , 2014 ; h.j.res .

91 ; p.l .

113-44 ) .

the funding gap terminated with the enactment of a broad cr covering fy2013 projects and activities at an annualized rate of $986.3 billion , through january 15 , 2014 .

 ( the continuing appropriations act , 2014 ; h.r .

2775 ; p.l .

113-46 . ) .

funding was extended for three additional days by p.l .

113-73 ( h.j.res .

106 ) to allow time for the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 .

on july 8 , 2014 , the president submitted a request to congress for $4.346 billion in supplemental appropriations for fy2014 , primarily for activities related to responding to the influx of unaccompanied and escorted children illegally crossing the southwest border .

in addition , funds were requested for wildland fire management to address a projected shortfall as a result of fire suppression activities expected over the summer months , and legislative language was proposed to establish a new adjustment to the statutory discretionary spending limits for wildfire suppression operations .

the amount requested for immigration and border security activities was $3.731 billion and the amount for wildland fire management was $615 million .

the president requested that such funds be designated as emergency spending , effectively exempting them from the statutory discretionary spending limits .

both the house and senate have responded to this request with floor consideration of supplemental appropriations measures .

senator mikulski , chair of the senate appropriations committee , introduced s. 2648 , the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2014 , on july 23 .

this bill would provide a total of $3.571 billion in additional appropriations for fy2014 immigration and border security activities , wildland fire management , and military cooperation with the government of israel related to the iron dome program .

all of these appropriations were designated as emergency spending , as requested by the president .

the senate began consideration of s. 2648 on july 31 .

on that same day , however , a point of order under section 306 ( a ) of the congressional budget act was raised and sustained for including matter under the jurisdiction of the senate budget committee , after the senate rejected a motion to waive the point of order .

as a result , pursuant to section 312 ( f ) of the congressional budget act , the bill was referred to the committee on appropriations .

on july 29 , representative harold rogers , chair of the house appropriations committee , introduced h.r .

5230 , the secure the southwest border supplemental appropriations act , 2014 .

the original version of the proposal provided a total of $659 million in additional appropriations for immigration and border security activities , and rescinded the same amount of previously enacted appropriations for various purposes .

on july 31 , the house debated the bill pursuant to the special rule that provided for its consideration ( h.res .

696 ) .

after the previous question was ordered pursuant to the rule , further proceedings were postponed .

the following day , the house resumed consideration of h.r .

5230 pursuant to provisions in a second special rule ( h.res .

710 ) .

this special rule amended the text of the bill upon its adoption to provide an additional $35 million for the army national guard associated with the border security activities in the bill .

at the end of the bill's consideration , the house passed h.r .

5230 , by a vote of 223-189 .

on august 1 , the senate passed a separate measure providing the funding related to the iron dome that was proposed in s. 2648 .

as was the case for s. 2648 , the $225 million in such spending was designated as emergency appropriations .

by unanimous consent , the senate considered and adopted h.j.res .

76 with a substitute amendment .

later that same day , the house agreed to that senate amendment by a vote of 395-8 .

the measure was signed into law by the president on august 4 , 2014 ( p.l .

113-145 ) .
