this report provides an overview of fy2019 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies ( lhhs ) .

this bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to three federal departments: the department of labor ( dol ) , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of education ( ed ) .

in addition , the bill provides annual appropriations for more than a dozen related agencies , including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

discretionary funds represent less than one - fifth of the total funds appropriated in the lhhs bill .

nevertheless , the lhhs bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic nondefense federal programs among the various appropriations bills .

 ( the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs. ) .

the bulk of this report is focused on discretionary appropriations because these funds receive the most attention during the appropriations process .

the lhhs bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , as well as various related social policy issues addressed in the bill , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion and for research on human embryos and stem cells .

congressional clients may consult the lhhs experts list in crs report r42638 , appropriations: crs experts , for information on which analysts to contact at the congressional research service ( crs ) with questions on specific agencies and programs funded in the lhhs bill .

this report is divided into several sections .

the opening section provides an explanation of the scope of the lhhs bill ( and hence , the scope of this report ) and an introduction to important terminology and concepts that carry throughout the report .

next is a series of sections describing major congressional actions on fy2019 appropriations and ( for context ) a review of the conclusion of the fy2018 appropriations process .

this is followed by a high - level summary and analysis of enacted and proposed appropriations for fy2019 , compared to fy2018 funding levels .

the body of the report concludes with overview sections for each of the major titles of the bill: dol , hhs , ed , and related agencies .

these sections provide selected highlights from fy2019 enacted and proposed funding levels compared to fy2018 .

 ( note that the distribution of funds is sometimes illustrated by figures , which in all cases are based on the fy2019 enacted version of the lhhs bill. ) .

finally , appendix a provides a summary of budget enforcement activities for fy2019 .

this includes information on the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) and sequestration , budget enforcement in the absence of an fy2019 budget resolution , provisional subcommittee spending allocations , and current - year spending levels .

this is followed by appendix b , which provides an overview of the lhhs - related floor amendments that were offered in the senate during its consideration of h.r .

6157 , an appropriations measure that was amended to contain lhhs appropriations for fy2019 .

 table 1 provides a timeline of major legislative actions for full - year lhhs proposals , which are discussed in greater detail below .

 table 2 displays fy2019 discretionary and mandatory lhhs budget authority provided or proposed , by bill title , along with fy2018 enacted levels .

the amounts shown in this table reflect total budget authority provided in the bill ( i.e. , all funds appropriated in the bill , regardless of the fiscal year in which the funds become available ) , not total budget authority available for the current fiscal year .

 ( for a comparable table showing current - year budget authority , see table a - 2 in appendix a . ) .

figure 2 displays the fy2019 enacted discretionary and mandatory lhhs funding levels , by bill title .

 ( while the dollars and percentages discussed in this section were calculated based on the fy2019 enacted amounts , they are generally also illustrativeâwithin several percentage pointsâof the share of funds directed to each bill title in fy2018 and under the other fy2019 proposals. ) .

as this figure demonstrates , hhs accounts for the largest share of total fy2019 lhhs appropriations: $899 billion , or 84.9% .

this is due to the large amount of mandatory funding included in the hhs appropriation , the majority of which is for medicaid grants to states and payments to health care trust funds .

after hhs , ed and the related agencies represent the next - largest shares of total lhhs funding , accounting for 7.1% and 6.7% , respectively .

 ( the majority of the ed appropriations each year are discretionary , while the bulk of funding for the related agencies goes toward mandatory payments and administrative costs of the supplemental security income program at the social security administration. ) .

finally , dol accounts for the smallest share of total lhhs funds , 1.3% .

however , the overall composition of lhhs funding is noticeably different when comparing only discretionary appropriations .

hhs accounts for a comparatively smaller share of total discretionary appropriations ( 47.8% ) , while ed accounts for a relatively larger share ( 37.7% ) .

together , these two departments represent the majority ( 85.5% ) of discretionary lhhs appropriations .

dol and the related agencies account for a roughly even split of the remaining 14.5% of discretionary lhhs funds .

 table 10 displays fy2019 proposed and enacted funding levels for lhhs related agencies , along with fy2018 enacted levels .

in general , discretionary funds constitute about 20% of total appropriations for lhhs related agencies each year .

the fy2019 omnibus increased discretionary appropriations for related agencies by about 0.1% compared to fy2018 .

the president's budget and the house committee bill would have decreased discretionary appropriations for related agencies by about 14.0% and 2.2% , respectively , while the senate - passed bill would have increased such appropriations by 0.5% .

the largest share of funding appropriated to related agencies in the lhhs bill consistently goes to the social security administration ( ssa ) .

when taking into account both mandatory and discretionary funding , ssa usually represents roughly 97% of total appropriations to related agencies in the lhhs bill .

the bulk of mandatory funding provided to ssa from the lhhs bill supports the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , which provides means - tested cash assistance to disabled adults and children and to seniors aged 65 or older .

when looking exclusively at discretionary funding , ssa received 84.7% of discretionary appropriations for lhhs related agencies in the fy2019 lhhs omnibus .

after ssa , the next - largest related agency in terms of appropriations is usually the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) , which accounted for about 1.5% of total appropriations and 7.1% of discretionary appropriations to lhhs related agencies in fy2019 .

typically , each of the remaining related agencies receives less than $1 billion from the annual lhhs appropriations bill .

for more information , see table 11 .

the following sections highlight fy2019 appropriations issues for selected related agencies .

table 11 tracks funding levels for these related agencies .

the ssa lae account consists mainly of funds that are used by ssa to administer the social security and ssi programs and to support cms in administering portions of medicare .

the account also contains funds that are specifically set aside for certain program integrity activities , such as continuing disability reviews ( cdrs ) and ssi nonmedical redeterminations .

the fy2019 lhhs omnibus provided $12.9 billion to the lae account , which was a slight increase ( +$2 million ) over the fy2018 enacted level .

the president's request would have provided about $482 million less ( - 3.7% ) for the lae account relative to fy2018 .

the senate - passed bill would have increased lae funding by $77 million ( +0.6% ) compared to fy2018 , while the house committee bill would have decreased lae funding by $318 million ( - 2.5% ) .

of the $12.9 billion provided to the lae account for fy2019 , nearly $1.7 billion ( 13.1% ) was dedicated to program integrity activities .

the program integrity portion of the lae account included $273 million in "base" funding subject to the discretionary spending caps established by the budget control act of 2011 , as well as additional funding that was effectively exempt from those caps and subject to an annual limit ( "cap adjustment funding" ; see appendix a for further information ) .

the fy2019 lhhs omnibus provided $1.4 billion in cap adjustment funding , which was the maximum amount permitted for fy2019 .

however , because federal law allowed more cap adjustment funding for fy2018 than for fy2019 , the combined amount of program integrity funding enacted for fy2019 was $52 million ( - 3.0% ) less than the combined amount enacted for fy2018 .

all three proposals would have also provided the maximum amount of cap adjustment funding permitted for fy2019 .

the cncs is an independent federal agency that administers a variety of national and community service programs , such as americorps and the national senior volunteer corps .

the fy2019 lhhs omnibus provided $1.1 billion in total cncs funding , a $19 million ( +1.8% ) increase over the fy2018 enacted level .

the fy2019 president's budget had requested $123 million ( - 88.5% ) for cncs , noting that these funds would be used to execute an orderly shutdown of cncs operations , with the agency's closure slated to be complete by the end of fy2019 .

both the house committee bill and the senate - passed bill declined the president's proposal , with the house proposing to retain cncs funding at its fy2018 level of $1.1 billion ( 0.0% ) , while the senate - passed bill would have modestly reduced agency funding by $6 million ( - 0.5% ) .

the nlrb is an independent board that enforces provisions in the national labor relations act ( nlra ) .

the fy2019 lhhs omnibus maintained the fy2018 funding levels for the nlrb of $274 million .

the fy2019 president's budget and the house committee bill would have decreased funding for the nlrb by $25 million ( - 9.2% ) and by $13 million ( - 4.7% ) , respectively , while the senate - passed bill would have provided the same amount as fy2018 .

the fy2019 lhhs omnibus retained a provision that has been included in the lhhs bill since fy2012 that prohibits any funds appropriated to the nlrb in the bill , or any prior appropriations act , from being used to issue a directive or regulation to provide employees a means of voting through any electronic method in an election determining representation for collective bargaining ( â§407 ) .

the fy2019 lhhs omnibus , however , did not include two nrlb - related provisions proposed by the house committee bill that would have prohibited any funds made available by the bill from being used to issue , enforce , or litigate any administrative action related to changing the interpretation or application of the "joint employer" standard in effect as of january 1 , 2014 ( â§408 of h.r .

6470 ) ; and prohibited any funds made available by the bill from being used to enforce the nlra against any indian tribe ( â§409 of h.r .

6470 ) .

appendix a .

budget enforcement activities the framework for budget enforcement under the congressional budget process has both statutory and procedural elements .

the statutory elements include the discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester derived from the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( bbedca ; p.l .

99-177 ) .

the procedural elements are primarily associated with the budget resolution and limit both total discretionary spending and spending under the jurisdiction of each appropriations subcommittee .

readers should note that the statutory budget enforcement requirements that apply to fy2019 discretionary spending under the bca were altered the prior fiscal year by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l .

115-123 ) , which was enacted on february 9 , 2018 .

this law increased the defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for fy2018 and fy2019 , and extended mandatory spending sequestration through fy2027 .

budget control act and sequestration the bca provides budget process mechanisms to reduce mandatory spending and further reduce discretionary spending over an extended period .

for mandatory spending , reductions are to occur through sequestration in each of fiscal years between fy2013-fy2027 .

for discretionary spending , reductions occurred through sequestration in fy2013 , but are to be achieved through lower discretionary spending limits for each of the fiscal years between fy2014-fy2021 .

the bca does not require a sequester of discretionary spending in fy2014-fy2021 unless one or both of the statutory discretionary spending limits ( defense and nondefense ) is breached .

only discretionary spending subject to a given spending limit is affected by a breach of that limit , and the lhhs bill only includes funding in the nondefense category .

fy2019 on february 12 , 2018 , concurrent with the release of the president's budget , president trump issued the required fy2019 sequestration order , calling for nonexempt mandatory spending to be reduced on october 1 , 2018 .

the office of management and budget ( omb ) estimated that the fy2019 sequestration percentages would equal 2% of nonexempt medicare spending and 6.2% of other nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending , for a total reduction of $19 billion in fy2019 .

 ( omb also estimated an 8.7% reduction , totaling $809 million , in nonexempt defense mandatory spending , which does not affect lhhs funds. ) .

with regard to discretionary spending , the fy2019 statutory spending limits as specified in bba 2018 were $647 billion for defense spending and $597 billion for nondefense spending ; each of these levels was $18 billion more than their respective fy2018 limits .

once all annual appropriations acts were enacted for fy2019 and allowable adjustments to the spending limits were made , omb determined that those appropriations did not violate either the defense or the nondefense limit .

cap adjustments , exemptions , and special rules the bca allows for certain adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for fy2012-fy2021 .

for lhhs , the bca as originally enacted allowed increases to the nondefense limit ( up to a point ) to accommodate new budget authority for specified program integrity initiatives at hhs and the social security administration ( ssa ) .

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-74 ) amended the list of ssa activities that may be covered by this "cap adjustment" to include costs associated with work - related continuing disability reviews , cooperative disability investigations , and fraud prosecutions by special assistant u.s .

attorneys .

the bipartisan budget act of 2015 also revised the amount of the allowable ssa adjustment amounts to be more generous in fy2017-fy2019 compared to what was previously allowed , but less generous in fy2021 .

the bba 2018 added a new cap adjustment that also involves a lhhs activity .

this new cap adjustment allows increases to the nondefense limit ( up to a point ) to accommodate new budget authority for the dol to help fund the reemployment services and eligibility assessments conducted by the states related to unemployment compensation .

separate from these cap adjustments , the 21 st century cures act ( cures act , p.l .

114-255 ) , which was enacted on december 13 , 2016 , included additional budget enforcement procedures related to the discretionary spending limits .

these procedures originally applied to two accounts within the scope of the lhhs bill: the nih innovation account and the account for the state response to the opioid abuse crisis .

for fy2019 , the nih innovation account was the only lhhs funding to be subject to the cures act budget enforcement procedures .

the cures act created the nih innovation and state response to the opioid abuse crisis accounts and authorized appropriations from them for specific fiscal years ( fy2017-fy2026 for the nih innovation account and fy2017-fy2018 for the account for the state response to the opioid abuse crisis ) .

the cures act further provided that subsequent discretionary appropriations from these accounts ( up to the amounts authorized for each fiscal year ) are to be subtracted from any cost estimates provided for purposes of budget controls .

the cures act ensured that appropriations from these accounts will not count against any spending limits , such as the statutory discretionary spending limits imposed by the bca ; that is , the amounts appropriated from these accounts will be considered to be outside those limits .

an additional set of statutory exemptions and special rules that apply to sequestration are relevant for the lhhs bill .

the lhhs bill contains several programs that are exempt from sequestration , including medicaid , payments to health care trust funds , supplemental security income , special benefits for disabled coal miners , retirement pay and medical benefits for commissioned public health service officers , foster care and adoption assistance , and certain family support payments .

the lhhs bill also contains several programs that are subject to special rules under sequestration , such as unemployment compensation , certain student loans , health centers , and portions of medicare .

budget resolution and 302 ( b ) suballocations the procedural elements of budget enforcement generally stem from requirements under the congressional budget act of 1974 ( p.l .

93-44 ) that are associated with the adoption of an annual budget resolution .

through this process , the appropriations committee in each chamber receives a procedural limit on the total amount of discretionary budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year , referred to as a 302 ( a ) allocation .

the appropriations committee subsequently divides this allocation among its 12 subcommittees .

these subcommittee - level spending limits are referred to as 302 ( b ) suballocations .

the 302 ( b ) suballocations restrict the amount of budget authority available to each subcommittee for the agencies , projects , and activities under its jurisdiction , effectively acting as a cap on each of the 12 regular appropriations bills .

enforcement of the 302 ( a ) allocation and 302 ( b ) suballocations occurs through points of order .

for the fy2019 appropriations cycle , the house and the senate did not adopt a budget resolution .

instead , the house and senate both used authority granted in the bba 2018 for the budget committee chair in each chamber to file enforceable budgetary levels for fy2019 .

in line with these budgetary levels , the house appropriations committee adopted its initial suballocations on may 10 , 2018 ( h.rept .

115-710 ) , while the senate appropriations committee adopted its initial suballocations on may 24 , 2018 ( s.rept .

115-260 ) .

 ( as the fy2019 appropriations process was underway , both committees periodically updated these suballocations to align them with changing congressional priorities. ) .

for current - year lhhs discretionary funding , table a - 1 displays fy2018 enacted levels , the house and the senate fy2019 initial suballocations , and enacted fy2019 lhhs appropriations .

the table shows that the house initially would have kept regular lhhs appropriations at a flat level compared to the prior fiscal year , whereas the senate would have increased those appropriations by about $2.1 billion relative to fy2018 ( +1% ) .

ultimately , final enacted appropriations were a little less than $1 billion higher than the prior fiscal year .

the table also displays funding for which adjustments may be made to the discretionary spending limits under the bca , including funding for certain lhhs program integrity activities and emergency requirements , where applicable .

the "adjusted appropriations" total includes this funding .

note that compliance with discretionary spending allocations is evaluated based on budget authority available in the current fiscal year , adjusted for scorekeeping by cbo .

as such , totals shown in this table may not be comparable to other totals shown in this report .

current - year budget authority totals exclude advance appropriations for future years , but include advance appropriations from prior years that become available in the current year .

 ( advance appropriations are provided to selected lhhs accounts , generally in order to manage specific planning concerns and ensure continuity of operations at the start of a new fiscal year. ) .

current - year budget authority table a - 2 displays the total lhhs current - year budget authority , by title .

the amounts shown in this table reflect total budget authority available for obligation in the fiscal year , regardless of the year in which it was first appropriated .

amounts in the fy2018 enacted column include fy2018 budget authority provided by the fy2016 omnibus ( p.l .

114-113 ) and fy2017 omnibus ( p.l .

115-31 ) .

similarly , the fy2019 president's budget , house committee , senate floor , and enacted columns include fy2019 budget authority provided by the fy2017 and fy2018 omnibuses .

 ( for a comparable table showing total budget authority in the bill , rather than current - year budget authority , see table 2 in this report. ) .

as mentioned above , it is current - year budget authority ( adjusted for scorekeeping by cbo ) that is used to determine compliance with discretionary spending allocations .

appendix b. senate floor amendments offered to h.r .

6157 while the senate committee - reported version of the lhhs bill ( s. 3158 ) did not receive floor consideration , the text of this measure ( with minor alterations ) was included in a different appropriations vehicle ( h.r .

6157 ) that was amended on the floor and passed by the senate on august 23 , 2018 .

prior to senate floor consideration , h.r .

6157 contained the text of the fy2019 department of defense appropriations only .

on the floor , that bill was amended into an omnibus measure that contained appropriations for both the department of defense and lhhs .

the senate proceeded to consider h.r .

6157 by unanimous consent on august 16 , 2018 .

at that point , senator shelby ( the chair of the senate appropriations committee ) offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute containing department of defense appropriations in division a , and lhhs appropriations in division b ( s.amdt .

3695 ) .

on august 21 , a cloture motion on the measure was presented in the senate , but a subsequent unanimous consent agreement provided , among other matters , for the senate to adopt a manager's package comprised of dozens of amendments to the substitute amendment , adopt the substitute amendment ( as amended ) , and then proceed to a vote without the need to invoke cloture .

the senate passed the bill , as amended , by a vote of 85-7 .

over the course of senate floor consideration , a total of 32 lhhs amendments were offered to division b. twenty - nine of these were adopted by unanimous consent en bloc as part of the manager's package .

of the three that received recorded votes , two were adopted and one was rejected .

these amendments and their dispositions are listed in table b - 1 below .
