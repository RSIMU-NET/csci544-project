appropriations bills reflect the jurisdiction of the subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees in which they are considered .

jurisdictions for the subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees were changed at the beginning of the 109 th congress .

in the 108 th congress , both the house and senate subcommittees had identical jurisdiction and produced the commerce , justice , state , the judiciary and related agencies appropriations bills .

in the 109 th congress , jurisdiction for the judiciary appropriation was removed to the treasury , transportation , hud subcommittees in the house and the senate .

science appropriations , namely the national aeronautical and space administration and the national science foundation were transferred to the former cjs subcommittees in both chambers .

in the senate , appropriations for the department of state were transferred to the foreign operations subcommittee , however , they remains under the jurisdiction of ssjc in the house .

additionally , the senate appropriations committee has placed the national institute of science and technology and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration under its title iii science agencies .

for the purposes of comparison , this report will retain reference these agencies in title ii commerce agencies .

title ii includes the appropriations for the department of commerce and related agencies .

the origins of the department date to 1903 with the establishment of the department of commerce and labor ( 32 stat .

825 ) .

the separate department of commerce was established on march 4 , 1913 ( 37 stat .

7365 ; 15 u.s.c .

1501 ) .

the department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied , but its activities center on five basic missions: ( 1 ) promoting the development of american business and increasing foreign trade ; ( 2 ) improving the nation's technological competitiveness ; ( 3 ) encouraging economic development ; ( 4 ) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment ; and ( 5 ) compiling , analyzing and disseminating statistical information on the u.s. economy and population .

the following agencies within the commerce department carry out these missions: economic development administration ( eda ) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions .

minority business development agency ( mbda ) seeks to promote private and public sector investment in minority businesses .

bureau of the census collects , compiles , and publishes a broad range of economic , demographic , and social data .

economic and statistical analysis programs provide ( 1 ) timely information on the state of the economy through preparation , development , and interpretation of economic data ; and ( 2 ) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities .

much of the analysis is conducted by the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) .

international trade administration ( ita ) seeks to develop the export potential of u.s. firms and to improve the trade performance of u.s. industry .

bureau of industry and security enforces u.s. export laws consistent with national security , foreign policy , and short - supply objectives ( formerly the bureau of export administration ) .

national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) provides scientific , technical , and management expertise to ( 1 ) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation ; ( 2 ) assess the health of coastal and marine resources ; ( 3 ) monitor and predict the coastal , ocean , and global environments ( including weather forecasting ) ; and ( 4 ) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources .

patent and trademark office ( pto ) examines and approves applications for patents for claimed inventions and registration of trademarks .

technology administration , through the office of technology policy , advocates integrated policies that seek to maximize the impact of technology on economic growth , conducts technology development and deployment programs , and disseminates technological information .

national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality , modernize manufacturing processes , ensure product reliability , and facilitate rapid commercialization of products based on new scientific discoveries .

national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) advises the president on domestic and international communications policy , manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum , and performs research in telecommunications sciences .

the president's fy2006 budget request calls for $9.6 billion for the department of commerce and related agencies .

this represents a 44 percent increase over the fy2005 appropriation of $6.7 billion ( p.l .

108-447 ) for title ii and related agencies .

this proposed increase primarily would be the result of the creation of a $3.7 billion strengthening america's communities grant program .

the president's budget proposes major reductions in the advanced technology program , the emergency steel guarantee loan program , and the public telecommunications facilities , planning and construction program .

the house bill ( h.r .

2862 ) passed on june 16 , 2005 and proposes $5.8 billion in appropriations ( which includes a $35 million rescission ) , a 13.4 percent decrease from fy2005 .

h.r .

2862 would reduce significantly the appropriations for the economic development administration , the national telecommunications and information administration , and the national institute of standards and technology .

h.r .

2862 would not include funding for the administration's strengthening america's communities grant program .

the senate bill ( h.r .

2862 ) was passed on september 15 , 2005 and proposes $7.4 billion in appropriations ( with no rescissions ) , a 11.2 percent increase from fy2005 .

it would cease funding for the technology administration ( funded in fy2005 at $6.5 million ) and would not fund the administration's strengthening america's communities grant program .

the eeoc enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability .

the commission's workload has increased substantially since it was created under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 , due to passage of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the civil rights act of 1991 as well as to employees' greater awareness of their rights .

the administration requested an fy2006 appropriation of $331.2 million for the eeoc , an increase of $4.4 million from the $326.8 million ( including rescissions ) provided by the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ( p.l .

108-447 ) .

notably , $33 million would be devoted to payments for fair employment practices agencies ( fepas ) , which are state and local bodies with which the agency has work - sharing agreements to address workplace discrimination within their jurisdictions .

this is the amount of payments to fepas to which congress has , in prior years , raised the eeoc's request .

as well as a $441,000 increase for state and local contracts , the commission asked for an additional $5.5 million to cover the staff's total compensation and an additional $400,000 to cover rental ( including security ) payments .

the eeoc would reduce general operating expenses ( eg , printing , reproduction , postage , and travel ) by $977,000 and information technology expenditures by $1 million to offset the aforementioned increases .

the house and senate , following the appropriations committees' recommendations , provide the eeoc with the same budget the administration requested ( $331.2 million , including $33 million for fepas ) .

the conference agreement ( h.rept .

109-272 ) maintains these funding levels .

discretionary budget authority is subject to a rescission of 0.28% provided at title vi , general provisions , of h.r .

2862 .

in november 2005 , president bush signed the fy2006 appropriations bill ( p.l .

109-108 ) .

the conference agreement adopts , by reference , language in h.rept .

109-118 that requires the commission to continue submitting quarterly reports on projected and actual spending levels by function and to highlight any changes due to repositioning activities .

the conference agreement also adopts , by reference , language in s.rept .

109-88 that ( a ) prohibits the agency from implementing a repositioning plan which reduces the salary of eeoc employees , or reduces the number of officers or employees serving as mediators , investigators or attorneys at any commission office , and that ( b ) directs the commission to submit to congress , before implementation of any repositioning , restructuring or reorganization plan , a comprehensive analysis ( conducted for each district , field , area , and local office ) of current investigations and enforcement levels , and the full impact of such plan on all core services .

the conference agreement further provides that the eeoc should not undertake any workforce repositioning , restructuring or reorganizing without advance notification of the committees on appropriations .

in addition , the conferees direct the commission to continue working toward resolution of concerns regarding the pending repositioning plan .

the federal communications commission , created in 1934 , is an independent agency charged with regulation and interstate and foreign communication of radio , television , wire , cable , and satellite .

the fcc performs four major functions: spectrum allocation , creating rules to promote fair competition and protect consumers where required by market conditions , authorization of service , and enforcement .

among its responsibilities are licensing of communications operators ; interpretation and enforcement of rules , regulations , and authorizations regarding competition ; publication and dissemination of consumer information services ; and management and allocation of the use of the electromagnetic spectrum .

the fcc obtains the majority of its funding through the collection of regulatory fees pursuant to title i , section 9 of the communications act of 1934 ; therefore , its direct appropriation is considerably less than its overall budget .

h.r .

2862 was signed by president bush on november 22 , 2005 ( p.l .

109-108 ) .

it includes $289,771,000 for the salaries and expenses of the fcc .

of the amounts provided , $288,771,000 is to be derived from offsetting fee collections , resulting in a net direct appropriation of $1,000,000 .

p.l .

109-108 includes the following provisions: a limitation on expenditures to administer spectrum auctions , as proposed by the senate language , by reference , from the house report regarding the fcc's budget presentation , acceptance of travel payments , and the universal service fund language , by reference , from the senate report regarding broadcast television standards .

in the conference report accompanying the bill , the conferees expressed support for the fcc's plan to convene a panel of experts from the public safety and communications industry to perform an independent review and make recommendations on ways to improve disaster preparedness , network robustness and reliability , and public safety operations .

the conferees also encouraged the fcc to work with the departments of justice , homeland security , and commerce to best address public safety needs and requested that the fcc report to the committees on appropriations by march 1 , 2006 , on the work of the panel .

the conferees expressed their "surprise" regarding the fcc's september 2005 announcement to reorganize prior to submission of a reprogramming notification to the committees on appropriations .

they further stated that the committees on appropriations "take very seriously the statutory requirement of advanced notification before any reorganization is implemented" and directed the fcc to immediately submit its reorganization plan .

the conferees stated their expectation that the fcc would provide a final recommendation on plans to renovate the columbia , maryland , laboratory by january 30 , 2006 .

finally , the conferees stated their support for the fcc's pilot program to modernize its radiation monitoring equipment .

if the pilot program proves successful , the conferees encouraged the fcc to include sufficient funding in future budget submissions to complete the modernization of its monitoring systems and they agreed to consider a reprogramming of fy2006 funds to accelerate the transition to the new technology if the fcc determines it is warranted .

three additional sections of p.l .

109-108 also will affect the operations of the fcc .

first , title vi provides an overall 0.28% rescission on all discretionary budget authority .

further , title vi sect .

622 provides that "[n]one of the funds appropriated by this act may be used by the federal communications commission to modify , amend , or change its rules or regulations for universal service support payments to implement the february 27 , 2004 recommendations of the federal - state joint board on universal service regarding single connection or primary line restrictions on universal service support payments. .

second , per title vii , $25,300,000 of the unobligated balances available to the fcc for salaries and expenses are rescinded .

the bush administration had originally requested $304,057,000 for the fy2006 fcc budget , with $4,823,000 in direct appropriations and $299,234,000 derived from offsetting fee collections .

the house of representatives passed a budget of $289,771,000 for the salaries and expenses of the fcc ; of that amount , $288,771,000 would be derived from offsetting fee collections , with a direct appropriation of $1,000,000 .

the senate passed a budget of $297,370,000 for the salaries and expenses of the fcc ; of that amount , $296,370,000 would be derived from offsetting fee collections , with a direct appropriation of $1,000,000 .

the fcc's fy2005 budget was $281,098,000 .

for fy2006 , the administration is requesting a program level of $211 million for the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , an increase of slightly more than $5.5 million or 2.7 percent over current funding .

the house - passed bill provides the ftc with $211 million for fy2006 , which is $6.7 million above the current year funding and the same as the administration's request .

for its part , the senate followed the recommendation of the appropriations committee , which set funding for the agency for fy2006 at the $211 million level .

of the amounts provided , $116 is from hart - scott - rodino pre - merger filing fees and $23 million from do - not - call fees .

the total amount of direct appropriations for fy2006 is therefore $72 million .

indeed , there was no disagreement to be resolved .

the conference agreement ( h.r .

2862 / p.l .

109-108 ) provides the ftc with $211 million for fy2006 , employing the previously noted funding formula .

last year ( fy2005 ) , the administration requested 205.4 million for the agency .

the house approved a program level of $203.4 million , an increase of $17.9 million over fy2004 funding .

the senate appropriations committee , for its part , recommended $207.7 million for fy2005 .

the conference agreement provided the ftc with $205.4 million ( the same as requested ) .

more specifically , of the amounts provided , $101 million is coming from fees for hart - scott - rodino premerger notification filings , $21.9 million from do - not - call provisions of the telemarketing sales rule , and congress has provided a direct appropriation of $82.5 million .

more specifically for fy2006 , the administration is requesting that the program level of $211 million for the ftc be funded by$72 million from the general fund of the u.s. treasury and offsetting collections from two sources: $116 million from fees for hart - scott - rodino premerger notification filings ; and $23 million from fees sufficient to implement and enforce new do - not - call provisions of the telemarketing sales rule .

the ftc , an independent agency , is responsible for enforcing a number of federal antitrust and consumer protection laws .

in recent years the ftc has used pre - merger filing fees collected under the hart - scott - rodino act to mostly or entirely fund its operations .

by way of an historical footnote , for fy2000 through fy2002 , zero ( $0 ) direct appropriations were required since the entire program level was covered by a combination of fees and prior year collections .

the lsc is a private , non - profit , federally - funded corporation that provides grants to local offices which , in turn , provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( non - criminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s , and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency , and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annual appropriations laws , congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases .

p.l .

108-447 , the consolidated appropriations for fy2005 , among other things continued funding for the lsc at a level of $335.3 million .

the lsc fy2005 appropriation of $335.3 million included $316.6 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $13.0 million for management and administration ; $1.3 million for client self - help and information technology ; $2.6 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $1.8 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census - based reallocations .

it also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

in addition , it allowed the lsc to spend up to $1 million of prior - year funding balances for a school student loan repayment pilot program .

p.l .

108-447 also authorized a 0.8% across - the - board government - wide rescission and an additional 0.54% uniform rescission applicable only to funding for the commerce , justice , state , and related agencies appropriation ( which includes the lsc ) , thereby lowering the fy2005 lsc appropriation to $330.8 million .

for fy2006 , the bush administration requested $318.3 million for the lsc .

this is $12.5 million ( almost 4% ) below the fy2005 lsc appropriation ( after the rescissions ) .

the fy2006 budget request for the lsc included $299.2 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $13.4 million for management and administration , $3.5 million for client self - help and information technology , and $2.2 million for the office of the inspector general .

the budget request also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

on june 16 , 2005 , the house passed the appropriations committee's recommended funding level of $330.8 million for the lsc for fy2006 ( h.r .

2862 ; see h.rept .

109-118 ) .

this is the same amount as the lsc fy2005 appropriation after the rescissions ; and $12.5 million above the bush administration's fy2006 budget request for the lsc .

the house appropriation for the lsc included $313.7 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $12.8 million for management and administration , $1.8 million for client self - help and information technology , and $2.5 million for its office of the inspector general .

the house bill also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

moreover , the house bill included text that encourages the lsc to proceed with the planned pilot loan repayment assistance plan for attorneys ( no funding ) and advises the lsc to reduce its rent for its office space ( by eliminating some office space and negotiating a more competitive cost per square foot ) .

on june 23 , 2005 , the senate appropriations committee recommended $324.5 million for the lsc for fy2006 ( s.rept .

109-88 ) .

the committee's recommendation is $6.3 million below the fy2005 lsc appropriation and $6.3 million above the administration's fy2006 budget request for the lsc .

the senate committee recommendation included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

on september 15 , 2005 , the senate passed an amended version of the appropriation committee's recommendation .

it included $358.5 million for the lsc for fy2006 ( of which $8 million is for basic field programs providing legal assistance to victims of hurricane katrina ) .

 ( s.amdt .

1659 to h.r .

2862 introduced by senator harkin on september 9 th increased lsc funding from $324.5 million to $358.5 million. ) .

on november 9 , 2005 , the house passed the conference report on h.r .

2862 ( h.rept .

109-272 ) .

it included $330.8 million for the lsc , the same amount as originally passed by the house , instead of $358.5 million as passed by the senate .

the lsc would receive $312.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $12.8 million for management and administration ; $1.3 million for client self - help and information technology ; $2.5 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $1.8 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census - based reallocations .

in addition , the conference report incorporated , by reference , language in the house report regarding rent costs ( see above ) .

it also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

the conference report also included a general rescission equal to 0.28% of funding for the science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies appropriation ( which includes the lsc ) .

on november 16 , 2005 , the senate passed the conference report on h.r .

2862 .

president bush signed h.r .

2862 into law ( p.l .

109-108 ) on november 22 , 2005 .

the sec administers and enforces federal securities laws to protect investors from fraud and to maintain fair and orderly markets .

the sec's budget is set through the normal appropriations process , but funds for the agency come from fees on sales of stock , new issues of stocks and bonds , corporate mergers , and other securities market transactions .

when these fees are collected , they go to a special offsetting account available to appropriators , not to the treasury's general fund .

in fy2005 , the administration requested $913.0 million , an increase of 13% over fy2004 .

the house and senate both approved the amount requested by the administration .

the conference committee approved the $913.0 million , but that was to include $57 million in prior - year unobligated balances .

thus , the new appropriation for fy2005 was $856 million , to be covered by current - year fee collections .

the administration's request for fy2006 was $888.1 million , a decrease of 2.7% from fy2005 .

of that total , $25.0 million was to be from prior - year unobligated balances , and the remaining $863.1 would be from offsetting fee collections .

thus , no direct appropriation would be necessary .

the house , the senate and the conference report all approved an amount equal to the request: $888.1 million , of which $25.0 million is to come from prior - year unobligated balances , and the remainder ( $863.1 million ) from current year fee collections .

the administration proposed a total appropriation for the sba of $453.7 million for fy2006 .

the house appropriations committee recommended $655.3 million for the agency .

this recommendation was nearly $50 million more than the agency's fy2005 funding level , excluding emergency appropriations , and a little less than $29 million above the budget request .

for its part , the senate recommended $1,216.6 million for fy2006 , which includes an emergency appropriation of $509 million .

the conference agreement ( h.r .

2862 / p.l .

109-108 ) provides the sba with a total of $456.4 million for its five appropriations accounts , including $313 million for salaries and expenses , instead of $304.6 million as proposed by the house and $336.1 million as proposed by the senate .

with regard to the sba's non - credit programs , the conference agreement provided the following appropriations: $750,000 for veterans programs ; $1.5 million for 7 ( j ) technical assistance programs ; $89 million for small business development centers ; $5 million for score ; $12 million for women's business centers ; $750,000 for women's business council ; $1 million for native american outreach ; $1 million for drug - free workplace program ; $13 million for microloan technical assistance ; $2 million for prime technical assistance ; and , $2 million for hubzones .

it is , perhaps , worth noting that the conference agreement includes no new funding for the disaster loans program account , in accordance with the amendment to the president's budget that was submitted to the congress on july 15 , 2005 .

the conferees noted that the emergency appropriations provided in response to natural disaster at the end of fy2004 greatly exceeded the actual need for loans to affected businesses and individuals .

in fact , over $600 million was carried forward into fy2006 ; therefore , the conferees said that they expect the carryover balances will be applied to meet the disaster loan program's needs , and that no additional appropriations are needed for fy2006 .

the sba is directed to provide a monthly status report on the disaster loan activity to the committees on appropriations .

for fy2005 , the administration had requested a total appropriation of $678.4 million for the small business administration ( sba ) , a reduction of $32.9 million , or about 4.6% , from the agency's current funding level .

the fy2005 request included $326.3 million for salaries and expenses ( s&e ) .

the house approved $742.8 million , $31.5 million more than the agency's fy2004 appropriation .

the house - approved fy2005 appropriation included $315.4 million for s&e , which was $10.9 million less than the president's budget recommendation and approximately $7 million less than its fy2004 appropriation .

the senate appropriations committee recommended a total fy2005 appropriation of $761.9 million , including $357.7 million for s&e .

during the debate on the fy2005 cjs bill several amendments were adopted on the house floor , including one by chairman of the small business committee , donald a. manzullo , which would have provided a $79 million subsidy for the sba's 7 ( a ) loan program .

the conference report provides the sba with $579.5 million for fy2005 , including $322.3 million for s&e .

while this is substantially less than the administration requested — and the house and senate recommended — it is not will not result in a reduction in the agency's guaranteed loan program levels .

it is not clear , however , what the economic effect will be .

proponents for making the agency's largest guaranteed loan program — the so - called 7 ( a ) program — "self - funding" maintain that the subsidy costs for the programs can be offset by charging slightly higher fees to borrowers and lenders .

opponents express worry that shifting cost burdens to lenders will reduce the number of lenders willing to participate in the program .

it may be that only time will tell .

for fy2004 , the president's budget request had included $797.9 million for the sba .

the house approved $745.6 million for the agency , which would have been roughly a 1.9% increase over the fy2003 amount .

the house - approved version included $326.6 million for s&e , about $33.6 million below the administration request .

the senate appropriations committee recommended and the senate approved $751.7 million for the agency , including $332.4 million for s&e .

the conference agreement provided the sba with a total appropriation of $711.3 million for fy2004 , including rescissions .

the sba is an independent federal agency created by the small business act of 1953 .

although the agency administers a number of programs intended to assist small firms , arguably its three most important functions are to guarantee — principally through the agency's section 7 ( a ) general business loan program — business loans made by banks and other financial institutions ; to make long - term , low - interest loans to small businesses that are victims of hurricanes , earthquakes , other physical disasters , and acts of terrorism ; and to serve as an advocate for small business within the federal government .

the state justice institute ( sji ) is a private , nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts and funds research , technical assistance , and informational projects aimed at improving the quality of judicial administration in state courts across the united states .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sji is authorized to present its request directly to congress , apart from the president's budget .

p.l .

109-108 ( h.r .

2862 ) funds $3.5 million for sji in fy2006 , compared with $2.0 million proposed earlier by the house , $5 million proposed by the senate and $2.6 million enacted for fy2005 .

 ( like all discretionary budget authority in p.l .

109-108 , sji's appropriation is subject to a general rescission of 0.28% , provided for in title vi of the act. ) .

sji had requested $5 million for fy2006 , while the bush administration , as it had in its budgets for the previous three years , proposed eliminating federal funding for the institute altogether .

the $3.5 million approved by congress for sji in fy2006 marks the second fiscal year in a row in which funding for the institute has been increased — following a number of years during which appropriators in congress considered whether to provide any funding for sji .

for fy1999 , 2000 , and 2001 , sji received an annual appropriation of $6.85 million , after which the level of funding dropped significantly — to $3.0 million in both fy2002 and fy2003 and to $2.2 million in fy2004 .

in fy2005 , the downward trend was reversed , with $2.6 million approved for the institute .

during the previous four fiscal years , appropriations conferees in congress had encouraged sji to obtain funds , at least in part , from sources other than congress .

in response to specific directives from conferees for the fy2002 and fy2003 cjs bills , sji explored the availability of support from private donors , state and local agencies , state and local bar associations , and state court systems , but was unable to secure funding from any of them .

for fy2004 and fy2005 , conferees on the cjs bill suggested a somewhat different approach , encouraging sji to apply for funding from programs in the department of justice ( doj ) which support state court programs .

accordingly , during those two fiscal years , pursuant to an agreement between sji and doj , the latter transferred $1.2 million to the institute to support state court projects educating judges about rape , sexual assault , and other violence against women .

after scaling back the appropriations level for sji in fy2002 , fy2003 and fy2004 , congress , in a separate action , authorized multi - year funding for sji at a significantly higher level .

on september 30 , 2004 , the senate , by unanimous consent , passed h.r .

2714 ( state justice institute reauthorization act of 2004 ) , authorizing $7 million in funding for sji annually for fy2005 through fy2008 .

in october 2004 , the house agreed to the senate - amended version of h.r .

2714 , and the bill was signed by the president into law ( p.l .

108-372 ) .

earlier , in its report on h.r .

2714 ( h.rept .

108-285 , p. 2 ) , the house judiciary committee endorsed sji's continued operation .

"sustaining the institute's operations," the committee said , ... is necessary because the states , as a practical matter , devote the great majority of their judicial funding to address personnel , construction , and maintenance needs .

they simply lack the resources to develop programs that improve the administrative efficiency and overall productivity of their courts .

sji serves a federal interest precisely because it makes state courts more efficient .

state courts are the primary fora in which the vast majority of lawsuits are resolved .

in fulfilling that mission , state courts address federal constitutional and statutory issues every day... .

in sum if litigants largely resolve their legal differences at the state level — including those that involve federal issues — then congress promotes a federal interest by supporting sji .

in the fy2006 appropriations process , the house appropriations committee endorsed an approach of providing some directly appropriated funds to sji , but with the institute as well seeking additional funding from department of justice grant programs .

in reporting h.r .

2862 , the house committee ( in h.rept .

109-118 , p. 154 ) stated that it understood that sji had "been unable to generate stable sources of non - federal funding" and that the sji had contacted bar associations and court organizations as possible alternative sources of funding .

however , the committee noted , "these groups are not inclined to contribute to operations of the sji beyond providing matching grant funds for individual projects. .

for this reason , the committee said , it continued to recommend funding for sji even though the president's fy2006 request did not .

the committee commended sji for beginning to work with the department of justice's office of justice programs ( ojp ) on issues involving state courts and encouraged sji to continue to seeking funds from ojp grant programs .

 ( in addition to sji's fy2005 appropriation of $2.6 million , funds transferred from ojp increased total funding available to sji in fy2005 to $3.4 million. ) .

subsequently , in reporting its version of h.r .

2862 , the senate appropriations committee ( in s.rept .

109-88 , p. 114 ) noted simply that sji was created in 1984 "to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in state courts. .

house - senate conferees on h.r .

2862 , in recommending $3.5 million for sji for fy2006 , did not address the subject of possible sources of sji funding other than direct appropriation .

instead ( in h.rept .

109-272 , p. 206 ) , it focused on procedural requirements to be followed by applicants for sji grants .

the conferees stated that they expected that "successful applicants for new and continuing sji grants will provide a cash match of not less than 50 percent of the total cost of the project," and reminded grantees that "adherence to grant guidelines is required in order to receive further federal funding. .

the commission on international religious freedom was created by the international religious freedom act of 1998 ( p.l .

105-292 ) as a federal government commission to monitor religious freedom abroad and to advise the president , the secretary of state , and congress on promoting religious freedom and combating intolerance in other countries .

for fy2005 , the administration requested $3.0 million for the commission and h.r .

4754 as passed by the house included that amount .

the house appropriations committee in its report commended the commission for its efforts to promote religious freedom and urged the commission and the state department to continue work on developing an index on religious freedom that may be used to assess progress within regions and in specific countries .

the senate appropriations committee in reporting s. 2809 ( s.rept .

108-344 ) did not include any funds for the commission .

as finally enacted as part of the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 , p.l .

108-447 , $3.0 million was appropriated for the commission .

the conference agreement also included language allowing the commission to procure temporary services for a study of the right to freedom of religion in north korea .
