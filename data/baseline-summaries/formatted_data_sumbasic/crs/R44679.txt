the national science foundation ( nsf ) supports both basic research and education in the non - medical sciences and engineering .

congress established the foundation through the national science foundation act of 1950 to "promote the progress of science ; to advance the national health , prosperity , and welfare ; to secure the national defense ; and for other purposes. .

the nsf is a major source of federal support for u.s. university research , especially in certain fields such as mathematics .

it is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) education program portfolio and federal stem student aid and support .

this report describes selected items from the obama administration's fy2017 budget request for nsf and tracks legislative action on fy2017 appropriations to the foundation .

it also details selected authorizations of nsf appropriations proposed in the 114 th congress , summarizes budget and appropriations action from fy2015 and fy2016 , and presents information on historical funding for the foundation .

nsf has six major appropriations accounts: research and related activities ( rra ) , education and human resources ( ehr ) , major research equipment and facilities construction ( mrefc ) , agency operations and award management ( aoam ) , national science board ( nsb ) , and the office of the inspector general ( oig ) .

at times , authorizations and appropriations have been specified at the rra subaccount level , and nsf's budget justifications detail activities and obligations at that level .

the majority of nsf's primary mission activities are funded through rra , ehr , and mrefc .

nsf adopted its current appropriations account structure in fy2003 .

in general , nsf's major accounts have been comparable since then .

appropriations to nsf are typically included in annual commerce , justice , science and related agencies appropriations acts .

 ( the congressional research service tracks these acts on crs.gov , at http: / / www.crs.gov / appropriationsstatustable / index . ) .

nsf's budget justifications are published on the agency's website at http: / / www.nsf.gov / about / budget / .

the obama administration sought $7.964 billion for nsf in fy2017 , a $501 million ( 6.7% ) increase over the fy2016 estimate of $7.463 billion ( see table 1 ) .

this request included $7.564 billion in discretionary budget authority and $400 million in new one - time mandatory budget authority ( excluding new mandatory funding , the total nsf request was $101 million ( 1.3% ) greater than the fy2016 appropriation ) .

the request would have increased budget authority in three accounts relative to the fy2016 estimate: rra by $392 million ( 6.5% ) , ehr by $73 million ( 8.3% ) , and aoam by $43 million ( 13% ) .

the nsb and oig accounts would have received about the same amount as in fy2016 .

funding for the mrefc account would have decreased by $7 million ( 3.6% ) .

the requested mandatory budget funding would have been split between two accounts — $346 million for rra and $54 million for ehr .

it is not typical for nsf to request or receive mandatory funding for major accounts .

as reported by the senate committee on appropriations on april 21 , 2016 , s. 2837 , the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , would have provided a total of $7.510 billion to nsf for fy2017 .

this amount would have been $46 million ( 0.6% ) above the fy2016 estimated funding level , $54 million ( 0.7% ) below president obama's fy2017 discretionary funding request , and $454 million ( 5.7% ) below the request including new mandatory funding .

this bill would have kept funding for each of the major accounts at nearly the same level as the fy2016 estimate , except for the mrefc account , which would have increased by $46 million ( 23% ) .

as reported by the house committee on appropriations on june 6 , 2016 , h.r .

5393 , the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , would have provided a total of $7.406 billion to nsf for fy2017 .

this amount would have been $57 million ( 0.8% ) below the fy2016 estimated funding level , $158 million ( 2.1% ) below president obama's fy2017 discretionary funding request , and $558 million ( 7.5% ) below the request including new mandatory funding .

the bill would have kept funding for the ehr , nsb , and oig accounts nearly the same as the fy2016 estimate , increased the rra and aoam accounts by $46 million ( 0.8% ) and $10 million ( 3% ) , respectively , and decreased the mrefc account by $113 million ( 57% ) .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , signed by the president on may 5 , 2017 , provides $7.472 billion in discretionary funding to nsf , 0.1% above the fy2016 enacted amount .

the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-254 ) , provided funding at about 99.8% of the fy2016 funding level for the nsf through april 28 , 2017 .

the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-223 ) , provided funding for the nsf from october 1 , 2016 through december 9 , 2016 , at the fy2016 funding rate subject to a 0.496% across - the - board decrease .

the fy2017 nsf budget justification highlighted many of the same programs as in fy2016 .

specifically , the document identified two areas of major emphasis , four cross - foundation investments , and six on - going nsf - wide priorities .

the two areas of major emphasis — a new classification in the fy2017 budget document — are clean energy research and development ( r&d ) and strengthening support for core activities: the fy2017 request would have increased funding across multiple offices and rra directorates for clean energy r&d by $141 million to $512 million total , a 37.9% increase .

clean energy r&d appears to have broadly included clean energy technology , listed as one of the cross - foundation investments in fy2016 .

strengthening support for core activities would have been funded by the new mandatory budget authority request of $400 million to support "fundamental , curiosity - driven research," with a focus on supporting early - career investigators .

the budget justification reported that the mandatory funding would have allowed for an estimated 800 additional research grants to be funded .

the foundation's four cross - foundation investments aim to bring researchers from different fields of science and engineering together to address cross - disciplinary questions .

as in fy2016 , these activities included the following: understanding the brain ( utb , $142 million requested , 3.6% decrease from fy2016 estimate ) ; risk and resilience ( $43 million requested , 4.9% increase ) ; innovations at the nexus of food , energy , and water systems ( infews , $62 million requested , 27.7% increase ) ; and nsf inclusion across the nation of communities of learners of underrepresented discoverers in engineering and science ( nsf includes , $16 million requested , 3.2% increase ) .

nsf identified six ongoing foundation - wide priorities for fy2017 .

these included the following: cyber - enabled materials , manufacturing , and smart systems ( cemmss , $257 million requested , 0.3% increase over the fy2016 estimate ) ; cyberinfrastructure framework for 21 st century science , engineering , and education ( cif21 , $100 million requested , 24.4% decrease ) ; innovation corps ( i - corps , $30 million requested , no change ) ; research at the interface of biological , mathematical , and physical sciences ( biomaps , $30 million requested , 4.8% decrease ) ; science , engineering , and education for sustainability ( sees , $52 million requested , 29.8% decrease ) ; and secure and trustworthy cyberspace ( satc , $150 million requested , 15.4% increase ) .

the nsf research traineeship ( nrt ) program was no longer included in the foundation - wide priorities list , though nrt was noted as a crosscutting program with funding from the rra and ehr accounts .

the overall fy2017 request for nrt was $58.6 million , an 8.3% increase from the fy2016 estimate ( including a 9.4% decrease in requested funding through rra and a 21.4% increase through ehr ) ; this remained lower than the $74.4 million in enacted funding level for nrt in fy2015 .

for another widely tracked crosscutting program , the graduate research fellowship ( grf ) , the fy2017 request was about the same as the fy2016 estimate ( $332 million ) .

the report to accompany s. 2837 , s.rept .

114-239 ( referred to as the "senate report" in this section ) , specifically addressed one of these nsf - wide funding priorities , stating "the committee supports the nsf's request for the innovation corps [i – corps] program ..." the report to accompany h.r .

5393 , h.rept .

114-605 ( referred to as the "house report" in this section ) , recommended $5 million above the requested level for i - corps "to enable greater participation nationally. .

the explanatory statement accompanying p.l .

115-31 directs nsf to provide the requested level of $30 million for i - corps .

broadly , both reports expressed support for programs that focus on such things as cybersecurity and broadening participation in stem fields from underrepresented populations .

as reported , neither s. 2837 nor h.r .

5393 would have included the $400 million in new mandatory funding requested to strengthen support for core services .

the requested mandatory funding is not included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 .

authorizations of appropriations to nsf , which were last enacted in the america competes reauthorization act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-358 ) , expired in fy2013 .

members of the 114 th congress introduced measures to reauthorize provisions from p.l .

111-358 , including provisions that would have authorized appropriations to nsf .

as reported by the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation on june 29 , 2016 , s. 3084 , the american innovation and competitiveness act ( aica ) , would have authorized $7.510 billion for nsf in fy2017 .

however , provisions to authorize appropriations for nsf were not included in the aica bill language as enacted on january 6 , 2017 ( p.l .

114-329 ) .

as passed by the house in 2015 , h.r .

1806 , the america competes reauthorization act of 2015 , would have authorized $7.597 billion for nsf in fy2017 , specifying funding levels for major accounts and rra subaccounts .

funding levels initially proposed in each of these acts would have provided reduced authorizations of appropriations compared to the fy2013 nsf authorization levels under p.l .

111-358 .

compared to nsf budget amounts , the proposed reauthorization levels were higher than nsf's actual and estimated budget amounts in fy2015 and fy2016 .

table 3 shows the fy2013 authorization levels , appropriations to nsf in fy2015 and fy2016 , fy2017 requested amounts , and proposed authorized funding levels for nsf in fy2017 under selected reauthorization measures from the 114 th congress .

the following sections provide information on authorizations of appropriations , as well as funding data and trends , since the foundation was established in 1950 .

continuing appropriations acts ( often known as continuing resolutions [crs] ) that provide short - term funding until appropriations decisions are finalized can lead to uncertainty for agencies .

on one hand , crs allow for ongoing appropriations discussions without a funding gap .

on the other hand , they may lead to reductions or delays in agency operations , such as hiring staff , beginning new projects , and granting awards and contracts .

further , the three crs that affected agency funding levels for the first approximately seven months of fy2017 reduced nsf operations slightly below fy2016 estimated levels , including a 0.496% across - the - board decrease from fy2016 funding levels that was in effect until december 9 , 2016 , and a 0.19% decrease in effect from december 10 , 2016 until april 28 , 2017 .

in the longer term , differences between program authorizations and appropriations , and a lack of consensus between some house and senate appropriations committee recommendations , may lead to planning challenges for agencies and the broader scientific community .

for example , the competes acts sought to double funding for nsf ; while the nsf budget increased between fy2008 and fy2013 , appropriations did not reach authorized levels .

for fy2017 , there was a distinct difference between house and senate recommended funding levels for the major facilities ( mrefc ) account ; such discrepancies in recommendations may reflect broader policy disagreements .

having a clear signal from congress on likely budgetary resources may better aid future program planning .
