throughout the last few decades , the united states has maintained a strong interest in political and economic developments in el salvador .

during the 1980s , el salvador was the largest recipient of u.s. military aid in latin america as its government struggled against the fmln insurgency .

after the 1992 peace accords were signed , u.s. involvement and assistance shifted toward helping successive arena governments rebuild democracy and implement market - friendly economic reforms .

the united states is the largest supplier of foreign direct investment and among the top suppliers of foreign assistance to el salvador , as well as the destination for more than 40% of salvadoran exports .

beyond economic bonds , el salvador and the united states are linked by significant migratory and cultural ties ; close to 2 million salvadorans currently reside in the united states .

during the saca administration ( 2004-2009 ) , el salvador cooperated in counternarcotics operations , supported the u.s. coalition forces in iraq , and implemented cafta - dr .

despite some concerns that the 2009 fmln presidential victory could have complicated u.s. - salvadoran relations , bilateral relations have remained friendly since mauricio funes took office in june 2009 .

during his inauguration , which was attended by then - secretary of state hillary clinton , funes asserted his desire to "broaden , strengthen , and renew" el salvador's relations with the united states .

while some fmln officials have made anti - american remarks , funes has repeatedly referred to the united states as a strategic partner .

high - level contacts between funes and obama administration officials culminated in president funes' first visit to the white house , which took place on march 8 , 2010 .

after that meeting , president obama thanked president funes for his help in resolving the political crisis in honduras and expressed "how interested the united states is in continuing to be an equal partner with el salvador. .

in 2011 , president obama highlighted the importance of u.s. - salvadoran relations by selecting el salvador as the only central american country to be included in his march 2011 tour of latin america .

during a march 22 , 2011 , joint press conference with president funes , president obama pledged to continue "working as partners , with el salvador in the lead , to confront the hurdles to growth and development. .

he announced a number of initiatives , including the partnership for growth ( pfg ) ; the crossroads fund for border infrastructure projects ; and the central american citizen security partnership .

the salvadoran government has reciprocated by , for example , sending a small contingent of non - combatant troops to afghanistan in august 2011 and agreeing to accept detainees who had been held at guant√°namo bay , cuba , in april 2012 .

u.s. - salvadoran cooperation has continued since that time despite tension that arose during the aforementioned constitutional crisis .

u.s. - salvadoran efforts and u.s. assistance have gradually been reoriented to focus on implementing the goals of the pfg initiative: improving productivity and reducing insecurity in el salvador .

bilateral relations received a boost in mid - june 2012 when the u.s. senate approved the long - stalled nomination of mari carmen aponte to serve as u.s .

ambassador to el salvador .

in september 2012 , both governments celebrated the completion of el salvador's first mcc compact ; a second compact proposal is currently being developed by the salvadoran government .

in october 2012 , the united states donated three light helicopters to the salvadoran air force to support efforts against organized crime and to aid in disaster relief .

el salvador is one of four countries that have been selected to participate in the obama administration's partnership for growth initiative , which seeks to foster sustained economic growth and development in top - performing low - income countries .

pfg involves greater collaboration between the donor and recipient countries than traditional u.s. assistance programs , but does not necessarily portend an increase in u.s. foreign aid .

as a first step of implementing the pfg in el salvador , a binational team conducted a diagnostic study published in july 2011 that identified the two greatest constraints on growth in the country as crime and insecurity and a lack of competitiveness in the "tradables" sector .

on november 3 , 2011 , the two governments signed a 2011-2015 joint country action plan officially launching the pfg .

the action plan includes detailed pledges by the u.s. and salvadoran governments on how they intend to address the aforementioned growth constraints .

progress towards meeting each of 20 shared goals will be mutually evaluated and then made public every six months .

according to the plan , the u.s. government aims to help el salvador address crime and insecurity by strengthening judicial sector institutions and supporting crime and violence prevention programs .

the u.s. government also states its intention to help el salvador improve its infrastructure ( physical , human , and financial ) and business climate in order to attract investment and boost competitiveness .

both governments aim to involve the private sector and other donors in the pfg .

as such , president funes has formed a growth council , composed of government and business officials , to improve public - private cooperation .

a year into the implementation of the joint country action plan , the u.s. and salvadoran governments reported that 17 of 20 bilateral goals were "on track" to being met .

however , issues such as promoting the use of extraditions as a crime control mechanism , advancing civil service reform , and attracting fdi in el salvador have fallen behind schedule .

advances included: reducing crime and insecurity the enactment of an access to public information law and the drafting of an asset forfeiture law ; the establishment of an elite anti - gang unit in the pnc , the expansion of u.s. funded model precinct programs , the provision of community policing training to more than 10,000 police , and justice sector training provided to 389 officials ( including public defenders ) ; the inauguration of a family law center and mediation center for child victims of domestic violence ; the creation of one task force to combat crimes against small businesses and progress towards creating another to combat crime on public transit ; and the expansion of temporary employment , training , and job placements programs for at - risk youth ; the expansion of full - time schools nationwide ; and the opening of low - security prison farms for low - risk inmates .

improving productivity the approval of legislation backed by the private sector that is aimed at making it easier to invest in el salvador and to better regulate the free trade zones and the presentation of a law to boost private - public partnerships ; the progress made in the comalapa airport modernization project and the national assembly approval of measures to support its financing ; the provision of job training and placement assistance that helped 6,000 job seekers find employment ; and the start of programs aimed at improving the government's fiscal transparency , using results - based budgeting , and reducing tax evasion .

bilateral funding to el salvador amounted to roughly $29.8 million in fy2011 , not including disaster assistance provided in the wake of a tropical storm that hit the country in october 2011 .

el salvador is receiving an estimated $28.2 million in u.s. aid in fy2012 .

despite the austere budget environment , the administration requested $41.8 million in bilateral assistance for el salvador for fy2013 , a large increase compared to other countries in latin america and the caribbean ( see table 1 ) .

however , the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 ) , as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( h.r .

8 / p.l .

112-240 , signed into law january 2 , 2013 ) , requires an across - the - board reduction of about 5% of the annualized funding in the fy2013 continuing resolution ( p.l .

113-6 ) , according to the office of management and budget .

given uncertainty over the country allocations that would be used as the base line to calculate the sequestration , crs is unable to calculate post - sequestration funding levels for el salvador .

a possible rough estimate , however , might be determined by reducing fy2012 estimates by 5% .

as previously mentioned , u.s. bilateral assistance to el salvador is being realigned to focus on reducing insecurity and boosting productivity in the country .

as part of that effort , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) is increasing funding for institutional strengthening , violence prevention , and private sector competitiveness programs ; in contrast , health programs are ending and education programs are being reoriented .

moving forward , usaid's basic education programs will focus on in - school and out - of - school youth in high - crime communities , while tertiary programs will aim to align post - secondary training and education programs with current workforce demands .

el salvador receives some foreign assistance beyond the bilateral funds appropriated annually through the foreign operations budget .

there are approximately 73 u.s. peace corps volunteers serving in el salvador who are engaged in projects related to agro - forestry and environmental education , community organization and economic development , rural health and sanitation , and youth development .

usaid's office of foreign disaster assistance ( ofda ) provides assistance in response to natural disasters , including , most recently , more than $605,000 provided through early december 2011 in response to tropical depression 12e .

el salvador also benefits from regional trade capacity building assistance and regional anti - gang assistance funded through global funds appropriated to the state department's bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement .

el salvador also receives assistance under the central america regional security initiative ( carsi , formerly known as m√©rida - central america ) , a package of counternarcotics and anticrime assistance for the region .

as currently formulated , carsi provides equipment , training , and technical assistance to build the capacity of central american institutions to counter criminal threats .

in addition , carsi supports community - based programs designed to address underlying economic and social conditions that leave communities vulnerable to those threats .

since fy2008 , congress has appropriated nearly $500 million for central america through m√©rida / carsi .

according to the government accountability office ( gao ) , between fy2008 and fy2011 , el salvador received some $58.8 million in carsi assistance ( 17% of the funds appropriated ) .

the obama administration requested an additional $107.5 million for carsi in fy2013 .

in november 2006 , el salvador signed a five - year , $461 million compact with the millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) to develop its northern border region , where more than 53% of the population lives in poverty .

the compact included ( 1 ) a $68.5 million productive development project to provide technical assistance and financial services to farmers and rural businesses ; ( 2 ) an $89.1 million human development project to strengthen education and training and improve public services in poor communities ; and ( 3 ) a $268.8 million connectivity project to rehabilitate the northern transnational highway and some secondary roads .

the mcc compact was designed to complement the cafta - dr and regional integration efforts and is expected to benefit more than 700,000 salvadorans .

it officially ended on september 20 , 2012 .

u.s. and salvadoran officials have touted the mcc compact's effects on development and investment in el salvador's northern border region .

according to mcc , the compact enabled the construction or rehabilitation of 220 kilometers ( 137 miles ) of roads and 23 bridges , which salvadoran officials maintain has helped that area attract $57 million in private investment .

the project also provided electricity to 28,000 families ; connected 6,300 households to potable water sources ; provided vocational training to 12,000 people ; and gave supplies and technical assistance to 17,000 small - scale producers .

the salvadoran government complemented mcc investments in each of the project areas , investing $70 million in road construction and rehabilitation alone .

on december 15 , 2011 , the mcc board announced that el salvador would be eligible to develop a proposal for a second compact .

according to el salvador's then - ambassador to the united states francisco altschul , the proposal for a second compact is going to focus on improving ports and airports ; increasing access to water , electricity , and education ; and developing a tourism and communications hub in the country's southern coastal region .

the mcc board voted to keep el salvador eligible to submit a compact when it met in december 2012 and the mcc is currently providing $3 million to assist el salvador with compact development .

the compact proposal is expected to be finalized in 2013 .

although el salvador is not a producer of illicit drugs , it does serve as a transit country for narcotics , mainly cocaine and heroin , cultivated in the andes and destined for the united states via land and sea .

on september 16 , 2011 , president obama included el salvador on the list of countries designated as "major" drug - producing or "drug - transit" countries , for a second time .

a country's inclusion in the list does not mean that its antidrug efforts are inadequate .

however , corruption , a lack of internal controls in law enforcement agencies , and inadequate manpower and equipment continue to hinder bilateral efforts .

in 2012 , salvadoran officials seized 327 kilograms of cocaine , 453 kilograms of marijuana , and $2.0 million in illicit cash .

both the anti - narcotics division ( dan ) of the pnc and the military achieved fewer "operational results" in 2012 as compared to prior years due to staff turnover and shortages .

however , the dan and the salvadoran navy continued to coordinate with their u.s. counterparts .

u.s. assistance focused on improving the interdiction capabilities of salvadoran law enforcement and military agencies , particularly the joint military - police task force "grupo cuscatl√°n," and supporting the attorney general's national electronic monitoring center , an entity for which the u.s. government provided $5 million to establish that opened in 2012 .

comalapa international airport in el salvador serves as one of two cooperative security locations ( csls ) for u.s. anti - drug forces in the hemisphere .

the csl extends the reach of detection and monitoring aircraft into the eastern pacific drug smuggling corridors .

although the u.s. lease on the airport was set to expire in 2010 , el salvador signed an agreement in april 2009 that will allow the united states to continue using comalapa for an additional five years .

el salvador is also the home of the u.s. - backed international law enforcement academy ( ilea ) , which provides police management and training to officials from all of the countries of the region .

since the mid - 2000s , several u.s. agencies have been actively engaged on the law enforcement and preventive side of dealing with central american gangs ; many u.s. anti - gang efforts in central america have begun in el salvador .

in 2004 , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) created an ms - 13 task force to improve information - sharing and intelligence - gathering among u.s. and central american law enforcement officials .

the fbi established a vetted transnational anti - gang unit in el salvador in 2007 .

the bureau of immigrations and customs enforcement ( ice ) within the department of homeland security created a national anti - gang initiative called "operation community shield" in 2005 .

in addition to arresting suspected gang members in the united states , ice began coordinating anti - gang efforts with its office in el salvador and , in collaboration with the fbi , has begun providing detailed criminal history information on gang deportees to salvadoran authorities .

since fy2008 , the state department has funded anti - gang programs in el salvador with support from the m√©rida initiative / central american regional security initiative ( carsi ) and a line item in the foreign operations budget designated for "criminal youth gangs" for which roughly $35 million was provided for country and regional efforts between fy2008 and fy2012 .

a regional gang advisor based in el salvador has coordinated central american gang programs , including model police precincts and a school - based , law enforcement - led prevention program , since january 2008 .

usaid conducted a comprehensive gang assessment in 2005 and has since supported a variety of prevention programs for at - risk youth , municipal crime prevention projects , and community policing efforts .

usaid - el salvador recently announced a $42 million public - private partnership focused on crime prevention in el salvador and $2 million in grant awards to municipalities that have designed innovative crime prevention projects .

on october 11 , 2012 , the treasury department designated the ms - 13 as a significant transnational criminal organization whose assets will be targeted for economic sanctions pursuant to executive order ( e.o. ) .

13581 .

issued in july 2011 as part of the obama administration's national strategy to combat transnational organized crime , e.o .

13581 enables the treasury department to block the assets of members and associates of designated criminal organizations and prohibit u.s. citizens from engaging in transactions with them .

the treasury department worked with ice to build evidence to support the designation of the ms - 13 based on the gangs' involvement in "drug trafficking , kidnapping , human smuggling , sex trafficking , murder," and other serious criminal offenses that threaten u.s. and central american citizens .

while there is evidence that some ms - 13 cliques in the washington , dc , area collaborate with groups based in el salvador , some analysts maintain that transnational collaboration is not the norm for the ms - 13 .

salvadoran officials seemed surprised by the designation , with president funes asserting that u.s. officials may be "overestimating the economic risk or financial risk resulting from the criminal actions of the ms." he and minister of justice and public security mungu√≠a pay√©s have pledged to continue supporting efforts in the peace process involving ms - 13 and m - 18 despite the designation .

in response , u.s. officials have stood by the tco designation , asserting that it will provide law enforcement with additional tools to advance domestic and international anti - gang efforts .

the united states is home to close to 2 million salvadoran - born migrants .

the movement of large numbers of poor salvadorans to the united states has eased pressure on el salvador's social service system and labor market while providing the country with substantial remittances that constitute as much as 17% of the country's gdp .

following a series of earthquakes in el salvador in 2001 and a determination that the country was temporarily incapable of handling the return of its nationals , the u.s. government granted temporary protected status ( tps ) to an estimated 212,000 eligible salvadoran migrants .

tps has been extended several times , and is currently scheduled to expire in march 2015 .

nonetheless , many salvadoran migrants continue to be deported from the united states , including 18,870 in fy2011 , 47% of whom were deported on criminal grounds .

the united states is working with the salvadoran government in a joint effort to improve the deportation process .

in december 2009 , a bi - national working group consisting of migration authorities from both countries was formed in washington , dc .

two of the group's goals are to expedite the deportation process in order to avoid immigrants spending unnecessary time in u.s. detention centers and to address more general concerns about the current deportation process .

on may 9 , 2012 , el salvador became the first country in the world to receive more complete criminal history information on u.s. deportees , in this case gang members , through the fbi's criminal history information program ( chip ) .

the united states is el salvador's main trading partner , purchasing 45% of its exports and supplying close to 39% of its imports .

more than 300 u.s. companies currently operate in el salvador , many of which are based in the country's 13 free trade zones .

since the 1980s , el salvador has benefitted from preferential trade agreements , such as the caribbean basin initiative and later the caribbean basin trade partnership act ( cbtpa ) of 2000 , which have provided some of its exports , especially apparel and related items , duty - fee entry into the u.s. market .

as a result , the composition of salvadoran exports to the united states has shifted from agricultural products , such as coffee and spices , to apparel and textiles .

since the expiration of global textile quotas on december 31 , 2004 , salvadoran apparel producers have had trouble competing with goods from cheaper asian producers .

on december 17 , 2004 , despite strong opposition from the fmln , el salvador became the first country in central america to ratify the dominican republic - central america - united states free trade agreement ( cafta - dr ) .

el salvador was also the first country to pass the agreement's required legislative reforms , implementing cafta - dr on march 1 , 2006 .

since that time , the volume of u.s. - salvadoran trade has tended to follow trends in growth rates in the united states , with a variety of factors inhibiting the performance of salvadoran exports vis - √† - vis the other cafta - dr countries .

those factors have included a continued dependence on the highly competitive apparel trade , low levels of investment , public security problems , and broader governance concerns .

according to the july 2011 pfg assessment , a lack of competitiveness among firms in el salvador that produce internationally traded goods has prevented the country from enjoying the full benefits of cafta - dr .

the study found that el salvador may be "missing eight percentage points of gdp compared to cafta colleagues" due to its productivity constraints .

low productivity may be due , in part , to the country's low level of human capital .
