the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .

it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .

in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .

the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .

as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .

annual u.s. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period .

when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .

in the third of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2019 ( see shaded box below ) , ers projects that u.s. net farm income will rise 10.2% in 2019 to $92.5 billion , up $8.5 billion from last year .

net cash income ( calculated on a cash - flow basis ) is also projected higher in 2019 ( +15.0% ) at $119.0 billion .

the november forecast of $92.5 billion is 6.3% above the 10-year average of $87.0 billion but is well below 2013's record high of $123.7 billion .

the november 2019 net farm income forecast represents an increase from both usda's preliminary march 2019 forecast of $69.4 billion , and the august 2019 forecast of $88.0 billion ( table a - 1 ) .

the initial march forecast did not anticipate the second round of mfp payments ( valued at up to $14.5 billion ) .

the increase in government support in 2019 , projected at $22.4 billion and up 64.0% from 2018 , is the principal driver behind the rise in net farm incomeâboth year - to - year and from the previous two forecasts .

support from traditional farm programs is expected to be bolstered by large direct government payments in response to trade retaliation under the trade war with china .

direct government payments of $22.4 billion in 2019 , if realized , would represent 24.2% of net farm incomeâthe largest share since a 27.6% share in 2006 .

u.s. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income , especially since 2005 .

as a result , the financial success of the u.s. agricultural sector is strongly linked to international demand for u.s. products .

because of this strong linkage , the downturn in u.s. agricultural exports that started in 2015 ( figure 18 ) deepened the downturn in farm income that ran from 2013 through 2016 ( figure 1 ) .

since 2018 , the u.s. agricultural sector's trade outlook has been vulnerable to several international trade disputes , particularly the ongoing dispute between the united states and china .

a return to market - based farm income growth for the u.s. agricultural sector would likely need improved international trade prospects .

the u.s. farm income and asset - value situation and outlook suggest a slowly eroding financial situation heading into 2019 for the agriculture sector as a whole .

considerable uncertainty clouds the economic outlook for the sector , reflecting the downward outlook for prices and market conditions , an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses , and an increasing dependency on federal support to offset lost trade opportunities due to ongoing trade disputes .

farm asset valuesâwhich reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investmentsâare projected to be up 2.3% in 2019 to a nominal $3.1 trillion ( table a - 3 ) .

in inflation - adjusted terms ( using 2018 dollars ) , farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( figure 21 ) .

nominally higher farm asset values are expected in 2019 due to increases in both real estate values ( +2.1% ) and nonreal - estate values ( +3.4% ) .

real estate is projected to account for 83% of total farm sector asset value .

crop land values are closely linked to commodity prices .

the leveling off of crop land values since 2015 reflects stagnant commodity prices ( figure 22 ) .

total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $415.5 billion in 2019 ( +3.4% ) ( table a - 3 ) .

farm equityâor net worth , defined as asset value minus debtâis projected to be up slightly ( +2.2% ) at $2.7 trillion in 2019 ( table a - 3 ) .

the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.4% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 23 ) .

if realized , this would be the seventh consecutive year of increase in the debt - to - asset ratio .

a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt .

thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy .

average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $120,082 in 2019 ( table a - 2 ) , up 7.0% from 2018 but 10.5% below the record of $134,165 in 2014 .

about 20% ( $24,106 ) of total farm household income in 2019 is projected to be from farm production activities , and the remaining 80% ( $95,976 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) .

the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 24 ) .

since 2014 , over half of u.s. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations .

since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 25 ) .

in 2018 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $112,211 was about 25% higher than the average u.s. household income of $90,021 ( table a - 2 ) .

 figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 present usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commoditiesâcorn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens .

the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons .

usda farm income data tables table a - 1 to table a - 3 present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of u.s. agriculture .

in addition , table a - 4 presents the annual average farm price received for several major commodities , including the usda forecast for the 2019-2020 marketing year .
