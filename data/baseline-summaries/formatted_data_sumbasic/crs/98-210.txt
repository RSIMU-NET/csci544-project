the department of defense manages the world's largest dedicatedinfrastructure , covering over 40,000 square miles of land and a physical plant worthover $500 billion .

the annual military construction appropriations bill provides mostof the funding to maintain and upgrade this infrastructure .

the bill fundsconstruction projects and real property maintenance of the active army , navy &marine corps , air force , and their reserve components ; defense - wide construction ; u.s. contributions to the nato security investment program ( formerly called thenato infrastructure program ) ; and military family housing operations andconstruction .

the bill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure ( brac ) account , which finances most base realignment and closure costs , includingconstruction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions , andenvironmental cleanup at closing sites .

the military construction appropriations bill is one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense .

other major legislationincludes ( 1 ) the defense appropriations bill , that provides funds for all militaryactivities of the department of defense , except for military construction ; ( 2 ) thenational defense authorization bill , that authorizes appropriations for nationaldefense , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) the energy and water developmentappropriations bill , that providesfunding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy .

threeother appropriations - - va - hud - independent agencies , commerce - justice - state,and transportation - - also include small amounts for national defense .

in addition,the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funds for civilprojects carried out by the u.s. army corps of engineers .

the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defense appropriations measures described above .

therefore , major debates over defensepolicy and funding issues , including military construction may also occur in actionon the authorization bill .

since issues in the defense authorization and appropriationsare so interwoven , this report highlights salient parts of the authorization bill , alongwith the military construction appropriations process .

military construction appropriations are the major , but not the sole , source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies .

thedefense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance inoperation and maintenance accounts .

in addition , funds for construction andmaintenance of "morale , welfare , and recreation ( mwr ) " facilities , are partiallyprovided through proceeds from commissaries , recreation user fees , and otherincome .

most funds appropriated by congress each year must be obligated in that fiscal year .

military construction appropriations are an exception .

 ( 2 ) these funds aregenerally made available for obligation for five fiscal years .

consideration of the military construction budget starts when the president's budget is delivered to the congress each year .
