title ii typically includes the appropriations for the department of commerce and related agencies .

the origins of the department date back to 1903 with the establishment of the department of commerce and labor ( 32 stat .

825 ) .

the separate department of commerce was established on march 4 , 1913 ( 37 stat .

7365 ; 15 u.s.c .

1501 ) .

the department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied , but its activities center on five basic missions: ( 1 ) promoting the development of american business and increasing foreign trade ; ( 2 ) improving the nation's technological competitiveness ; ( 3 ) encouraging economic development ; ( 4 ) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment ; and ( 5 ) compiling , analyzing and disseminating statistical information on the u.s. economy and population .

national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) advises the president on domestic and international communications policy , manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum , and performs research in telecommunications sciences .

for fy2005 appropriations , the administration requested roughly $5.96 billion for title ii , including the commerce department and related agencies .

the house bill ( h.r .

4754 ) would have appropriated $5.65 billion and the senate bill ( s. 2608 ) would have appropriated $6.80 billion .

the final appropriation ( p.l .

108-447 , before rescissions ) is $6.60 billion .

the federal communications commission , created in 1934 , is an independent agency charged with regulation of interstate and foreign communication of radio , television , wire , cable , and satellite .

the fcc performs four major functions: spectrum allocation , creating rules to promote fair competition and protect consumers where required by market conditions , authorization of service , and enforcement .

among its responsibilities are licensing of communications operators ; interpretation and enforcement of rules , regulations , and authorizations regarding competition ; publication and dissemination of consumer information services ; and management and allocation of the use of the electromagnetic spectrum .

fcc priorities for fy2005 include increasing broadband penetration throughout the country ; implementing spectrum - use plans ; overseeing competitive developments in all areas of broadcast and cable media ; monitoring compliance with indecency regulations ; and promoting homeland security goals with respect to critical communications infrastructures .

the fcc obtains the majority of its funding through the collection of regulatory fees pursuant to title i , section 9 of the communications act of 1934 ; therefore , its direct appropriation is considerably less than its overall budget .

p.l .

108-447 includes $281,098,000 for the salaries and expenses of the fcc for fy2005 , a $7,140,000 increase over the fy2004 appropriation of $273,958,000 .

of the amounts provided , $280,098,000 will be derived from offsetting fee collections , resulting in a net direct appropriation of $1,000,000 .

the administration originally requested a budget of $292,958,000 with a direct appropriation of $20,000,000 for fy2005 ; the house approved $279,851,000 with a direct appropriation of $6,893,000 and the senate approved $282,346,000 with a direct appropriation of $1,000,000 .

the fcc is allocated up to $85,000,000 to administer the spectrum auctions program .

the law includes the following specific items: up to $600,000 for land and structure up to $500,000 for care and improvement of grounds and repair to buildings up to $4,000 for official reception and representation expenses purchase and hire of vehicles ( no amount given ) special counsel fees ( no amount given ) fees as authorized by 5 u.s.c .

3109 ( which limits the maximum earnings of experts and consultants ) collection of $280,098,000 in section 9 fees — the sum appropriated to be reduced as section 9 fees are collected — fees in excess of $280,098,000 to be available in fy2006 .

proceeds up to $85,000,000 from any auctions may be retained and made available for obligation for fy2006 .

other sections of p.l .

108-447 will also have an impact on the fcc .

first , section 634 of prohibits the fcc from " modifying , amending , or changing its rules or regulations for universal service support payments to implement the february 27 , 2004 , recommendations of the federal - state joint board on universal service regarding single connection or primary line restrictions on universal service support payments. .

 ( for more information on this item , please refer to in the matter of federal - state joint board on universal service , cc docket no .

96-45 , recommended decision , fcc 04j - 1 , february 27 , 2004 .

this document is available online at http: / / hraunfoss.fcc.gov / edocs_public / attachmatch / fcc - 04j - 1a1.pdf . ) .

second , section 638 allows the fcc to sell monitoring facilities in hawaii and california .

finally , p.l .

108-447 included the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act of 2004 in title ix .

 ( the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act , h.r .

4501 , was introduced by representative fred upton and was reported out of the house on july 22 , 2004 .

see house report 108-634 for additional information. ) .

the conference agreement also includes , by reference , language from both the house and senate reports .

house report: set forth public notice requirements for broadcast applications set forth requirements for ravel payments included language regarding the fcc's accounting system , stating that congress expected the fcc to differentiate between the costs of auctions and other costs .

senate report: noted the continuing concern about the declining standards of broadcast television and the impact of that decline on america's children .

directed the fcc to continue to report to congress on the issues associated with implementing a broadcast industry code of conduct for content of programming that , if adhered to by the broadcast industry , would protect against the further erosion of broadcasting standards .

the conference report includes language on a number of other issues , as well .

first , the conferees noted that the fcc is considering subjecting prepaid phone cards to increased regulation .

they expressed concern that members of the armed services and their families make extensive use of prepaid phone cards to stay in contact and that increased regulation could increase the cost of those cards .

therefore , the conferees directed the fcc not to take any action that would directly or indirectly have the effect of raising the rates charged to military personnel or their families for telephone calls placed using prepaid phone cards .

second , the conferees encouraged the fcc to follow through on its plan to modernize its radio frequency radiation monitoring equipment by purchasing selective radiation meter ( srm ) units and anticipates that future budget requests will address replacement of outdated equipment .

for fy2005 , the administration requested a program level of $205.4 million for the federal trade commission ( ftc ) .

this figure is considerably larger than both the fy2004 request and the amount approved in the conference report .

the house approved a program level of $203.4 million , an increase of $17.9 million over the current - year funding .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $207.7 million for fy2005 .

the conference agreement provides the ftc with $205.4 million , as requested .

more specifically , of the amounts provided , $101 million will come from fees for hart - scott - rodino premerger notification filings , $21.9 million will come from do - not - call provisions of the telemarketing sales rule , and congress will provide a direct appropriation of $82.5 million .

for fy2004 , the administration had requested a program level of $191 million for the ftc , an increase of $14 million over the fy2003 level .

the requested program level for fy2004 was to have been fully funded by a $14 million direct appropriation and offsetting collections from two sources: $159 million from fees for hart - scott - rodino premerger notification filings ; and $18 million from fees sufficient to implement and enforce new do - not - call provisions of the telemarketing sales rule .

the house approved a program level of $183 million for the ftc .

the senate recommended a program level of $189 million .

the conference agreement provides $185.5 million for the ftc , including recisions .

of the amounts provided , $112 million is from premerger fees , $23.1 million is derived from do - not - call fees , and $50.4 million is a direct appropriation .

the ftc , an independent agency , is responsible for enforcing a number of federal antitrust and consumer protection laws .

in recent years the ftc has used pre - merger filing fees collected under the hart - scott - rodino act to mostly or entirely fund its operations .

for fy2000 through fy2002 , zero ( $0 ) direct appropriations were required .

the lsc is a private , non - profit , federally - funded corporation that provides grants to local offices which , in turn , provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( non - criminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s , and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency , and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annual appropriations laws , congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases .

p.l .

108-199 , the consolidated appropriations for fy2004 , among other things continued funding for the lsc at the fy2003 level of $338.8 million .

p.l .

108-199 included $317.5 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $13.3 million for management and administration , $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology , $2.6 million for the inspector general , and $2.5 million in grants equitably distributed to the ten states most negatively affected by recent census - based reallocations that were based on shifts in the poverty population indicated by the 2000 census .

it also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

moreover , the $338.8 million lsc appropriation for fy2004 was subject to the mandated 0.59% across - the - board government - wide rescission , and an additional 0.465% uniform rescission applicable only to funding for the commerce , justice , state , the judiciary , and related agencies appropriation ( which includes the lsc ) , thereby lowering the fy2004 lsc appropriation to $335.3 million .

for fy2005 , the bush administration requested $329.3 million for the lsc .

this is $6 million less than the $335.3 million ( after the rescissions ) that was appropriated for the lsc for fy2004 .

the fy2005 budget request for the lsc included $310.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $13.3 million for management and administration , $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology , and $2.6 million for the inspector general .

the budget request for the lsc also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

on june 23 , 2004 , the house appropriations committee recommended $335.3 million for the lsc for fy2005 ( h.r .

4754 , see h.rept .

108-576 ) .

this amount is the same as the fy2004 appropriation for the lsc ( after the 0.59% and 0.465% rescissions ) ; and $6.0 million above the bush administration's fy2005 budget request for the lsc .

the house committee recommendation for the lsc included $316.6 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $13.2 million for management and administration , $2.9 million for client self - help and information technology , and $2.6 million for the inspector general .

it also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

in addition the house appropriations committee recommendation included a provision to allow the lsc to spend up to $1 million of prior - year funding balances for a law school student loan repayment pilot program in fy2005 in an effort to encourage more lawyers to pursue careers in legal assistance .

on july 8 , 2004 , the house passed h.r .

4754 which includes $335.3 million of the lsc .

on september 15 , 2004 , the senate appropriations committee recommended $335.0 million for the lsc for fy2005 ( s. 2809 , see s.rept .

108-344 ) .

this amount is $282,000 below the fy2004 appropriation for lsc and $5.7 million above the administration's fy2005 budget request .

the senate committee recommendation for the lsc included $312.251 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $13.9 million for management and administration , $3.4 million for client self - help and information technology , $2.6 million for the inspector general , and $2.849 million for grants to offset losses due to census adjustments .

it also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

on november 20 , 2004 , the house passed h.r .

4818 , the conference report ( h.rept .

108-792 ) on a consolidated appropriations bill .

the conference agreement included $335.3 million for the lsc: $316.6 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $13.0 million for management and administration , $1.3 million for client self - help and information technology , $2.6 million for the inspector general , and $1.8 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census - based reallocations .

it also included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

in addition , it allows the lsc to spend up to $1 million of prior - year funding balances for a school student loan repayment pilot program .

the senate also passed h.r .

4818 on november 20 , 2004 , but held it back because of a dispute with the house over access to tax records of individual taxpayers ; the house passed a resolution making the necessary changes on december 6 , 2004 ; and h.r .

4818 became p.l .

108-447 on december 8 , 2004 .

further , p.l .

108-447 authorizes a 0.8% across - the - board government - wide rescission and an additional 0.54% uniform rescission applicable only to funding for the commerce , justice , state , and related agencies appropriation ( which includes the lsc ) , thereby lowering the fy2005 lsc appropriation to $330.8 million .

the sec administers and enforces federal securities laws to protect investors from fraud and to maintain fair and orderly stock and bond markets .

the sec collects fees on sales of stock and other securities market transactions .

during the stock market boom of the 1990s , these collections exceeded the agency's budget by a wide margin .

legislation passed by the 107 th congress ( p.l .

107-123 ) reduced these fees , with the intention of limiting collections to approximately the amount of the sec's budget .

for fy2004 , the administration requested $841.5 million for the sec .

the house and senate appropriations committees each approved that amount .

the conference agreement reduced the amount requested by the administration and approved by both chambers by $30 million , to $811.5 million .

the conference report cited the sec's inability to fill all the positions funded by the previous year's appropriation as the reason for the reduction .

p.l .

108-199 , the omnibus appropriations measure , approved the $811.5 million .

of the total , $691.5 million is to come from fee collections , and $120 million from prior year unobligated balances .

for fy2005 , the administration requested $913.0 million , an increase of 13% over fy2004 .

the house approved the amount requested by the administration for the sec in fy2005 .

of the total $913.0 , $893 million is to come from current - year fee collections , and the remaining $20 million from prior - year unobligated balances .

there will be no appropriation from the general fund .

the senate appropriations committee also approved the requested amount of $913.0 million .

the conference committee approved the $913.0 amount , but that was to include $56 million in prior - year unobligated balances .

thus , the new appropriation is $856 million , which will be covered by current - year fee collections .

for fy2005 , the administration requested a total appropriation of $678.4 million for the small business administration ( sba ) , a reduction of $32.9 million , or about 4.6% , from the agency's current funding level .

the fy2005 request includes $326.3 million for salaries and expenses ( s&e ) .

the house approved $742.8 million , $31.5 million more than the agency's fy2004 appropriation .

the house - approved fy2005 appropriation included $315.4 million for s&e , which was $10.9 million less than the president's budget recommendation and approximately $7 million less than its fy2004 appropriation .

the senate appropriations committee recommended a total fy2005 appropriation of $761.9 million , including $357.7 million for s&e .

during the debate on the fy2005 cjs bill several amendments were adopted on the house floor , including one by chairman of the small business committee , donald a. manzullo , which would have provided a $79 million subsidy for the sba's 7 ( a ) loan program .

the conference report provides the sba with $579.5 million for fy2005 , including $322.3 million for s&e .

while this is substantially less than the administration requested — and the house and senate recommended — it is not will not result in a reduction in the agency's guaranteed loan program levels .

it is not clear , however , what the economic effect will be .

proponents for making the agency's largest guaranteed loan program — the so - called 7 ( a ) program — "self - funding" maintain that the subsidy costs for the programs can be offset by charging slightly higher fees to borrowers and lenders .

opponents express worry that shifting cost burdens to lenders will reduce the number of lenders willing to participate in the program .

it may be that only time will tell .

for fy2004 , the president's budget request had included $797.9 million for the sba .

the house approved $745.6 million for the agency , which would have been roughly a 1.9% increase over the fy2003 amount .

the house - approved version included $326.6 million for s&e , about $33.6 million below the administration request .

the senate appropriations committee recommended and the senate approved $751.7 million for the agency , including $332.4 million for s&e .

the conference agreement provided the sba with a total appropriation of $711.3 million for fy2004 , including recissions .

the sba is an independent federal agency created by the small business act of 1953 .

although the agency administers a number of programs intended to assist small firms , arguably its three most important functions are to guarantee — principally through the agency's section 7 ( a ) general business loan program — business loans made by banks and other financial institutions ; to make long - term , low - interest loans to small businesses that are victims of hurricanes , earthquakes , other physical disasters , and acts of terrorism ; and to serve as an advocate for small business within the federal government .

the institute is a private , nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts and conducts activities to further the development of judicial administration in state courts throughout the united states .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sji is authorized to present its request directly to congress , apart from the president's budget .

for fy2005 , the sji requested $7 million , compared with $2.2 million appropriated to it for fy2004 .

 ( in its budget submission , sji noted that its fy2005 request was $6 million lower than the amount it requested for fy2004. ) .

for its part , the president's fy2005 budget , like the previous two years' budgets , proposed nothing for sji .

the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

108-447 ) provides $2.6 million for sji .

however , as the result of two across - the - board rescissions in the act , discretionary spending in the sji account is reduced by 1.34% .

 ( earlier , the house approved $2.2 million for sji in fy2005 , the same as its fy2004 appropriation , while the senate appropriations committee recommended $3.0 million. ) .

over the past three fiscal years , congress has approved funding for sji at a level significantly below previous levels .

for fy1999 , 2000 and 2001 , sji received an annual appropriation of $6.85 million , compared with $3.0 million in both fy2002 and fy2003 and $2.2 million in fy2004 .

for their part , conferees for the cjs appropriations bills in the last three fiscal years have encouraged the institute to obtain funds from sources other than congress .

in response to specific directives from conferees for the fy2002 and fy2003 cjs bills , sji explored the availability of support from private donors , state and local agencies , state and local bar associations , and state court systems , but was unable to secure funding from any of them .

in fy2004 , conferees on the cjs bill encouraged sji to apply for funding from programs in the department of justice ( doj ) which support state court programs , and discussions between sji and doj officials followed .

in november 2003 , an inter - agency agreement was reached between sji and doj's office on violence against women , for the latter to transfer $1.2 million to the institute to support state court projects educating judges about rape , sexual assault , and other violence against women .

adding the $1.2 million from the inter - agency agreement increased the funds available to sji in fy2004 to $3.45 million .

the institute also has been in recent discussions with the justice department's bureau of justice assistance to pursue other possible fund transfers to sji .

sji said its fy2005 request for a $4.75 million increase over its fy2004 appropriation would support: a continuation of its national technical assistance program addressing the highest priorities identified by state courts ; an anti - terrorism initiative to protect highly vulnerable and symbolic courthouses from violent acts ; and an expansion of the institute's special interest categories beyond the five high priority areas in current sji guidelines .

 ( sji is currently awarding grants in these five categories: access to the courts , application of technology in the courts , children and families in court ; judicial branch education , and the relationship between state and federal courts. ) .

on june 23 , 2004 , the house appropriations committee approved h.r .

4754 , its cjs - judiciary appropriations bill for fy2005 .

in its report on the bill , the committee explained its funding support for sji , despite the fact that the president's budget proposed eliminating federal funding for the institute .

the committee observed that the president's budget provided a variety of grant programs to assist state courts under the office of justice programs ( ojp ) in the department of justice .

the committee commended sji for beginning to work with ojp in fy2004 and encouraged sji to continue to seek funds from ojp grant programs .

the committee noted that sji has been unable to generate stable sources of non - federal funding .

while sji has contacted bar associations and court organizations , the committee said , "these groups are not inclined to contribute to operations of the sji beyond providing matching grant funds for individual projects .

for this reason , the committee has continued to provide federal funds for sji even though the president's request does not include funding for this organization. .

subsequently , the house on july 8 , 2004 , in its passage of h.r .

4754 , approved the $2.2 million appropriation to sji for fy2005 , as recommended by the house appropriations committee .

on september 15 , 2004 the senate appropriations committee approved s. 2809 , which includes an fy2005 appropriation for sji of $3.0 million .

in a related development , the senate on september 30 , 2004 by unanimous consent passed h.r .

2714 , authorizing a $7 million appropriation for sji annually for fy2005 through fy2008 .

on october 8 , 2004 , the house agreed to the senate - amended version of h.r .

2714 , and on october 25 , 2004 , the bill was signed into law by the president ( p.l .

108-372 ) .

prior to the senate action , h.r .

2714 had been approved by house judiciary committee on september 10 , 2003 ( and , as amended , passed by the full house , on march 10 , 2004 , by voice vote under suspension of the rules ) .

in its report on h.r .

2714 ( h.rept .

108-285 , at p. 2 ) , the house judiciary committee endorsed sji's continued operation .

"sustaining the institute's operations," the committee said , is necessary because the states , as a practical matter , devote the great majority of their judicial funding to address personnel , construction , and maintenance needs .

they simply lack the resources to develop programs that improve the administrative efficiency and overall productivity of their courts .

sji serves a federal interest precisely because it makes state courts more efficient .

state courts are the primary fora in which the vast majority of lawsuits are resolved .

in fulfilling that mission , state courts address federal constitutional and statutory issues everyday .

 .

 .

 .

in sum if litigants largely resolve their legal differences at the state level — including those that involve federal issues — then congress promotes a federal interest by supporting sji .

the u.s. commission on civil rights ( commission ) , established by the civil rights act of 1957 , investigates allegations of citizens that they were denied the right to vote based on color , race , religion , or national origin ; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws ; assesses federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights ; and submits reports on its findings to the president and congress when the commission or the president deem it appropriate .

for the commission on civil rights , the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ( p.l .

108-447 ) provides $9.1 million , the same amount requested by the administration .

in fy2004 , the commission received an appropriation of $9 million .

the commission on international religious freedom was created by the international religious freedom act of 1998 ( p.l .
