ghana , a country of 28 million people on west africa's atlantic coast , faces diverse development challenges , but has built a robust democracy notable for consistent peaceful turnovers of executive power since a transition to multiparty rule in the early 1990s .

the country also has made progress toward many of the socioeconomic outcomes that successive u.s. administrations have sought to foster in africa , and u.s. policymakers have tended to view ghana as a stable u.s. partner in an often - volatile region .

substantial u.s. bilateral aid has both been premised on and arguably contributed to ghana's generally positive development trajectory .

amicable relations between the united states and ghana , a former british colony , have persisted since 1957 , when ghana became the first colonized sub - saharan african country to gain independence .

in 2008 , then - president george w. bush visited ghana to showcase u.s. aid programs on trade , entrepreneurship , health , education , and ghana's first millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) compact .

in 2009 , then - president barack obama traveled to ghana to highlight the nation as a democratic model for other african countries .

the trump administration has signaled support for continued close cooperation , although there has been some recent tension over reported ghanaian noncooperation with u.s. immigration law enforcement proceedings .

the administration also has proposed sharp cuts in bilateral aid as part of its overall emphasis on reducing foreign assistance , which could affect relations .

during the obama administration , u.s. aid to ghana was provided primarily under u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) - administered global presidential development initiatives .

these included feed the future ( ftf , a global food security effort ) , the global health initiative ( ghi ) , the global climate change initiative ( gcci ) , and several africa - specific initiatives: power africa , trade africa , and the young african leaders initiative ( yali ) .

in 2014 ghana signed a second mcc compact focused on the electrical power sector .

ghana was also selected to join the obama administration's african peacekeeping rapid response partnership ( aprrp ) and its security governance initiative ( sgi ) , both launched in 2014 .

ghana is a key international peacekeeping troop contributor in africa , and engages in regular joint military training exercises and other security cooperation with the united states .

ghana has also played an active and constructive role in regional affairs .

it has been a leader in various regional interventions to address political and security crises in west africa and has hosted refugees fleeing conflict .

the ghanaian government is currently helping to mediate long - standing government - opposition political tensions in neighboring togo .

it also hosted a regional hub that supported united nations ( u.n. ) operations to counter the 2014-2015 ebola outbreak in nearby countries .

ghanaians have played leadership roles in regional and multilateral organizations .

ghana supports economic community of west african states and african union efforts to foster regional and continental economic integration .

at a global level , ghana seeks to sustain positive donor relations , aid , and investment , and contribute to multilateral policymaking relating to peace , stability , development , and scientific cooperation , while also expanding its foreign export markets .

the predecessor of ghana's incumbent president nana addo dankwa akufo - addo was john dramani mahama , who came to office in july 2012 as the constitutional successor of president john atta mills , who died in office of natural causes earlier that month .

mahama then won election in polls held in late 2012 .

ghana's most recent general elections , held on december 7 , 2016 , were generally regarded as free and fair , despite tensions and isolated incidents of political violence .

the presidential race featured a rematch between mahama , of the national democratic congress ( ndc ) , and akufo - addo , of the new patriotic party ( npp ) .

these two parties dominate national politics to such an extent that ghana effectively has a two - party system .

akufo - addo won 53.7% of votesâexceeding the 50-percent - plus - one threshold necessary to preclude a runoff voteâagainst 44.5% for mahama .

akufo - addo took office in january 2017 .

the npp also won 171 of 275 legislative seats and the ndc 104 .

the strength of akufo - addo's first - round win was noteworthy , as he had lost two prior presidential runoffs by razor - thin margins .

despite moderate economic improvements in 2016 , widespread frustration over poor economic performance under mahama likely clinched his electoral defeat .

during mahama's tenure , multiple downward economic trends converged , spurring repeated protests over unemployment and socioeconomic challenges .

ghana has largely recovered from a period of low growth under former president mahama .

the value of ghana's gdp reached an estimated $65 billion in 2018 , up from an annual average of $55.8 billion from 2013 through 2017 , while gdp grew by 5.6% in 2018âan arguably healthy rate , but one lower than the 8.1% rate achieved in 2017 .

the international monetary fund ( imf ) projects that the growth rate will rise to 8.8% in 2019 before slowing to an average of 3.7% over the next five years .

in the aggregate , however , that growth would be significant ; the imf anticipates that gdp will be worth $97 billion in 2024 .

increases in the prices of ghana's key commodity exports have helped spur the post - mahama recovery .

historically , ghana's most important exports have been cocoa and gold .

crude oil has become a third major commodity export since 2010 , when production from newly discovered oil fields began .

the oil and gas sector is expected to rapidly expand following a period of weak oil prices and a number of technical production challenges .

ghana's domestic economy is more diverse and dynamic than the economies of many of its west african peers .

the services sector , which includes a small stock market , a nascent call - and information - processing sector , and a mobile money market worth $35 billion , has grown particularly rapidly since the mid - 2000s .

services , which are centered in cities , where about 56% of ghanaians live , contributed an estimated 42% of gdp in 2017 .

agriculture's share of gdp has declined over the past decade , from 36% in 1997 to 20% in 2017 , but the sector remains an economic keystone ; it employed 34% of the labor force in 2017 .

compared with much of west africa , ghana has fairly effective public goods and service provision capacities , and relatively high cell phone usage and electricity access rates , which underpin production , digital trade , and financial transactions .

access to reliable power is projected to increase as multiple new power plant projects come onlineâthough in the meantime , power generation and transmission capacities remain unreliable and costly .

ghana is also continuing to expand natural gas production and related transport and storage infrastructure , primarily for use in electricity production , but also for applications in other sectors ( eg , for fertilizer production ) .

a multi - year slide in the exchange value of ghana's cedi currency that began under mahama has continued under akufo - addo , hurting the trade balance and hindering economic activity , due to a heavy reliance on imported goods .

despite the npp's strong criticism of the mahama government's deficit spending and other aspects of its economic policy record , including its high deficit spending , the akufo - addo administration has continued to borrow heavily to fund its policy agenda .

it sold $2 billion worth of eurobonds in may 2018 and another $3 billion in march 2019 , after issuing roughly $1.2 billion in state - backed bonds to finance state - owned enterprise energy sector debts earlier in the akufoâ­addo administration .

public debt climbed from 57.1% of gdp in 2016 , mahama's final year in office , to 59.6% of gdp in early 2018 ( latest data ) .

debt payments and efforts to fulfill the npp's campaign pledges have helped drive such spending .

to help ghana address fiscal imbalances , external account deficits , exchange rate - linked rises in inflation , and power shortages , in 2015 the imf began a $925 million , policy - conditioned extended credit facility ( ecf ) loan program .

the akufo - addo government maintained the program , while requesting and receiving waivers allowing deviations from some ecf targets .

the program was extended into early 2019 .

the imf has generally praised the government's economic performance , notably regarding revenue collection efforts , public debt audits aimed at identifying invalid claims , and accountability measures ( eg , the creation of a special prosecutor post ( see above ) and a proposed public financial management act ) .

it has also called new government credit commitments "justified," while also warning that the national debt loads remain "at high risk of distress. .

annual foreign direct investment ( fdi ) has generally grown in recent years , especially in the energy sector .

according to the u.n. conference on trade and development , fdi flows into ghana averaged $3.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2016 , while fdi stock averaged $26.5 billion .

the world bank's 2019 doing business report ranks ghana 114 th out of 190 countries surveyed .

this is far below its 2012 ranking of 63 rd among 183 countries , yet still placed ghana in the top - performing quarter of african countries .

under mahama , ghana created an investment promotion center to oversee fdi and streamline investment procedures .

while in its 2019 investment climate statement for ghana the state department reported that ghana has "one of the more open" investment climates in africa , it also cited a number of "troubling" foreign investment policy in recent years .

the trump administration has not announced any major changes in u.s. policy toward ghana , but has proposed a sharp reduction to usaid and state department - administered aid for ghana , which could affect bilateral relations .

according to the state department , the united states and ghana "share a long history promoting democracy , human rights , and the rule of law," and ghana is a model for its peers throughout africa "in promoting resilient democratic institutions , transparent and peaceful transitions of power and regional stability. .

there have also been robust "people - to - people" relations since the late 1950s , notably in the form of learning exchange visits and cooperation among educational and scientific institutions , and thousands of ghanaians have been educated in the united states .

there are close cultural ties , notably between ghanaians and african - americans ; there is a substantial african - american expatriate community in ghana .

despite generally amicable bilateral relations , the u.s. department of homeland security ( dhs ) in coordination with the department of state imposed visa sanctions on ghana in january 2019 , citing a "lack of cooperation in accepting their nationals ordered removed from the united states"âan issue of particular salience for the trump administration .

the restrictions affect tourist and business visitor visas for certain government officials and , in some cases , their families and attendants .

the united states had earlier warned that it might take such an action: in june 2018 , the united states alleged that ghana's government was insufficiently cooperating with u.s. deportation orders by not interviewing or providing travel documents to ghanaians being deported from the united states .

in such cases , the united states pays for charter flights to effect removals .

despite periodic challenges , a long history of positive u.s. - ghanaian relations suggests that bilateral cooperation relating to development , trade , and security is likely to endure .

president akufo - addo's stated goal of decreasing and ultimately ending ghana's need for foreign aid , and his embrace of private - sector - led growth models , are likely to be received positively by most u.s. policymakers .

his message of economic self - reliance may resonate , in particular , with the trump administration , given president trump's contention that leaders of all countries should prioritize their own nations' economic interests .

if ghana is able to become more self - sufficient and boost its economic production and trade capacity , diversify its economy , and reduce poverty , it could also become a more significant u.s. trade partner .
