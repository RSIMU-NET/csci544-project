this report describes the president's proposal for fy2005 appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs , as submitted to the congress february 2 , 2004 , and the congressional response to that proposal .

it compares the president's fy2005 request to the fy2004 l - hhs - ed amounts .

it tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the fy2005 l - hhs - ed appropriations bill , with particular attention paid to discretionary programs .

in addition , the report summarizes activities related to the annual budget process , such as the congressional budget resolution , continuing resolutions , and supplemental appropriations ( see " related legislation " ) .

however , the report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory l - hhs - ed programs — such as medicare or social security — nor will it follow the authorizing legislation associated with funding some of the president's initiatives .

for a glossary of budget terms and relevant websites , see appendix a .

for funding resources for l - hhs - ed agencies , see appendix b .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the 13 regular appropriations bills , not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion , stem cell research , and human cloning , or modifications of overtime pay regulations .

this bill provides most of the discretionary funds for three federal departments and several related agencies including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

of the 13 annual appropriations bills , the l - hhs - ed bill is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs ; the defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs .

for fy2004 , the l - hhs - ed bill accounted for $140.9 billion ( 17.9% ) and the defense bill accounted for $336.1 billion ( 46.5% ) of the estimated $787.3 billion total for all federal discretionary budget authority , as reported in budget of the united states government fiscal year 2005 , table s - 5 .

this section summarizes major funding changes proposed for l - hhs - ed and related issues such as 302 ( b ) allocations , advance appropriations , and earmarks for specific projects .

later sections provide additional details for each l - hhs - ed department .

the fy2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations at the department of labor ( dol ) was $12.0 billion , $0.2 billion ( 1.7% ) more than the fy2004 appropriations of $11.8 billion , as shown in table 6 .

the fy2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations at the department of health and human services ( hhs ) was $63.2 billion , $1.0 billion ( 1.6% ) more than the fy2004 appropriations of $62.2 billion , as shown in table 8 .

the house bill would have provided $63.2 billion ; as reported , the senate bill would have provided $64.5 billion .

the conference amount , as enacted , is $64.2 billion , prior to the offsets required elsewhere in the conference agreement ( see page 8 ) .

mandatory hhs programs included in the l - hhs - ed bill were funded at $298.1 billion in fy2004 , and consist primarily of grants to states for medicaid ( $189.3 billion ) , payments to medicare trust funds ( $95.1 billion — virtually all of this amount was for part b supplementary medical insurance ) , foster care and adoption ( $6.8 billion ) , family support payments to states ( $4.5 billion ) , and social services block grant ( $1.7 billion ) .

the fy2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations at the department of education ( ed ) was $57.3 billion , $1.6 billion ( 2.9% ) more than the fy2004 appropriations of $55.7 billion , as shown in table 10 .

the house bill would have provided $57.7 billion ; as reported , the senate bill would have provided $58.8 billion .

the conference amount , as enacted , is $57.0 billion , prior to the offsets required elsewhere in the conference agreement ( see page 8 ) .

a single mandatory ed program is included in the l - hhs - ed bill ; the vocational rehabilitation state grants program was funded at $2.6 billion in fy2004 .

the fy2005 budget request for discretionary appropriations for l - hhs - ed related agencies was $10.3 billion , $0.2 billion ( 2.0% ) more than the fy2004 appropriations of $10.1 billion , as shown in table 12 .

the house bill would have provided $10.5 billion ; as reported , the senate bill would have provided the same .

the conference amount , as enacted , is $10.6 billion , prior to offsets required elsewhere in the conference agreement ( see page 8 ) .

mandatory programs for related agencies included in the l - hhs - ed bill were funded at $35.9 billion in fy2004 , virtually all of it for the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .

several proposals related to l - hhs - ed appropriations were introduced during the second session of the 108 th congress , including a series of fy2005 continuing resolutions , fy2005 supplemental appropriations , fy2005 budget resolutions , and a bill to provide fy2005 appropriations for ed .

early in the session , the senate approved passage of p.l .

108-199 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2004 , which provided most of the fy2004 appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs .

a series of three continuing resolutions — p.l .

108-309 , p.l .

108-416 , and p.l .

108-434 — provided temporary fy2005 appropriations for most ongoing l - hhs - ed programs , including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees , for the period october 1 , 2004 , through december 8 , 2004 .

an fy2005 continuing resolution was necessary because the regular l - hhs - ed appropriations were not enacted by the start of fy2005 .

funding under the fy2005 continuing resolutions was provided at a rate of operations not to exceed the "current rate," under fy2004 conditions and program authority .

new initiatives were prohibited unless otherwise specifically authorized .

for programs with high spend - out rates that normally would occur early in the fiscal year , special restrictions prohibited spending levels that would impinge on final funding decisions .

3 rd continuing resolution , p.l .

108-434 ( h.j.res .

115 ) , extended the provisions of p.l .

108-309 through december 8 , 2004 .

p.l .

108-309 included two special provisions related directly to l - hhs - ed activities .

the hhs strategic national stockpile ( sns ) was funded for the duration of the resolution at a rate not to exceed the lower of the house - passed ( $450 million ) or senate - reported ( $400 million ) bills ( §114 ) .

the sns was funded at $398 million during fy2004 through the homeland security appropriations act , but administered by the cdc .

programs , activities , and functions authorized under the higher education act of 1965 ( hea ) through fy2004 were continued for the duration of the resolution ( §118 of p.l .

108-309 ) .

however , on october 25 , 2004 , p.l .

108-366 ( h.r .

5185 ) was signed into law , extending all the hea programs , activities , and functions through the end of fy2005 ; for additional information , please see crs issue brief ib10097 , the higher education act: reauthorization status and issues .

two supplemental appropriations were enacted in response to a series of hurricanes in the fall of 2004 .

the first statute , p.l .

108-303 ( h.r .

5005 ) , provided $2.0 billion for fy2004 , primarily for hurricanes charley and frances .

the second statute , p.l .

108-324 ( h.r .

4837 ) provides $14.5 billion for fy2005 , primarily for hurricanes ivan and jeanne .

for l - hhs - ed activities , p.l .

108-324 includes funds of $50 million for "aging services , social services and health services associated with natural disaster recovery and response efforts" under the public health and social service fund ( phssf ) of hhs .

disaster relief for hurricanes ivan and jeanne was initially considered in a separate bill , h.r .

5212 , which passed the house without dissent on october 6 , 2004 .

subsequently , these provisions were added as division b of h.r .

4837 ( conference report h.rept .

108-773 ) , the military construction appropriations act , 2005 , which was signed into law by the president on october 13 , 2004 , as p.l .

108-324 .

for additional details on disaster relief , please see crs report rl32581 , supplemental appropriations for the 2004 hurricanes and other disasters .

the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget .

among other provisions , the conference agreement on the fy2005 resolution , h.rept .

108-498 , proposes total discretionary budget authority of $821 billion .

this total represents an increase of 4.2% from the estimated fy2004 total of $788 billion , according to the summary published by the senate committee on the budget .

report language outlines the funding assumptions made for selected programs that might be used to reach the spending targets .

fy2005 discretionary appropriations for specific departments , agencies , and programs , however , are determined only through the enactment of appropriations .

table 14 shows the assumed levels of discretionary budget authority for budget functions most relevant to l - hhs - ed programs from the fy2005 conference agreement .

the senate version of the fy2005 budget resolution would include a reserve fund for higher education ( §302 ) .

under that provision , if the senate committee on health , education , labor , and pensions ( help ) were to report a measure to reauthorize the higher education act of 1965 ( hea ) , the chairman of the senate committee on the budget would be authorized to add up to $1.0 billion in new fy2005 budget authority , and $5.0 billion for the period fy2005-fy2009 .

if help were to report a measure to eliminate the accumulated shortfall in pell grants , the chairman would be authorized to add up to $3.7 billion to the total budget authority in the resolution .

under the conference agreement , h.rept .

108-498 , does not include any special provision for the elimination of the pell grants shortfall .

the agreement would allow an increase of $5.0 billion for hea reauthorization for the period fy2005 through fy2009 , but only if matching offsets are found elsewhere .

on june 1 , 2004 , representative david obey , ranking member of the house committee on appropriations , introduced a bill to provide ed appropriations for fy2005 .

the bill would increase funding compared to the fy2004 levels for selected ed accounts , including increases of $8.3 billion for education for the disadvantaged ( primarily for title i , part a ) ; $1.4 billion for school improvement ; $2.2 billion for special education ; and $3.3 billion for student financial assistance ( primarily for pell grants ) , with the maximum pell grant to be increased to $4,500 ( from $4,050 ) .

the bill would offset these increases by decreasing certain reductions in taxes resulting from the 2001 and 2003 reconciliation acts , p.l .

107-16 and p.l .

108-27 , respectively .

specifically , any taxpayer with an adjusted gross income in excess of $1,000,000 would have the reduction decreased by 55.7% in 2004 .

h.r .

4473 , the educational opportunity for the 21 st century department of education appropriations act , 2005 , was jointly referred to the house committee on appropriations and the house committee on ways and means .

regular fy2004 funding for l - hhs - ed activities was enacted early in the second session of the 108 th congress , more than four months after the start of the fiscal year on october 1 , 2003 .

seven of the 13 regular fy2004 appropriations bills were combined into a single omnibus bill , h.r .

2673 ; division e of the omnibus provided funds for l - hhs - ed programs .

a series of five continuing resolutions , p.l .

108-199 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2004 .

for a guide to the fy2004 omnibus bill , please see crs report rs21684 , fy2004 consolidated appropriations act: reference guide .

for information on the fy2004 l - hhs - ed appropriations , please see crs report rl31803 , appropriations for fy2004: labor , health and human services , and education .

in a effort to meet the overall spending limitations requested by the president , the h.r .

2674 conferees included two reductions in discretionary appropriations — one for defense , the other for non - defense .

these provisions were specified in p.l .

108-199 , division h , "miscellaneous appropriations and offsets," section 168 .

the defense reduction required a rescission of $1.8 billion from unobligated balances that remain available from the fy2001 anti - terrorism supplemental , p.l .

107-38 ; the fy2002 anti - terrorism supplemental , p.l .

107-117 ; and unobligated balances from any appropriations for the department of defense .

the non - defense reduction required a decrease of 0.59% from most domestic discretionary appropriations found in p.l .

108-199 , as well as from certain fy2004 appropriations enacted separately and advance appropriations for fy2004 enacted in previous years .

this reduction yielded an estimated $2.8 billion ( please see congressional record , daily edition , december 12 , 2003 , p. h12812 ; also see crs report rs21684 , fy2004 consolidated appropriations act: reference guide ) .

for the specified appropriations , the 0.59% reduction must be applied to "each discretionary account and each item of budget authority" and to each program , project , and activity within each such account or item .

fy2004 supplemental appropriation acts and discretionary amounts from fy2004 defense and military construction appropriations acts were excluded , as were advance appropriations for fy2005 or later that were enacted through p.l .

108-199 .

although the exact percentage of the non - defense reduction procedures was specified , the actual reductions for each account or line item were left for the determination of the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the individual agencies .

within 30 days of enactment of the bill , omb was required to report the amount of each rescission .

in addition , section 515 of the fy2004 l - hhs - ed bill required a $50 million reduction of funds otherwise provided for l - hhs - ed administrative and related expenses on a pro rata basis ; these reductions were required to be reported by omb within 15 days of enactment .

as a result , the tables in the h.r .

2673 conference report , h.rept .

108-401 , show pre - reduction levels , whereas the final post - reduction amounts , as approved by omb , are incorporated into the tables shown in this report .

appendix a. terminology and web resources the following items include some of the key budget terms used in this report ; they are based on crs report 98-720 , manual on the federal budget process ( pdf ) .

context of l - hhs - ed appropriations budget authority for all federal programs has been estimated to be $2,345.3 billion for fy2004 .

budget authority for all l - hhs - ed departments and related agencies has been estimated at $1,213.4 billion , or slightly more than half — 51.7% — of the federal total .

table b - 1 shows funding for the major l - hhs - ed agencies and provides context for the discretionary funding provided by the l - hhs - ed bill — $139.2 billion , or 5.9% of the federal total in fy2004 .

of the $1,213.4 billion for l - hhs - ed agencies , as shown in table b - 1 , the l - hhs - ed appropriations subcommittees generally have effective control only over the $139.2 billion in discretionary funds .

what accounts for the remaining $1,074.2 billion of l - hhs - ed funds ? .

first , funding for mandatory programs accounts for more than two - thirds of the l - hhs - ed bill — $331.9 billion , or 14.2% of the fy2004 federal total .

although appropriations are enacted for these mandatory activities annually — these are sometimes called "appropriated entitlements" — in general the amounts provided must be sufficient to cover program obligations and entitlements to beneficiaries .

for these programs , as well as the programs funded through trust funds and permanent authorities , most changes in funding levels are made through amendments to authorizing legislation rather than through annual appropriations bills .

federal administrative costs for these programs typically are subject to annual discretionary appropriations , however .

for l - hhs - ed agencies , these mandatory programs include supplemental security income , black lung disability payments , foster care and adoption , the social services block grant , and vocational rehabilitation , as well as general ( non - earmarked ) fund support for medicare and medicaid .

second , other appropriations bills account for a small portion of l - hhs - ed agency funding — $5.1 billion , or 0.2% of the fy2004 federal total .

two hhs agencies are fully funded by other appropriations bills , and three l - hhs - ed programs are partially funded by bills other than l - hhs - ed .

the non - l - hhs - ed sources are shown for each of these agencies below .

the hhs food and drug administration is funded by the agriculture appropriations ( $1.4 billion in fy2004 ) .

the hhs indian health service is funded by the interior appropriations ( $2.9 billion in fy2004 ) .

the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) — which is funded under related l - hhs - ed agencies — receives funds from the l - hhs - ed bill for programs authorized under the domestic volunteer service act of 1973 ( $354 million ) ; it also receives funds from the fy2004 veterans affairs and housing and urban development ( va - hud ) appropriations for americorps and other programs authorized by the national community service act ( $581 million ) .

the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) is primarily funded under l - hhs - ed ( $4.4 billion in fy2004 ) ; it also receives funds under the fy2004 va - hud appropriations for the agency for toxic substances and disease registry ( atsdr ) ( $73 million ) .

the national institutes of health ( nih ) is primarily funded under l - hhs - ed ( $27.8 billion in fy2004 ) ; it receives additional funds under fy2004 va - hud appropriations for certain environmental health sciences activities ( $78 million ) .

third , the remaining l - hhs - ed agency funds — an estimated $737.2 billion , or 31.4% of the total fy2004 federal budget — are received automatically without congressional intervention and outside the annual appropriations process .

these funds are provided from permanent appropriations and trust funds .

the major l - hhs - ed programs in this category include unemployment compensation , medicare , railroad retirement , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf , the welfare assistance program ) , student loans , state children's health insurance , and social security benefits .

jurisdictional changes related to l - hhs - ed appropriations on june 9 , 2004 , the house committee on appropriations modified the subcommittee jurisdiction of several programs relevant to the l - hhs - ed bill .

it moved the u.s. institute of peace ( $27 million in fy2004 ) from l - hhs - ed to commerce - justice - state appropriations .

it transferred two programs to l - hhs - ed: the weatherization grants program of the department of energy ( $227 million in fy2004 ) from interior appropriations , and the committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled ( $5 million in fy2004 ) , an independent federal agency , from transportation - treasury appropriations .

the senate committee on appropriations did not accept any of these changes when it reported the fy2005 l - hhs - ed bill , s. 2810 ( s.rept .

108-345 ) .

subsequently , the conference agreement on h.r .

4818 , h.rept .

108-792 , modified the initial house proposal for jurisdictional changes for fy2005 , as follows: the committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled is transferred from transportation - treasury to l - hhs - ed appropriations .

the u.s. institute of peace is transferred from l - hhs - ed to commerce - justice - state appropriations .

the weatherization assistance program of the department of energy is transferred from interior appropriations to division j , other matters , of p.l .

108-447 .
