december 16 , 2014 .

the president signed into law the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( h.r .

83 / p.l .

113-235 ) .

the house had passed the legislation on december 11 , 2014 ; the senate passed it december 13 , 2014 .

november amendments to the request .

on november 5 and 10 , 2014 , the administration submitted amendments to its fy2015 budget request to address the ebola crisis and the threat posed by the islamic state ( is ) , respectively .

the administration requested an additional $2.89 billion in emergency funding through international affairs accounts for activities related to ebola , including a $792 million contingency fund .

an additional $520 million was requested for the international affairs oco budget to support efforts to defeat is and address humanitarian needs related to is attacks .

together with the june 2014 oco amendment , these amendments increased the total fy2015 state , foreign operations and related programs request to $53.50 billion .

continuing resolution s ( cr ) .

the house and senate were unable to pass regular appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year and , therefore , passed h.j.res .

124 , continuing appropriations resolution , 2015 , on september 17 and 18 , respectively .

the president signed the cr into law ( p.l .

113-164 ) on september 19 , 2014 .

the cr funded government agencies and programs at an across - the - board reduction of .0554% below the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-76 ) , funding rate through december 11 , 2014 .

oco funds were not subject to the reduction .

the cr included some anomalies , with one for foreign affairs: section 145 provided the department of state with the ability to exceed the rate for operations that would otherwise apply to funds in a number of accounts — international broadcasting operations , economic support fund ( esf ) , nonproliferation , anti - terrorism , demining , and related programs ( nadr ) , international narcotics control and law enforcement ( incle ) , and foreign military financing ( fmf ) — to sustain assistance for ukraine and other independent states in that region .

two additional crs — p.l .

113-202 and h.j.res .

131 — kept the government funded until the full - year appropriations bill was signed into law .

june oco amendment .

on june 27 , the administration amended its oco request , asking for an additional $1.35 billion in state - foreign operations oco funds ( out of a total $65.8 billion oco request , mostly for department of defense programs ) for peacekeeping and counterterrorism activities .

committee action .

on june 19 , 2014 , the senate appropriations committee introduced and passed s. 2499 , an sfops appropriation for fy2015 that totaled $47.18 billion .

the house appropriations committee introduced and passed an fy2015 sfops appropriation , h.r .

5013 , on june 27 , which recommended total funding of $48.45 billion .

 ( see appendix a for account - by - account request , house and senate comparisons. ) .

302 ( b ) allocations .

on april 8 , 2014 , the house agreed to a $48.45 billion allocation for state - foreign operations accounts for fy2015 ; the senate approved an sfops allocation of $48.48 billion ( see table 1 ) on may 22 .

hearings .

in march and april 2014 , secretary of state john kerry and u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) administrator rajiv shah testified on the request before the house and senate appropriations committees , as well as the house foreign affairs and the senate foreign relations committees .

on july 17 , 2014 , deputy secretary of state for management and resources heather higginbottom testified before the house budget committee regarding the amended oco request .

on november 11 , 2014 , deputy secretary higginbottom testified before the senate appropriations committee on the state department response to the ebola crisis .

budget submission .

the obama administration submitted its original fy2015 budget request , including for international affairs ( function 150 ) , to congress on march 4 , 2014 .

of the total fy2015 foreign a ffairs request , $17.09 billion wa s for state department operations and related agencies , a 7.8% increase from the fy2014 funding estimate of $15.86 billion .

for foreign op erations , the administration requested $32.99 billion , a 2.2% decrease from the fy2014 estimate of $33.72 billion .

the state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations fund a variety of u.s. foreign affairs programs and activities .

these include state department and u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) operations , bilateral economic and security assistance , contributions to international organizations and multilateral financial institutions , public diplomacy , such as educational and cultural exchanges and international broadcasting , and certain international commissions .

the administration's fy2015 request , as amended , sought to increase funding for the state department and related accounts category by 8.3% over fy2014 estimated levels , to $17.18 billion .

both "base" ( or "enduring" ) funding and overseas contingency operations ( oco ) funding would have grown under the proposal , by 5.3% and 27.3% , respectively .

in addition , the fy2015 request , as amended , included $41 million in emergency funding .

the overall composition of this portion of the request is shown in figure 3 .

figure 3 shows funding levels for selected state operations accounts for fy2013 , fy2014 , the fy2015 amended request , house and senate proposals , and the adopted consolidated appropriations act for 2015 , h.r .

83 .

under the administration's request , diplomatic and consular programs ( d&cp ) , the department's main operating account , would have grown by 4.5% , to $8.34 billion .

the state department's second - largest administrative account is embassy security , construction and maintenance ( escm ) ; the fy2015 proposal called for $2.28 billion , a 14.8% decrease from the fy2014 estimated level of $2.67 billion .

in addition , the "related programs" category would have been cut by 21% under the fy2015 request , which included significant proposed cuts to funding appropriated for the east - west center , the asia foundation , and national endowment for democracy ( cuts of 35% , 29% , and 23% respectively ) .

the pending house and senate bills would have fully funded the administration's escm request .

the house's measure would have provided a 3% increase in d&cp funds from fy2014 levels ( rather than the 4.5% growth requested by the administration ) , while the senate measure would have reduced d&cp by 2% .

both h.r .

5013 and s. 2499 would have funded the "related programs" category at a higher level than the administration's request , rejecting proposed reductions of funding to the national endowment for democracy and the asia foundation .

while senate appropriators would have increased funding for the east - west center , as was enacted , the house measure had proposed to zero out the center's funding altogether .

the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( p.l .

113-235 / h.r .

83 ) , reduced funding for d&cp by slightly less than 2% .

the escm account was reduced by more than 13% from 2014 levels , although more funding was provided than was requested by the administration .

while accounts covering international peacekeeping operations and contributions to international organizations grew by 15.7% over 2014 levels under the act , the funding enacted for this category was $906 million less than the administration requested .

with the exception of food aid , the foreign operations budget funds most traditional foreign aid programs , including bilateral economic aid , multilateral aid , security assistance , and export promotion programs .

funding for u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) administration is also part of the foreign operations budget .

the fy2015-enacted appropriation for foreign operations accounts was $36.10 billion , or 0.6% less than the amended request of $36.32 billion and a 7.1% increase from the fy2014 estimated appropriation .

table 5 shows foreign operations and total foreign aid funding by type for fy2013 , fy2014 , and the fy2015 amended request and pending house and senate bills: aid by type .

although the request appeared to include a significant boost over current year funding for usaid operating expenses , the administration explained that the increase was intended to offset anticipated decreases in other funding sources , including recoveries , reimbursement , and trust funds , and would have allowed for continued operations at the current level rather than growth .

while the administration originally proposed reductions in bilateral economic aid , largely driven by a 27.8% cut in international disaster assistance ( ida ) and a 33.1% cut in migration and refugee assistance ( for which the administration explained that actual available resources would not be reduced because of anticipated carry - over funding from previous years ) , supplemental requests have since brought the fy2015 bilateral economic aid request to 7% above fy2014 .

much of the increase was in the ida and usaid global health accounts for funds to address the ebola crisis .

security assistance also would have been reduced under the original request , but would have increased 8% with the additional fmf and counterterrorism partnership fund spending proposed in the july 2014 amended oco request and the november 2014 oco amendment requesting additional fmf to counter is .

multilateral aid would have increased as a result of an international monetary fund quota increase ( +$315 million ) , partly offset by a proposed cut to the international development association ( - 4.8% ) and no request for the global agriculture and food security program ( $133 million in fy2014 ) .

house appropriators stayed close to current year spending levels for most types of aid , with the exception of multilateral assistance , which they would have cut significantly ( - 17.6% ) .

senate appropriators would have increased usaid administrative funding ( +16.8% ) , similar to the administration's proposal , provided slightly less than current year funding for bilateral economic aid ( - 2.8% ) , and more than the current funding levels for multilateral aid ( +8.1% ) .

the senate committee - approved bill also included significantly more security assistance ( +17.0% ) under foreign operations than the current budget , but this in large part reflected the bill's shift of assessed contributions to peacekeeping activities from the state operations to foreign operations section of the bill .

peacekeeping funds ( including both assessed and voluntary contributions ) recommended by senate appropriators totaled $2.86 billion , compared to $2.25 billion proposed by house appropriators , the administration's amended request of $3.35 billion , and fy2014 funding of $2.20 billion .

both the house and senate legislation were approved by committee before the administration made multiple amendments to its request in response to world events , so comparisons between the congressional proposals and the administration's request are of questionable value .

the enacted appropriation , p.l .

113-235 , included an 8.6% increase from fy2014 levels for administration of foreign assistance , but 10.5% less than requested .

bilateral economic programs increased 12.2% from fy2014 , driven largely by emergency funding to address the ebola crisis .

security assistance declined by 0.7% , and multilateral assistance declined by 7.3% from fy2014 funding .

aid by country and region .

under the original fy2015 request , bilateral aid allocated by region ( excluding humanitarian aid and the millennium challenge corporation ) would have varied in some instances from current year funding .

aid to south and central asia would have increased by 13.2% compared to fy2014 , while east asia pacific and the near east would have seen modest increases of about 1.9% and 1.6% , respectively .

funding for africa would have been reduced by about 1.6% .

europe and eurasia would have seen a decrease of 6.3% under the original request , but the amended request for european security assistance would have provided an increase of 7.6% .

only the western hemisphere would have seen significant reductions ( - 10.1% ) from current year regional spending under the request .

the proportional allocation of aid among regions would not have changed significantly ( figure 6 ) .

nevertheless , these portions would change with the inclusion in the amended request of a $1 billion counterterrorism partnership fund , nearly $3 billion to fight the ebola virus , and additional funds to fight is .

regional and country allocations for these proposed funds have not been specified .

the house and senate appropriators did not provide comprehensive information on country and regional allocation in their pending bills .

however , the house committee report notably rejected the administration's proposed cuts to western hemisphere countries and increased aid to the region by no less than $120 million above the administration request to address needs related to the surge of undocumented migrants at the u.s. - mexico border .

house appropriators also included funding above the original request to support democracy in the ukraine and former countries of the soviet union .

senate appropriators included an additional $100 million to address the migrant surge .

p.l .

113-235 and the accompanying report did not provide comprehensive data on regional or country allocations , but did provide some details .

notably , israel was allocated $3.1 billion in foreign military financing ( fmf ) ; egypt was allocated $1.3 million from fmf ; the report noted that $120 million above the request was provided to implement a migration prevention and response strategy for central america ; and $139.28 million was provided for bilateral assistance to ukraine .

the top aid recipient countries under the original fy2015 request ( table 6 ) were fairly consistent with fy2014 allocation estimates .

as in fy2014 and recent years , the top recipient list for fy2015 includes long - standing strategic partners such as israel , egypt , and jordan ; frontline states in the war against terrorism , such as pakistan ; and global health focus countries .

one notable change under the original request was the ranking of iraq , which had been a top recipient since the 2003 u.s. invasion , but fell just under the top 15 in fy2015 with the requested allocation of $309 million .

however , the request was made before the security situation in iraq deteriorated in the midst of an is insurgency , and a large portion of the additional funds requested and enacted for activities to fight is would likely support activities in iraq .

similarly , the increased funds requested and ( at a lower level ) enacted to fight ebola may move some of the countries hardest hit by the virus to the top recipients list .

ongoing political unrest in the middle east and north africa has significant implications for u.s. national security goals , challenging the administration and lawmakers to respond in a manner that best promotes u.s. strategic interests and democratic values .

for the last two budget cycles , the administration had requested funding ( $770 million for fy2013 and $580 million for fy2014 ) and authorities to create a middle east north africa incentive fund ( mena - if ) that would provide flexible resources to meet diverse and rapidly evolving needs .

congress neither authorized nor appropriated funds for a mena - if account in fy2013 , and needs in the region have been addressed through existing accounts .

the fy2014 appropriations bill also did not include funding for a mena - if account , but the explanatory statement accompanying the bill noted that oco funds may be used for stabilization and response efforts in the middle east and north africa .

in the absence of a designated account , the administration estimated that it had spent $3.62 billion on mena response between january 2011 and february 2014 using funds in existing accounts .

for fy2015 , the administration did not request a separate mena if account , but instead requested funds for mena response through a variety of established accounts .

the request included a total of $1.53 billion for mena through the migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) , international disaster assistance ( ida ) , economic support fund ( esf ) , international narcotics control and law enforcement ( incle ) , nonproliferation , antiterrorism , demining and related programs ( nadr ) , transition initiatives ( ti ) , and complex crises fund ( ccf ) accounts .

of this amount , $1.255 billion ( almost all designated as oco ) was expected to be used for syria regional response , $225 million for reform activities , and $50 million for contingencies .

the administration's june 2014 amendment to the oco request included the addition of $1 billion in foreign operations funds for a counterterrorism partnership fund , which was largely intended to address instability in the mena region related to the crisis in syria , but may be used to support counterterrorism capacity building in other regions .

the november 2014 request for an additional $520 million to counter is focused on the mena region as well .

while not recommending a total funding level for the region , the fy2015 house and senate committee reports noted that their funding recommendations for several foreign operations accounts reflected evolving needs in the middle east and north africa , including the crisis in syria , refugee assistance to jordan and other neighboring countries , and the deteriorating security situations in iraq and libya .

senate appropriators also recommended $5 million for a multi - donor mena transition fund .

the explanatory report accompanying p.l .

113-235 noted that the legislation did not create a new account for middle east activities , but that funding for "middle east response" was provided through several existing accounts , including $400 million in esf , $15 million under nadr , $5 million under incle , and $110 million under fmf .

in addition , the report noted that the legislation provided significantly more funding than requested for ida and mra , and that a significant portion of these funds ( both base and oco ) are to be used to address humanitarian needs in the middle east .

the report also noted that the act provided flexibility within oco accounts to transfer funds between accounts if necessary to address unanticipated contingencies .

as discussed earlier in this report , the administration appears to have embraced the congressional approach to oco in the fy2015 request , asking for the oco designation for funding beyond the frontline states of iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan .

the foreign operations oco funding request for fy2015 , as amended , totaled $5.47 billion and included funds for syria / mena response , peacekeeping in somalia and central african republic , and security assistance to bolster european self - defense capabilities , among other things .

this would have been a 6.6% increase from fy2014 foreign operations oco funding estimates , with the increase largely attributed to ramped - up activities to counter is in iraq and syria .

in their pending fy2015 proposals , house and senate appropriators took notably different approaches to oco designation , with the house committee coming in only slightly above the administration's original request of $3.89 billion and the senate committee designating a much larger portion of foreign operations funds , $6.87 billion , as oco .

 ( both bills were reported before the administration revised its foreign operations oco request upward to $5.47 billion ) .

much of the discrepancy reflected the senate committee's application of the oco designation to a much larger portion of humanitarian assistance ( ida and mra ) than the house committee , as well as the senate committee moving assessed contribution to peacekeeping operations from the state operations to the foreign operations titles of the bill .

a significant portion of the administration's oco request was made by amendment after committee approval of the house and senate legislation , making it difficult to accurately compare the administration's request to congressional action .

the enacted fy2015 appropriation , p.l .

113-235 , included $7.49 billion in foreign operations funds designated as oco , a 46% increase over fy2014 and higher than the administration's request and both the house and senate bills .

the legislation took a broad approach to the oco designation , described as "the extraordinary costs of contingency operations in afghanistan , pakistan and iraq ; stabilization , security and response efforts , including in the middle east and north africa ; and other programs that address counterterrorism , counterinsurgency , and humanitarian crisis. .

oco funding for the mra account increased 66% from fy2014 , to address humanitarian needs in africa , the near east , and south asia .

significant increases , for unspecified purposes , were provided in the esf and ida oco accounts as well .

the legislation also provided authority for funds within other oco accounts to be transferred to the mra and ida oco accounts .

humanitarian assistance has increased as a portion of the foreign operations budget since fy2013 , driven largely by the crisis in syria , which has resulted in an estimated 2.4 million refugees and 9.3 million internally displaced persons .

as of march 2014 , the united states had provided over $1.70 billion in syria - related humanitarian assistance , including aid to neighboring countries that have taken in refugees , and the need is not expected to diminish in the near future .

in addition to syria , the administration anticipated at the time of the request an ongoing need for humanitarian assistance in south sudan , the central african republic , and for unforeseen conflicts and emergencies .

for fy2015 , the administration originally requested humanitarian assistance totaling $4.80 billion , including $2.05 billion for migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) , $50 million for emergency refugee and migration assistance ( erma ) , $1.30 billion for international disaster & famine assistance ( ida ) and $1.40 billion for food for peace ( food aid funded through the agriculture appropriation ) .

the original requested amount would have been a 24.8% decrease from the total fy2014 estimated appropriation for these accounts , but the administration asserted that anticipated carryover funds from fy2014 , the result of large mra and ida increases in fy2013 and fy2014 , would enable the united states to meet anticipated humanitarian needs .

however , with the growing humanitarian needs created by the ebola epidemic in africa and the deteriorating environment in iraq and syria , the administration requested an additional $1.49 billion in ida funds in november 2014 .

the amended humanitarian assistance request totaled $6.29 billion , or 23% more than the fy2014 funding estimate .

both the house and senate committees recommended significantly more than the administration's original request for humanitarian accounts in their fy2015 proposals , and slightly more than the amended request .

the house recommendation totaled $6.376 billion and the senate $6.362 billion , both consistent with fy2014 funding .

p.l .

113-235 provided $7.91 billion for humanitarian accounts , or about 24% above the enacted fy2014 level and the house and senate committee - approved legislation .

mra , erma , and food for peace were funded at approximately the fy2014 level , while total ida funding was increased by nearly 85% to $3.33 billion , bolstered by more than $1.44 billion in new emergency funding to address the ebola crisis and $1.34 billion designated as oco ( up from $924 million in fy2014 ) .

the international affairs budget has supported international food assistance for decades , primarily through the food for peace ( p.l .

480 , title ii ) program utilizing donated u.s. agricultural commodities .

unlike most foreign assistance , this program is authorized in farm bills and funded through the agriculture appropriations bill .

in the fy2014 budget proposal , the administration proposed several food aid reforms , including a requirement that only 55% of aid be used to procure and ship u.s. produced commodities , allowing more aid to be procured regionally or provided as cash .

the administration also proposed that food for peace be funded through foreign operations appropriations .

the fy2014 appropriation did not adopt these reforms , but new authorizing legislation in the 2014 farm bill ( agricultural act of 2014 , p.l .

113-79 ) did create more flexibility in the food for peace program and create a new local and regional purchase program authorized at $80 million annually for fy2014 through fy2018 .

for fy2015 , the administration requested $1.4 billion for food for peace , within the agriculture appropriation , of which $1.1 billion would be for emergency food needs and $270 million for development programs .

in total , this would have been a 4% reduction from the fy2014 food aid estimate , but the administration noted that it requested an additional $80 million in the development assistance account for development food aid .

in addition , the administration requested new authority to use up to 25% of the food for peace request ( $350 million ) for cash - based food assistance to address emergencies , asserting that this authority would allow food aid to reach 2 million more beneficiaries without increasing funding .

the fy2015 house and senate agriculture appropriations bills , as reported by committee , both included $1.466 billion for food for peace , matching the fy2014 enacted funding .

p.l .

113-235 , the enacted appropriation , matched that funding level .

for more information on food aid , see crs report r41072 , international food aid programs: background and issues , by [author name scrubbed] .

the obama administration introduced three new africa initiatives in 2013 , joining the three major ongoing foreign assistance initiatives introduced by the administration in 2009 and 2010 — the global health initiative , the food security initiative ( feed the future ) , and the global climate change initiative .

the initiatives were priorities in the fy2015 budget request .

africa initiatives .

the request included $114.3 million for africa initiatives , including $77 million for power africa , $27.3 million for trade africa , and $10 million for the young african leaders initiative ( yali ) .

power africa , led by usaid , aims to increase access to reliable , affordable , and sustainable power .

it is designed to leverage the resources of 12 u.s. trade and development agencies to facilitate project transactions and private sector investment in the power sector .

total u.s. government resources for power africa are expected to total up to $7.8 billion over five years .

trade africa focuses on improving trade and investment activities in east africa , while yali seeks to develop the professional and leadership skills of emergent young african leaders .

the house committee report did not mention any of these initiatives , while the senate committee report recommended $15 million for yali and included language supporting power africa and requiring the administration to report to congress on the initiative's objectives and the metrics used to measure progress .

p.l .

113-235 mentioned none of the initiatives , although the explanatory statement indicated $15 million was allocated for yali .

global health initiative .

the original request included $8.05 billion for global health programs , a 4.6% decrease from the estimated fy2014 funding and level with fy2013 funding .

of this , $1.35 billion was for the global fund , an 18.2% reduction from fy2014 funding .

the administration asserted that the requested funds were focused on creating an aids - free generation , ending preventable maternal and child death , and preventing the spread of infectious diseases .

compared to fy2014 allocations , family planning ( +2.7% ) and malaria ( +1.4% ) programs would have seen modest increases , while hiv / aids ( - 5.0% ) , nutrition ( - 12.2% ) , and neglected tropical diseases ( - 13.5% ) activities would have been reduced .

maternal and child health ( - 0.1% ) funding would have remained almost level , though a larger proportion would have gone toward a proposed 14.3% increase for the global alliance for vaccines and immunizations ( gavi ) .

the proposal included significant reductions for vulnerable children ( - 34.1% ) , tuberculosis ( - 19.1% ) , and pandemic influenza ( - 31.0% ) activities .

in november 2014 , the administration amended its global health programs request to add $340 million for ebola response , bringing the total ghp request to $8.39 billion .

it is not clear how the additional funding would have been allocated by sector .

both house and senate appropriators included more funding than was requested for global health in fy2015 , recommending $8.31 billion and $8.14 billion , respectively , but still less than fy2014 funding .

as in past years , the most notable divergence in sub - allocations between the proposals was for reproductive health and family planning funding , for which the senate committee recommended $539 million , consistent with the administration's request , while the house committee recommended $461 million , or 14% less .

in contrast , the house committee report recommended $300 million ( 5% ) more than the senate report for global hiv / aids programs .

p.l .

112-235 provided $8.77 billion for the global health programs account , including $312 million for emergency ebola response .

this was a 3.9% increase from the fy2014 estimate and 4.5% more than the amended request , though base funding of $845 billion ( excluding emergency funds ) was about level with the fy2014 estimate .

subsector allocations of non - emergency funds , as detailed in the explanatory statement , were very similar to the fy2014 estimates , with the exception of an 18% decrease in the contribution to the global fund , as requested .

food security initiative .

feed the future ( ftf ) is the administration's food security initiative , designed to support long - term country - led agricultural growth and nutrition plans .

for fy2015 , the administration requested $1.00 billion for feed the future , a 4.5% increase over the fy2013 funding ( fy2014 data are not yet available ) .

the administration's request was consistent with u.s. commitments made at g - 8 summits in 2012 and 2013 .

for fy2015 , requested funding would be used for programs in 19 focus countries and 9 aligned countries to reduce poverty and malnutrition .

the fy2015 house committee report did not specify a funding level for feed the future programs or for food security and agricultural development generally .

the senate committee report recommended $1 billion for this purpose .

p.l .

113-235 adopted the senate provision , calling for no less than $1.006 billion for food security and agricultural development programs .

global climate change initiative ( gcci ) .

the gcci is designed to promote environmentally sustainable , climate resilient development .

the initiative would have received nearly level funding in fy2015 under the administration proposal , with a requested $839 million , but the program allocations would have differed considerably from fy2013 ( the most recent data available ) .

bilateral clean energy funding would have increased by 34.7% and adaptation programs by 3.8% , while sustainable landscapes funding would have been reduced by 7.5% .

total u.s. contributions to world bank climate accounts would have decreased by 12.5% , counting $84 million in bilateral aid transferred for this purpose in fy2013 .

according to the administration , gcci funding in fy2015 would be essential for implementing the president's climate action plan and increasing u.s. leverage in negotiating an international climate agreement in 2015 .

the house committee report identified no specific allocations for bilateral climate change activities for fy2015 , and included no funding for multilateral climate change programs .

the senate committee report recommended $193.3 million for adaptation and mitigation , $123.5 million for sustainable landscapes , and $189.45 million for clean energy , in addition to funding multilateral climate change programs .

p.l .

113-235 did not specify a funding level for bilateral climate change activities , so the allocations in the senate report presumably apply .

the legislation included $184.6 million for the international clean technology fund and $49.9 million for the strategic climate fund — both less than the senate bill but more than the house bill , which provided no funding for either account .
