budget justifications are detailed written materials , data , and supporting documents provided by federal agencies that expand upon and support the president's yearly budget submission to congress .

in form and content , the justifications may vary by agency .

the office of management and budget ( omb ) provides yearly instructions to agencies for producing materials to be included in the president's budget submission and agency budget justifications .

each summer , omb issues these instructions as part of a document entitled , circular no .

a - 11: preparation , submission , and execution of the budget .

the release of budget justifications occurs soon after the release of the president's annual budget submission and in advance of congressional hearings on agency budget requests .

agencies submit budget justifications to the appropriations subcommittees to support agency testimony and inform congressional deliberations .

beginning with the fy2008 executive budget cycle , agencies have also been required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to congress .
