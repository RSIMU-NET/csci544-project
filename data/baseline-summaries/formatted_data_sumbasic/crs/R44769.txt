a t the beginning of each congress , the house of representatives must adopt rules to govern its proceedi ngs .

the house does this by readopting the rules of the previous congress along with any changes that will apply in the new congress .

on january 3 , 2017 , the house passed h.res .

5 , adopting the standing rules for the house of representatives for the 115 th congress .

in addition to the standing rules , h.res .

5 includes several additional provisions , called separate orders , that also govern proceedings in the house .

a number of the provisions adopted both as part of the standing rules of the house and as separate orders affect budgetary legislation .

in many cases , these provisions are similar to provisions adopted in previous congresses .

one standing order applies specifically to the budgetary treatment of any legislative provision requiring or authorizing a conveyance of federal land to a state , local government , or tribal entity .

the standing order states that in the house , such provisions shall not be considered as increasing spending or providing new spending , nor shall it be considered as decreasing revenues .

this standing order is not expected to change the way cbo estimates the budgetary impact of such provisions .

it will , however , likely affect house enforcement of budgetary points of order as well as the enforcement of house leadership protocols , meaning that such provisions will likely not be subject to budgetary points of order or leadership protocols related to budgetary legislation .
