the transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies ( thud ) appropriations subcommittees are charged with drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the department of transportation ( dot ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and six small related agencies .

title i of the annual thud appropriations bill funds dot .

the department is primarily a grant - making and regulatory organization .

its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation , providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways , transit , and intercity passenger rail infrastructure , while overseeing safety in the rail , public transportation , commercial trucking and intercity bus , and maritime industries .

the federal aviation administration ( faa ) is exceptional among dot's large sub - agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the u.s. air traffic control system .

in support of that task , it employs over 80% of dot's total workforce , roughly 46,000 of dot's approximately 56,000 employees .

title ii of the annual thud appropriations bill funds hud .

the department's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs .

these include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor , elderly , and / or have disabilities .

three rental assistance programs — public housing , section 8 housing choice vouchers , and section 8 project - based rental assistance — account for the majority of the department's funding .

two flexible block grant programs — the home investment partnership program and community development block grants ( cdbg ) — help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low - income families .

other , more specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons , including those with aids .

hud's federal housing administration ( fha ) insures mortgages made by lenders to home buyers with low down payments and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units .

title iii of the thud appropriations bill funds a collection of agencies involved in transportation or housing and community development .

they include the access board , the federal maritime commission , the national transportation safety board , the amtrak office of inspector general ( ig ) , the neighborhood reinvestment corporation ( often referred to as neighborworks ) , the u.s. interagency council on homelessness , and the costs associated with the government conservatorship and regulation of the housing - related government - sponsored enterprises , fannie mae and freddie mac .
