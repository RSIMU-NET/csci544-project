this report provides a brief history of the major legislative changes to the charitable deduction for individuals , from its enactment in 1917 through the recent changes enacted at the end of 2017 .

policymakers considering changes to this tax benefit may find it helpful to understand how this benefit has evolved over the past 100 years .

this report does not address all the legislative changes made to this tax benefit , nor does it provide a broad overview of charitable giving in general , charitable giving tax incentives , their economic effects , or policy options to modify them .

those issues are discussed in crs report r45922 , tax issues relating to charitable contributions and organizations , by jane g. gravelle , donald j. marples , and molly f. sherlock , and crs in focus if11022 , the charitable deduction for individuals , by margot l. crandall - hollick and molly f. sherlock .

this report begins with a brief overview of the current charitable deduction for individuals .

it then describes major legislative changes made to the deduction from 1917 through the present day , with the most recent changes being those made in 2017 .

for the purposes of this report , major legislative changes include those that changed the amount that taxpayers could deduct .

the bills summarized in this report do not include those that temporarily modified the charitable deduction in response to a disaster .

laws that modified definitions or changed substantiation requirements for taxpayers claiming the deduction are also generally excluded .

this report will be updated as necessary to reflect future legislative changes .

under current law , taxpayers who itemize their deductions canâsubject to certain limitationsâdeduct charitable donations to qualifying organizations .

 ( individuals who take the standard deduction may not deduct their charitable contributions. ) .

deductions that cannot be claimed in the current tax year can be carried forward for up to five years , subject to certain limitations .

enacted in 1917 , the deduction for charitable giving has changed over the years from "a short statutory provision into a complex set of rules. .

below is a brief legislative history of the major legislative changes to the charitable deduction that have occurred over the past 100 years , focusing on changes to the amount that taxpayers could deduct .

table 2 summarizes these changes .

over the past 100 years , congress has generally increased the amount that eligible taxpayers can deduct for their charitable donation .

the history of the charitable deduction illustrates two main policy objectives of this benefit .

in its early years , the charitable deduction served to ensure that resources given to charity would not be treated as income for the purposes of taxation .

when the charitable deduction was created , the income tax was in its early years , and applied only to the very top of the income distribution .

thus , when the deduction was created , it could be viewed as having been designed to "protect voluntary giving to public goods by rich industrialists who had made their fortunes in business. .

today , many policymakers are focused on the charitable deduction's impact on giving , and its efficacy at inducing additional giving .

as the deduction has changed over time , policymakers have continued to discuss its effectiveness at increasing charitable giving , the broader role of the government in the philanthropic sector , and reform proposalsâa discussion that continues to this day .

the charitable deduction was initially enacted to offset the potential negative effects of increased income taxes on charitable giving among the wealthy .

the federal income tax , enacted four years earlier as part of the tariff act of 1913 , generally applied a top rate of 7% to only the wealthiest americans .

the war income tax revenue act of 1917 ( p.l .

65-50 ) increased federal income tax ratesâthe top rate on individuals rose to 67% by 1917 âas a way to pay for the costs of the united states' involvement in world war i .

according to the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) , some [l]egislators feared that the [tax] increase would reduce individuals' income "surplus" from which they supported charity .

it was thought that a decrease in private support would create an increased need for public support and even higher rates , so the [charitable] deduction was offered as a compromise .

in short , some policymakers were concerned that without the charitable deduction , wealthy taxpayers subjected to these higher tax rates would no longer contribute to charities or institutions of higher education ( or would contribute less ) .

as senator hollis stated , usually people contribute to charities and educational objects out of their surplus .

after they have done everything else they want to do , after they have educated their children and traveled and spent their money on everything they really want or think they want , then , if they have something left over , they will contribute it to a college or to the red cross or for some scientific purposes .

now when war comes and we impose these very heavy taxes on income , that will be the first place where wealthy men will be tempted to economize , namely in donations to charity .

they will say , "charity begins at home. .

i should not favor allowing any man to deduct all of his contributions to these objects from his income - tax return , but if we limit it to 20 percent of his income we cannot be doing much harm to the public treasury .

look at it this way: for every dollar that a man contributes for these public charities , educational , scientific , or otherwise , the public gets 100 percent ; it is all devoted to that purpose .

and since "many believed charities could deliver social services better than the government," a drop in funding to charitable groups could have led to what many may have perceived as the inefficient provision of social services and public goods by the government .

the law allowed a deduction for cash or gifts made to organizations operated for religious , charitable , scientific , or education purposes , or for the prevention of cruelty to animals or children .

the overall amount that could be deducted was limited to 15% of net taxable income "to ensure that individual taxpayers could not eliminate their tax liability through the deduction. .

several years later , congress waived the 15% limitation for taxpayers who made consistently large charitable donations .

specifically , as a result of the revenue act of 1924 ( p.l .

68-176 ) , taxpayers who donated "more than 90% of their net taxable income in the current year and in each of the previous 10 years" were not subject to the 15% net taxable income limitation .

this provision was often referred to as the "philadelphia nun" provision , after mary katherine drexel , a wealthy philadelphia native who became a nun and underwrote her charitable activities from her sizable inheritance .

 ( in later years , it was also referred to as the "unlimited charitable deduction" ( ucd ) , or "unlimited charitable contribution deduction." ) .

in 1944 , congress changed the limitation of the charitable deduction , which effectively increased the maximum amount that taxpayers could deduct .

as previously discussed , for most taxpayers the charitable deduction was limited to 15% of net taxable income .

the individual income tax act of 1944 ( p.l .

78-315 ) changed the measurement of this limitation from net taxable income to adjusted gross income .

since agi was generally larger than net taxable income , the maximum amount that could be deducted in dollar terms was larger .

this law also created a standard deduction , which some charities worried would result in a reduction in charitable giving .

the federal income tax , which before the early 1940s had been levied only on high - income americans , was expanded to apply to most working - age americans by the end of world war ii .

according to the irs , in 1939 only about five percent of american workers paid income tax .

the united states' entrance into world war ii changed that figure .

the demands of war production put almost every american back to work , but the expense of the war still exceeded tax - generated revenue .

president roosevelt's proposed revenue act of 1942 introduced the broadest and most progressive tax in american history , the victory tax .

now , about 75 percent of american workers would pay income taxes .

this expansion was driven by increasing needs for revenue to finance world war ii expenses .

as more americans became subject to the federal income tax , congress became interested in simplifying tax preparation for these new taxpayers , which motivated the creation of a standard deduction .

however , some worried that among those who used the standard deduction , there would be a reduction in charitable giving since there would be no additional tax benefit for these donations .

others who advocated for the standard deduction contended that charitable contributions were made for more than just financial reasons , and that especially among lower - and middle - income taxpayers ( who were most likely to claim the standard deduction ) , the tax benefit for giving was not an important factor in their decisions to give .

according to senator walter george , chairman of the senate finance committee , the committee does not believe that it can be proved that a tax incentive has been an important factor in the making of such gifts by individuals having less than $5,000 of adjusted gross income , and certainly the $500 standard deduction will not remove the tax incentive for persons in the higher brackets , upon whom the charities depend for contributions in substantial amounts .

in 1952 , as part of p.l .

82-465 , congress further increased the maximum amount taxpayers could deduct , raising the limitation to 20% of agi .

in 1954 , congress further increased the maximum deduction limit to 30% of agi ( p.l .

83-591 ) for any contributions to certain charitable organizations ânamely churches , educational institutions , or hospitals .

the 10% of additional agi that taxpayers could deduct was allowable only for contributions made to one of these eligible organizations .

deductible donations to other eligible organizations were still limited to 20% of agi .

one commentator noted that this was "the first time that congress encouraged certain charitable giving by granting more generous deductions for donations to certain charitable organizations than to others â¦ [to] encourage additional contributions to these organizations to offset their rising costs and modest returns on endowment funds. .

congress expanded the list of organizations for which taxpayers could claim the 30% charitable deduction as part of the revenue act of 1964 ( p.l .

88-272 ) to include those that "receive a substantial part of [their] support from a governmental unit â¦ or from direct or indirect contributions from the general public. .

this effectively expanded the 30% agi limitation to most charitable organizations except private nonoperating foundations , which were still subject to the 20% limitation .

in addition , the law included a provision that allowed for charitable contributions in excess of the agi limits to be carried forward up to five years .

this five - year carryforward allows taxpayers who contributions exceed the agi limit in a given year to still potentially receive a tax benefit from that contribution in future years .

the tax reform of 1969 ( p.l .

91-172 ) made several modifications to the charitable deduction , including increasing the maximum agi limits , phasing out the "philadelphia nun" provision , and creating certain limitations on donations of appreciated property .

many of the current parameters of the charitable deduction for individuals were enacted as part of this law .

at the time that congress was debating this legislation , there was increased concern that taxpayers were using tax benefits like the charitable deduction to avoid paying income taxes .

in particular , â¦ the unlimited charitable contribution deduction ( ucd ) had become a sanctuary in which many of the very wealthy were sheltered from the income tax .

prior to its repeal , the ucd was being used by an estimated 100 taxpayers who generally had economic income in excess of one million dollars .

since the ucd had a particular appeal to taxpayers having large amounts of appreciated capital which could be donated to charitable institutions , with the deduction based on the full market value rather than acquisition value , it not surprisingly became a prime target for reformers .

the tax reform act of 1969 phased out the "philadelphia nun provision" over five years while also raising the maximum agi limitation to 50% of agi for donations of cash / short - term capital gain property to public charities .

the increase in the agi limit was intended to "offset any decreased incentive resulting from the repeal of the unlimited charitable contributions deduction. .

in addition , the increased agi limitation was intended to [s]trengthen the incentive effect of the charitable contributions deduction for taxpayers.â¦ it is believed that the increase in the limitation will benefit taxpayers who donate substantial portions of their income to charity and for whom the incentive effect of the deduction is strongâprimarily taxpayers in the middle - and upper - income ranges .

the new 50% limitation generally did not apply to gifts of property that had appreciated in value ( eg , capital gains ) , which were still generally subject to the 30% agi limitation .

in addition , the 20% agi limitation for donations to private nonoperating foundations ( irrespective of the form of the donation ) was unchanged by the law .

under the economic recovery act of 1981 ( p.l .

97-34 ) , taxpayers who did not itemize their deductionsâi.e. , those who took the standard deductionâcould claim a new deduction for charitable giving .

this was a temporary provision that went into effect in 1982 and was scheduled to expire at the end of 1986 .

 ( the law made no change to the itemized deduction for charitable giving. ) .

the amount that nonitemizers could deduct was limited to a percentage of the contributed amount , subject in some years to an additional fixed dollar cap .

in 1982 and 1983 , 25% of contributions could be deducted , subject to a $100 cap .

in 1984 , the contribution percentage remained unchanged ( 25% ) , but the dollar cap rose to $300 .

in 1985 , 50% of contributions could be deducted , and the contribution cap was eliminated , and in 1986 100% of contributions could be deducted with no contribution cap .

in addition to these caps , the amounts that could be deducted were also subject to the agi limits applicable to the itemized deduction for charitable giving .

this temporary provision was opposed by the treasury department and some economists at the time .

for example , donald lubick , assistant secretary for tax policy at the treasury department , argued that the main beneficiaries of the above - the - line deductionâlower - and moderate - income taxpayersâwould be less responsive than higher - income taxpayers in terms of additional giving .

lubick argued that the above - the - line deduction "would go , in very large measure , to those who are already giving with respect to their existing gifts," providing them with a windfall gain .

he testified that an above - the - line deduction "would result in a large revenue loss to the treasury and little increased giving for the charities. .

but according to jct , congress disagreed .

the congress believed that allowing a charitable deduction to nonitemizers stimulates charitable giving , thereby providing more funds for worthwhile nonprofit organizations , many of which provide services that otherwise might have to be provided by the federal government .

in addition , supporters of this provision believed that "[p]eople ought not be taxed on money they contribute to charitable causes .

this should be true whether or not their other economic actions make it advantageous for them to itemize their deductions. .

this tax benefit expired as scheduled at the end of 1986 , and was not extended as part of the tax reform act of 1986 .

according to one commentator , "the big idea of the '86 act was to pare away deductions and credits to broaden the base so you could bring the top rates down .

and that was a pretty powerful tide and the nonitemizer [deduction] just wasn't strong enough to swim against that current. .

as part of the deficit reduction act of 1984 ( p.l .

98-369 ) , congress increased the contribution limits on donations of cash or ordinary income property to private nonoperating foundations from 20% of agi to 30% of agi .

 ( donations of long - term capital gain property to private nonoperating foundations remained limited to 20% of agi. ) .

in explaining this increase , jct noted the following: because as a general rule public charities and operating foundations directly carry out charitable function and programs , expend charitable donations more promptly and have public involvement , support , and supervision , the congress concluded that a tax preference for contributions to public charities and operating foundations [50% agi limitation] continues to be appropriate .

however , acknowledging the substantial role of many grant making foundations in private philanthropy , the congress believed that the extent of this tax preference should be narrowed by increasing to 30 percent the deduction limitation for gifts by individuals of cash and ordinary - income property to nonoperating foundations .

at the end of 2017 , president trump signed into law p.l .

115-97 , often referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ( tcja ) , which made numerous changes to the federal income tax for individuals and businesses .

among the many changes , the law temporarily increased the agi limit for cash donations made to public charities from 50% to 60% .

this change went into effect in 2018 , and is scheduled to expire on december 31 , 2025 .

according to the house ways and means committee report that accompanied h.r .

1 ( the house - passed version of p.l .

115-9 ) : the committee believes that a robust charitable sector is vital to our economy , and that charitable giving is critical to ensuring that the sector thrives .

for this reason , the committee believes that it is desirable to provide additional incentives for taxpayers to provide monetary and volunteer support to charities .

increasing the charitable percentage limit for cash contributions to public charities will encourage taxpayers to provide essential monetary support to front - line charities .

while this change to the charitable deduction may increase the amount that some taxpayers can deduct and hence may encourage more charitable giving , other changes made by the law are expected to result in an overall reduction in charitable giving .

tpc estimates that even after including the increased 60% limitation , the changes tcja made to the tax code could result in charitable donations falling by 5% .

appendix a. definitions of commonly used terms appendix b. valuation of noncash donations for the charitable deduction for noncash donations , there are certain rules on how to value the property .

depending on the type of property and the recipient organizations , the property is generally valued either at its basis ( i.e. , what the taxpayer originally paid for the property ) or its fair market value ( how much the taxpayer would receive in an open market for the property at the time it is donated ) , as summarized in table b - 1 .

for an overview of these and other terms often used in the context of the charitable deduction , see appendix a .

if a property increases or appreciates in value , its fair market value when sold will be greater than its basis .

if property decreases or depreciates in value , its fair market value when sold will be less than its basis .

hence , deducting the fair market value of an appreciated ( depreciated ) property results in a larger ( smaller ) deduction for the taxpayer than the basis value of that same property .
