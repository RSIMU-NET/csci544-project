comprehensive immigration reform was the subject of much discussion at the start of the 110 th congress .

in the 109 th congress , both the house and the senate passed major immigration bills , but they were never reconciled .

during the first session of the 110 th congress , a bipartisan group of senators developed broad immigration reform legislation with the active involvement of the bush administration .

aimed at addressing a host of perceived problems with the u.s. immigration system , this legislation combined border security and interior enforcement provisions with provisions on temporary workers , permanent admissions , and unauthorized aliens .

the senate considered several immigration reform measures ( s. 1348 , s.amdt .

1150 to s.1348 , s. 1639 ) in may and june of 2007 .

on june 28 , 2007 , the senate voted on a motion to invoke cloture on s. 1639 , which , if approved , would have ultimately brought the bill to a vote .

the cloture motion failed , however , on a vote of 46 to 53 , and the senate majority leader pulled the bill from the senate floor .

the 110 th congress has not again taken up comprehensive immigration reform .

in october 2007 , however , the senate considered , as a stand - alone bill , a proposal on unauthorized alien students , which has been included in various comprehensive reform bills .

the proposal , known as the dream act , would enable certain unauthorized students to obtain legal status .

the senate failed to invoke cloture on this bill .

the 110 th congress has also considered various other immigration measures , and has enacted a number of immigration - related provisions .

among the enactments are provisions on the visa waiver program in a law implementing recommendations of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( p.l .

110-53 ) ; on border security in p.l .

110-53 and the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) ; and on military service - based immigration benefits in the kendell frederick citizenship assistance act ( p.l .

110-251 ) and the military personnel citizenship processing act ( p.l .

110-382 ) .

other enactments include provisions on alien inadmissibility in a bill concerning the african national congress ( p.l .

110-257 ) and the tom lantos and henry j. hyde united states global leadership against hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria reauthorization act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-293 ) ; on alien eligibility for benefits in the ssi extension for elderly and disabled refugees act ( p.l .

110-328 ) ; and on employment eligibility verification in p.l .

110-161 and the consolidated security , disaster assistance , and continuing appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l..110-329 ) .

refugee - related provisions are included in the fy2007 revised continuing appropriations resolution ( p.l .

110-5 ) ; the u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act ( p.l .

110-28 ) ; a measure to increase the number of iraqi and afghani translators and interpreters who may be admitted to the united states as special immigrants ( p.l .

110-36 ) ; and the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( p.l .

110-181 ) , as amended by p.l .

110-242 .

this report discusses these and other immigration - related issues that have seen legislative action or are of significant congressional interest .

department of homeland security ( dhs ) appropriations are addressed in a separate report and , for the most part , are not covered here .

the final section of this report lists enacted legislation and selected bills receiving action .

the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides for the temporary admission to the united states of various categories of foreign workers and business personnel .

it also provides for the temporary admission of foreign students .

temporary visitors , including workers , business personnel , and students , enter as nonimmigrants .

as such , they are admitted for a temporary period of time and a specific purpose .

the main nonimmigrant category for temporary workers is the h visa .

in addition , certain temporary workers and business personnel enter under other visa categories , as discussed below .

issuances of temporary employment - based visas have risen steadily over the past decade .

the nonimmigrant visa categories used by foreign students are the f visa for academic study , the m visa for vocational study , and the j visa for cultural exchange .

the number of nonimmigrants admitted under these three categories has more than doubled over the past two decades .

the ina also provides for the permanent admission , as legal permanent residents ( lprs ) , of certain categories of foreign workers and business personnel .

there are five employment - based preference categories .

most employment - based lprs enter under the first three categories , which , as detailed below , encompass aliens of extraordinary ability as well as unskilled workers .

these three categories have been the focus of recent efforts to reform the permanent employment - based immigration system .

the smaller fourth and fifth preference categories , which respectively cover special immigrants and immigrant investors , are discussed separately in other sections of this report ( iraqi special immigrants are discussed in the " iraqi refugees " section ; religious workers — the largest special immigrant subcategory — and immigrant investors are covered in the " other issues and legislation "section ) .

the current annual limitation on employment - based lpr admissions is 140,000 ( plus any unused family preference visas from the prior year ) .

unauthorized alien students comprise a subpopulation of the larger unauthorized alien population in the united states .

they are distinct from foreign students .

although they are foreign nationals , unauthorized alien students , unlike foreign students , are not in the united states legally on nonimmigrant visas to study at u.s. institutions .

instead , by definition , they are in the country illegally .

unauthorized alien students are eligible for free public elementary and secondary education , but many of them who want to attend college face various obstacles .

among these obstacles , a provision enacted in 1996 as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act ( iirira ; division c of p.l .

104-208 , §505 ) discourages states and localities from granting unauthorized aliens certain "postsecondary education benefits," widely interpreted to refer to "in - state" residency status for tuition purposes .

under the higher education act of 1965 ( hea ; p.l .

89-329 ) , as amended , unauthorized aliens are also ineligible for federal student financial aid .

more broadly , as unauthorized aliens , they are unable to work legally and are subject to removal from the united states .

bills have been introduced in recent congresses to provide relief to unauthorized alien students by repealing the 1996 provision and enabling certain unauthorized alien students to adjust to lpr status in the united states .

these bills are commonly referred to as the dream act ( whether or not they carry that name ) .

in the 110 th congress , dream act legislation has been introduced both in stand - alone bills and as part of larger comprehensive immigration reform measures .

s. 774 and h.r .

1275 are similar , but not identical , stand - alone dream act bills before the 110 th congress .

they would repeal the iirira provision and thereby eliminate the restriction on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens .

both bills also would enable eligible unauthorized students to adjust to lpr status in the united states through an immigration procedure known as cancellation of removal .

cancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief authorized by the ina that an alien can apply for while in removal proceedings before an immigration judge .

aliens granted cancellation of removal have their status adjusted to lpr status .

under s. 774 and h.r .

1275 , aliens could affirmatively apply for cancellation of removal without being placed in removal proceedings .

to be eligible for cancellation of removal / adjustment of status under these bills , the alien would have to demonstrate that he or she met various requirements , including that he or she had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than five years immediately preceding the date of enactment and had not yet reached age 16 at the time of initial entry .

both bills also would require the alien to demonstrate that he or she had been admitted to an institution of higher education in the united states , or had earned a high school diploma or the equivalent in the united states .

there would be no limit on the number of aliens who could be granted cancellation of removal / adjustment of status under s. 774 and h.r .

1275 .

an alien granted cancellation of removal under these bills would be adjusted initially to conditional permanent resident status .

such conditional status would be valid for six years and would be subject to termination .

to have the condition removed and become a full - fledged lpr , the alien would have to submit an application during a specified period and meet additional requirements , including acquisition of a college degree ( or completion at least two years in a bachelor's or higher degree program ) or service in the uniformed services for at least two years .

s. 2205 , another stand - alone dream act bill , was introduced in october 2007 .

on october 24 , 2007 , the senate voted on a motion to invoke cloture on s. 2205 .

the motion failed on a vote of 52 to 44 .

s. 2205 contains legalization provisions similar to those in s. 774 and h.r .

1275 .

under s. 2205 , eligible unauthorized students could adjust to lpr status through the cancellation of removal procedure .

to be eligible for cancellation of removal / adjustment of status under s. 2205 , as under s. 774 and h.r .

1275 , the alien would have to demonstrate , among other requirements , that he or she had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than five years immediately preceding the date of enactment , had not yet reached age 16 at the time of initial entry , and had been admitted to an institution of higher education in the united states or had earned a high school diploma or the equivalent in the united states .

in a requirement not included in s. 774 and h.r .

1275 , the alien would also have to show that he or she was under age 30 on the date of enactment .

as under s. 774 and h.r .

1275 , an alien granted cancellation of removal under s. 2205 would be adjusted initially to conditional permanent resident status .

to have the condition removed and become a full - fledged lpr , the alien would have to meet additional requirements , including acquisition of a college degree ( or completion of at least two years in a bachelor's or higher degree program ) or service in the uniformed services for at least two years .

there would be no limit on the number of aliens who could be granted cancellation of removal / adjustment of status .

unlike s. 774 , h.r .

1275 , and dream act bills introduced in past congresses , s. 2205 would not repeal the iirira provision and thereby eliminate the restriction on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens .

in addition to these free - standing bills , dream act provisions have been included in larger comprehensive immigration reform bills .

h.r .

1645 contains a dream act subtitle in title vi that is nearly identical to s. 774 , as discussed above .

a version of the dream act also was included in s. 1639 , the immigration bill that the senate considered but failed to invoke cloture on in june 2007 .

the s. 1639 version of the dream act , however , is substantially different than the other dream act bills in the 110 th congress .

s. 1639's dream act provisions are tied to other provisions in the bill to enable certain unauthorized aliens in the united states to obtain legal status under a new "z" nonimmigrant visa category .

s. 1639 , like most other dream act bills , would couple adjustment of status provisions for unauthorized students with language addressing the iirira provision that places restrictions on state provision of educational benefits to unauthorized aliens .

unlike most other dream act bills , however , s. 1639 would not completely repeal the iirira provision .

instead , §616 ( a ) of s. 1639 would make the provision inapplicable with respect to aliens with probationary z or z status .

two federal agencies issue most immigration - related identity documents .

the department of state ( dos ) is responsible for issuing visas to foreign nationals and passports to u.s. citizens .

among other uses , these documents are used by persons seeking admission to the united states , as all must demonstrate that they are either foreign nationals with valid documents or u.s. citizens .

dhs issues most other immigration documents , which foreign nationals need for various purposes within the united states .

for example , the ina requires employers — when hiring citizens and foreign nationals alike — to examine specified documents presented by the employee , which may include immigration documents , to verify employment eligibility and establish identity .

for well over a decade , the security of immigration documents has been an issue .

initially , the emphasis was on issuing documents that were tamper - resistant and difficult to counterfeit in order to impede document fraud and unauthorized employment .

since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the policy priorities have centered on preventing identity fraud , with a sharp focus on intercepting terrorist travel and other security threats .

there is a consensus that immigration documents should include biometric identifiers ( eg , digitized photos or finger scans ) , but determining what type of biometric identifier to use poses a variety of technical issues .

congress imposed a statutory requirement in 1996 for dos's bureau of consular affairs to issue a biometric border crossing card , known today as a laser visa .

in 2001 and 2002 , congress added requirements that all visas be biometric .

since october 2004 , the bureau of consular affairs has been issuing machine - readable visas that use biometric identifiers in addition to the photograph that has been collected for some time .

immigration documents issued by uscis in dhs likewise include biometric identifiers .

the permanent resident card , commonly called a "green card," is the document lprs use to establish their status .

according to uscis , approximately 14.6 million biometric "green cards" were issued between fy1998 and fy2006 .

aliens who are temporarily in the united states and eligible to work file a request for an employment authorization document ( ead ) .

over 8.3 million biometric eads were issued between fy1998 and fy2006 , according to uscis .

the united states does not require its citizens to have legal documents that verify their citizenship and identity ( i.e. , national identification cards ) .

the ina does require all u.s. citizens to present a valid passport when entering and departing the united states , but gives the president the authority to waive this requirement .

while not directly amending the president's passport waiver authority , p.l .

108-458 requires the secretary of homeland security , in consultation with the secretary of state , to develop and implement a plan that requires a document that denotes identity and citizenship for all entries into the united states .

this statutory directive , discussed in a separate section below , is known as the western hemisphere travel initiative ( whti ) .

striking a balance among the facilitation of legitimate travel and trade , the integrity of immigration documents , the security of personal identification documents , the protection of personal privacy and civil liberties , and the deterrence of foreign security threats remains a challenge for congress .

the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( p.l .

110-53 ) requires dhs , in conjunction with the director of national intelligence and the heads of other relevant federal agencies , to submit a report to congress outlining the actions the u.s. government has taken to collaborate with international partners to increase border security , enhance document security , and exchange information about terrorists .

a number of bills before the 110 th congress include provisions aimed at improving document security .

provisions that would require that immigration documents comply with specified authentication , documentation , and machine readable standards are included in h.r .

1645 , h.r .

2954 , s. 330 , and s. 1348 .

provisions to expand document fraud training for dhs officers are included in h.r .

2954 , s 1348 , and s. 1984 .

for its part , s. 276 would revise the criminal penalties for immigration and visa fraud , including trafficking in counterfeit immigration documents .

the visa waiver program ( vwp ) allows nationals from certain countries to enter the united states as temporary visitors ( nonimmigrants ) for business or pleasure without first obtaining a visa from a u.s. consulate abroad .

the vwp constitutes one of the few exceptions under the ina in which foreign nationals are admitted into the united states without a valid visa .

to qualify for the vwp , the ina specifies that a country must meet certain requirements .

for example , the country must offer reciprocal privileges to u.s. citizens ; the country must issue its nationals machine - readable passports that incorporate biometric identifiers ; and the country's inclusion in the vwp must not compromise the law enforcement or security interests of the united states .

among the other requirements for vwp participation , the country must have a low nonimmigrant refusal rate ( normally less than 3% ) .

p.l .

110-53 modifies the vwp by adding criteria to qualify as a vwp country .

among other new requirements , p.l .

110-53 mandates that the secretary of dhs , in consultation with the secretary of state , develop and implement an electronic travel authorization system , through which each alien would electronically provide , in advance of travel , the biographical information necessary to determine whether the alien is eligible to travel to the united states and enter under the vwp .

p.l .

110-53 also requires that the secretary of dhs establish an exit system that records the departure of every alien who enters under the vwp and leaves the united states by air .

finally , the act allows the secretary of dhs , in consultation with the secretary of state , to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement for admission to the vwp on the date on which the secretary of dhs certifies to congress that an air exit system is in place that can verify the departure of not less than 97% of all foreign nationals who exit through u.s. airports .

this waiver authority is also contingent on the secretary of dhs certifying to congress that the electronic travel authorization system discussed above is operational .

in addition , after june 30 , 2009 , the air exit system would have to incorporate biometric identifiers and be able to match an alien's biometric information with relevant watch lists and manifest information .

otherwise , the secretary of dhs's authority to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate would be suspended until the air exit system had the specified biometric capacity .

in order to participate in the vwp , a country receiving a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate waiver could not have a refusal rate above 10% and would have to meet other requirements .

dhs is charged with protecting u.s. borders from weapons of mass destruction , terrorists , smugglers , and unauthorized aliens .

border security involves securing the many means by which people and things can enter the country .

operationally , this means controlling the official ports of entry ( poe ) through which legitimate travelers and commerce enter the country , and patrolling the nation's land and maritime borders to safeguard against and interdict illegal entries .

border security has been a key immigration issue for the 110 th congress .

there has been much debate about whether dhs has sufficient resources to fulfill its border security mission , and a number of bills have been considered that would add resources to the border , including personnel , infrastructure , and technology .

other bills would institute new , or modify existing , programs within the department .

the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law has generally been construed to be limited to the criminal provisions of the ina ; the enforcement of the civil provisions , which includes apprehension and removal of deportable aliens , has been viewed as a federal responsibility , with states playing an incidental supporting role .

one of the broadest grants of authority for state and local immigration enforcement activity stems from §133 of iirira , which amended ina §287 by adding a new provision .

this provision , commonly referred to as the 287 ( g ) program , authorizes the attorney general ( now the secretary of homeland security ) to enter into written agreements with states and local governments to allow their law enforcement officers to perform certain immigration law enforcement functions .

some bills in the 110 th congress would modify or expand the 287 ( g ) program .

for example , s. 1639 would require dhs to reimburse states and local governments for training provided to their law enforcement officers under the 287 ( g ) program and for the cost of any equipment required by the agreement .

s. 1269 would create a web - based curriculum that could be used to train state and local law enforcement officers on immigration law enforcement .

other related bills , such as senate - passed h.r .

2638 and h.r .

4088 , would create grant programs to reimburse states and local communities for unauthorized immigration - related expenses that they may incur .

lastly , some bills ( including s. 1269 , s. 2717 , h.r .

842 , and h.r .

2954 ) would "reaffirm the existing inherent authority of states," as sovereign entities ( including their law enforcement personnel ) , to investigate , identify , apprehend , arrest , detain , or transfer into federal custody aliens in the united states in the course of carrying out routine duties .

s. 2717 and h.r .

842 would also require dhs to designate one detention facility within each state as a central facility for law enforcement entities within that state to place aliens .

under s. 1269 , s. 2717 , and h.r .

842 , dhs would be further required to take aliens into federal custody within a specified period of time after their apprehension by state and local law enforcement officers .

employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement have been key issues in the debate over comprehensive immigration reform .

they are widely viewed as essential components of a strategy to reduce unauthorized immigration .

there appears to be considerable congressional support to expand verification requirements and bolster worksite enforcement efforts .

in some cases , this support seems to be linked to support for other proposals to establish new temporary worker programs and to legalize the status of unauthorized aliens in the united states .

under ina §274a , it is unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire , recruit or refer for a fee , or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be so employed .

employers also are required to participate in a paper - based employment eligibility verification system , commonly referred to as the i - 9 system , in which they examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility , and complete and retain i - 9 verification forms .

employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil and / or criminal penalties .

enforcement of these provisions is termed worksite enforcement .

while all employers must meet the i - 9 requirements , they also may elect to participate in an electronic employment eligibility verification pilot program that was established under iirira .

participants in the program , now known as e - verify ( formerly , the basic pilot program and then the employment eligibility verification system ) , electronically verify new hires' employment authorization through social security administration ( ssa ) and , if necessary , dhs databases .

p.l .

110-329 , division a , §143 , extends e - verify , which had been scheduled to expire in november 2008 , until march 6 , 2009 .

the house had passed a bill in july 2008 ( h.r .

6633 ) to extend e - verify until november 2013 , but the senate never acted on this bill .

p.l .

110-161 includes provisions related to e - verify that build on current law regarding entities required to participate in an employment eligibility verification pilot program .

under iirira §402 ( e ) ( 1 ) , as amended , "each department of the federal government shall elect to participate in a [employment eligibility verification] pilot program," and the secretary of homeland security shall help ensure that "a significant portion of the total hiring within each department ... is covered under such a program. .

each member of congress , each officer of congress , and the head of each legislative branch agency likewise "shall elect to participate in a pilot program. .

employers found to have violated the prohibitions on unlawful employment or to have engaged in unfair immigration - related employment practices also may be required to participate in a pilot program .

a provision in division b of p.l .

100-161 on commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations ( §541 ) directs that none of the funds made available may be used in contravention of iirira §402 ( e ) ( 1 ) .

a provision in division e on dhs appropriations ( §557 ) states that none of the funds made available to the office of the secretary and executive management may be used for any new hires that are not verified through e - verify .

several fy2008 appropriations bills ( h.r .

3043 , h.r .

3074 , h.r .

3093 , and h.r .

3161 ) , as passed by the house , contained identical language to prohibit any funds made available in the acts to be used to enter into contracts with entities that do not participate in e - verify , but these provisions are not included in p.l .

110-161 .

a variety of other bills introduced in the 110 th congress would require all employers to conduct electronic employment eligibility verification and would make other changes to current law related to employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement .

title iii of s. 1639 would amend ina §274a to establish a new employment eligibility verification system ( eevs ; modeled on the current largely voluntary electronic system ) .

under s. 1639 , it would be unlawful for an employer or other entity to hire , or recruit or refer for a fee , an individual for employment in the united states without verifying identity and employment eligibility , as specified .

over time , participation in the new electronic eevs would become mandatory .

as of the date of enactment , the secretary of dhs would be authorized to require any employer or industry that is a federal contractor , part of the critical infrastructure , or directly related to u.s. national or homeland security to participate in the new eevs .

this requirement could be applied to both newly hired and current employees .

no later than 18 months after the date of enactment , all employers would be required to participate in the new eevs with respect to newly hired employees and certain current employees .

no later than three years after enactment , all employers would be required to participate with respect to new employees and all employees not previously verified through the eevs .

under s. 1639 , individuals who receive final notices that the system cannot confirm their employment eligibility ( known under the bill , as under e - verify , as final nonconfirmation notices ) could seek administrative and judicial review , as specified .

the current i - 9 system would remain in place with some modifications .

changes would also be made to existing monetary penalties for employer violations .

among its other employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement - related provisions , s. 1639 would provide for the disclosure of certain taxpayer identity information by ssa to dhs ( §304 ) ; require ssa to issue more secure social security cards ( §305 ) ; and establish a voluntary program through which participating employers could submit employees' fingerprints to verify identity and employment eligibility ( §307 ) .

title iii of h.r .

1645 would likewise amend ina §274a to establish a new electronic employment verification system .

under this bill , it would be unlawful for an employer or other entity to hire an individual for employment in the united states without verifying identity and employment eligibility , as specified .

unlike under s. 1639 , these verification requirements , for the most part , would not apply in cases of recruitment or referral for a fee .

requirements to participate in the new electronic system with respect to new hires would be phased - in .

"critical employers" would have to participate no later than one year after enactment .

large , mid - sized , and small employers , as defined in the bill , would be required to participate in the system no later than two , three , and four years after enactment , respectively .

this schedule for participation , however , would be contingent on the comptroller general of the united states submitting annual certifications that the system's databases are updated in a timely fashion ; there are low error rates in verification ; the system has not and will not result in increased discrimination ; workers' private information is protected ; and staffing and funding are adequate .

in the absence of such certifications , employer participation requirements would be waived or delayed .

in addition to the participation requirements with respect to new hires , h.r .

1645 includes a separate requirement that critical employers complete a one - time reverification of all individuals currently employed at these facilities .

under h.r .

1645 , individuals who are terminated from employment as a result of a final nonconfirmation could seek administrative and judicial review .

the current i - 9 system would remain in place with some modifications .

in addition , h.r .

1645 would increase monetary penalties for employer violations of ina prohibitions on unlawful employment .

like s. 1639 , h.r .

1645 contains provisions on the disclosure of taxpayer identity information by ssa to dhs ( §306 ( b ) ) , and on enhancing the security of social security cards .

the provisions in the two bills differ , however .

with respect to social security cards , h.r .

1645 includes language like that in h.r .

98 and h.r .

2954 ( discussed below ) to require the issuance of social security cards with a machine - readable electronic identification strip unique to the bearer and a digitized photograph .

furthermore , h.r .

1645 would amend ina §274b on unfair immigration - related employment practices to , among other changes , add new antidiscrimination requirements related to the electronic verification system ( §303 ) .

h.r .

4088 / s. 2366 / s. 2368 would make the existing e - verify system permanent and phase in a requirement that all employers conduct employment authorization verification through it .

initially this requirement would apply only to new hires .

not later than four years after enactment , however , employers would have to verify that all their employees are authorized to work .

these bills also would require ssa to share information with dhs in certain circumstances .

s. 3093 , like h.r .

4088 / s. 2366 / s. 2368 , would make e - verify permanent .

unlike these bills , however , it would not make participation mandatory for all employers .

instead , it would require federal contractors to participate .

in addition , under s. 3093 , employers participating in e - verify could elect to verify the employment eligibility of their existing employees .

the secretary of homeland security also could require any employer or class of employers to use e - verify to verify the employment eligibility of its current workforce if the secretary has reasonable cause to believe that the employer has committed material violations of the ina prohibitions on unlawful employment .

h.r .

98 and h.r .

2954 would require social security cards to include an encrypted machine - readable electronic identification strip unique to the bearer and a digitized photograph .

under the bills , a new hire would have to present a social security card of this type to his or her employers , who would use it to verify the worker's identity and work authorization .

employment eligibility verification would be conducted by accessing a database to be established by dhs that would contain dhs and ssa data .

these verification requirements would take effect two years after the date of enactment and would apply to any employment commencing on or after that effective date .

h.r .

98 and h.r .

2954 would increase penalties on employers who violate prohibitions on unlawful employment , but would do so differently .

h.r .

2954 also would require ssa to share data with dhs in certain circumstances .

sections 102 and 103 of h.r .

5515 would replace the dhs - administered e - verify system with two new verification systems to be established by ssa: the electronic employment verification system ( eevs ) and the secure employment eligibility verification system ( seevs ) .

under h.r .

5515 , employers and other entities would be required to verify identity and employment eligibility in cases of hiring and in certain cases of referral or recruitment for a fee .

not later than three years after enactment , employers would be required to participate in either the eevs or the seevs .

the eevs would be modeled broadly on e - verify , although it would differ from the current system in key ways .

for example , the eevs would use information from a government database , the national directory of new hires , that is not currently part of e - verify .

like h.r .

1645 , h.r .

5515 would enable individuals who are terminated from employment as a result of a disapproval notice ( akin to a final nonconfirmation under e - verify ) to seek administrative and judicial review .

the seevs , which h.r .

5515 would direct ssa to establish by regulation , would provide for identity authentication and employment eligibility verification .

it would use the services of private sector entities to enroll new employees by means of identity authentication , to protect authenticated information through biometric technology , and to verify employment eligibility .

employees would be afforded the same rights and protections in connection with responses to inquiries under the seevs as under the eevs .

h.r .

5515 also would increase monetary penalties for employer violations of ina §274a prohibitions on unlawful employment ( §104 ) and would amend ina §274b on unfair immigration - related employment practices to add new antidiscrimination requirements related to the eevs and the seevs ( §103 ) .

in addition , the bill would provide for the disclosure of certain information in the national directory of new hires by the department of health and human services to dhs ( §106 ) .

the admission of refugees to the united states and their resettlement here are authorized by the ina .

the u.s. worldwide refugee ceiling for fy2009 is 80,000 , with 75,000 of these numbers allocated among the regions of the world and the remaining 5,000 comprising an "unallocated reserve" to be used if , and where , additional refugee slots are needed .

fy2008 refugee admissions totaled 60,192 , below the fy2008 ceiling of 80,000 but above the fy2007 total of 48,282 .

as of november 30 , 2008 , fy2009 refugee admissions total 7,416 .

refugee numbers that are unused in a fiscal year are lost ; they do not carry over into the following year .

dos handles overseas processing of refugees , which is conducted through a system of three priorities for admission .

priority one ( p - 1 ) covers compelling protection cases and individuals for whom no durable solution exists , who are referred to the u.s. refugee program by unhcr , a u.s. embassy , or a designated nongovernmental organization ( ngo ) .

all nationalities are eligible for p - 1 processing .

priority two ( p - 2 ) covers groups of special humanitarian concern to the united states .

it includes specific groups within certain nationalities , clans , or ethnic groups , such as iranian religious minorities and certain iraqis associated with the united states ( see below ) .

priority three ( p - 3 ) comprises family reunification cases involving spouses , unmarried children under age 21 , and parents of persons who were admitted to the united states as refugees or granted asylum .

eighteen nationalities are eligible for p - 3 processing in fy2009 .

in most cases , to be considered for refugee resettlement in the united states , an individual must be outside his or her country of nationality .

uscis is responsible for adjudicating refugee cases .

it makes determinations about whether an individual qualifies for refugee status and is otherwise admissible to the united states .

the "lautenberg amendment," first enacted in 1989 , requires the attorney general ( now the secretary of dhs ) to designate categories of former soviet and indochinese nationals for whom less evidence is needed to prove refugee status , and provides for adjustment to lpr status for certain former soviet and indochinese nationals denied refugee status .

p.l .

108-199 amended the lautenberg amendment to add a new provision , known as the "specter amendment," that directs the attorney general to establish categories of iranian religious minorities who may qualify for refugee status under the lautenberg amendment's reduced evidentiary standard .

p.l .

110-5 extends the lautenberg amendment through fy2007 , and p.l .

110-161 ( division j , §634 ( k ) ) extends the amendment through fy2008 .

an fy2009 extension has not yet been enacted .

lautenberg cases that were filed by september 30 , 2008 , however , can continue to be adjudicated .

the "mccain amendment," first enacted in 1996 , made the adult children of certain vietnamese refugees eligible for u.s. refugee resettlement .

p.l .

107-185 revised the amendment for fy2002 and fy2003 .

among its provisions , this law enabled adult children previously denied resettlement to have their cases reconsidered .

subsequent laws extended the amendment , as revised , through fy2007 .

p.l .

110-161 ( division j , §634 ( f ) ) extends the amendment through fy2009 .

h.r .

3096 , as passed by the house , would state that it is u.s. policy to offer refugee resettlement to nationals of vietnam who were eligible for a u.s. refugee program , but who were deemed ineligible because of an administrative error or who , for reasons beyond their control , did not apply by the relevant deadlines .

according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) , more than 2 million iraqis have left their homes for neighboring states , mainly syria and jordan .

the plight of iraqi refugees is of congressional interest , and multiple bills have been introduced in the 110 th congress to facilitate the resettlement of iraqi refugees in the united states .

iraqi refugees are eligible for resettlement in the united states through the u.s. refugee program .

fy2008 admissions of iraqi refugees totaled 13,823 .

as of november 30 , 2008 , fy2009 admissions total 1,443 .

like all nationalities , iraqis are eligible for refugee processing under priority one of the priority system outlined in the preceding section .

with respect to priority two , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( p.l .

110-181 ) specifies certain groups of iraqis that are to be processed under this processing priority .

these new priority two groups include iraqis who are or were employed by the u.s. government in iraq ; iraqis who are or were employed in iraq by a media or non - governmental organization headquartered in the united states , or by an entity closely associated with the u.s. mission in iraq that has received u.s. government funding ; and iraqis who are members of a persecuted religious or minority group and have close family members in the united states .

iraqis are also among the 18 nationalities eligible for priority three processing in fy2009 .

in most cases , as mentioned above , an individual must be outside his or her country of nationality to be considered for refugee resettlement in the united states .

p.l .

110-181 requires the secretary of state to establish an in - country refugee processing program for iraqis .

iraqi refugee provisions similar to those in p.l .

110-181 are included in s. 1651 and the senate - passed version of h.r .

1585 .

beyond the formal refugee program , other immigration mechanisms have been established to facilitate the admission to the united states of iraqis who have worked for or been closely associated with the u.s. government , including the u.s. military .

provisions enacted in 2006 authorize dhs to grant lpr status as special immigrants to certain nationals of iraq or afghanistan who worked directly with the u.s. armed forces as translators for at least one year , and their spouses and children .

this program was initially capped at 50 aliens ( excluding spouses and children ) annually .

p.l .

110-28 and p.l .

110-36 expand this program to authorize dhs to grant special immigrant status to nationals of iraq or afghanistan who have worked directly with the u.s. armed forces , or under chief of mission authority , as translators or interpreters .

these laws also increase the annual cap on this program to 500 for fy2007 and fy2008 .

p.l .

110-36 further establishes that an individual's absence from the united states due to his or her work with the chief of mission or u.s. armed forces as a translator or interpreter , some of which work was done in iraq or afghanistan , will not be considered a break in u.s. continuous residence for purposes of naturalization under the ina .

p.l .

110-181 , in addition to making changes to the refugee program discussed above , broadens dhs's authority to provide special immigrant status to certain nationals of iraq .

it also grants the secretary of state the authority to provide such status in consultation with dhs .

under this law , iraqi nationals are eligible for special immigrant status if they were employed by or on behalf of the u.s. government in iraqi on or after march 20 , 2003 , for not less than one year ; provided documented valuable service to the u.s. government ; and have experienced "an ongoing serious threat as a consequence of the alien's employment by the united states government. .

this special immigrant program is capped at 5,000 principal aliens ( excluding spouses and children ) for each of the five fiscal years after the date of enactment .

p.l .

110-242 amends p.l .

110-181 to change the reference to "each of the five fiscal years after the date of enactment" to "fiscal years 2008 through 2012. .

p.l .

110-242 also grants the secretary of homeland security or the secretary of state the authority to convert an approved petition for special immigrant status under the special immigrant program for afghani or iraqi translators or interpreters described above to an approved petition for special immigrant status under the special immigrant program established by p.l .

110-181 , if a visa for the former program is not immediately available and the original petition was filed before october 1 , 2008 .

such a converted petition would not subject to the eligibility requirements of the p.l .

110-181 program but would be subject to that program's 5,000 annual cap .

as mentioned above , aliens admitted to the united states as refugees are eligible for resettlement assistance and for federal public assistance , provided that they meet the relevant requirements .

while special immigrants as a whole are not eligible for such assistance , p.l .

110-161 includes a provision making iraqis and afghans who are admitted as special immigrants eligible for the same resettlement assistance , entitlement programs , and other benefits as refugees for up to six months .

p.l .

110-181 extends this period of eligibility to up to eight months for iraqi special immigrants only .

h.r .

6328 , as ordered reported by the house committee on foreign affairs , would establish the position of a white house coordinator for iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons ( idps ) .
