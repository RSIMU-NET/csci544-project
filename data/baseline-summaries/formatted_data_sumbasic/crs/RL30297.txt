the congressional budget act of 1974 ( titles i - ix of p.l .

93-344 , as amended ; 2 u.s.c .

601-688 ; hereafter referred to as the "budget act" ) provides for the annual adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget each year .

the congressional budget resolution represents a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years .

as a concurrent resolution , it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law .

instead , when adopted by congress , the budget resolution serves as an agreement between the house and senate on a congressional budget plan .

as such , it provides the framework for subsequent legislative action on the annual appropriations bills , revenue measures , reconciliation legislation , and any other budgetary legislation .

while the programmatic assumptions ( i.e. , the specific mix of revenue and spending policies that are assumed within the budget levels ) are not binding , the totals and committee spending allocations may be enforced through points of order and through the budget reconciliation process ( explained below ) .

this report provides current and historical information on the budget resolution .

it provides a list of the budget resolutions adopted and rejected by congress since implementation of the budget act , including the u.s. statutes - at - large citations and committee report numbers , and describes their formulation and content .

the report provides a table of selected optional components , a list of the budget reconciliation measures developed pursuant to directives contained in budget resolutions , and information on the number of years covered by budget resolutions .

it also provides information on the consideration and adoption of budget resolutions , including an identification of the house special rules that provided for consideration of budget resolutions , the amendments in the nature of a substitute to the budget resolution considered in the house , the number and disposition of house and senate amendments to budget resolutions , and dates of house and senate action on budget resolutions .

congress has modified the congressional budget process several times since it was first established in 1974 .

the appendix identifies laws , budget resolutions , and other resolutions that modified the procedures and requirements pertaining to the development , content , and consideration of the budget resolution .

as originally enacted , the budget act provided for the annual adoption of two budget resolutions for each year .

the first budget resolution , adopted in the spring , set nonbinding "targets" to guide the consideration of budgetary legislation .

the second budget resolution , adopted in the fall ( about two weeks before the beginning of the fiscal year ) , was intended to provide congress , after considering and possibly completing action on specific budgetary legislation , the opportunity to either reaffirm or revise the budget levels in the first budget resolution .

additional budget resolutions , or revisions to the previous one , could be ( and still can be ) adopted at any time .

the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( title ii of p.l .

99-177 , 99 stat .

1038-1101 ; hereafter referred to as the "deficit control act" ) eliminated the requirement for a second budget resolution beginning in 1986 ( for the fy1987 budget resolution ) .

for several preceding years , for fy1983-fy1986 , congress did not adopt a second budget resolution but instead included a provision in the first budget resolution that made the spending and revenue totals in it binding automatically as of the beginning of the fiscal year .

during the 41 years under the budget act ( 1975 to the present ) , congress has completed action on 40 budget resolutions , including in some years multiple budget resolutions for a single fiscal year .

in 32 of the 41 years , congress adopted at least one budget resolution for the fiscal year .

congress did not complete action on a budget resolution for nine fiscal years , most recently for fy2015 .

congress also adopted a second budget resolution in seven of the 41 years .

in 1977 , congress adopted a third budget resolution for fy1977 , further revising the budget levels that fiscal year .

table 1 lists all budget resolutions adopted by congress , with the house and senate votes on initial passage and adoption of the conference report .

it also includes , in italics , budget resolutions reported or considered in one chamber but not the other for those fiscal years that congress did not complete action on a budget resolution .

the u.s. statutes - at - large citations for budget resolutions adopted by congress are listed in table 2 .

 ( although concurrent resolutions such as budget resolutions have no statutory authority , they are compiled in a special section of the u.s. statutes - at - large . ) .

table 3 lists the budget resolutions rejected in the house .

no budget resolutions have been rejected in the senate ; however , the senate rejected several motions to proceed to different budget resolutions in 2011 and 2012 .

floor consideration of the budget resolution differs in the house and senate .

section 305 of the budget act sets forth special procedures for the consideration of the budget resolution , generally to expedite its consideration .

the house , however , regularly adopts a special rule , a simple house resolution , setting forth the terms for consideration of the measure .

in particular , special rules have been used for more than a decade to limit the offering of amendments to a few major substitutes .

table 8 lists the special rules that provided for the consideration of budget resolutions in the house .

in contrast , floor consideration in the senate is governed by the procedures set forth in the budget act .

the procedures generally limit debate and prohibit certain amendments and motions .

the house has considered an average of almost seven amendments per budget resolution .

the largest number of amendments considered was 45 in 1979 ; the largest number agreed to was 11 also in 1979 .

 ( the first fy1983 budget resolution also was amended 11 times , but it subsequently was rejected. ) .

table 9 identifies the number of accepted and rejected amendments to budget resolutions considered in the house .

the amending activity in the house during the last few decades is in marked contrast to the early years under the budget act .

during the first eight years , the house considered an average of 16 amendments per budget resolution , agreeing to an average of four of them .

in contrast , during the past 33 years , the house has considered very few amendments to budget resolutions , averaging between two and three per budget resolution and agreeing to even fewer of these .

of the 121 amendments considered by the house during this time period , 5 have been adopted .

contributing to this trend , the house special rule typically has allowed for consideration of only amendments in the nature of a substitute to the budget resolution .

for example , between 1983 and 2015 ( for the fy1984-fy2016 budget resolutions ) , 117 of the 121 amendments to the budget resolution made in order by the special rule were amendments in the nature of a substitute .

only two of these 117 amendments in the nature of a substitute were agreed to ; those two contained the budget resolution text recommended by the house budget committee offered by its chair at the time , representative william h. gray iii and representative tom price , respectively .

table 10 lists the amendments in the nature of a substitute to the budget resolution made in order by the special rule .

in the senate , the terms of debate and the consideration of amendments are not structured by a special rule , as in the house , but instead are governed by the procedures set forth in section 305 ( b ) of the budget act .

typically , the senate considers many amendments to the budget resolution , most addressing specific issues instead of proposing a complete substitute as in the house .

during the period between 1975 and 2015 , the senate considered an average of almost 54 amendments per budget resolution , agreeing to an average of 31 of these .

the largest number of amendments considered was 254 in 2015 ; the largest number agreed to was 146 , also in 2015 .

table 11 identifies the number of amendments adopted , rejected , ruled out - of - order , and withdrawn during senate consideration of budget resolutions .

in contrast to the house , the number of amendments considered by the senate has increased over the last two decades or so .

for the last 18 budget resolutions considered on the floor , for example , the senate considered an average of almost 90 amendments per budget resolution , agreeing to an average of over 56 of these .

amendments have been agreed to in the senate at a much higher rate compared to the house as well .

for instance , in 13 of the past 18 years in which a budget resolution was considered on the floor , the success rate for amendments has equaled or exceeded 60% .

the budget act sets april 15 as a target date for completing action on the annual budget resolution .

table 12 lists the dates of final adoption of budget resolutions for fy1976-fy2015 .

during this period , congress adopted the budget resolution by the target date only six times , most recently in 2003 with the fy2004 budget resolution .

under the original timetable ( prior to 1986 , the deadline was may 15 ) , congress adopted the annual budget resolution by the target date twice: in 1975 and 1976 .

after the target date was changed to april 15 by the 1985 deficit control act , congress has completed action on the budget resolution by the target date four times: in 1993 , 1999 , 2000 , and 2003 .

further , as noted above , congress did not complete action on a budget resolution for nine fiscal years , most recently for fy2015 .

in those years in which congress has adopted a budget resolution ( that is , not including fy1999 , fy2003 , fy2005 , fy2007 , and fy2011 through fy2015 ) , it has adopted the budget resolution an average of 36 days after the target date .

the fy1991 budget resolution was adopted the latest , on october 9 , 1990 , or 177 days after the target date .

the earliest adoption of a budget resolution was for fy1994 on april 1 , 1993 , or 14 days before the target date .

table 13 and table 14 provide a list of dates related to the consideration and adoption of the budget resolution in the house and the senate , respectively .

full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 ( "humphrey - hawkins act" ; p.l .

95-523 ; 92 stat .

 ( provision was repealed in 1982. ) .

balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( title ii of p.l .

99-177 ; 99 stat .

1038-1101 ; december 12 , 1985 ) required congress to complete action on a budget resolution by april 15 of each year ( deadline moved from may 15 ) .

excluded social security from budget totals , except for purposes of calculating the deficit in order to determine if sequestration is required .

the budget resolution may contain two deficit totals: one with social security and one without .

budget enforcement act ( bea ) of 1990 ( title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 ; p.l .

101-508 ; 104 stat .

1388-573 through 630 ; november 5 , 1990 ) added language to the budget act allowing the option to include pay - as - you - go procedures for the senate and house in the budget resolution ( sections 301 ( b ) ( 7 ) and 301 ( b ) ( 8 ) ) .

required that the budget resolutions for fy1991-fy1995 cover five fiscal years .

in the senate , prohibited the consideration of a reported budget resolution calling for a reduction in social security surpluses .

changed deadline for submitting views and estimates reports from "on or before february 25 of each year" to "within 6 weeks after the president submits a budget. .

added language to the budget act allowing the option of including social security outlays and revenues in the budget resolution for purposes of senate enforcement .

in the senate , created a point of order that prohibits the consideration of any budget resolution that would exceed any of the discretionary spending limits .

 ( initially , this point of order was added to the budget act as a temporary section ( 601 ( b ) ) ; the bea of 1997 permanently added this point of order to the budget act as section 312 ( b ) and applied the point of order to any legislation. ) .

omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 ( title xiv of p.l .

103-66 ; 107 stat .

683-685 ; august 10 , 1993 ) extended through fy1998 the bea requirement that budget resolutions cover five fiscal years .

budget resolution for fy1995 ( h.con.res .

218 ; 103 rd congress ; may 12 , 1994 ) made permanent a temporary modification found in the budget resolutions for fy1993 and fy1994 , which applied section 301 ( i ) to a budget resolution at any stage of consideration .

section 301 ( i ) of the budget act prohibits the senate from considering any reported budget resolution that would decrease the excess of social security revenues over social security outlays for any of the fiscal years covered by the resolution , subject to a three - fifths waiver requirement .

this creates a "firewall" to protect social security balances .

the provision did not apply if the deficit for a fiscal year resulted solely from legislation that made structural programmatic reforms to enhance retirement security .

budget resolution for fy2001 ( h.con.res .

290 ; 106 th congress ; april 13 , 2000 ) applied the point of order against budget resolutions setting forth an on - budget deficit for any fiscal year ( see fy2000 budget resolution ) to a revised fy2001 or a fy2002 budget resolution .

the provision would not apply if the economy experienced low growth in two consecutive quarters or if a declaration of war was in effect .

specified that amendments that contain predominately "precatory" language , such as sense - of - the - senate amendments , are not germane , effectively prohibiting such amendments to budget resolutions and reconciliation legislation .
