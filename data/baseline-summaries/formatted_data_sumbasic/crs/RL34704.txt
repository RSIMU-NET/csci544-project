the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( h.r .

6893 ) is an omnibus child welfare bill designed to ensure greater permanence and improve the well - being of children served by public child welfare agencies â€” especially children in foster care , those who leave foster care in their later teens , and those who are indian children .

the legislation received strong support in congress , and beyond revising and extending the adoption incentives program , it responds to a range of issues and concerns that have been variously raised ( some for more than a decade ) by public child welfare administrators ; youth , adoption , tribal , and child welfare advocates ; and by children and youth who have been ( or still are ) in foster care .

the bill passed the house of representatives , by voice vote ( under suspension of the rules ) , on september 17 , 2008 , and the senate , by unanimous consent , on september 22 , 2008 .

it was signed into law by president george w. bush on october 7 , 2008 .

as enacted , p.l .

110-351 represents a compromise between provisions that were included in the improved adoption incentives and relative guardianship support act of 2008 ( s. 3038 , introduced by senator charles grassley ) , as approved by the senate finance committee on september 10 , 2008 ( s.rept .

110-467 ) , and the fostering connections to success act ( h.r .

6307 , introduced by representative jim mcdermott with representative jerry weller ) , as passed by the house on june 24 , 2008 .

the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-351 ) revises and extends the adoption incentives program ( under section 473a of the social security act ) for five years , authorizes states to claim additional federal funds for certain child welfare purposes and adds new requirements for receipt of federal child welfare dollars .

these changes are primarily designed to better ensure the well - being of children in foster care , to increase support for permanent living arrangements outside of foster care , to better support the transition of older foster youth to independent living , and to enable tribes to directly access federal support for foster care , kinship care , and adoption assistance provided to indian children under their authority .

although h.r .

6893 , as enacted , authorizes significant expansions in federal support for state and tribal child welfare programs , cbo projects a combined change in federal spending and revenues from the overall bill that is roughly budget neutral over ten years ( fy2009-fy2018 ) .

specifically , cbo projects that the bill will reduce the federal budget deficit by $15 million over those ten years .

this positive effect ( i.e .

reduction in federal budget deficit ) is projected to be much larger in the first five years of the bill's enactment ( $449 million ) , in part because a number of the bill's provisions that are expected to increase federal spending are made effective a year or two after enactment and because the full effect of other provisions is phased in over five or more years .

the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( h.r .

6893 ) was introduced by representative jim mcdermott , with representative jerry weller , on september 15 , 2008 , and passed the house ( under suspension of the rules and by voice vote ) on september 17 , 2008 .

the bill then went to the senate where it was passed ( by unanimous consent ) on september 22 , 2008 .

enacted on october 7 , 2008 as p.l .

110-351 , the final legislation represented a compromise between bills that were earlier acted on by the house and by the senate finance committee .

these bills are the improved adoption incentives and relative guardianship support act of 2008 ( s. 3038 ) and the fostering connections to success act ( h.r .

6307 ) .

s. 3038 was introduced by senator grassley in may 2008 , and the senate finance committee approved the "chairman's mark" version of that bill on september 10 , 2008 ( s.rept .

110-467 ) .

h.r .

6307 was introduced by representative mcdermott with representative weller in june 2008 , and it passed the house on june 24 , 2008 .

both representative mcdermott and representative weller described the final bill , h.r .

6893 , as the product of bipartisan and bicameral legislative work and they cited the importance of senator max baucus and senator grassley in this effort .

the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-351 ) is divided into six titles , most with multiple sections , and makes the following changes .

[sections 501 and 502 in this title are not a part of federal child welfare policy but are changes made to other parts of federal law , including the tax code , to offset costs of increased federal child welfare spending authorized in the previous titles of the enacted bill. .

unless a different date is stipulated in the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 , the effective date of the amendments made by the bill is october 7 , 2008 ( date of its enactment ) ; for any state , permits a time - limited exception to the effective date of any requirement added by this bill ( under title iv - b or title iv - e ) if hhs determines that the state must enact legislation ( other than legislation to appropriate funds ) to comply with a new requirement .
