p.l .

114-254 , the further continuing resolution for fy2017 , extended funding and program authority for the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant through april 28 , 2017 .

though several bills altering tanf policies were reported by the house ways and means committee to the full house during the second session of the 114 th congress — and one bill passed the house — none were enacted .

on june 21 , 2016 , the house passed h.r .

5170 , a bill that would have established a demonstration project for "social impact partnership projects. .

that bill would also have extended tanf and mandatory child care block grant funding for one year ( fy2017 ) and revised tanf - related research funding .

the bill was not considered in the senate .

in may 2016 , the house ways and means committee approved separate bills that would have made additional policy changes to tanf by ( 1 ) establishing a demonstration program for subsidized employment for tanf assistance recipients and noncustodial parents ; ( 2 ) making revisions to tanf state spending requirements ; ( 3 ) adding child poverty reduction to the statutory purpose of tanf ; and ( 4 ) establishing new employment outcome measures for tanf .

these bills were not considered by the full house .

the tanf block grant funds grants to states , tribes , and territories for providing benefits , services , and activities to broadly address both the effects and root causes of childhood economic and social disadvantage .

it was created in the 1996 welfare reform law , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-193 ) , which culminated decades of debate over how to change public assistance programs for needy families with children .

the 1996 welfare law provided funding for tanf through fy2002 .

since the end of fy2002 , tanf has been extended numerous times on a short - term basis , and had one long - term ( five - year ) extension .

that long - term extension expired at the end of fy2010 , and tanf has been extended on an annual basis since then .

though there have been policy changes to tanf attached to some tanf extensions , most tanf policy dates back 20 years to the 1996 welfare law .

in july 2015 , the house ways and means committee released a "discussion draft" proposing a five - year reauthorization of tanf with wide - ranging policy changes , including changes to tanf's work standards .

 ( see crs in focus if10315 , tanf reauthorization: house ways and means committee discussion draft of july 10 , 2015 . ) .

the president's fy2017 budget proposals also proposed a number of changes to tanf , including an increase in block grant funding .

 ( see crs in focus if10367 , temporary assistance for needy families and related programs: the president's fy2017 budget proposal . ) .

h.r .

5170 , the social impact partnerships to pay for results act , was introduced by representative todd young , for himself and representative john delaney .

as ordered reported with an amendment by the ways and means committee , h.r .

5170 would have provided for the establishment of "social impact partnerships," also sometimes referred to as "social impact bonds. .

h.r .

5170 was ordered reported by the house ways and means committee on may 11 , 2016 .

its report ( h.rept .

114-616 ) was filed on june 10 , 2016 .

the version of h.r .

5170 considered ( and passed ) on the house floor on june 21 differed from the bill reported from the ways and means committee .

the version considered on the floor and passed by the house added a provision that would have required at least 50% of funds provided for agreements awarding funding for social impact partnership projects be used for initiatives that directly benefit children .

the version considered and passed by the full house also added provisions that would have provided for a one - year extension of tanf funding as well as a revision of tanf's provisions on research .

that version was considered by the house under suspension of the rules and passed by a voice vote .

in addition to h.r .

5170 , the house ways and means committee reported additional changes to tanf in separate bills during may 2016 .

these bills would have established a subsidized employment demonstration project ( h.r .

2990 ) , revised the rules for tanf state spending requirements ( h.r .

2959 ) , added reducing child poverty as a statutory goal of tanf ( h.r .

2966 ) , and established new employment outcome measures for tanf ( h.r .

2952 ) .

these bills were not acted upon by the full house .

two of the bills approved by the house ways and means committee on may 11 , 2016 — h.r .

5170 as passed by the house ( social impact partnerships ) and h.r .

2990 ( subsidized employment ) — proposed demonstration projects .

each project would have been funded at $100 million , with the funding coming from the fy2017 appropriation for the tanf contingency fund .

p.l .

114-113 made appropriations to the tanf contingency fund for both fy2016 and fy2017 .

under current law , the fy2017 appropriation to the fund is $608 million .

these funds are available for grants to states that qualify for them .

h.r .

5170 , as passed by the house , would have reduced the amount available for fy2017 grants to states from the contingency fund by $100 million .

additionally , h.r .

2990 would also have reduced fy2017 contingency fund grants to states by an additional $100 million .

the contingency fund was created in the 1996 welfare reform law to make extra grants to states during economic downturns .

it was initially funded at $2 billion , to remain available as needed .

the original funding was exhausted in fy2010 ; since then congress has provided annual appropriations for the fund .

states have to meet criteria of economic need in order to access the contingency fund .

the criteria of economic need are ( 1 ) a three - month average state unemployment rate of at least 6.5% and at least 10% higher than in the corresponding three months of either of the prior two years ; or ( 2 ) a state's supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) caseload is at least 10% higher than it was in fy1994 or fy1995 .

additionally , states have to spend more from their own funds than they spent in fy1994 on tanf - related programs in order to access the fund .

the number of households receiving snap increased through the 2000s , even before the onset of the 2007-2009 recession , with additional increases during the recession .

though snap caseloads have begun to decline , for almost all states they remain elevated well above their fy1994 or fy1995 levels .

thus , almost all states qualify as economically needy for the purposes of the contingency fund .

in fy2016 , 19 states met both the criteria as economically needy , spent sufficient state funds , and drew down tanf contingency grants .

the available fy2016 funding was exhausted in april 2016 .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimated in march 2016 that all contingency fund dollars will be spent in each of the next 10 years — regardless of the projected economic growth forecast for that period .

thus , the tanf contingency fund is not expected to serve a countercyclical function of providing extra grants when the economy experiences a downturn .

it does , however , provide extra tanf grants to states that qualify for contingency funds .
