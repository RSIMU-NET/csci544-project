the davis - bacon act ( 40 u.s.c .

Â§Â§Â 276a - 276a - 5 , now re - codified as 40 u.s.c .

3141-3148 ) became law in 1931 .

as amended , the act requires that construction contracts entered into by the federal government specify minimum wages to be paid to the various classes of laborers and mechanics working under those contracts .

minimum wages are defined by the act as those determined by the secretary of labor ( a ) to be prevailing ( b ) in the locality of the project ( c ) for similar crafts and skills ( d ) on comparable construction work .

the prevailing wage concept was expanded in 1964 to include a fringe benefit component .

the act has a coverage threshold of $2,000 .

through the years , davis - bacon prevailing wage provisions have been added to more than 50 program statutes .

in addition , many states and some local jurisdictions have "little davis - bacon" acts of their own .

most of these differ from each other in coverage or other requirements â€” and differ , as well , from the federal statute .

this report sketches the evolution of the davis - bacon act and suggests the scope of the controversy that has formed around it .

it then examines , briefly , some of the trends in the scholarship and reportage concerning the act and , finally , provides a bibliography of published non - documentary sources that are generally available to persons with a deeper interest in the statute , its history , and its administration .

early in the 20 th century , it was not at all clear that the federal government had the authority to regulate wages and conditions of work in the private sector .

when congress attempted to deal legislatively with hours of work , child labor or minimum wages , its enactments were often found by the courts to be in violation of its constitutional authority .

only after 1937 when the u.s. supreme court sustained a washington state labor standards statute ( west coast hotel v. parrish ( 300 u.s. 379 ) ) did congress assume a more confident affirmative role in regulation of the workplace .

through the years , arguments for and against davis - bacon have become largely fixed â€” as have the counter - arguments of defenders and critics .

the logic and many of the assumptions that these arguments contain have been questioned at length .

in the evolving debate , few contentions about the act have gone ( or are likely to go ) unchallenged .

the davis - bacon act , among labor laws , is widely known but it may not be well known .

the davis - bacon literature , if one takes into account agency reports and congressional hearings , is extensive .

these public documents have provided a basis both for popular and scholarly consideration of the act .

perhaps the most frequently asked question concerning the davis - bacon act is: would we save money if the davis - bacon act were repealed or modified to narrow its scope ? .

the short answer is: no one really knows .

conversely , might davis - bacon result in savings to the federal government in its purchases of construction ? .

that , too , would seem to be an open question .

another question frequently asked by those , both in industry and in the workforce , who may have to deal with the davis - bacon act is: is this particular project covered ? .

and further: if so , why ? .

if not , why not ? .

to whom is assigned the judgment for making such determinations ? .

such questions might be answered were there a scholarly , institutional history of the act and of its place within the broader field of public contracting policy .

if such a study exists , it does not appear to be generally available .

through the years , the davis - bacon act has attracted considerable attention from economists , attorneys , policy analysts , journalists and others .

the result is a moderately extensive bibliography of materials readily available to the public .

its quality , as noted above , varies from one item to another .

most of the entries in this bibliography deal specifically with davis - bacon .

there are , however , a number that focus upon issues related tangentially ( but importantly ) to questions that have been raised about the application of the act .

for example , an extensive literature has been developed dealing with the impact of trade unions upon productivity , a central factor in estimating the cost impact of the act .

a representative sample of these studies has been included in the listing .

also included are a number of entries bearing upon the nature of the construction industry and upon legal issues associated with administration of the davis - bacon act and with its impact .

this bibliography is selective .

while primarily of published materials , it also includes , in a few instances , materials that have not been published but which have been widely circulated through the years and / or which have had an impact upon the davis - bacon debate .

because its focus is primarily upon analytical or policy literature , a listing of congressional hearings and reports has not been included , though these have been cited in the footnotes of the covering essay as appropriate .

also omitted ( with select exceptions ) are studies produced by the department of labor and the several legislative branch agencies such as the general accounting office and the congressional budget office .

there has been , through the years , a significant reportage concerning the davis - bacon act in the industry and trade union press: sometimes brief editorial comment ; on other occasions , publication of testimony presented before a committee of the congress or an analysis of legislation .

for the most part , these industry and trade union materials have not been included , though this latter policy has not been followed uniformly .

finally , there are a number of manuals â€” how to administer the act , how to conduct wage surveys , how to comply with the provisions of the statute â€” that have been prepared by an agency or one of the interest groups .

these , too , have been omitted from the listing here .

for the most part , items listed in the bibliography are available from the general collection of the library of congress and , frequently , are also available from university collections and public libraries .
