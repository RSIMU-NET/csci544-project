while periodic , omnibus farm bills focus on agricultural and food policy , they also contain provisions addressing rural community and economic development .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , through its rural development agency ( rd ) , administers a broad portfolio of programs focused on rural housing , rural infrastructure , and rural business and employment .

congress considers reauthorizing and amending many of these programs in periodic farm bills .

the most recent is the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( 2018 farm bill , p.l .

115-334 ) .

the 2018 farm bill generally authorizes programs and funding levels for the period fy2019-fy2023 , though some provisions apply to different periods , such as fy2019-fy2025 .

since 1973 , farm bills have included a title dedicated to rural development .

the rural development title ( title vi ) of the 2018 farm bill generally addresses ( 1 ) rural infrastructure , including housing , electrical generation and transmission , water and wastewater , and more recently , broadband deployment ; ( 2 ) rural economic development ; and ( 3 ) rural business creation and expansion .

the miscellaneous title ( title xii ) also includes certain rural development provisions related to rd personnel , federal task forces or working groups , and other federal rural development programs .

programs authorized in other titles of p.l .

115-334 may benefit rural areas , especially rural areas with economies reliant on agriculture .

however , most rural development provisions in the rural development and miscellaneous titles specifically target rural areas .

a number of issues influenced the rural development provisions of the 2018 farm bill .

many rural communities have experienced decreasing populations over the last decade .

in addition , some rural residents struggle to access employment opportunities , especially in high - wage jobs .

the ongoing opioid crisis and an increasing number of rural hospital closures have raised concerns about the health of rural residents .

aging infrastructure , such as electric or drinking water infrastructure , also presents a challenge to some rural communities .

the digital divide âlower rates of broadband access in rural areas compared to urban areasâhas raised concerns that rural residents may be less able to access opportunities and services such as distance learning , telemedicine , and e - commerce .

in addition , policymakers and scholars have increasingly examined regional approaches to rural economic development rather than approaches focused on individual communities .

the 2018 farm bill includes new provisions and programs related to rural broadband deployment , health care , and community development .

the law also reauthorizes and amends existing programs related to broadband deployment , other rural infrastructure , and community development .

p.l .

115-334 amends multiple definitions of rural used to determine eligibility for rd programs .

the law also amends programs that address regional approaches to rural economic development .

further , p.l .

115-334 repeals some rural development programs and makes technical corrections to statutory language authorizing other programs .

this report provides a brief overview of federal rural development programs .

it then analyzes issues that influenced the development of rural development provisions in the 2018 farm bill .

next , the report details new rural development programs and entities created and changes made to existing rural development programs , in p.l .

115-334 .

the appendix provides a side - by - side comparison of each provision in the rural development title , as well as each rural development provision in the miscellaneous title , of the 2018 farm bill with prior law .

the rural development policy act of 1980 ( p.l .

96-355 ) named usda as the lead federal agency for rural development .

rd is the mission area within usda responsible for rural infrastructure and economic development assistance .

three agencies comprise rd: the rural business - cooperative service , the rural housing service , and the rural utilities service ( rus ) .

rd programs are largely loan and grant programs that assist communities with small populations to finance development projects .

many rd programs have statutory authority in the consolidated farm and rural development act of 1972 ( the conact , p.l .

87-128 ) or the rural electrification act of 1936 ( 7 u.s.c .

901 et seq. ) .

rd programs typically rely on annual appropriations for funding , but omnibus farm bills also authorize mandatory funding for some rd programs .

the most recent of these , the 2018 farm bill , reauthorizes or amends existing rd programs and authorizes new rd programs by amending the conact , the rural electrification act , or other authorizing legislation .

the 2018 farm bill also authorizes some rural development programs or entities administered outside usda .

for example , the law authorizes the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to establish a new task force on precision agriculture connectivity .

it also reauthorizes federal regional commissions , such as the appalachian regional commission .

a number of economic and social issues in rural america influenced the rural development provisions of the 2018 farm bill .

rural policy issues that influenced the 2018 farm bill include: rural population decline ; rural underemployment ; rural health issues , including the ongoing opioid crisis and an increasing rate of hospital closures in rural areas ; aging rural infrastructure and a lack of access to broadband internet in rural areas ; and a shift among some scholars and policymakers towards supporting regional approaches to rural economic development .

between 2010 and 2017 , the number of people living in nonmetropolitan counties declined by approximately 223,000 .

additionally , over 1,300 nonmetropolitan counties experienced population loss ( figure 2 ) .

while the overall u.s. rural population declined , rates of population change varied among rural areas .

populations declined in many rural counties dependent on agriculture and manufacturing , while populations increased in many rural counties dependent on recreation .

population decline results from a combination of out - migration , declining birth rates , and increased mortality .

research has attributed rural out - migration to many factors , including lack of employment opportunities and less access to education , health care , and cultural amenities .

congress sought to address rural population decline in the 2018 farm bill through rural infrastructure , business development , and community development .

historically , agriculture and rural policy were closely linked due to the high percentage of rural americans employed in agriculture .

this link has weakened due to the changing nature of rural employment .

in 2017 , the agriculture sector accounted for 5.6% of rural jobs , down from 6.8% in 2001 .

in addition , usda estimates that approximately 80% of total farm household income in 2019 will come from off - farm activities .

manufacturing has also been an important source of employment in rural areas , being responsible for a larger share of jobs in rural counties than in urban counties .

in 2017 , manufacturing employed 10.8% of the rural workforce , declining from 14.1% in 2001 .

congress sought to address rural employment in the 2018 farm bill through entrepreneurship , business development , broadband deployment , and access to credit .

rural health issues also influenced the 2018 farm bill's rural development provisions .

policymakers continue to look for solutions to address the opioid epidemic that began in the 1990s .

though this epidemic has affected urban , suburban , and rural areas , the drug overdose death rate in rural areas increased at a faster rate than in urban areas between 1990 and 2015 .

in addition , many scholars and interest groups have asserted that the federal government's approach to mitigating the opioid crisis in rural areas should differ from the strategy for urban areas .

while federal , state , and local governments have addressed the epidemic , drug overdose rates remain high .

in addition , a rise in the number of rural hospital closures has increased concerns about access to health care in rural areas .

according to the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) , 64 rural hospitals closed between 2013 and 2017 , more than twice as many as during the previous five - year period .

these hospital closures will likely result in rural residents having to travel greater distances for emergency medical care .

in the 2018 farm bill , congress included provisions related to refinancing of rural hospital debt , funding for opioid abuse prevention and treatment , and coordination of federal rural health efforts .

aging infrastructure continues to be a concern for rural areas .

according to gao , "many rural communities face significant challenges in financing the costs of replacing or upgrading aging and obsolete drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. .

because communities typically pay for drinking water infrastructure through rates charged to users , more sparsely populated communities have difficulty financing major infrastructure construction or upgrades .

some rural communities also lack the resources to assess infrastructure needs .

similar challenges exist to upgrading and maintaining rural housing and electricity infrastructure .

the 2018 farm bill includes provisions related to rural infrastructure loan and grant programs , technical assistance for infrastructure planning , and prioritizing water infrastructure funding to address a public health crisis .

additionally , scholars and policymakers have asserted that access to broadband internet is important for economic and community development in rural areas .

according to the most recent fcc deployment data , as of december 2017 , 26% of americans in rural areas and 32% of americans on tribal lands lack access to broadband at speeds of at least 25 megabits per second ( mbps ) download and 3 mbps upload .

in comparison , 1.7% of americans in urban areas lack access to broadband at 25 / 3 mbps .

the 2018 farm law includes provisions related to broadband deployment , federal program coordination , and the use of broadband for precision agriculture .

some scholars and policymakers increasingly support a regional approach to rural economic development .

rather than focus on individual towns or communities , which may compete for jobs and residents , a regional approach draws on the strengths and opportunities of different localities within a region and involves coordination across communities .

the 2018 farm bill contained provisions related to federal regional commissions , technical assistance for regional planning , and prioritizing projects that support a strategic community development plan .

this section summarizes the rural development provisions in the 2018 farm bill .

it provides an overview of new rural development provisions .

it also summarizes provisions that reauthorize or amend federal statutes related to existing rural development programs and requirements .

in addition to amending programs , the farm bill authorizes programs to receive mandatory or discretionary funding .

congress controls the level of discretionary funding through the subsequent enactment of annual appropriations .

congress controls the level of mandatory funding outside of the appropriations process based on payments made as a direct consequence of statutory requirements .

most rd programs rely on discretionary funding .

section 6101 directs usda to set aside at least 20% of annual funds appropriated for the distance learning and telemedicine program for fy2019-fy2025 for telemedicine projects that provide substance use disorder treatment services .

it also directs usda to prioritize funding for community facilities direct loans and grants and rural health and safety education grants for projects that provide substance use disorder treatment , education , and prevention .

the provision also authorizes the secretary of agriculture to temporarily prioritize assistance under certain rd programs to help rural communities respond to a significant public health disruption .

section 6202 of the 2018 farm bill authorizes a new rural broadband deployment program to fund middle mile infrastructure .

middle mile infrastructure is infrastructure that does not connect directly to an end user ( such as a business or household ) but rather connects a local network to the larger internet backbone .

the provision authorizes $10 million per year for loans and grants for fy2019-fy2023 , subject to annual appropriations .

section 6208 adds a new section to the rural electrification act that addresses environmental reviews for rural broadband programs .

the new language authorizes usda to obligate , but not disburse , loan or grant funds before the completion of an environmental , historical , or other review .

the funds may be obligated if usda determines that a subsequent review will be adequate and easily accomplished .

section 6213 authorizes usda to use existing regulations for the rural broadband access and community connect programs for up to one year until usda issues a final rule implementing the 2018 farm bill changes .

section 6212 establishes procedures for federal broadband program coordination .

it directs the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) at the u.s. department of commerce to assist usda with verifying applicant eligibility for usda rural broadband programs .

the provision also directs usda and the fcc to coordinate before providing broadband assistance to prevent duplication .

it requires usda , ntia , and the fcc to submit a report to congress within one year of the farm bill's enactment on how to best coordinate federal broadband programs and activities .

section 6214 establishes a broadband integration working group to conduct a survey of all current federal assistance for broadband deployment .

the provision also directs the working group to make recommendations to address regulatory barriers and incentivize investment in broadband deployment and adoption .

the working group includes numerous federal agencies .

the administrator of rus , assistant secretary for communications and information at the department of commerce , director of the national economic council , and director of the office of science and technology policy at the white house co - chair the working group .

section 12511 directs the fcc to establish a task force on precision agriculture .

duties of the task force include identifying and measuring current gaps in broadband internet access on agricultural land and making policy recommendations to promote broadband deployment on unserved agricultural land .

section 6419 authorizes usda to make grants to eligible entities to provide technical assistance and training to support applications for rural business - cooperative service programs .

eligible entities may use grants to assist communities in planning for business and economic development needs , identifying public and private financing options , and preparing applications and materials to request financial assistance .

the law authorizes appropriations of $5 million per year for the program for fy2019-fy2023 .

section 6302 directs usda to provide technical assistance to t ribal entities to improve the entities' access to rd programs .

the provision requires technical assistance to address the unique challenges faced by tribal governments , producers , businesses , and tribally designated housing entities in accessing rd programs .

section 12510 directs usda to establish tribal promise zones that are to receive priority consideration for federal grant programs and initiatives .

criteria for tribal promise zones include unemployment rates , poverty rates , vacancy rates , household income , and the effectiveness of a competitiveness plan submitted by nominating entities .

prior to the 2018 farm bill's enactment , the federal government had designated certain tribal areas as tribal promise zones under an existing promise zones initiative at the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) .

section 12510 directs the secretary of agriculture to re - designate any previously designated tribal promise zone .

section 6424 establishes a new rural innovation stronger economy grant program to establish job accelerators in rural regions .

grant awards may be between $500,000 and $2 million , and applicants must provide at least 20% of project funds .

eligible applicants may use funds for a variety of purposes , including linking rural communities and entrepreneurs to markets , facilitating the repatriation of high - wage jobs to the united states , and identifying and building assets in rural communities .

the provision authorizes annual appropriations of $10 million per year for fy2019-fy2023 .

section 6306 creates a council on rural community innovation and economic development , comprised of various executive branch departments and agencies , to coordinate federal engagement with rural stakeholders and make recommendations to streamline and leverage federal investments in rural areas .

the provision also establishes a rural smart communities working group and a jobs accelerator working group within the council .

section 6103 authorizes usda to use loans or loan guarantees under certain rural business or infrastructure programs to refinance rural hospital debt .

congress permits usda to assist a rural hospital with refinancing debt if "the assistance would help preserve access to a health service in a rural community , meaningfully improve the financial position of the hospital , and otherwise meet the financial feasibility and adequacy of security requirements of the rural development agency. .

section 12409 directs usda to establish a rural health liaison who would integrate rural health activities across usda , coordinate with the secretary of health and human services , and provide technical assistance to usda outreach , extension , and county offices .

section 6201 reauthorizes and makes a number of amendments to the rural broadband access program ( also known as the farm bill loan program ) : increases authorized funding for the program from $25 million to $350 million per year for the period fy2019-fy2023 .

authorizes 3% - 5% of annual program funding for technical assistance and training to applicants applying to provide broadband service to communities that lack broadband at speeds of at least 10 / 1 mbps .

adds a grant component to the program to the existing direct and guaranteed loan components .

to be eligible for a grant , at least 90% of households in the proposed service area âthe area in which an applicant proposes to deploy broadbandâmust lack access to broadband at minimum speeds .

applicants must provide matching funds of 25% - 75% of the project cost , depending on the population density of the proposed service area .

amends the eligibility criteria for loans to require at least 50% of households in proposed service areas to lack access to broadband service at minimum speeds .

under prior law , this threshold was 15% of households .

increases the minimum acceptable broadband speeds for the program from 4 / 1 mbps to 25 / 3 mbps .

these minimum speeds determine both eligibility criteria and buildout requirements .

usda uses the minimum speeds to determine whether areas lack sufficient broadband service and are therefore eligible for program funding ( see above two bullet points ) .

usda also requires all loan or grant recipients to provide broadband service that meets the minimum speeds .

directs usda to prioritize applications that serve communities with a population of fewer than 10,000 residents ; serve communities experiencing out - migration ; provide broadband to cropland and ranchland for use in precision agriculture ; and were developed with , and received funding from , community stakeholders , among other prioritization criteria .

increases the maximum time to complete buildout of broadband infrastructure to five years .

under prior law , the maximum buildout time was three years from when usda made assistance available .

directs usda to establish broadband buildout requirements âthe level of internet service an applicant must provide for the duration of a project agreement .

section 6201 also directs usda to project minimum acceptable service standards for projects with agreements of 5-10 , 11-15 , 16-20 , and more than 20 years .

applicants must demonstrate the ability to furnish or improve service in order to meet the broadband buildout requirements .

the conference report contains language further explaining congressional intent .

authorizes usda to provide payment assistance for certain loan and grant recipients .

this includes reduced interest rates or allowing borrowers to defer payments .

directs usda to charge fees to lenders in amounts that reduce the cost of subsidies for guaranteed loans but are not a barrier to program participation .

moves certain provisions regarding notice requirements , default and deobligation , and service area assessment to other sections of the rural electrification act and makes amendments to these relocated provisions .

these provisions still apply to the rural broadband access program .

section 6201 also removes language regarding paperwork reduction , the preapplication process , and the number of application evaluation periods per year .

section 6102 reauthorizes the distance learning and telemedicine program through fy2023 and increases the authorization for annual appropriations from $75 million to $82 million per year .

section 6204 codifies the community connect program and authorizes funding of $50 million per year for fy2019-fy2023 .

previously , congress had authorized the program in annual agriculture appropriations bills .

section 6203 reauthorizes the rural gigabit network pilot program and renames it the innovative broadband advancement program .

congress authorizes usda to provide loans or grants to decrease the cost of broadband deployment and increase broadband speeds .

eligible applicants must agree to complete project buildout within five years and increase broadband speeds to at least the minimum broadband buildout requirements established for the rural broadband access program .

congress authorizes appropriations of $10 million per year for fy2019-fy2023 .

section 6205 establishes criteria for outdated broadband systems .

beginning october 1 , 2020 , usda must consider any portion of a service territory that is subject to an outstanding usda grant agreement to be unserved if broadband speeds in that portion of a service territory are less than 10 / 1 mbps .

the provision includes an exception for broadband service providers that have constructed , or begun to construct , broadband facilities that meet the minimum speeds for the rural broadband access program .

as mentioned earlier in this section , section 6201 set minimum broadband speeds for the rural broadband access program at 25 / 3 mbps .

section 6207 creates a new section of the rural electrification act that addresses public notices , service area assessments , and reporting requirements under usda rural broadband programs .

the provision includes both new language and language moved from other sections of the rural electrification act .

it moves language related to public notice requirements , service area assessments , and reporting from the section of the rural electrification act that authorizes the rural broadband access program to this newly created section .

moving this language makes it applicable to certain other programs authorized in the rural electrification act in addition to the rural broadband access program .

section 6207 also makes the following amendments: directs usda to publish information on applications and funding awards for rural broadband programs in a searchable database on the rus website .

the database must be available to the public .

gives internet service providers at least 45 days to respond to a public notice of application , in contrast to at least 15 days under prior law .

providers may submit information on any broadband service the provider currently offers in the area identified in an application .

this information helps usda determine whether a proposed area meets program eligibility requirements .

exempts from certain freedom of information act requirements information submitted by internet service providers in response to public notices .

includes language regarding assessing unserved communities for rural broadband access program eligibility .

under the program , usda gives priority to unserved communities âcommunities that lack residential broadband service at speeds of at least 10 / 1 mbps .

section 6207 directs usda to coordinate with the fcc and ntia , obtain data from any other relevant source , and perform site - specific testing to verify that communities given priority are eligible for program funding .

requires loan or grant recipients to report annually to usda , rather than semiannually as under prior law .

the provision also adds reporting requirements for middle mile projects .

section 6210 authorizes recipients of certain rd loans , loan guarantees , or grants authorized by the rural electrification act or the conact to use up to 10% of the award amount for rural broadband infrastructure projects .

recipients can use funding only for projects in areas that lack broadband service at speeds of at least 25 / 3 mbps .

the provision also directs usda not to provide funding if it would result in competitive harm to another recipient of rd loans or grants .

section 6206 moves language regarding default and deobligation from the section authorizing the rural broadband access program to a new section of the rural electrification act .

it also authorizes usda to establish a deferral period of not shorter than the project buildout period in order to support the financial feasibility of a project .

section 6209 moves existing language regarding refinancing telecommunications loans to a new section of the rural electrification act and amends this language .

prior law allowed a loan recipient to use any usda telecommunications loan to refinance another usda telecommunications loan if refinancing would support broadband deployment in rural areas .

the amended language allows a loan recipient to refinance any outstanding loan that would have been used for an eligible telecommunications purpose under the rural electrification act .

sections 6211 and 6502 of p.l .

115-334 amend section 922 of the rural electrification act , which authorizes usda to make loans for rural telephone service .
