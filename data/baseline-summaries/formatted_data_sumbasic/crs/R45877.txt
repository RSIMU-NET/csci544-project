the final status of the former princedom of kashmir has remained unsettled since 1947 .

on august 5 , 2019 , the indian government announced that it was formally ending the "special status" of its muslim - majority jammu and kashmir ( j&k ) state , the two - thirds of kashmir under new delhi's control , specifically by abrogating certain provisions of the indian constitution that granted the state autonomy with regard to most internal administrative issues .

the legal changes went into effect on november 1 , 2019 , when new delhi also bifurcated the state into two "union territories," each with lesser indigenous administrative powers than indian states .

indian officials explain the moves as matters of internal domestic politics , taken for the purpose of properly integrating j&k and facilitating its economic development .

the process by which india's government has undertaken the effort has come under strident criticism for its alleged reliance on repressive force in j&k and for questionable legal and constitutional arguments that are likely to come before india's supreme court .

internationally , the move sparked controversy as a "unilateral" indian effort to alter the status of a territory that is considered disputed by neighboring pakistan and china , as well as by the united nations .

new delhi's heavy - handed security crackdown in the remote state also raised ongoing human rights concerns .

to date , but for a brief january visit by the u.s .

ambassador to india , u.s. government officials and foreign journalists have not been permitted to visit the kashmir valley .

the long - standing u.s. position on kashmir is that the territory's status should be settled through negotiations between india and pakistan while taking into consideration the wishes of the kashmiri people .

since 1972 , india's government has generally shunned third - party involvement on kashmir , while pakistan's government has continued efforts to internationalize it , especially through u.n. security council ( unsc ) actions .

china , a close ally of pakistan , is also a minor party to the dispute .

there are international concerns about potential for increased civil unrest and violence in the kashmir valley , and the cascade effect this could have on regional stability.â to date , the trump administration has limited its public statements to calls for maintaining peace and stability , and respecting human rights .

the unsc likewise calls for restraint by all parties ; an "informal" august 16 unsc meeting resulted in no ensuing official u.n. statement .

numerous members of the u.s. congress have expressed concern about reported human rights abuses in kashmir and about the potential for further international conflict between india and pakistan .

new delhi's august moves enraged pakistan's leaders , who openly warned of further escalation between south asia's two nuclear - armed powers , which nearly came to war after a february 2019 suicide bombing in the kashmir valley and retaliatory indian airstrikes .

the actions may also have implications for democracy and human rights in india ; many analysts argue these have been undermined both in recent years and through article 370's repeal .

moreover , indian prime minister narendra modi and his hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) âempowered by a strong electoral mandate in may and increasingly pursuing hindu majoritarian policiesâmay be undermining the country's secular , pluralist traditions .

the united states seeks to balance pursuit of broader u.s. - india partnership while upholding human rights protections and maintaining cooperative relations with pakistan .

a key goal of u.s. policy in south asia has been to prevent india - pakistan conflict from escalating to interstate war .

this means the united states has sought to avoid actions that overtly favored either party .

over the past decade , however , washington appears to have grown closer to india while relations with pakistan appear to continue to be viewed as clouded by mistrust .

the trump administration "suspended" security assistance to pakistan in 2018 and has significantly reduced nonmilitary aid while simultaneously deepening ties with new delhi .

the administration views india as a key "anchor" of its "free and open indo - pacific" strategy , which some argue is aimed at china .

yet any u.s. impulse to "tilt" toward india is to some extent offset by islamabad's current , and by most accounts vital , role in facilitating afghan reconciliation negotiations .

president trump's apparent bonhomie with pakistan's prime minister and offer to mediate on kashmir in july was taken by some as a new and potentially unwise strategic shift .

the u.s. government has maintained a focus on the potential for conflict over kashmir to destabilize south asia .

at present , the united states has no congressionally - confirmed assistant secretary of state leading the bureau of south and central asia and no ambassador in pakistan , leading some experts to worry that the trump administration's preparedness for india - pakistan crises remains thin .

developments in august 2019 and after also renewed concerns among some analysts that the trump administration's "hands - off" posture toward this and other international crises erodes american power and increases the risk of regional turbulence .

some commentary , however , was more approving of u.s. posturing .

developments in kashmir in 2019 raise possible questions for congress: have india's actions changing the status of its j&k state negatively affect regional stability ? .

if so , what leverage does the united states have and what u.s. policies might best address potential instability ? .

is there any diplomatic or other role for the u.s. government to play in managing india - pakistan conflict or facilitating a renewal of their bilateral dialogue ? .

to what extent does increased instability in kashmir influence dynamics in afghanistan ? .

will islamabad's cooperation with washington on afghan reconciliation be reduced ? .

to what extent , if any , are india's democratic / constitutional norms and pluralist traditions at risk in the country's current political climate ? .

are human rights abuses and threats to religious freedom increasing there ? .

if so , should the u.s. government take any further actions to address such concerns ? .
