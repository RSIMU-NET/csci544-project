in all , at least seven house - passed title xvi bills are now pending before the senate energy and natural resources committee .

the committee's water and power subcommittee a held hearing on several pending title xvi bills on july 27 , 2006 .

on july 12 , 2006 , senators murkowski and feinstein introduced s. 3639 , a bill to amend the reclamation wastewater and groundwater study and facilities act ( title xvi of p.l .

102-575 ) .

the bill would replace existing authorization for bureau of reclamation's oversight of title xvi water reuse and recycling projects with new standards and procedures for the review of title xvi projects .

representative napolitano introduced an identical bill ( h.r .

another house - passed bill , h.r .

3929 , to authorize a desalination demonstration project at dana point , ca , has been reported from the senate committee on environment and public works .

a bill to establish a national integrated drought information system ( nidis ) , h.r .

5136 , also passed the house in september .

a related nidis bill , s. 2751 , was reported from the senate commerce committee and placed on the senate calendar .

members of the house and senate also prepared to respond to a mid - september stipulated settlement agreement between parties warring over the future of the san joaquin river .

after nearly a year of negotiation , a settlement was reached among water users , the federal government , and the natural resources defense council ( nrdc ) on how to respond to a judges' ruling that operation of the federal friant dam on the san joaquin river ( ca ) is in violation of california state fish and game code .

the ruling is part of an 18-year - old lawsuit between friant and nrdc , and calls for providing water to support salmon habitat in reaches of the river that have been dry and void of salmon since the mid - 1940s , when water was diverted from the river for irrigation .

many activities included in the settlement would require congressional authorization .

at issue for entities not party to the settlement is how reintroduction of federally threatened or endangered species ( salmon ) would affect existing irrigation and power project operations , as well as how increases in water flow would affect land use and flood flows .

for more than a century , the federal government has been involved in developing water projects for a variety of purposes , including flood control , navigation , power generation , and irrigation .

most major water projects , such as large dams and diversions , were constructed by either the bureau of reclamation ( bureau ) , in the department of the interior , or the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , in the department of defense .

traditionally , the corps has built and maintained projects designed primarily for flood control , navigation , and power generation , whereas bureau projects were designed primarily to facilitate settlement of the west by storing and providing reliable supplies of water for irrigation and "reclamation" of arid lands .

while both agencies supply water for some municipal and industrial uses , they do so largely as a secondary responsibility in connection with larger multipurpose projects .

most of the nation's public municipal water systems have been built by local communities under prevailing state water laws .

today , the bureau operates nearly 350 storage reservoirs and approximately 250 diversion dams — including some of the largest dams in the world , such as hoover dam on the colorado river and grand coulee dam on the columbia river .

in total , the bureau's projects provide water to approximately 9 million acres of farmland and nearly 31 million people in 17 western states .

the bureau also operates 58 power plants .

because of the strategic importance of its largest facilities , the bureau has heightened security at all key facilities to protect projects in the wake of the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .

most bureau water supply projects were built under authority granted to the secretary of the interior in the reclamation act of 1902 , or through individual project authorizations .

the original intent of the reclamation act was to encourage families to settle and farm lands in the arid and semi - arid west , where precipitation is typically 30% to 50% of amounts in the east .

construction of reclamation projects expanded greatly during the 1930s and 1940s , and continued rapidly until the late 1960s and early 1970s .

by the late 1960s , a combination of changing national priorities and local needs , increasing construction costs , and the prior development of most prime locations for water works contributed to a decline in new construction of major water works nationwide .

water supply for traditional off - stream uses — including municipal , industrial , and agricultural uses — was increasingly in direct competition with a growing interest in allocating water to maintain or enhance in - stream uses , such as recreation , scenic enjoyment , and fish and wildlife habitat .

during the 1970s , construction of new projects slowed to a handful of major works , culminating in the completion of the tellico dam project in tennessee and the tennessee tombigbee waterway through alabama and mississippi .

these projects pitted conservation and environmental groups , as well as some fiscal conservatives , against the traditional water resources development community .

new on the scene was the national environmental policy act of 1970 ( nepa ) , which for the first time required an assessment of the environmental effects of federal projects , and provided for more public scrutiny of such projects .

in 1978 , president carter announced that future federal water policy would focus on improving water resources management , constructing only projects that were economically viable , cooperating with state and local entities , and sustaining environmental quality .

the reagan administration continued to oppose large projects , contending they were fiscally unsound .

new construction of federally financed water projects virtually stopped until congress passed the water resources development act ( wrda ) of 1986 , which addressed corps projects and policies .

federal water research and planning activities were also reduced during the early years of the reagan administration , which felt that states should have a greater role in carrying out such activities .

consistent with this outlook , president reagan abolished the water resources council , an umbrella agency established in 1968 to coordinate federal water policy and to assess the status of the nation's water resource and development needs .

congress subsequently scaled back several remaining authorized projects , changed repayment and cost - share structures , and passed laws that altered project operations and water delivery programs .

for example , in 1982 congress passed the reclamation reform act , which altered the bureau's water pricing policies for some users .

the act revised acreage limitation requirements and charges for water received to irrigate leased lands .

congress soon increased local entities' share in construction costs for corps water resource projects with passage of the 1986 wrda .

over the last decade , both the corps and the bureau have undertaken projects or programs aimed at mitigating or preventing environmental degradation due in part to the construction and operation of large water projects , while at the same time expanding water supply facilities .

the agencies have pursued these actions through administrative efforts and congressional mandates , as well as in response to court actions .

currently , the federal government is involved in several restoration initiatives including the florida everglades , the california bay - delta , and the columbia and snake river basins in the pacific northwest .

these initiatives have been quite controversial .

each involves many stakeholders at the local and regional level ( water users , landowners , farmers , commercial and sport fishermen , urban water suppliers and users , navigational interests , hydropower customers and providers , recreationists , and environmentalists ) and has been years in the making .

at the same time , demand for traditional or new water resource projects continues — particularly for ways to augment local water supplies , maintain or improve navigation , and control or prevent floods and shoreline erosion .

in addition , demand continues from some sectors for new or previously authorized large water supply projects ( eg , auburn and temperance flats dams , and sites reservoir , all in california ) .

for both the everglades and calfed , water supply facilities are included in proposals for restoration .

the 109 th congress is considering several water resource issues in legislation ranging from re - authorizing the bureau of reclamation's water recycling program , to individual project authorizations and agency policy changes ( eg , re - operation of water project facilities in the central valley of california and in the colorado and columbia river basins ) .

oversight of ongoing agency activities , such as water management in the klamath and san joaquin river basins , salton sea restoration , allocation of colorado river water supplies ( particularly within california ) , and calfed ( a program to carry out activities affecting the delta confluence of the san joaquin and sacramento rivers at the san francisco bay ) , may also be discussed .

the broader topic of whether to review federal water activities or establish a national water policy commission was discussed during the 108 th congress , and is also being addressed in the 109 th .

for example , h.r .

135 , which would establish a national water commission , passed the house and has been referred to the senate environment and public works committee .

funding and policy direction through the annual energy and water appropriations bill also influences the construction and operation of projects .
