president obama's fy2013 budget request for energy and water development was released in february 2012 .

the request totaled $33.7 billion , compared to the fy2012 appropriation of $32.7 billion ( plus $1.7 billion for disaster relief ) .

on april 25 , 2012 , the house appropriations committee reported out h.r .

5325 ( h.rept .

112-462 ) , with a total of $32.2 billion .

112-164 ) on april 26 , funding energy and water development programs at $33.4 billion .

the continuing appropriations resolution , 2013 ( p.l .

112-175 ) , signed into law september 28 , continues appropriations until march 27 , 2013 , for energy and water development programs at 0.612% above the fy2012-enacted levels , with two exceptions: doe's nuclear weapons activities program is funded at an annual rate of $7.577 billion , the amount requested for fy2013 , instead of the fy2012 rate of $7.214 billion , and the nuclear nonproliferation program was increased by $100 million over the fy2012 level of $2.296 billion to fund domestic uranium enrichment r&d .

 ( see nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship and nonproliferation and national security programs , below. ) .

on march 6 , 2013 , the house passed h.r .

933 , the fy2013 defense and military construction / va , full year continuing resolution .

the senate approved an amended version of the bill on march 20 , 2013 , and the house agreed to the senate amendment to h.r .

933 the next day .

the bill was signed into law on march 26 , 2013 ( p.l .

113-6 ) .

the act funds energy and water development accounts at the fy2012 enacted level for the rest of fy2013 , with some exceptions , and subject to the sequestration requirements of the budget control act which went into effect march 1 , 2013 .

 table 1 indicates the status of the fy2013 funding legislation .

cells will be filled in as the appropriations cycle progresses .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

the energy and water development bill provides funding for the civil program of the u.s. army corps of engineers , an agency in the department of defense with both military and civilian responsibilities .

under its civil works program , the corps plans , builds , operates , and maintains a wide range of water resources facilities .

the corps attracts congressional attention because its projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects , in addition to their water resource development purposes .

a number of recent changes have affected corps appropriations , including earmark moratoriums in both houses in the 112 th congress and reductions for some projects and classes of projects compared to previous years .

additionally , 2011 flooding events on the mississippi and missouri rivers and in the northeastern united states affected a number of corps projects and required reprogramming of corps funds .

in addition to the regular corps appropriation for fy2012 , congress appropriated $1.724 billion in supplemental funding for response and recovery related to these events .

 ( see table 4 . ) .

in most years , the president's budget request for the army corps of engineers is below the agency's enacted appropriation .

enacted appropriations for fy2012 continued this trend .

in contrast to most other agencies , the corps received an increase in total funding compared to the president's request .

the fy2012 enacted appropriation for the corps was $5.002 billion , or approximately $500 million more than the president's fy2012 request .

the president's fy2013 budget requested $4.731 billion for the corps , a decrease of $271 million from the fy2012 enacted level .

in its markup , the house appropriations committee recommended $4.814 billion for the corps , or $83 million more than the president's request .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $5.007 billion , or $276 million more than the president's budget request and $193 million more than the house .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs , as well as programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics .

the fy2012 appropriations act , p.l .

112-74 , funded doe programs at $26.3 billion .

for fy2013 , the obama administration requested $27.7 billion for doe programs .

the house appropriations committee recommended $26.1 billion .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $27.1 billion .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) requested $1.053 billion for fy2013 ( including $11 million for the inspector general's office ) , $15 million above fy2012 funding level .

major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users .

the house and senate appropriations committees recommended relatively small changes from the budget request ( see table 15 ) .

the nrc budget request includes $264.8 million for new reactor activities , nearly the same as the fy2012 level .

until 2007 , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s .

however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities and other generating companies to apply for licenses for 30 new reactors , although several license applicants have suspended work on their projects .

nrc issued combined construction and operating licenses for four new reactors at two sites in georgia and south carolina in early 2012 .

nrc's proposed fy2013 budget includes no funds for licensing doe's previously planned yucca mountain nuclear waste repository .

because the obama administration wants to cancel the yucca mountain project and filed a motion to withdraw the license application on march 3 , 2010 , the nrc's fy2011 appropriation was used to close out its licensing activities .

the house appropriations committee directed nrc to resume consideration of the yucca mountain application with prior - year funds .

the panel also cut $3.4 million for nrc's waste confidence rulemaking on the safety of on - site waste storage for up to 300 years , an effort that the committee said was designed "to provide cover for the administration's yucca mountain policy. .

in response to controversy over actions by nrc chairman gregory jaczko to halt the yucca mountain licensing process , the enacted fy2012 funding bill included a provision ( ยง401 ) that prohibits the nrc chairman from terminating "any program , project , or activity" without a majority vote by the nrc commission .

a majority commission vote would also be required to reprogram funds that were specifically included in the bill .

that language is continued in the house appropriations committee's fy2013 bill .

for regulation of operating reactors , nrc's fy2013 budget request includes $545.1 million , $10.4 million above the fy2012 level .

those activities include reactor safety inspections , license renewals and modifications , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises .

the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan increased congressional and public concern about the safety of u.s. nuclear power plants .

nrc established a task force 10 days after the accident to review nrc's regulatory system , and nrc issued the first regulatory orders resulting from that review on march 12 , 2012 .

the energy policy act of 2005 permanently extended a requirement that 90% of nrc's budget be offset by fees on licensees .

not subject to the offset are expenditures from the nuclear waste fund to pay for waste repository licensing , spending on general homeland security , and doe defense waste oversight .

the offsets in the fy2013 request would result in a net appropriation of $128.5 million , nearly the same as ( $100,000 below ) the fy2012 enacted level .
