2361 , the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations act for fy2006 , was enacted as p.l .

109-54 .

the law contained a total of $26.20 billion for interior , environment , and related agencies .

the law also contained $1.50 billion in supplemental funds to cover a shortfall in veterans health care resources .

on december 30 , 2005 , h.r .

2863 was signed into law as p.l .

109-148 .

the law affected funding levels enacted in p.l .

109-54 , through rescissions and emergency supplemental funds , which are not reflected in this report .

the fy2006 interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations law included funding for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments , as well as numerous related agencies and bureaus .

the law provided funding for department of the interior ( doi ) agencies ( except for the bureau of reclamation , funded in energy and water development appropriations laws ) , many of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs .

the law also provided funds for agencies in two other departments: for the forest service in the department of agriculture , and the indian health service in the department of health and human services , as well as funds for the environmental protection agency .

further , the fy2006 law included funding for arts and cultural agencies , such as the smithsonian institution , national gallery of art , national endowment for the arts , and national endowment for the humanities , and for numerous other entities and agencies .

in recent years , the appropriations laws for interior and related agencies provided funds for several activities within the department of energy ( doe ) , including research , development , and conservation programs ; the naval petroleum reserves ; and the strategic petroleum reserve .

however , at the outset of the 109 th congress , these doe programs were transferred to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water , to consolidate jurisdiction over doe .

at the same time , jurisdiction over the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , and several smaller entities , was moved to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering interior and related agencies .

this change resulted from the abolition of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs , housing and urban development , and independent agencies , which previously had jurisdiction over epa .

in the recent past , interior and related agencies appropriations acts typically contained two primary titles providing funding .

title i provided funds for interior agencies , and title ii contained funds for other agencies , programs , and entities .

the fy2006 appropriations law contained three primary titles providing funding .

this report is organized along the lines of the law .

accordingly , the first section ( title i ) provides information on interior agencies ; the second section ( title ii ) discusses epa ; and the third section ( title iii ) addresses other agencies , programs , and entities funded in the fy2006 law .

a fourth section of this report discusses cross - cutting topics that encompass more than one agency .

in general , in this report the term appropriations represents total funds available , including regular annual and supplemental appropriations , as well as rescissions , transfers , and deferrals , but excludes permanent budget authorities .

increases and decreases generally are calculated on comparisons between the funding levels enacted for fy2006 , requested by the president , recommended by the house and senate for fy2006 , and appropriated for fy2005 .

the house committee on appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report .

other sources of information include the senate committee on appropriations , agency budget justifications , and the congressional record .

in the tables throughout this report , some columns of funding figures do not add to the precise totals provided due to rounding .

finally , some of the doi websites provided throughout the report have not been consistently operational due to a court order regarding indian trust funds litigation .

nevertheless , they are included herein for reference when the websites are operational .

in the first session of 109 th congress , epa's funding was moved to the jurisdiction of the interior subcommittees beginning with the fy2006 appropriations .

this was the result of the abolition of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs , housing and urban development , and independent agencies , which previously had jurisdiction over epa .

epa's responsibilities have grown since it was established in 1970 , as congress has enacted an increasing number of environmental laws , as well as major amendments to these statutes .

the agency's primary responsibilities include the regulation of air quality , water quality , pesticides , and toxic substances ; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes ; and the cleanup of environmental contamination .

epa also awards grants to assist state , tribal and local areas in controlling pollution .

without adjusting for inflation , the agency's appropriation has risen from $1.0 billion when the agency was established in fy1970 to $8.03 billion in fy2005 .

for fy2006 , p.l .

109-54 provided $7.81 billion for epa , including $80.0 million in funds rescinded from past fiscal year appropriations .

in effect , the rescinded funds are an offset in the fy2006 appropriations resulting in a net appropriation of $7.73 million .

the rescissions of previous years appropriations are to be taken from grants , contracts , and interagency agreements for various program activities , whose availability under their original agreements has expired .

although included in the state and tribal assistance grants ( stag ) account , the joint explanatory statement in the conference report ( h.rept .

109-188 , p.112 ) emphasized that the provision applies to all epa appropriations accounts .

unlike the house - passed bill , neither text of p.l .

109-54 nor the joint explanatory statement specify redirecting the rescinded funds for specific epa activities for fy2006 .

the house - passed bill had specified that a rescission of $100.0 million in unobligated funds from past appropriations be used for increased support for the clean water state revolving fund ( srf ) under the stag account ( see discussion under " water infrastructure " in this epa section of the report ) .

the senate - passed bill included $58.0 million in "rescinded" previous year funds within the stag account but did not specify its allocation for fy2006 .

p.l .

109-54 contained significant increases for some activities and programs within each of the epa appropriations accounts , while calling for sizeable decreases or similar funding in other areas when compared to the president's fy2006 request and the fy2005 appropriations .
