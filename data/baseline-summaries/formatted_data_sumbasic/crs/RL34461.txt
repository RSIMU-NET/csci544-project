on march 11 , 2009 , the president signed the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 , h.r .

1105 ) .

the omnibus law contained regular appropriations for fy2009 of $27.59 billion for interior , environment , and related agencies .

in earlier action , on february 17 , 2009 , the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 , h.r .

1 ) .

this broad economic stimulus legislation contained $10.95 billion in emergency funds for fy2009 for some of the accounts within agencies typically funded by the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations laws .

taken together , the two laws provided a total of $38.54 billion for fy2009 .

the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments , as well as numerous related agencies and bureaus .

it provides funding for department of the interior ( doi ) agencies ( except for the bureau of reclamation , funded in energy and water development appropriations laws ) , many of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs .

the bill also provides funds for agencies in two other departments — the forest service in the department of agriculture , and the indian health service ( ihs ) in the department of health and human services — as well as funds for the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .

further , the annual bill includes funding for arts and cultural agencies , such as the smithsonian institution , national endowment for the arts , and national endowment for the humanities , and for numerous other entities and agencies .

in former years , the appropriations laws for interior and related agencies provided funds for several activities within the department of energy ( doe ) , including research , development , and conservation programs ; the naval petroleum reserves ; and the strategic petroleum reserve .

however , at the outset of the 109 th congress , these doe programs were transferred to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water , to consolidate jurisdiction over doe .

at the same time , jurisdiction over the epa and several smaller entities was moved to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering interior and related agencies .

this change resulted from the abolition of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs , housing and urban development , and independent agencies , which previously had jurisdiction over epa .

since fy2006 , appropriations laws for interior , environment , and related agencies have contained three primary titles .

this report is organized along these lines .

accordingly , the first section ( title i ) provides information on interior agencies ; the second section ( title ii ) discusses epa ; and the third section ( title iii ) addresses other agencies , programs , and entities .

a fourth section of this report discusses cross - cutting topics that encompass more than one agency .

entries in this report are for major agencies ( eg , the national park service ) and cross - cutting issues ( eg , everglades restoration ) that receive funding in the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill .

for each agency or issue , we discuss some of the key funding changes enacted for fy2009 , or proposed by the george w. bush administration , that have been of interest to congress .

we also address related policy issues that tend to occur in the context of considering appropriations legislation .

presenting such information in summary form is a challenge .

for example , budget submissions for some agencies number several hundred pages and contain innumerable funding , programmatic , and legislative changes for congressional consideration .

further , appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts , activities , and subactivities , and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information .

for information on programs funded in the bill but not directly discussed in this report , please contact the key policy staff members listed at the end of the report .

in general , in this report the term appropriations represents total funds available , including regular annual and supplemental appropriations , as well as rescissions , transfers , and deferrals , but excludes permanent mandatory budget authorities .

this report contains final fy2009 appropriations levels for agencies , programs , and activities as enacted in the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 , h.r .

1105 ) .

these funds generally are referred to as omnibus funds , or funds provided by the omnibus law .

increases and decreases generally are calculated on comparisons between these fy2009 omnibus funding levels and those requested by president bush for fy2009 and enacted for fy2008 .

an overview of emergency funding for fy2009 provided in broad economic stimulus legislation ( p.l .

111 - 5 , h.r .

1 ) is discussed in the introduction to this report .

this law contained additional fy2009 funding for some of the agencies and programs typically funded by the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill .

these funds also are discussed in the pertinent sections throughout the report , in both the text and accompanying tables .

they generally are referred to as stimulus funds , or funds provided by the stimulus law .

the house committee on appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report .

other sources of information include the senate committee on appropriations , agency budget justifications , and the congressional record .

references to the "explanatory statement" for the omnibus law refer to the statement published in the february 23 , 2009 , congressional record .

references to the "explanatory statement" for the stimulus law refer to the statement published in the february 12 , 2009 , congressional record , together with the tables published in the february 13 , 2009 , congressional record .

in the tables throughout this report , some columns of funding figures do not add to the precise totals provided due to rounding .

the epa's primary responsibilities are the regulation of air quality , water quality , pesticides , and toxic substances ; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes ; and the cleanup of environmental contamination .

epa also awards grants to assist states and local governments in complying with federal requirements to control pollution .

epa's funding over time generally has reflected an increase in overall appropriations to fulfill a rising number of statutory responsibilities .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law provided a total of $7.64 billion for epa .

this was an increase above president bush's request of $7.18 billion , and the $7.46 billion enacted for fy2008 .

although epa's appropriations increased overall , congress reduced funding for certain programs and activities within various accounts .

the stimulus law provided an additional $7.22 billion in fy2009 emergency supplemental appropriations for epa .

as discussed earlier in this report , the stimulus funds that epa and other agencies received in this act are subject to certain timing limitations , requirements , and conditions .

notably , epa must obligate the funds by the end of fy2010 ( september 30 , 2010 ) to speed the delivery of the funds for individual projects as a means to stimulate the economy , whereas appropriations for epa are usually available until expended by the agency .

including both the $7.64 billion in omnibus funds and the $7.22 billion in stimulus funds , congress appropriated a total of $14.86 billion for epa in fy2009 , doubling the funding that the agency has received in annual appropriations in recent years .

of the $7.22 billion , $6.00 billion was for grants to help states support their state revolving funds ( srfs ) that finance local water infrastructure projects .

the stimulus law provided $4.00 billion for the clean water srfs that finance wastewater infrastructure projects , such as municipal sewage treatment plant upgrades , and $2.00 billion for the drinking water srfs that finance drinking water treatment infrastructure projects .

these funds are in addition to the $689.1 million and $829.0 million in fy2009 omnibus appropriations provided for these srf grants , respectively .

congress appropriated the remaining $1.22 billion in stimulus funds for epa to pay for cleanup "remedial" projects at superfund sites ( $600.0 million ) ; to award grants for the cleanup of brownfields sites ( $100.0 million ) , the cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks ( $200.0 million ) , and projects to reduce emissions from diesel - powered vehicles , engines , and equipment ( $300.0 million ) ; and to support the agency's office of inspector general ( $20.0 million ) .

table 17 lists the eight statutory accounts that fund epa .

the table presents the fy2009 omnibus and stimulus appropriations enacted for each account , compared with president bush's fy2009 request , and appropriations enacted for fy2008 .

a breakout of these funds is provided for transfers between various epa accounts , and for selected grants within the state and tribal grants ( stag ) account in which there has been broad interest within congress .

altered natural flows of water by a series of canals , levees , and pumping stations , combined with agricultural and urban development , are thought to be the leading causes of environmental deterioration in south florida .

in 1996 , congress authorized the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) to create a comprehensive plan to restore , protect , and preserve the entire south florida ecosystem , which includes the everglades ( p.l .

104-303 ) .

a portion of this plan , the comprehensive everglades restoration plan ( cerp ) , was completed in 1999 , and provides for federal involvement in restoring the ecosystem .

congress authorized the corps to implement cerp in title iv of the water resources development act of 2000 ( wrda 2000 , p.l .

106-541 ) .

while restoration activities in the south florida ecosystem are conducted under several federal laws , wrda 2000 is considered the seminal law for everglades restoration .

 ( see crs report rs20702 , south florida ecosystem restoration and the comprehensive everglades restoration plan , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. ) .

appropriations for restoration projects in the south florida ecosystem have been provided to various agencies as part of several annual appropriations bills .

the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations laws have provided funds to several doi agencies for restoration projects .

specifically , doi conducts cerp and non - cerp activities in southern florida through the national park service , fish and wildlife service , u.s. geological survey , and bureau of indian affairs .

 ( for more on everglades funding , see crs report rs22048 , everglades restoration: the federal role in funding , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. ) .

from fy1993 to fy2009 , federal appropriations for projects and services related to the restoration of the south florida ecosystem exceeded $3.3 billion , and state funding topped $12.0 billion .

the average annual federal cost for restoration activities in southern florida in the next 10 years is expected to be approximately $286 million per year .

for fy2009 , $118.3 million was provided to doi for everglades restoration .

for fy2009 , $118.3 million was provided to doi for everglades restoration , an increase of $45.3 million over the fy2008 enacted level of $73.0 million and an increase of $48.9 million over the bush administration's request of $69.4 million .

additional funds for everglades restoration also were provided under the stimulus law .

detailed information on agency activities related to everglades restoration is provided in table 25 .

the primary difference in funding between fy2008 and fy2009 was for the modified water deliveries project ( mod waters ) .

specifically , the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $60.0 million for mod waters , a $45.7 million increase from the fy2008 enacted level .

see table 25 .

this funding was in addition to $50.0 million provided to the corps for fy2009 .

mod waters is designed to improve water deliveries to everglades national park , and to the extent possible , restore the natural hydrological conditions within the park .

the completion of this project is required prior to the construction of certain projects under cerp .

funding and planning for the tamiami trail portion of the project is being conducted by the corps .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law provided that funding in the law , as well as any prior acts , for the implementation of mod waters shall be made available to the corps to implement a project regarding the tamiami trail , as described in the limited reevaluation report with integrated environmental assessment and addendum ( lrr ) .

this report details a project to increase water flows southward to everglades national park by creating a 1-mile bridge on tamiami trail and increasing the height of a canal by one foot .

the project is expected to cost $227 million .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law also directed the secretary of the interior , acting through the national park service , to evaluate the feasibility of additional bridge length ( i.e. , additional bridges and longer bridges ) beyond what is to be constructed under the lrr , to restore natural flows of water to everglades national park .

the feasibility study and recommendation for additional bridge length are to be submitted to congress no later than march 11 , 2010 .

the level of commitment by the federal government to implement restoration activities in the everglades continues to receive attention .

some observers measure commitment by the frequency and number of projects authorized under cerp , and the appropriations they receive .

because only two restoration projects have been authorized since wrda 2000 , these observers are concerned that federal commitment to cerp implementation is waning .

others assert that the federal commitment will be measurable by the amount of federal funding for construction , expected when the first projects break ground in the next few years .

some state and federal officials contend that federal funding will increase compared to state funding as cerp projects move beyond design into construction .

still others question whether the federal government should maintain the current level of funding , or increase its commitment , because of escalating costs and project delays .

phosphorus is one of the primary water pollutants in the everglades and a primary cause for ecosystem degradation .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law did not contain a provision regarding phosphorus mitigation that had been included in recent appropriations laws .

specifically , from fy2004-fy2008 , interior appropriations laws conditioned funding for the modified water deliveries project based on meeting state water quality standards .

funds appropriated in the laws and any prior laws for mod waters would be provided unless administrators of four federal departments / agencies ( secretary of the interior , secretary of the army , administrator of the epa , and the attorney general ) indicate in their joint report that water entering the a.r.m .

loxahatchee national wildlife refuge and everglades national park do not meet state water quality standards , and the house and senate committees on appropriations respond in writing disapproving the further expenditure of funds .

these provisions were enacted based on concerns regarding a florida state law ( chapter 2003-12 , enacted on may 20 , 2003 ) that amended the everglades forever act of 1994 ( florida statutes §373.4592 ) by authorizing a new plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the everglades .

the lwcf ( 16 u.s.c .

§§460 l - 4 , et seq. ) .

is authorized at $900 million annually through fy2015 .

however , these funds may not be spent without an appropriation .

the lwcf is used for three purposes .

first , the four principal federal land management agencies — bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , national park service , and forest service — draw primarily on the lwcf to acquire lands .

the sections on each of those agencies earlier in this report identify funding levels and other details for their land acquisition activities .

second , the lwcf funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the nps , sometimes referred to as stateside funding .

third , the clinton and bush administrations had requested , and congress appropriated , money from the lwcf to fund some related activities .

this third use is relatively recent , starting with the fy1998 appropriation .

programs funded have varied from year to year .

most of the appropriations for federal acquisitions generally are specified for management units , such as a specific national wildlife refuge .

the appropriations for the state grant program and other related activities rarely have been specified for individual projects or areas .

from fy1965 through fy2009 , about $32 billion was credited to the lwcf .

roughly $15 billion of that amount has been appropriated .

throughout history , annual appropriations from lwcf have fluctuated considerably .

the omnibus appropriations law contained a total of $275.3 million for the land and water conservation fund for fy2009 .

this was 8% higher than the fy2008 level ( $255.1 million ) but 21% less than the bush administration's request for fy2009 ( $348.7 million ) .

the law included funds for federal land acquisition , the stateside program , and other purposes , as discussed below .

of the total appropriations for fy2009 , $152.2 million was for federal land acquisition .

this was an 18% increase over fy2008 ( $129.1 million ) and more than three times the administration's request of $41.5 million for fy2009 .

the administration had requested an additional $8.0 million for land appraisals related to federal land acquisition .

from a low of $111.9 million for fy2006 , funding for federal land acquisition increased each year to $152.2 million for fy2009 .

the variability of funding for this activity reflects a tension regarding the extent of federal land ownership .

table 26 shows recent funding for lwcf .

the omnibus appropriations law provided $19.0 million for fy2009 for stateside grants .

this figure was comprised of $19.0 million for state grants , $1.0 million for program administration , and a $ - 1.0 million cancelation of prior year funds .

over the past decade ( since fy2000 ) , stateside funding has ranged from a high of $143.9 million in fy2002 to a low of $19.0 million in fy2009 .

the bush administration did not request funds for new stateside grants in fy2009 ; similarly , there was no administration request for stateside grants for fy2006 through fy2008 .

the bush administration had asserted that state and local governments have alternative sources of funding for parkland acquisition and development .

the administration also concluded that the current program could not adequately measure performance or demonstrate results , and is not central to nps's core functions .

for fy2009 , the administration did request a relatively small amount of funding for administration of the grant program─$1.4 million .

however , the funds were not sought from lwcf , but instead from nps's national recreation and preservation line item which funds administration of other grants .

seeking to eliminate funds for new stateside grants is not a new phenomenon .

for example , for several years the clinton administration proposed eliminating stateside funding , and congress concurred .

through provisions of the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-432 ) , a portion of revenues from certain ocs leasing are provided ( without further appropriation ) to the stateside grant program .

an estimated $8.2 million in revenue from such ocs leasing was projected to be collected in fy2008 and disbursed to the stateside program in fy2009 .

the omnibus appropriations law contained $104.1 million for two other programs .

of the total , $54.7 million was provided for fws cooperative endangered species grants and $49.4 million was for the fs forest legacy program .

the fy2009 total was similar to the fy2008 appropriation ( $101.3 million ) but about one - third of what the bush administration had requested for fy2009 ( $299.2 million ) .

in addition to the two programs that were funded , president bush had sought funds for fy2009 for several other programs within the department of the interior and the forest service .

the bush administration typically requested a much larger amount for other programs than was appropriated .

nevertheless , for each year from fy2004 through fy2007 , the largest portion of the lwcf appropriation was for other programs , as shown in table 26 .

this changed in fy2008 , when the largest portion of the lwcf appropriation was for land acquisition , as was the case for fy2009 .

table 27 shows the other programs for which congress appropriated funds for fy2006 through fy2009 or for which president bush requested funds for fy2009 .

any non - lwcf funds provided to these programs is not reflected here .

crs report rl33531 , land and water conservation fund: overview , funding history , and current issues , by [author name scrubbed] .

wildfire protection programs and funding continue to be controversial .

ongoing discussions include questions about the high cost of fire suppression efforts ; locations for various fire protection treatments ; and whether , and to what extent , environmental analysis , public involvement , and legal challenges to administrative decisions hinder fuel reduction and post - fire rehabilitation activities .

the fs and doi wildfire line items include funds for fire suppression , preparedness , and other operations .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law provided $2.99 billion for the fs and doi wildland fire management accounts .

see table 28 .

this was an increase of $164.4 million ( 6% ) from the bush administration's fy2009 request , and an increase of $239.7 million ( 9% ) from fy2008 regular appropriations .

for fy2009 , the fs received $2.13 billion , $155.0 million ( 8% ) more than the request .

doi received $859.5 million , $9.4 million ( 1% ) more than the request .

the fy2009 budget request also proposed transferring the doi wildfire appropriation from the bureau of land management , which traditionally had transferred wildfire funds to the other doi agencies , to the office of the secretary — department - wide programs ; the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law accepted this change .

 ( for historical background , descriptions of activities , and analysis of wildfire expenditures , see crs report rl33990 , wildfire funding , by [author name scrubbed]. ) .

fy2008 funding also included $1.71 billion of emergency wildfire appropriations — $500.0 million in p.l .

110-116 ( $329.0 million for the fs and $171.0 million for doi ) , $300.0 million in title v of p.l .

110-161 ( $222.0 million for the fs and $78.0 million for doi ) , and $910.0 million in p.l .

110-329 ( $775.0 million for the fs and $135 million for doi ) .

in addition , the fy2009 economic stimulus law provided an additional $515.0 million ( $500.0 million for the fs and $15.0 million for blm ) for reducing fuel levels on federal and nonfederal lands , and for related activities .

the omnibus appropriations law included $1.33 billion for fy2009 wildfire suppression — for fighting wildfires — matching the bush administration's request .

this was an increase of $193.7 million ( 17% ) above the fy2008 regular appropriations .

this included an increase of $148.3 million ( 18% ) for the fs and of $45.4 million ( 16% ) for doi .

the amounts were based on the 10-year average of suppression obligations , adjusted for inflation .

however , the appropriations were less than the total of fire suppression plus emergency and contingent funding in four of the past five years .

further , emergency wildfire funding for fy2008 totaled $1.71 billion , of which $1.28 billion was for fire suppression ( or repaying funds previously borrowed for fire suppression ) .

in its report on the fy2008 appropriations bill , the house appropriations committee expressed continued concern with the high costs of large fires , and provided direction to the fs and doi on examining , reducing , and reporting on the costs of large fire incidences ( h.rept .

110-187 , p. 139 ) .

the federal land assistance , management , and enhancement ( flame ) act , h.r .

1404 and s. 561 , have been introduced to modify the funding structure for severe fires , to reduce the borrowing that has affected other agency programs .

the omnibus appropriations law included $956.8 million for fy2009 for wildfire preparedness — equipment , training , baseline personnel , prevention , and detection .

this was an increase of $90.7 million ( 10% ) from the request and of $14.5 million ( 2% ) from fy2008 .

the bush administration had proposed a decrease of $77.4 million ( 12% ) for fs preparedness , but congress increased preparedness funding for both agencies .

in their reports on the fy2008 appropriations bill , the appropriations committees had recommended an increase in preparedness funding .

for instance , the senate committee had asserted that cutting preparedness funds would not save money , but rather shift expenditures to suppression ( s.rept .

110-91 , p. 15 ) .

other wildland fire operations include funds for an array of activities — burned area rehabilitation , fuel reduction , research , and assistance to states and private entities .

the omnibus appropriations law included $705.2 million for fy2009 for other operations , an increase of $73.7 million ( 12% ) from the fy2009 requests and of $31.4 million ( 5% ) from fy2008 regular appropriations .

however , the increases were not spread evenly among the activities .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations law included $31.8 million for burned area rehabilitation — $20.3 million for doi and $11.5 million for the fs .

this was a decline of $4.0 million ( 16% ) from the blm's fy2009 requested appropriations and an increase of $11.5 million from the request for no specific fs site rehabilitation funds .

fs funds for emergency burned area rehabilitation can be drawn from suppression funding , while additional funds to restore burned areas are provided in the various accounts for the national forest system .

emergency funds totaling $131.0 million — $100.0 million for the fs and $31.0 million for doi — also were enacted for fy2008 to supplement burned area rehabilitation .

fuel reduction was a bush administration focus , to implement the healthy forests restoration act of 2003 ( p.l .

108-148 ) and the national fire plan .

the omnibus appropriations law included $531.1 million for fuel reduction , $31.3 million ( 6% ) more than was requested ( $499.8 million ) and $21.4 million ( 4% ) more than enacted for fy2008 ( $509.7 million ) .

emergency funds totaling $265.0 million ( $255.0 million for the fs and $10.0 million for doi ) also were enacted for fy2008 for fuel reduction , with as much as $155.0 million of the fs funds available for fuel reduction on nonfederal lands .

in addition , the fy2009 economic stimulus law contained an additional $515.0 million for activities including fuel reduction .

of this , $15.0 million was for the blm and $500.0 million was for the fs , with half of the fs funds for use on federal lands and half for use on state and private lands .

the omnibus appropriations law maintained or increased wildfire appropriations for fire research in fy2009 .

doi funding for the joint fire science program received $6.0 million , 50% above the request and nearly the same as the fy2008 level .

fs funding for the joint fire science program was $8.0 million as requested , and above the fy2008 level .

funding for fs fire plan research and development was increased to $23.9 million , $1.9 million ( 9% ) above the request and 2% above the fy2008 level .

the fs also funds fire research in its research line item , but the amount of general forestry research for fire is not distinguished in the budget documents .

the omnibus appropriations law significantly increased fy2009 fs fire assistance funding , to $91.2 million .

this was $11.5 million ( 14% ) more than enacted for fy2008 and $23.9 million ( 36% ) more the president bush's request .

relative to the administration's request , the fy2009 amount included an increase for fs forest health management on federal lands ( 21% ) , a modest decrease for forest health management on nonfederal lands ( 1% ) , an increase for volunteer fire assistance ( 13% ) , and a significant increase ( $20.0 million , 57% ) for state fire assistance .

the omnibus law also restored proposed cuts in state and private forestry funding for these programs .

 ( see state and private forestry under "department of agriculture: forest service," above. ) .

doi funding for community assistance , proposed to be terminated by the bush administration , was increased to $7.0 million , up $1.1 million ( 19% ) from fy2008 .

p.l .

110-116 provided $500.0 million in emergency wildfire appropriations for fy2008 , with $329.0 million for the fs and $171.0 million for doi .

the funds were for several purposes: $110.0 million for fs emergency wildfire suppression and $40.0 million for doi emergency wildfire suppression ; $100.0 million for repayment of fs accounts and $115.0 million for repayment of doi accounts from which funds were borrowed during fy2007 for wildfire suppression ; $80.0 million for fs fuels reduction and hazard mitigation activities ( including $30.0 million available for activities on nonfederal lands ) and $10.0 million for doi fuels reduction ; $25.0 million for fs rehabilitation and restoration of lands and $6.0 million for doi rehabilitation and restoration of lands ; and $14.0 million for reconstruction / construction of fs facilities .

in addition , title v of the fy2008 interior appropriations act ( division f of p.l .

110-161 ) provided another $300.0 million for emergency wildfire suppression — $222.0 million for the fs and $78.0 million for doi .

finally , p.l .

110-329 ( the consolidated security , disaster assistance , and continuing appropriations act , 2009 ) provided $910.0 million in emergency wildfire appropriations for fy2008 — $775.0 million for the fs and $135.0 million for doi .

as with p.l .

110-116 emergency funding , the money was directed for several purposes: $500.0 million for fs emergency wildfire suppression ( including at least $300.0 million to repay fy2008 borrowings and at least $100.0 million to repay previous borrowings ) and $110.0 million for doi emergency wildfire suppression and repayment of borrowed funds ; $75.0 million for fs rehabilitation and restoration of burned lands and $25.0 million for doi burned area rehabilitation ; $175.0 million for fs fuels reduction ( including $125.0 million available for activities on nonfederal lands ) ; and $25.0 million for fs preparedness for retention initiatives for high risk areas with recurrent staffing shortages .
