the public health service act ( phsa ) establishes authority for a wide range of activities that directly or indirectly affect the health of the u.s. population .

in title vii , health professions education , the phsa supports an education and training pipeline for professionals and pre - professionals to work in the medical , dental , public health , and allied health professions .

title vii provides support to both institutions and individuals .

it supports institutions to expand the capacity to build and sustain the health workforce through training programs , mainly through grant awards and contractual agreements .

for example , institutions may receive title vii grants to implement residency programs at medical and dental schools ; recruitment and retention initiatives in community - based educational settings ; and health workforce data collection activities within state health departments .

it supports individuals by providing them with direct assistance to support academic preparation in the health professions through scholarships , loans , loan repayments , and fellowships .

many title vii programs and activities were reauthorized in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) .

the aca also created the national health care workforce commission for federal health workforce planning , and state health care workforce development grants .

the aca also made sweeping changes to health care financing and delivery by restructuring the private health insurance market and setting minimum standards for health insurance coverage .

beginning in 2014 , the aca mandates that most u.s. citizens obtain health insurance or pay a penalty .

health policy experts expect this mandate combined with additional changes will increase health insurance coverage to be accompanied by a likely increased demand for health services and health care providers .

title vii represents one among several federal efforts to support the development of the health workforce .

these authorities , enacted in various statutes , are established to achieve different purposes and consequently receive different levels of support .

for example , in fy2012 , the medicare graduate medical education ( gme ) payments contribute approximately $8.9 billion annually to residents' salaries , teaching compensation , and other direct costs .

the medicare direct gme program is the largest source of federal support for health workforce development , followed by the medicaid gme payments ( both state and federal ) , which were $1.1 billion in fy2011 .

medicare and medicaid gme payments support education and training mainly for physicians .

by comparison , title vii programs contributed approximately $266 million in fy2012 ( the president's fy2014 request is for approximately $212 million ) to education and training activities for physicians , physician assistants , dentists , therapists , and other health professionals .

the text box below highlights other examples of federal support to develop or sustain the health workforce .

this report describes programs and activities authorized in title vii of the phsa .

it is divided into two major sections .

the first section summarizes the intents and purposes of title vii , as well as eligibility requirements for institutions interested in applying for title vii grants , contracts , and agreements , and for individuals applying for direct assistance .

the second part of the report provides details on each section within the title , including statutory requirements and preferences .

references to "the secretary" mean the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) unless otherwise specified .

appendix a summarizes two aca provisions that are title vii - related .

title vii consists of six parts that authorize grants , contracts , and agreements to institutions , or direct assistance to individuals .

grants and contracts to institutions support education and training activities for individuals in the medical , dental , public health , and allied health workforce , and support health workforce data collection and analysis .

direct assistance to individuals provides scholarships , loans , and loan repayments to those pursuing health professions education and training .

also , this title authorizes health workforce advisory groups and councils to monitor and assess related programs and activities .

part a specifies requirements for agreements between the secretary of hhs and eligible institutions that establish and operate federally - supported school loan funds .

school loan funds are created to support students pursuing a full - time course of study in health professions schools .

in providing for school loan funds , part a establishes preferences for primary care medical students and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds .

part b authorizes programs to increase the diversity of the health workforce .

part c authorizes grants to establish capacity - building programs in primary care medicine and dentistry , and it establishes an advisory committee to report on those activities .

part d authorizes programs to support recruitment and retention activities ; community - based interdisciplinary groups ; and capacity building within geriatrics and the allied health professions ; and authorizes an advisory committee on interdisciplinary collaboration .

part e establishes the national center for health workforce analysis and authorizes the council on graduate medical education .

it authorizes grants and contracts to institutions to support health workforce data collection , reporting , and analysis .

also , part e authorizes programs and funds to support education and training in the public health professions .

part f specifies requirements that title vii participants must adhere to , including preferences , prohibitions against sex discrimination , permissible use of funds , and matching fund requirements .

various entities are eligible to receive title vii grants and contracts .

those entities include health professions schools , academic health centers , states , local governments , and other public or private nonprofit and for - profit groups .

they must meet general eligibility requirements and , in some cases , specific requirements to qualify for a grant or contract .

an example of a general eligibility requirement is that an institution must be accredited by an association that is recognized by the secretary .

an example of a specific eligibility requirement is that a program must collaborate with the secretary to develop curricula and research and demonstration projects developed under another title .

individuals who are employed or studying in the health professions may be eligible for title vii support , either directly or indirectly .

undergraduate or graduate students , medical residents , and professional school faculty are examples of individuals who may be eligible to participate in a program that receives institutional support .

also , individuals may qualify to receive direct assistance in the form of scholarships , loans , or loan repayments if they are studying or have studied in an eligible title vii profession .

some title vii programs establish preferences for certain individuals , such as those belonging to an underrepresented minority group .

table 1 summarizes title vii by part .

parts are presented in the order that they appear in the phsa .

title vii authorizes a broad range of programs and activities to develop and sustain the education and training pipeline for the health care workforce .

the next section of this report describes each part of title vii , part a through part f .

part a consists of two subparts .

subpart i establishes the health education assistance loan ( heal ) program , which from 1978 to 1998 provided federally insured loans to health professions students to pay for their education costs .

subpart ii authorizes requirements for school - administered student loan funds , which provide direct assistance to health professions students to pay for their education costs .

each subpart establishes requirements for the borrowing and lending process .

the text box below briefly explains selected terms and concepts related to that process .

subpart i establishes the health education assistance loans ( heal ) program .

from 1978 through 1998 , the heal program insured loans to health professions students .

it enabled students in medicine , dentistry , osteopathy , veterinary medicine , optometry , and podiatry to borrow amounts up to $80,000 over the course of study .

students enrolled in health professions programs , including pharmacy and chiropractic medicine , were allowed to borrow up to $50,000 over a course of study .

refinancing of heal program loans continued through fy2004 .

currently , congressionally appropriated funds support the administration of outstanding loans .

according to hrsa , the heal program maintains oversight for an outstanding loan portfolio valued at $609 million some of which may not be fully repaid until 2037 .

subpart ii establishes requirements for health professions institutions that operate title vii student loan funds .

section 721 authorizes the secretary to enter into agreements with health professions schools to establish and operate student loan funds .

a student loan fund must provide for deposit into the fund of federal capital contributions , and other collections and earnings such as interest payments .

the federal capital contribution must be used to establish a direct account that provides loans to students .

student borrowers replenish the loan fund when they repay loans with interest .

section 722 specifies provisions for administering the federally supported loan programs .

it provides terms and conditions for the loan , including maximum loan amounts , repayment , interest rates , collections , and prohibitions .

maximum loan amounts for a school year may not exceed the cost of attendance ( which includes tuition and other reasonable educational and living expenses ) .

an exception is that third - and fourth - year medical school students may borrow additional loan amounts that are needed to pay off additional qualified loan balances related to medical school attendance .

borrowers may repay loans in equal or graduated periodic installments over a payment period that is between 10 and 25 years .

liability to repay the unpaid loan balances and accrued interest is cancelled if the borrower dies , or if the borrower has become permanently and totally disabled .

loans must bear an interest rate of 5% per year on the unpaid balance of the loan , and computed only for periods for which the loan is repayable .

loans are not transferable to another school except if the borrower transfers to another school participating in a title vii loan program .

the secretary is authorized to collect any student loan that is in default .

collected amounts must be deposited into the school's student loan fund .

civil actions regarding student loans must be referred to the attorney general .

the period for which the secretary may file a suit , or take other action to collect loan repayment , is exempt from statutory limits .

section 723 requires a medical student who is a borrower to complete a residency training program in primary health care within four years after graduating from the health professions school .

the borrower must practice in primary health care for 10 years ( including a primary care residency ) or through the date on which the loan is fully repaid .

however , some students may be exempt from these requirements , depending on the date of their first loan , or the type of the federal capital contribution supporting the loan .

if borrowers fail to comply with these obligations , an interest rate of 2% per year above the base interest rate must be applied to their loan .

there are two conditions under which the secretary may waive a student's obligation: ( 1 ) the student terminates before graduation from the school , whether voluntarily or involuntarily , and ( 2 ) the individual does not , after such termination , resume attendance at the school or begin attendance at any other school of medicine or osteopathic medicine .

section 724 specifies requirements for loan funds for students from disadvantaged backgrounds .

participating schools must be carrying out recruitment and retention programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds , and for minority faculty .

the secretary is required to define the term "disadvantaged," and to give special consideration to health professions schools that have enrollments of underrepresented minorities above the national average for health professions schools .

health professions schools must carry out the above activities no later than one year after the date on which the first federal capital contribution is made to the school , and continue those activities throughout the period that the student loan fund is operational .

schools that enter into agreements to establish student loan funds are required to provide that any federal capital contribution will be used to make loans to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds , and to cover collection costs and interest on the loan .

part b establishes grant support for health workforce "pipeline" programs , including interventions that target underrepresented minorities and individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds .

part b authorizes programs for ( 1 ) centers of excellence ( coe ) ; ( 2 ) scholarships for disadvantaged students ; ( 3 ) loan repayments and fellowships for faculty positions ; ( 4 ) educational assistance in the health professions for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds ; and ( 5 ) grants to institutions to support individuals who are entering the health professions pipeline .
