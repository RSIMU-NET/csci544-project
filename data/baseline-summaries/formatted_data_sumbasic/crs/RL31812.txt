for example , in thefy2003 act title ii contained funding for the john c. stennis center for public service trainingand development and the congressional award act .

congress changed the structure of the annual legislative branch appropriations bill effective in fy2003 .

prior to enactment of the fy2003 bill , and effective in fy1978 , the legislative branchappropriations bill was divided into two titles .

title i , congressional operations , contained budgetauthorities for activities directly serving congress .

included in this title were the budgets of thehouse , the senate , joint items ( joint house and senate activities ) , the office of compliance , thecongressional budget office ( cbo ) , the architect of the capitol ( aoc ) ( except the library ofcongress ( loc ) buildings and grounds ) , the congressional research service ( crs ) within thelibrary of congress , and congressional printing and binding activities of the government printingoffice ( gpo ) .

title ii , related agencies , contained budgets for activities not directly supporting congress .

included in this title were budgets of the botanic garden , the library of congress ( except thecongressional research service ) , the library buildings and grounds maintained by the architect ofthe capitol , the government printing office ( except congressional printing and binding costs ) , andthe general accounting office ( gao ) .

periodically since fy1978 , the bill contained additionaltitles for such purposes as capital improvements and special one - time functions .

in addition to activities funded in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill , there are legislative budget authorities that include permanent budget authority for both federal funds and trustfunds , and non - legislative entities .

permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action .

 ( 1 ) permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose .

trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority .

they are included in the u.s. budget either as budgetreceipts or offsetting collections .

 ( 2 ) the budget also contains non - legislative entities within the legislative branch budget .

they are funded in other appropriation bills , but are placed in the legislative section by the office ofmanagement and budget for bookkeeping purposes .
