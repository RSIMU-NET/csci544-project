two separate bills are advancing in the 111 th congress that together could provide nearly $4 billion of supplemental funds for agricultural programs .

table 1 shows the agriculture - related provisions in these bills — h.r .

4213 , commonly known as the "tax extenders" bill ; and h.r .

4899 , a supplemental appropriations bill for war spending and disaster response .

the tax extenders bill ( h.r .

4213 ) would provide comparatively large amounts totaling up to $3.6 billion for agriculture - related programs .

both the house and senate have passed versions of the bill .

rather than resolving differences in a conference committee , the house and senate are trading substitute amendments .

the house - passed version from may 28 , 2010 , includes $1.48 billion for agricultural disaster assistance , $1.15 billion for a settlement of the pigford lawsuit against the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) for past racial discrimination , $868 million to extend biodiesel tax credits for one year , and $190 million to extend a conservation tax deduction for one year .

the senate - passed version from march 10 , 2010 , does not contain funding for the pigford settlement , but does include the other provisions , which total $2.5 billion .

the other measure , the war supplemental appropriations bill ( h.r .

4899 ) , would provide smaller appropriations for other agricultural programs , as well as rescind prior appropriations from various agricultural accounts .

the house and senate are trading amendments to reconcile difference between each chamber's version of the bill .

the most recent house - passed version , from july 1 , 2010 , contains $1.4 billion for agriculture before rescissions , including $1.15 billion for the pigford settlement ( duplicated from h.r .

4213 because of procedural uncertainty about whether pigford will remain in the tax extenders bill ) , $150 million for p.l .

480 food for peace , $50 million for the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) , $32 million for the farm loan program to support an additional $950 million of loans , $18 million for emergency forest restoration , and additional authorities to raise fees for the section 502 rural housing loan guarantee program .

the senate - passed version from may 27 , 2010 , contains $200 million for agriculture before rescissions , including identical provisions for the loan programs and forestry , but does not have the pigford or tefap funding .

rescissions from agriculture programs are significant in the most recent house - passed version of h.r .

4899 , totaling $1.0 billion .

the house bill would rescind $487 million from reserve funds for the supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) , $422 million from rural development ( including $300 million of rural broadband funding from the american recovery and reinvestment act ) , and $70 million from unobligated balances from the natural resources conservation service .

both the house and senate bills would offset $50 million by limiting mandatory outlays for the biomass crop assistance program ( bcap ) .

after rescissions , the net cost of the agriculture provisions is $371 million in the most recent house - passed version of h.r .

4899 , and $150 million in the senate - passed version .

both bills await further floor action to resolve differences between the chambers .

in december 2009 , the original house - passed version of the "tax extenders" bill , h.r .

4213 , had two agricultural - related tax provisions: biodiesel tax credits .

section 401 would extend until december 31 , 2010 , retroactively , the expiration date for three biodiesel tax credits ( biodiesel tax credit , small agri - biodiesel producer credit , and renewable diesel tax credit ) .

these credits expired on december 31 , 2009 .

the joint tax committee estimates that these extensions would cost $634 million in fy2010 and $235 million in fy2011 .

conservation tax deduction .

section 131 of the original house - passed bill would extend until december 31 , 2010 , retroactively , the expiration date for contributions of capital gain real property made for a qualified conservation purpose .

a previous extension in the 2008 farm bill expired on december 31 , 2009 .

the joint tax committee estimates that the provision will cost $23 million in fy2010 , and $190 million over 10 years .

the senate - passed version from march 10 , 2010 ( h.r .

4213 , a senate amendment to the house bill ) , includes both of the tax provisions above , plus emergency agricultural disaster assistance .

agricultural disaster assistance .

section 245 of the senate - passed version of h.r .

4213 would provide $1.48 billion of agricultural disaster assistance to be paid from the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) .

the assistance includes about $950 million in direct payments to producers of program crops for 2009 crop losses in counties designated as primary natural disaster areas .

unlike prior - year disaster assistance , payments would be available for losses as small as 5% .

payments also would be allowed for producers with losses for specialty crops ( a $300 million grant program to states ) , cottonseed ( $42 million ) , and aquaculture ( $25 million ) , as well as for a hawaiian sugarcane cooperative ( $21 million ) .

poultry producers would be allowed no - interest emergency loans for losses due to contract terminations with poultry integrators ( an unspecified amount of loans supported by $75 million of budget authority ) .

also , the bill provides an additional $50 million for grazing losses in 2009 by altering the payment criteria for livestock forage disaster payments .

usda would receive $10 million for administrative costs .

the creation of "permanent" agricultural disaster programs ( eg , sure , the supplemental revenue assistance payments program ) in the 2008 farm bill was meant to forestall the need for this type of ad hoc disaster assistance .

biodiesel tax credits .

section 102 of the senate - passed version contains the same extension to december 31 , 2010 , as the house version above .

conservation tax deduction .

section 114 of the senate - passed version contains the same extension to december 31 , 2010 , as the house version above .

instead of going to a conference committee , a subsequent house amendment to the senate amendment was passed by the house on may 28 , 2010 , to address differences between the chambers .

it contains essentially the same agricultural disaster assistance and both of the tax extensions , and adds money for a settlement of the pigford discrimination case against usda .

agricultural disaster assistance .

section 604 of the house - passed amendment provides effectively identical disaster relief language as in the senate - passed version above .

pigford settlement .

section 608 of the house - passed amendment provides $1.15 billion of discretionary funds for a final settlement of the pigford lawsuit against usda for past racial discrimination in the farm loan programs .

this appropriation supplements $100 million of mandatory funds that were provided in the 2008 farm bill , and thus would provide a total of $1.25 billion .

the 2008 farm bill permitted any claimant in the original pigford decision from 1999 who had not previously obtained a determination to petition in civil court for a determination .

on february 18 , 2010 , udsa and the department of justice announced a $1.25 billion settlement of these so - called pigford ii claims .

the administration requested the funds shortly after the settlement in february , but the house amendment to h.r .

4213 posted on may 20 would be the first bill to provide funds .

a march 31 , 2010 , deadline for congress to appropriate $1.15 billion has passed , giving the plaintiffs a right to void the february settlement .

but because the settlement is a priority for usda and the white house , and efforts are proceeding for the appropriation , plaintiffs have not exercised their right to void the settlement .

biodiesel tax credits .

section 202 of the house - passed amendment contains the same extension to december 31 , 2010 , as the versions above .

conservation tax deduction .

section 224 of the house - passed amendment contains the same extension to december 31 , 2010 , as the versions above .

during senate consideration of amendments to the house version during june , there was difficulty reaching agreement over the budget impact of the bill , and a desire for more offsets rather than emergency spending .

this began to jeopardize the prospects that the ancillary provisions such as the agricultural disaster and pigford funding would remain in the bill .

the original house - passed version of h.r .

4899 from march 24 , 2010 — the other vehicle carrying supplemental appropriations for agriculture — did not provide any supplemental funding for agriculture .

but it did contain two rescissions from agricultural accounts that would have provided $465 million of offsets for other programs in the bill .

women , infants and children ( wic ) .

the march 24 , 2010 , house - passed bill would have rescinded $361.8 million of unobligated funds that were placed in reserve for the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) .

the arra provided $500 million to wic , "of which $400,000,000 [were] placed in reserve to be allocated as the secretary deems necessary , ... to support participation should cost or participation exceed budget estimates. .

rural development programs .

the march 24 , 2010 , house - passed bill would have rescinded $102.7 million in budget authority from prior - year rural development appropriations ( other than through arra ) that were designated as emergency .

besides arra , the only emergency appropriations in rural development have been for the "water and waste water" facilities account .

these were provided to help rural communities rebuild or restore their water infrastructure after natural disasters such as hurricanes , droughts , and floods .

the rescission would sweep unobligated disaster funds from several different prior - year emergency appropriations .

the senate passed its version of h.r .

4899 , the supplemental appropriations act , 2010 , on may 27 , 2010 .

this bill included $200 million of gross new budget authority and other provisions for several usda programs .

after offsets , the cost of the agricultural programs would be $150 million for the following programs .

p.l .

480 "food for peace" title ii grants .

usda's foreign agricultural service would receive an additional $150 million ( to supplement the fy2010 base of $1.69 billion ) for food for peace ( p.l .

480 ) title ii humanitarian food aid grants .

the supplemental responds to the january 2010 earthquake in haiti .

report language ( s.rept .

111-188 ) also encourages usda to use existing funds in the bill emerson humanitarian trust if future food deliveries are complicated by transportation or other logistical difficulties .

farm loan program .

usda has been facing higher loan demand during the financial crisis because commercial lenders have constrained their own lending practices .

some usda farm loan offices in the states have begun to deplete their fy2010 allocation to make loans .

nationally , some loan programs have used 80% - 90% of the their fiscal year allocation in seven months .

the senate - passed version of the supplemental would allow usda's farm service agency to issue an additional $950 million in loans and guarantees ( on top of a nearly exhausted fy2010 base of $5.1 billion ) .

this additional loan authority would cost $32 million in budget authority ( $31 million for loan subsidy plus $1 million for administrative expenses , on the fy2010 loan subsidy base of $141 million ) .

table 2 shows the specific amounts that would be provided to the various direct and guaranteed farm loan programs .

emergency forest restoration program .

usda's farm service agency would receive $18 million for a cost - share program to restore nonindustrial private forest land that is damaged by a natural disaster occurring after january 1 , 2010 .

the senate provision provides expedited rulemaking procedures to facilitate implementation of this 2008 farm bill program , which has yet to begin or receive any appropriation .

rural development .

usda's rural housing service would receive authority for an additional $697 million in loan guarantee authority ( on the fy2010 base of $12 billion of loan guarantees ) for the section 502 single - family housing guaranteed loan program .

the cost of providing these additional guarantees would be offset by raising the guarantee fees charged to commercial banks for guarantees they receive on section 502 loans to homeowners ( from 1% to 3.5% of the principal of new loans being guaranteed ) .

the increase in fees is permanent ; the increase in loan authority is temporary .

therefore , this guaranteed loan program would be able to operate in the future with less subsidy .

demand for single - family housing loan guarantees was heavy in fy2009 during the financial crisis .

by april of fy2010 , heavy demand had depleted the large increase in guarantee authority over fy2009 levels ( from $6.2 billion in fy2009 to $12 billion in the regular fy2010 appropriation ) .

biomass crop assistance program ( bcap ) .

in current law , the bcap is authorized to receive "such sums as necessary" of mandatory funds from the ccc .

the 2008 farm bill created bcap to encourage the production of cellulosic feedstocks for advanced biofuels .

incentives are available for harvest and post - production storage and transportation .

in its march 2010 baseline , cbo projects that bcap will need $602 million of budget authority in fy2010 and $432 million in fy2011 .

the senate - passed supplemental appropriation would create a "change in mandatory program spending" ( chimp ) by allowing no more than $552 million in fy2010 and $432 million in fy2011 .

the difference between the cbo baseline estimates and the limits placed in the supplemental would create an estimated savings of $50 million in fy2010 and no change in fy2011 ( assuming the supplemental is enacted before the final rule to implement the program is adopted and participants enroll ) .

food and nutrition service .

the senate report language accompanying the bill ( s.rept .

111-188 ) directs usda's food and nutrition service ( fns ) to review whether there is any need to reprogram funds within fns for use through the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) because of heavy demand on food banks and commodity assistance programs .

no additional budget authority is provided to implement this recommendation .

to resolve differences with the senate version , the house subsequently passed amendments to the senate version on july 1 , 2010 .

h.res .

1500 adopted all of the provisions in the senate - passed version described above and made additional supplemental appropriations and rescissions .

the additions to the senate version in this most recent house - passed version include: pigford settlement .

the house version from july 1 , 2010 , adds $1.15 billion for the pigford settlement .

this is duplicated from h.r .

4213 because of procedural uncertainty about whether pigford will remain in the tax extenders bill .

emergency food assistance .

the house version adds $50 million for the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) to purchase food for distribution through local food networks .

rescissions .

in addition to the $50 million offset from bcap in the senate - passed version above , the most recent house - passed version contains $979 million of other rescissions from agriculture accounts .

supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) .

the house version would rescind $487 million from reserve funds for wic , including $362 million from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) and $125 million of other reserve funds .

the first of these two wic rescissions was in the original house bill ; the second is new to the july version of the bill .

rural development programs .

the most recent house version would rescind a total of $422 million from rural development .

this includes $300 million of rural broadband funding from the arra ( out of $2.5 billion appropriated for rural broadband in arra ) , and $122 million in budget authority from prior - year rural development appropriations ( other than through arra ) that were designated as emergency .

as discussed for the original house version , these latter rescissions are for water and wastewater facilities accounts appropriated for prior natural disasters .

natural resources conservation service .

the house bill would rescind $70 million from unobligated prior - year balances from the natural resources conservation service .
