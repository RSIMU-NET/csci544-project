r apid growth in leveraged lending , a relatively complex form of credit , in the current economic expansion has raised concerns with some policymakers because they have noted similarities between leveraged lending and mortgage lending and mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) markets in the lead - up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis .

this report explains how leveraged lending works ; identifies the borrowers , lenders , and investors who participate in the market ; and examines the characteristics of a leveraged loan .

it then explains the characteristics of collateralized loan obligations ( clos ) âsecurities backed by cash flow from pools of leveraged loansâand their investors .

understanding clos is crucial to a discussion of the policy issues surrounding leveraged lending because more than 60% of investment in leveraged lending occurs through clos .

the report also provides data on trends and investor composition .

once these basics are explained , the report explores the regulation ofâand some of the potential risks posed byâleveraged lending and clos .

finally , it discusses how policymakers have addressed leveraged lending issues to date .

put simply , leveraged lending refers to loans to companies that are highly indebted ( in financial jargon , highly leveraged ) .

conceptually , a leveraged loan is understood to be a relatively high - risk loan made to a corporate borrower , but there is no consensus definition of leveraged lending for measurement purposes .

instead , different observers or industry groups use various working definitions that may refer to the borrower's corporate credit rating or a ratio of the company's debt to some measure of its ability to repay that debt , such as earnings or net worth .

because they are high risk , leveraged loans typically have relatively high interest rates , and thus offer higher potential returns for lenders .

investors can hold leveraged loans by either ( 1 ) investing directly in individual leveraged loans , typically through syndications and participations or ( 2 ) investing in clos .

institutions that directly hold large shares of outstanding leveraged loans include mutual funds ( 19% ) , banks ( 8% ) , and insurance companies ( 6% ) , as shown in figure 2 .

according to one study , mutual fund holdings are split fairly evenly between funds offered to institutional investors and funds offered to retail investors .

nearly all of the remainder of leveraged loans ( 62% ) are held by clos .

portions , or tranches , of clos are then sold , largely to the same types of investors that invest directly in leveraged loans .

clos will be discussed in more detail in the next section .

as discussed above , banks' share of funding in the leveraged loan market has exhibited a long - term decline .

collateralized loan obligations are securities backed by portfolios of corporate loans .

although clos can be backed by a pool of any type of business loan , in practice , u.s. clos are primarily backed by leveraged loans , according to the federal reserve .

the outstanding value of u.s. clos has grown from around $200 billion at year - end 2006 to $617 billion at year - end 2018 .

as noted above , about 60% of leveraged loans are held in clos .

clos offer a way for investors to receive cash flows from many loans , instead of being completely exposed to potential payments or defaults on a single loan .

to isolate financial risks , clos are structured as bankruptcy - remote special purpose vehicles ( spvs ) that are separate legal entities .

each clo has a portfolio manager , who is responsible for constructing the initial portfolio as well as the clo's ongoing trading activities .

clo managers are primarily banks , investment firms ( including hedge funds ) , and private equity firms .

clos are sold in separate tranches , which give the holder the right to the payment of cash flow on the underlying loans .

the different tranches are assigned different payment priorities , so some will incur losses before others .

this tranche structure redistributes the loan portfolios' credit risk .

the tranches are often known as senior , mezzanine , and equity tranches , in order from highest to lowest payment priority , credit quality , and credit rating .

through this process , the loan portfolio's risks are redistributed to the lower tranches first , and tranches with higher credit ratings are formed .

in general , the financial industry views clos' tranched structure as an effective method for providing economic protection against unexpected losses .

as figure 3 illustrates , in the event of default , the lower clo tranches would incur losses before others .

hence , tranches with higher payment priority have additional protection from losses and receive a higher credit rating .

the pricing of the tranches also reflects this difference in asset quality and credit risk , with lower tranches offering potentially higher returns to compensate for greater risks taken .

clos are often sold to institutional investors , including asset managers , banks , insurance companies , and others .

the asset management industry , which includes hedge funds and mutual funds , mainly holds the riskier mezzanine and equity tranches , and banks and insurers hold most of the lower - risk senior clo tranches .

the federal reserve estimated that u.s. investors held approximately $556 billion in clos based on u.s. loans at the end of 2018 .

of this , an estimated $147 billion in u.s. clo holdings were issued domestically .

detailed data on domestic clos' holders are not available ; certain detailed data , however , can be found in the reporting of cross - border financial holdings , which comprise a large majority of u.s. clos .

the cross - border financial reporting indicates that $409 billion of u.s. clo holdings were issued in the cayman islands , apparently the only offshore issuer .

figure 4 provides an overview by investor type for domestic holdings of these clos .

the rapid growth of leveraged lending has led to concerns that this source of credit could dry up in the next downturn .

a slowdown in leveraged loan issuance could pose challenges for the ( primarily ) nonfinancial companies relying on leveraged loans for financing .

were these firms to lose access to financing , they could be forced to reduce their capital spending , among other operational constraints , if they were unable to find alternative funding sources .

capital spending ( physical investment ) by businesses is typically one of the most cyclical components of the economy , meaning it is highly sensitive to expansions and recessions .

overall borrowing by nonfinancial firms is historically high at present .

this raises concerns that heavily indebted firms could experience a debt overhang âwhere high levels of existing debt curtail a firm's ability to take on new debtâin the next downturn .

if a debt overhang at nonfinancial firms leads to a larger - than - normal reduction in capital spending or more corporate failures , this might exacerbate the overall downturn .

if a downturn in the leveraged loan market had a negative effect on financial stability , as discussed in the next section , negative effects on the overall economy could be greater .

leveraged loans and clos pose potential risks to investors and overall financial stability .

some risks , such as potential unexpected losses for investors , are presented by both leveraged loans and clos .

some apply to only one , such as risks posed by securitization presented by clos .

this section considers the risks posed by both , highlighting differences between the two where applicable .

risks to investors .

like any financial instrument , leveraged loans and clos pose various types of risk to investors .

in particular , they pose credit risk âthe risk that loans will not be repaid in full ( due to default , for example ) .

credit risk is heightened because the borrowers are typically relatively indebted , have low credit ratings , and , in the case of covenant - lite loans , certain common risk - mitigating protections have been omitted .

the ways borrowers often use the funds raised from leveraged loans , such as for leveraged buyouts , can also be high risk .

nevertheless , the overall risk of leveraged loans should not be exaggeratedâleveraged loans have historically had lower default rates and higher recovery rates in default than high - yield ( junk ) bonds , another form of debt issued by financially weaker firms .

credit risk is mitigated to a certain degree because leveraged loans are typically secured and their holders stand ahead of the firm's equity holders to be repaid in the event of bankruptcy .

furthermore , leveraged loans typically have floating interest rates , so interest rate risk is borne by the borrower , not the investor .

as mentioned in the "what are clos ? .

section , when leveraged loans are securitized and packaged into clos , the credit risk of the original leveraged loans is redistributed by the clos' tranched structure , with senior tranches ( mostly held by banks and insurers ) often receiving the highest credit rating ( eg , aaa ) and junior tranches ( mostly held by hedge funds and other asset managers ) receiving lower credit ratings .

subordinated debt and equity positions provide additional protection to the senior tranches .

tranching distributes clo credit risk differently across investors in different tranches .

up to this point in the credit cycle , the risks associated with leveraged loans and clos have largely not materializedâleveraged loan default rates have been relatively low because of low interest rates and robust business conditions .

but some analysts fear that default rates could spike if economic conditions worsen , interest rates rise , or bothâand these possibilities may not have been properly priced in .

default rates on leveraged loans rose from below 1% to almost 11% during the last recession .

an unanticipated spike in default rates would impose unexpected losses on leveraged loan and clo holders .

systemic risk .

investment losses associated with changing asset values , by themselves , are routine in financial markets across many types of assets and pose no particular policy concern if investors have the opportunity to make informed decisions .

the main policy concern is whether leveraged loans and clos pose systemic risk ; that is , whether a deterioration in leveraged loans' performanceâparticularly if it were large and unexpectedâcould lead to broader financial instability .

this depends on whether channels exist through which problems with leveraged loans could spill over to cause broader problems in financial markets .

losses on leveraged loans or liquidity problems with leveraged loans could lead to financial instability through various transmission channels discussed below .

during the financial crisis , problems with mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) demonstrated how a class of securities can pose systemic risk .

similar to clos , mbs are complex , opaque securities backed by a pool of underlying assets that are typically tranched , with the senior tranches receiving the highest credit rating .

unexpected declines in housing prices and increases in mortgage default rates revealed that mbsâboth highly rated and lowly rated tranchesâhad been mispriced , with the previous pricing not accurately reflecting the underlying risks .

the subsequent repricing led to a cascade of systemic distress in the financial system: liquidity in the secondary market for mbs rapidly declined and fire sales pushed all mbs prices even lower .

mbs losses caused certain leveraged and interconnected financial institutions , including banks , investment firms , and insurance companies , to experience capital shortfalls and lose access to the short - term borrowing markets on which they relied .

ultimately , these problems caused financial panic and a broader decline in credit availability as financial institutions deleveraged âreducing new lending activity to restore their capital levelsâin response to mbs losses .

the resulting reduction in credit in turn caused a sharp decline in real economic activity .

clos today share some similarities with mbs before the crisis , but there are important differences .

similarities include the rapid growth in available credit and erosion of underwriting standards .

both types of securities are relatively complex and opaque , potentially obfuscating the underlying assets' true risks .

outstanding leveraged loans and clos are small relative to overall securities markets , which in isolation is prima facie evidence that they pose limited systemic risk , even if they were to become illiquid or subject to fire sales .

however , before the financial crisis , policy concerns were mainly focused on potential problems in subprime mortgage markets , which were also relatively small .

nevertheless , problems with subprime mortgages turned out to be the proverbial tip of the iceberg , as the deflating housing bubble caused losses in the much - larger overall mortgage market .

analogously , a disruption in the leveraged lending market could create spillover effects in related asset classes , similar to how problems that started with subprime mortgages eventually spread to the entire mortgage market and nonmortgage asset - backed securities in the financial crisis .

ultimately , the underlying cause of the mbs meltdown was the bursting of the housing bubble .

despite the high share of business debt to gross domestic product ( gdp ) at present , experts are divided on whether there is any underlying asset bubble in corporate debt markets ( analogous to the housing bubble ) that could lead to a destabilizing downturn .

in addition , it is not clear whether unexpected losses in leveraged lending would lead to broader systemic deleveraging by financial firms or problems for systemically important institutions .

losses on leveraged loans or clos might not cause problems for leveraged financial institutions , such as banks , because ( 1 ) their leveraged loan and clo holdings are small relative to total assets and limited mostly to aaa tranches ; and ( 2 ) banks face higher capital and liquidity requirements to protect against losses or a liquidity freeze , respectively , than they did before the crisis .

furthermore , the largest holders of leveraged loans and clos are asset managers .

they generally hold these assets as agents on their clients' behalf and thus are normally not vulnerable to insolvency from asset losses because those losses are directly passed on to account holders , who own the assets .

another source of systemic risk relates to a liquidity mismatch for certain holders .

there is potentially an incentive for investors in leveraged loan mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( etfs ) , respectively , to redeem their shares on demand for cash or sell their shares during episodes of market or systemic distress , similar to a bank run .

because the underlying leveraged loans and clos are illiquid , investors who are first to exit could limit their losses if they redeem them while the fund still has cash on hand and is not forced to sell the underlying assets at fire sale prices .

this incentive could act as a self - fulfilling prophecy , as the incentive to run could cause mass redemptions that then force fire sales that reduce the fund's value .

leveraged loan mutual funds generally allow withdrawal on demand , but other run risk may be limited because "u.s. clos are not required to mark - to - market their assets , and early redemption by investors is generally not permissible" and other private investment funds , such as hedge funds , often feature redemption restrictions .

although the financial crisis is a cautionary tale , there are other historical examples where a sudden shift in an asset class's performance did not lead to financial instability .

for example , a collapse in the junk bond market following a spike in defaults from 1989 to 1990 did not pose problems for the broader financial system or economy .

in addition , while clo issuance slowed during the last financial crisis , the rating agency and data provider standard & poor's reports that clo default rates remained low and "no tranches originally rated aaa or aa experienced a loss" throughout the crisis .

however , the amount of clos outstanding was much smaller then compared to now , and product features have changed over time .

more recently , in december 2018 , relatively large investor withdrawals from bank loan mutual funds did not result in instability in the leveraged loan market .

the goals of financial regulation , and the tools used to achieve those goals , vary based on the type of financial institution , market , or instrument involved .

thus , to answer this question , it is useful to break down leveraged loan regulation by the type of institution and activity ( issuance , investment , and securitization ) .

leveraged lending falls under the purview of multiple regulators with different regulatory approaches and authorities .

this regulatory fragmentation could encourage activities to migrate to less - regulated sectors , limits the official data available , and may complicate the evaluation and mitigation of any potential systemic risk to financial stability associated with leveraged lending .

following the 2007-2009 financial crisis , the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) , an interagency council of regulators headed by the treasury secretary , was created to address threats to financial stability and issues where regulatory fragmentation hinders an effective policy response .

in its 2018 annual report , fsoc recommended that the financial regulators "continue to monitor levels of nonfinancial business leverage , trends in asset valuations , and potential implications for the entities they regulate. .

outside of monitoring risk , fsoc has not , to date , recommended any regulatory or legislative changes to address leveraged lending .

bank regulators use guidance to provide clarity to banks on supervision , such as how supervisors treat specific activities in their exams .

in 2013 , the federal bank regulators jointly issued an updated 15-page guidance document that described their "expectations for the sound risk management of leveraged lending activities. .

subsequently , banks asserted that following the guidance constrained them from making sound loans and that regulators enforced the guidance as if it were a binding regulation .

as opposed to guidance , a regulation can be issued only if the agency follows the administrative procedure act's requirements ( 5 u.s.c .

â§551 et seq .

 ) , including the notice and comment process and other relevant requirements .

under the congressional review act ( cra ; p.l .

104-121 ) , regulators must submit new regulations and certain guidance documents to congress , which can then prevent a regulation or guidance from taking effect by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval .

because the bank regulators appeared to have the view that the document did not meet the cra's definition of "rule," they did not submit it to congress .

in 2017 , senator pat toomey asked the government accountability office ( gao ) to analyze the guidance and determine whether it qualified as a rule subject to cra review .

gao concluded that the guidance is a rule subject to cra review .

following gao's determination , the bank regulators reportedly sent letters to congress indicating they would seek further feedback on the guidance , and federal reserve chairman jerome powell indicated at a hearing on february 27 , 2018 , that the federal reserve has emphasized to its bank supervisors that the guidance was nonbinding .

the comptroller of the currency , joseph otting , reportedly stated in 2018 that the guidance provides flexibility for leveraged loans that do not meet its criteria , provided banks operate in a safe and sound manner .

to date , no changes have been made to the guidance and no joint resolution of disapproval under the cra has been introduced .

the congressional research service has been unable to locate a submission of the guidance to congress following the gao finding that it was required under the cra .

the house financial services committee held a hearing on june 4 , 2019 , entitled emerging threats to stability: considering the systemic risk of leveraged lending .

two unnumbered draft bills related to leveraged lending were considered at this hearing .

the draft leveraged lending data and analysis act would require the office of financial research , a treasury office that supports fsoc , to gather information , assess risks , and make recommendations in a report to congress on leveraged lending .

the draft leveraged lending examination enhancement act would require the federal financial institutions examination council ( ffiec ) , an interagency council of federal bank regulators , to set prudential standards for leveraged lending by depository institutions .

it would also require the ffiec to report quarterly on leveraged lending by depository institutions .
