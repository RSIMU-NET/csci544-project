in an effort to expand the options for health coverage , 35 states have established high risk health insurance pools .

these programs target individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market , primarily due to preexisting health conditions .

high risk pools ( hrps ) generally cover people who have sought health coverage in the individual ( nongroup ) market , but have been denied coverage , received quotes from insurers that are higher than the premiums offered by the high risk pools , or received offers from insurers that permanently exclude coverage of preexisting health conditions .

many states also use their high risk pools to comply with the portability and guaranteed availability provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa , p.l .

104-191 ) .

for eligible individuals moving from the group to nongroup market , hipaa requires state - licensed health insurers to make coverage available to such individuals , and prohibits exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions .

to enforce these rules , states are given a choice .

they may either enforce the hipaa individual market guarantees ( "federal fallback" ) , or establish an "acceptable alternative state mechanism," such as a high risk health insurance pool .

in general , state high risk pools tend to enroll a small percentage of the uninsured .

for example , approximately 200,000 individuals were enrolled in the 34 high risk pools in operation in 2008 .

in contrast , the government accountability office ( gao ) estimated that nearly 4 million additional persons were potentially eligible for enrollment .

however , such limited enrollment reflects , in part , the narrow focus of these pools: individuals with preexisting health conditions , who do not have access to public or group health insurance , and seek coverage in the private , non - group market .

in addition to state - established high risk pools , the 111 th congress passed the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , which president obama signed into law ( p.l .

111-148 ) on march 23 , 2010 .

ppaca , as amended , requires the secretary of health and human services to establish a temporary high risk pool program , prior to 2014 , to provide health insurance coverage to certain individuals with preexisting health conditions who have been uninsured for six or more months .

this report will focus on the original , state - established high risk pools .

currently , 35 states have high risk health insurance pools .

states have a great deal of discretion regarding the establishment and operation of these pools , including covered benefits , eligibility requirements , pre - existing condition exclusion periods , and funding sources .

given that state high risk pools typically operate at a loss ( see discussion above ) , the federal government has provided financial assistance to states during the past several years .

congress established a grant program , administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , to provide seed grants to states that did not already have high risk pools but wanted to establish them , and operational and bonus grants to existing state pools .

once congress appropriates funding for these grants , cms announces the funding opportunity and collects and reviews applications .

a state may receive up to $1 million in seed grant funding ; operational grant amounts are determined by formula .

 ( not all states with existing hrps receive grants. ) .

with enactment of the trade act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-210 ) , the federal government provided funding to state high risk pools for the first time .

the trade act authorized and appropriated $20 million in the form of seed grants .

each qualifying state could receive up to $1 million to support the creation and implementation of a high risk pool .

in 2003 , cms awarded seed grants to six states: maryland ( $1 million ) , new hampshire ( $1 million ) , ohio ( $150,000 ) , south dakota ( $1 million ) , utah ( $52,618 ) , and west virginia ( $1 million ) .

the trade act also authorized and appropriated $80 million to be split evenly over fy2003 and fy2004 to defray some of the operating losses experienced by states with existing high risk pools .

each operational grant could cover up to 50% of a pool's operating losses for the year .

to qualify , each state must have established a high risk pool that restricts premiums to no more than 150% of the premium for standard risk rates in the state , offers a choice of two or more coverage options , and has in effect a mechanism designed to ensure continued funding of losses incurred after the end of fy2004 .

however , states may still be able to determine , within federal standards , how much to charge enrollees in out - of - pocket costs , what benefits to include under the plans , how long coverage for preexisting conditions may be excluded , and whom among otherwise uninsurable individuals will be eligible .

table 1 shows which states received operational grants for fy2003 and fy2004 , and the funding levels .

nineteen states were awarded operational grants in fy2003 ; 22 states in fy2004 .

with expiration of authorizing legislation for the grant program , the house passed h.r .

4519 , the state high risk pool funding extension act of 2006 , on december 17 , 2005 .

h.r .

4519 reauthorized federal grants to state high risk pools through fy2010 , and changed the funding formula used for such grants .

the formula for operational grants was changed to the following: 40% to all qualifying states in equal amounts , 30% based on state proportion of uninsured population among all qualifying states , and 30% based on state proportion of the high risk pool population .

h.r .

4519 also allowed operational grants to cover up to 100% of pool losses and authorized the following amounts for fy2006: $15 million for seed grants and $75 million for operational and bonus grants .

the senate passed h.r .

4519 without amendment on february 1 , 2006 , and president bush signed it into law ( p.l .

109-172 ) on february 10 , 2006 .

as part of the budget reconciliation process , the senate passed s. 1932 , the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) conference agreement .

dra included provisions that would provide specific appropriations for the grants authorized under h.r .

4519 .

section 6202 of the senate measure amended the public health service act to provide $90 million in appropriations for grants to states for fy2006 .

dra provided $75 million for operational grants and $15 million for seed grants .

the grants are distributed according to existing statutory requirements .

this measure also included conforming language on enactment of h.r .

4519 .

pursuant to h.res .

653 , the house agreed to the senate - amended bill on february 1 , 2006 .

on february 8 , 2006 , president bush signed dra into law ( p.l .

109-171 ) .

the appropriations provided under dra were used to extend federal funding for this program .

on september 30 , 2006 , cms awarded seed grants to five states that wanted either to establish high risk pools or conduct feasibility studies: california ( $150,000 ) , new york ( $150,000 ) , north carolina ( $150,000 ) , tennessee ( $1 million ) , and vermont ( $1 million ) .

that same year , cms awarded grants to 31 states that experienced operational losses in 2005 .

of those 31 states , 25 also received bonus grants , exhausting the entire appropriations for operational and bonus grants .

table 2 shows which states received operational and bonus grants .

because the funding for seed grants was not exhausted with the 2006 awards , cms awarded five seed grants in 2007 .

the states that received these grants were the district of columbia ( $150,000 ) , florida ( $150,000 ) , georgia ( $150,000 ) , north carolina ( $850,000 ) , and rhode island ( $150,000 ) .

pursuant to the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) , congress made additional funding available for grants to state high risk pools .

cms issued a grant notification letter to states on may 1 , 2008 .

it stated that a total of $49,127,000 would be split to fund operational grants ( two - thirds of the appropriated amount ) and bonus grants ( remaining one - third ) .

applications were due by june 9 , 2008 .

on july 21 , 2008 , cms announced that 30 states received grants totaling $49 , 126,500 .

table 3 shows which states received grants and the combined grant amounts .

the omnibus appropriations act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ) provided $75,000,000 for grants to state high risk pools .

cms announced the availability of these grants in may 2009 .

on september 30 , 2009 , cms awarded operational grants to 31 states and bonus grants to 28 states ( see table 4 ) .

furthermore , the consolidated appropriations act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-117 ) provided $55,000,000 in additional appropriations for high risk pools .

the 111 th congress passed the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , which president obama signed into law ( p.l .

111-148 ) on march 23 , 2010 .

ppaca , as amended , requires the secretary of health and human services to establish a temporary high risk pool program , prior to 2014 , to provide health insurance coverage to certain individuals with preexisting health conditions who have been uninsured for six or more months .

states can run the program or elect to have the department of health and human services ( hhs ) operate the program in their states .

the majority of states ( 29 states and dc ) contracted to operate their own hrps .

hhs administers the hrps in 21 states , under the pre - existing condition insurance plan ( pcip ) name .
