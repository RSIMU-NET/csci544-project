rs21293 - - terrorist nuclear attacks on seaports: threat and response updated january 24 , 200 .

terrorists have tried to obtain weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) - - chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclearweapons .

while it would probably be more difficult for terrorists to obtain or fabricate a nuclear weapon than otherwmd , an attack using a nuclear weapon merits consideration because it would have much higher consequence .

u.s.seaports could be targets for terrorist attack .

a terrorist hiroshima - sized nuclear bomb ( 15 kilotons , the equivalentof15,000 tons of tnt ) detonated in a port would destroy buildings out to a mile or two ; start fires , especially in a portthat handled petroleum and chemicals ; spread fallout over many square miles ; disrupt commerce ; and kill manypeople .

many ports are in major cities .

by one estimate , a 10- to 20-kiloton weapon detonated in a major seaportwould kill 50,000 to 1 million people and would result in direct property damage of $50 to $500 billion , losses duetotrade disruption of $100 billion to $200 billion , and indirect costs of $300 billion to $1.2 trillion .

 ( 1 ) terrorists might try to smuggle a bomb into a u.s. port in many ways , but containers may offer an attractive route .

acontainer is a metal box , typically 8 ft wide by 8ï¿½ ft high by 20 ft or 40 ft long , that can be used on and movedbetween a tractor - trailer , a rail car , or a ship .

much global cargo moves by container .

nearly 9 million containersayear enter the united states by ship .

 ( 2 ) customs andborder protection ( cbp ) screens data for all containers , andreportedly inspects about 6 percent of them .

 ( 3 ) containers could easily hold a nuclear weapon .

many believe thatports and containers are vulnerable .

an fbi official stated , "the intelligence that we have certainly points to theportsas a key vulnerability of the united states and of a key interest to certain terrorist groups...." ( 4 ) cbp commissionerrobert bonner believes an attack using a nuclear bomb in a container would halt container shipments , leading to"devastating" consequences for the global economy .

..." ( 5 ) people can , however , find ways to minimize economicproblems .

terrorist nuclear weapons: routes to a bomb .

a terrorist group might obtain a bomb , perhaps with the yield of the hiroshima bomb , by several plausible routes .

russia .

strategic ( long - range ) nuclear weapons are reportedly well guarded on missiles or , thanks in part to u.s. assistance , in storage .

in contrast , thousands of shorter - rangelower - yield weapons intended for use in combat are less well secured , and numbers and locations are uncertain .

 ( see crs report rl32202 , nuclear weapons in russia: safety , security , and control issues . ) .

a fear is thatterroristsmight buy or steal one of these weapons along with information on how to bypass any use - control devices .

pakistan .

u.s. , british , chinese , french , and israeli nuclear weapons are thought to be well guarded .

control is less certain for india and pakistan .

reports indicate that pakistanis aidednuclear programs in iran , libya , and north korea , and there are concerns about the security of pakistani nuclearweapons if president musharraf were assassinated .

 ( 6 ) build a bomb .

the hiroshima bomb was a "gun assembly" weapon .

its nuclear explosive was a gun barrel about 6 inches in diameter by 6 feet long .

it was capped at each end , withstandard explosive at one end , a mass of uranium highly enriched in the isotope 235 ( highly enriched uranium , orheu ) next to the explosive , and a second heu mass at the other end .

detonating the explosive shot one mass ofheu into the other , rapidly assembling a mass large enough to support a fission chain reaction .

 ( plutonium cannotbeused. ) .

this is the simplest type of nuclear weapon .

u.s. scientists had such high confidence in the design that theydid not test the hiroshima bomb .

experts agree that terrorist groups could not make special nuclear material ( snm,i.e. , fissile plutonium or heu ) .

many believe that a terrorist group with access to heu and key skills could buildacrude nuclear weapon .

five former los alamos nuclear weapons experts held that such a weapon "could beconstructed by a group not previously engaged in designing or building nuclear weapons , providing a number ofrequirements were adequately met. .

 ( 7 ) a nationalresearch council study stated: "the basic technical informationneeded to construct a workable nuclear device is readily available in the open literature .

the primary impedimentthatprevents countries or technically competent terrorist groups from developing nuclear weapons is the availability ofsnm , especially heu. .

 ( 8 ) many believe it would behard for a terrorist group to obtain enough heu for a weapon ; others fear that terrorists could do so .

the national research council study rated the threat level from snm fromrussia as "high - - large inventories of snm are stored at many sites that apparently lack inventory controls andindigenous threats have increased. .

 ( 9 ) .

the main approach to reducing vulnerability to a terrorist nuclear attack is defense in depth - - using multiple methodsto detect and interdict a weapon .

it would be harder to evade several methods than one: attempts to evade one maymake a bomb more visible to another or reduce the odds that the bomb would work .

defense in depth also seekstopush detection and interdiction far from u.s. shores .

this section illustrates the scope of effort .

 ( see crs report rl31733 , port and maritime security: background and issues for congress , and crs report rs21283 , homelandsecurity: intelligence support. ) .

programs to secure nuclear weapons and materials .

one report saw securing "existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials" as "the most critical and cost - effective steptoprevent nuclear terrorism. .

 ( 10 ) to this end , thedepartment of energy ( doe ) operates the materials protection,control , and accounting program ( mcp&a ) to secure fissile materials in former soviet republics , and thedepartment of defense operates the cooperative threat reduction program to secure nuclear weapons there .

inmay2004 , doe announced the global threat reduction initiative to secure fissile and other radioactive materialworldwide .

 ( see crs report rl31957 , nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance: u.s. programsin theformer soviet union. ) .

other international programs .

 ( 1 ) the international atomic energy agency has safeguards to protect , among other things , heu in nuclear reactors .

 ( 2 ) a joint effort by that agency,theunited states , and russia moved heu from a shut - down nuclear reactor in bulgaria to russia for conversion to asafer form of uranium .

 ( 11 ) ( 3 ) on may 31 , 2003,president bush announced the proliferation security initiative , underwhich the united states and allies "have begun working on new agreements to search planes and ships carryingsuspect cargo and to seize illegal weapons or missile technologies. .

reports claim one such interdiction may haveinfluenced libya's decision to end its wmd programs .

 ( 12 ) ( 4 ) cbp's container security initiative started in january2002 .

csi involves bilateral agreements with foreign ports that export to this nation .

cbp teams work with hostgovernments to identify high - risk containers for screening for wmd before they are loaded onto ships .

csioperatedin 34 ports in january 2005 .

 ( 13 ) ( 5 ) under themegaports initiative , mcp&a provides radiation detection equipmentand expertise to cbp for screening containers in foreign ports .

 ( 6 ) the u.n.'s international maritime organizationpromulgated the international ship and port facility security code , effective july 1 , 2004 , which requires portoperators , ship owners , and others to improve maritime security , such as by creating plans to respond to terroristattack .

u.s .

domestic programs .

various programs seek to strengthen the security of u.s. ports .

as of late 2004 , dhs had reportedly distributed about $560 million in port security grantsinthe past few years .

 ( 14 ) the maritime transportationsecurity act ( mtsa ) of 2002 ( p.l .

107-295 ) requires ( sec.102 ) assessments of the vulnerability of vessels and u.s. maritime facilities "that may be involved in a transportationsecurity incident," a plan for deterring and responding to such an incident , assessment of the effectiveness ofantiterrorism measures at certain foreign ports , etc .

cbp is implementing the automated commercial environment,an electronic system to gather and analyze data on goods entering the united states to help select containers forinspection .

on december 21 , 2004 , president bush reportedly issued "maritime security policy," national securitypresidential directive 41 / homeland security presidential directive 13 .

while the text has apparently not beenreleased as of mid - january 2005 , a report indicates that it requires dhs to set standards for maritime recoveryoperations in the event of a terrorist attack .

it also requires creation of a maritime security policy coordinatingcommittee , development of a national strategy for maritime security , integration of global maritime intelligence,coordination of domestic and international outreach , and creation of a comprehensive plan for maritime supply chainsecurity .

 ( 15 ) enhanced technology .

the last line of defense against a terrorist nuclear attack is the ability to detect nuclear weapons or material entering the united states .

a large effort isunderway by government agencies , industry , and universities to develop key technologies .

by one estimate , thefy2005 appropriation provides $4.1 billion for homeland security r&d .

 ( 16 ) operation safe commerce , a departmentof transportation - cbp "program to fund business initiatives designed to enhance security for container cargo ... willprovide a test - bed for new security techniques. .

 ( 17 ) the trade act of 2002 , p.l .

107-210 , sec .

343a , mandates theestablishment of a task force to "establish a program to evaluate and certify secure systems of internationalintermodaltransport. .

 ( 18 ) terrorists can counter new technologies .

if the united states deploys sensors at some ports , terrorists might detonatea weapon before it is inspected , or ship it to another port .

if foreign ports screened containers before being loadedonto u.s. - bound ships , terrorists could infiltrate the ports .

securing the largest ports might lead terrorists to usesmaller ones .

securing every u.s. - bound container might lead terrorists to smuggle a weapon in a small boat orairplane .

detecting an heu bomb is difficult because heu emits very little radiation .

r&d is underway toaddressthis key issue .

in 2002 and 2003 , abc news shipped shielded 15-pound cylinders of depleted uranium ( du , natural uranium minusmost uranium - 235 ) into u.s. ports in containers .

cbp did not detect these shipments .

abc claimed that du is agood surrogate for heu ; cbp claimed the opposite .

in september 2004 , dhs issued a report on the topic .

it concluded "[i]mprovements are needed in the inspection process to ensure that weapons of mass destruction ... donotgain access to the u.s. through oceangoing cargo containers" and recommended improving detection equipmentandsearch methods .

 ( 19 ) pending legislation .

bills related to terrorist nuclear attacks on ports include h.r .

163 , secure domestic container partnership act of 2005 , and h.r .

173 ,anti - terrorism and port security act of 2005 .

securing nuclear materials .

the possibility that a terrorist group could make a nuclear weapon given enough heu , and the difficulty of preventing terrorists from smuggling aweaponinto a u.s. port , show the value of securing nuclear weapons and materials in russia and elsewhere .

are currentefforts sufficient ? .

forensics .

technology may enable identification of the origin of nuclear material used in a bomb .

this forensic capability strengthens the value of controlling russian nuclearweapons and materials: finding that material for a bomb detonated in the united states came from russia , a likelysource , would in all probability lead to the conclusion that the material was stolen rather than that russia conductedthe attack .

at the same time , augmenting already - excellent forensic capability through technology and intelligencecould help deter other nations from giving nuclear materials to terrorists .

ports in major cities .

the terrorist weapons discussed earlier , while lower in yield than strategic weapons , might produce blast damage over a radius of 1 to 2 miles , and fire andfallout beyond that range .

accordingly , it might be argued that ports with the greatest number of people living orworking within a mile or two of cargo docks , such as philadelphia and new york , should have highest priority inreceiving security resources .

ameliorating economic consequences .

cold war civil defense studies examined how to ameliorate the destructive effects of a large nuclear attack .

this effort , and more recentemergency preparedness efforts , provide a template for response and recovery following a terrorist attack using one15-kiloton weapon .

this work does not , however , address possible global economic consequences and how topredictand mitigate them .

these issues could benefit from further study and analyses .

what priority should port security have ? .

the 9 / 11 commission wrote , "opportunities to do harm are as great , or greater , in maritime or surface transportation [compared tocommercial aviation] .

initiatives to secure shipping containers have just begun. .

terrorists "may be deterred byasignificant chance of failure. .

 ( 20 ) improving theability to detect terrorist nuclear weapons in the maritimetransportation system may make a terrorist attack on a port less likely to succeed , and thus less probable .

theamerican association of port authorities , a trade association , welcomed federal grants for port security upgradestocomply with the mtsa , but called for "substantially greater resources. .

 ( 21 ) others agree that more resources areneeded to secure u.s. ports , such as to reduce overcrowding of cargo - handling facilities and to hire more workers .

 ( 22 ) a similar case could be made for gas pipelines , electric power plants , rail yards , or bridges .

at issue for congressishow to allocate security funds among ports and other potential targets .
