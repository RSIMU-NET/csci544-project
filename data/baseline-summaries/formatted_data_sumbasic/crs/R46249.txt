the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .

it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .

in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .

the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .

as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .

annual u.s. net farm income is the single most - watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period ( see box "measuring farm profitability" for a definition of net farm income ) .

when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .

in the first of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2020 ( see box "ers's annual farm income forecasts" below ) , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) economic research service ( ers ) projects that u.s. net farm income will rise 3.3% year - over - year in 2020 to $96.7 billion , up $3.1 billion from last year ( figure 1 and table a - 1 ) .

the february forecast of $96.7 billion is 6.3% above the 10-year average of $89.9 billion ( in nominal dollars ) but is well below 2013's record high of $123.7 billion .

in contrast , net cash income ( calculated on a cash - flow basis ) is projected lower in 2020 ( down 10.8% from 2019 ) at $109.6 billionâ4.7% below the 10-year average of $115.0 billion .

the divergence in year - to - year changes between the two measures of net income is due to their different treatment of harvested crops .

net farm income includes a crop's value after harvest even if it remains in on - farm storage .

in contrast , net cash income includes a crop's value only when it is sold .

thus , crops placed in on - farm storage are included in net farm income but not net cash income .

in 2018 , u.s. farmers harvested a record soybean crop and the third - largest corn crop on record .

that same year the u.s. - china trade dispute emerged as an impediment to trade and contributed to a widespread drop in soybean prices .

however , the administration assured producers that the trade dispute was temporary and would soon be resolved in their favor .

as a result , many producers of soybeans and other crops held on to their crops in the hopes of capturing higher prices after the trade dispute was resolved .

however , by mid - 2019 there was no end in sight to the trade dispute , and farmer cash flows necessitated selling from on - farm inventories to meet household and farm operation needs .

as a result , the net cash farm income forecast for 2019 included $14.7 billion in sales from on - farm crop inventories , whereas the 2020 forecast includes a much smaller amount ( $0.5 billion ) in sales from on - farm inventories .

this difference accounts for much of the decline in the 2020 net cash farm income projection .

a measure of the farm sector's financial well - being is net worth as measured by farm assets minus farm debt .

a summary statistic that captures this relationship is the debt - to - asset ratio .

the u.s. farm income and asset - value situation and outlook suggest a slowly eroding financial situation heading into 2020 for the agriculture sector as a whole .

considerable uncertainty clouds the economic outlook for the sector , reflecting the mixed outlook for prices and market conditions , an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses , and an increasing dependency on federal support to offset lost trade opportunities due to ongoing trade disputes .

farm asset values ( see box "measuring farm wealth: the debt - to - asset ratio" below for details ) âwhich reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investmentsâare projected to be up 1.3% in 2020 to a nominal $3.1 trillion ( table a - 3 ) .

the projected rise in asset value is due to increases in both real estate values ( +1.5% ) and non - real - estate values ( +0.6% ) .

real estate is projected to account for 83% of total farm sector asset value .

inflation - adjusted farm asset values ( using 2019 dollars ) are projected lower in 2020 ( - 0.6% ) .

in inflation - adjusted terms , farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( figure 17 ) .

crop land values are closely linked to commodity prices .

the leveling off of crop land values since 2015 reflects stagnant commodity prices ( figure 18 ) .

total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $425.3 billion in 2020 ( +2.3% ) ( table a - 3 ) .

farm equityâor net worth , defined as asset value minus debtâis projected to be up slightly ( +1.1% ) at $2.7 trillion in 2020 ( table a - 3 ) .

the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2020 at 13.6% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 19 ) .

if realized , this would be the eighth consecutive year of increase in the debt - to - asset ratio .

a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt .

thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy .

average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $118,908 in 2020 ( table a - 2 ) , down 1.5% from 2019 and 11.4% below the record of $134,165 in 2014 .

about 18% ( $20,926 ) of total farm household income in 2020 is projected to be from farm production activities , while the overwhelming majority , at 82% ( $97,982 ) , is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) .

the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 20 ) .

since 2014 , over half of u.s. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations .

since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 21 ) .

in 2018 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $112,211 was about 25% higher than the average u.s. household income of $90,021 ( table a - 2 ) .

 figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 present usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commoditiesâcorn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens .

the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons .

usda farm income data tables table a - 1 to table a - 3 present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of u.s. agriculture .

in addition , table a - 4 presents the annual average farm price received for several major commodities , including the usda forecast for the 2019-2020 marketing year for major program crops and 2020-2021 for livestock products .
