the following compilation provides a synopsis of the 107 contested election cases considered by the u.s. house of representatives from the 73 rd congress through the 112 th congress , 1933 to 2011 .

according to the u.s. constitution , the house of representatives has final authority over the "elections , returns and qualifications of its own members. .

this report examines only cases involving the question of whether a member - elect was duly elected , that is , questions regarding elections and returns .

questions regarding qualifications ( age , citizenship , and inhabitancy ) are not the focus of this report .

the case summaries highlight the nature of the contest and the disposition of the case .

for more detailed information regarding each contest , it is important to consult relevant house records .

this report is limited to those cases considered by the house of representatives ; cases decided at the state level are beyond the scope of this report .

furthermore , information contained in this report is derived solely from findings made by the reporting congressional committee or as documented in the congressional record ; crs did not make any of the findings independently .

for the purposes of this report , the term contestant refers to an individual who challenged the election of a member - elect of the house of representatives , and the term contestee refers to a member or member - elect of the house of representatives whose election was challenged .

from 1933 to 2011 , it appears that the house of representatives considered 107 contested election cases , many involving allegations of fraud or other election improprieties .

of these cases , a vast majority were resolved in favor of the contestee .

since enactment of the federal contested elections act of 1969 ( fcea ) , most cases have been dismissed due to failure by the contestant to sustain the burden of proof necessary to overcome a motion to dismiss .

rec .

71 , march 9 , 1933 ) .

the elections committee majority noted that although there had been some election irregularities in some district precincts , it found that "these irregularities , however , are of long standing and were no different in the election under consideration than in preceding elections in which the contestant was a successful candidate for office. .

the contest involved 16 precincts and had been submitted to the supreme court of maine , which could render advisory opinions to the governor and council .

the court advised that returns from two of the precincts should be thrown out for failure by the election officials to carry out certain statutory duties .

consequently , contestee acquired a majority of 74 votes .

the committee held hearings on the returns from the 14 precincts , concluding that there "was no sufficient evidence of legal fraud or intentional corruptness to justify the committee to recount the ballots of the precincts or to justify the committee in sustaining the contestant's contentions. .

a minority report was filed .

disposition of the contest — the committee recommended h.res .

390 , denying contestant brewster a seat and awarding a seat to contestee utterback .

nature of the contest — contestee gormley received 42,132 votes and contestant goss received 42,054 , a majority for the contestee of 78 votes .

contestant charged that through fraud , irregularities , corruption , and deceit , contestant was deprived of sufficient votes necessary to overcome contestee's majority .

the main issue in this case involved one voting booth in the city of waterbury .

the elections committee recognized that the contestant's allegations were general , vague , and uncertain as to "necessary particulars," and that while the allegations did not meet the statutory requirements , the committee would nevertheless "pierce the veil. .

the committee set forth guiding postulates for its consideration of the case: " ( 1 ) the official returns are prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of official action ; ( 2 ) election officials are presumed to have performed their duties loyally and honestly ; ( 3 ) the burden of coming forward with evidence to meet or resist these presumptions rests with the contestant. .

the committee held hearings and ascertained that while confusion existed at the polling place as to voting for repeal of the 18 th amendment , "in no instance was a single complaint made to anyone at the polling place as to irregularity , interference , or fraud , and this , in spite of the fact that the election board was nonpartisan. .

therefore , the committee found that the contestant failed to establish his case by a "fair preponderance of the evidence," concluding that contestee goss was duly elected .

disposition of the contest — on april 20 , 1934 , the house adopted h.res .

346 , awarding the seat to contestee goss ( 78 cong .

rec .

4035 , 7087 ) .

nature of the contest — in the official returns , contestee burnham received a plurality of 518 votes .

contestant chandler charged that he had received a majority of the lawful votes cast .

specifically , contestant argued that he was deprived of a rightful count because election officers rejected ballots favoring him , citing that such ballots had been void , spoiled , mutilated , or marked .

contestant also maintained that the unused ballots , together with the stubs of the used ballots , exceeded the number of ballots delivered to some precincts , while in other precincts , the unused ballots , together with the stubs of the used ballots was less than the number of ballots delivered .

contestant further charged that many used ballots were missing from the ballot boxes .

as in gormley v. goss , supra , the elections committee reiterated its warning about vague charges and pointed out that the statute required the notice of contest to contain particulars .

in addition to the three general guidelines for judging contested elections cases it set forth in gormley , the committee prescribed two more: " ( 4 ) that fraud is never presumed , but must be proven ; and ( 5 ) that the mere closeness of the result of an election raises no presumption of fraud , irregularities or dishonesty. .

the committee found that the record disclosed no evidence of fraud or deception and that a private recount taken by the contestant without the knowledge of the contestee , which supposedly showed a decided gain for the contestant , was inadmissible as uncorroborated and self - serving .

in respect to the contestant's charge that not all election board members signed the returns in some precincts and that in others , none signed the returns , the committee stated: the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to suffrage may be divided into two classes: first , mandatory , which defines the right of suffrage ; second , directory , which directs the manner of its exercise .

the first confers the right , and the last throws safeguards around that right .

the laws enacted for the purpose of conserving the right of the elector to exercise his franchise are mandatory or directory depending upon whether the statutes make them so .

if the statute provides that unless a certain procedure is followed the election is void , then the law is mandatory .

if , however , it prescribes for the doing or not doing of a certain thing in a certain manner by the election officers and fixes a penalty for the disobedience of the law , but does not provide that such violation shall void the election , then it is directory .

the rules prescribed by law for conducting an election are designed chiefly to accord an opportunity for the free and fair exercise of the elective franchise to prevent illegal voting , and to ascertain with certainty the result .

a departure from the mode prescribed will not vitiate an election , if the irregularities do not deprive any legal voter of his vote , or admit an illegal vote , or cast uncertainty on the result , and has not been occasioned by the agency of a party seeking to derive benefit from them .

the committee concluded that the contestant had failed to establish fraud in this case .

disposition of the contest — h.res .

386 , declaring contestee burnham to have been duly elected , was passed by the house on may 15 , 1934 ( 78 cong .

nature of the contest — contestee thurston received a majority of 177 votes .

on a recount agreed to by the parties , contestee received a 619 majority , and on a split of disputed ballots , he received a majority of 194 .

the central question in this case was whether ballots marked for the presidential nominees of the parties , but not for the congressional candidates , should be counted as straight party tickets , even though the laws of iowa provided a separate space for a straight party vote .

the elections committee decided against such an assumption and found that contestee thurston had been duly elected .

disposition of the contest — on april 25 , 1934 , the house adopted h.res .

359 , denying the election of contestant ellis and awarding the seat to contestee thurston ( 78 cong .

nature of the contest — contestant fox claimed that contestee higgins induced an individual named rollo to run as a "wet party" candidate for congress from the 2 nd district of connecticut ; that 624 voters voted either a straight republican or democratic ticket , plus a straight "wet party" ticket , under the impression that they were voting for the repeal of the 18 th amendment ; that such ballots were not counted ; that indeed they should be counted as democratic or republican ballots , and if so counted , would produce a majority for the contestant .

the elections committee found no evidence of any collusion between the contestee and rollo , nor any evidence of confusion because of the make - up of the ballot , nor any evidence as to the intention of the 624 voters who voted for two parties .

the committee concluded that there was no reason to change the result of the election .

disposition of the contest — on may 28 , 1934 , the house adopted h.res .

296 , declining to seat fox and awarding the seat to contestee higgins ( 78 cong .

although the election had been held on november 6 , 1934 , the record was not filed with the clerk of the house until the early part of 1936 .

it concluded that the 70 wpa workers' votes were illegal and should be disregarded , although such action would not affect the final result .

it took note of the informal recount taken in connection with a recount for sheriff and another for a seat in the state legislature , and concluded that no evidence was produced to demonstrate fraud or irregularity .

as for the contestant's application for a recount , the committee stated , "it is a well settled principle established by the precedents and accepted by congress that an application for a recount must be founded upon some proof sufficient at least to raise a presumption of irregularity or fraud , and a recount will not be ordered upon the mere suggestion of possible error. .

it further announced that returns made by election officials regularly appointed by the laws of the state , where the election is held , are presumed to be correct until they are impeached by proof of irregularity and fraud .

it stated that contestant miller had served notice of contest on contestee kirwan , but that miller was not a candidate for election at the general election of november 1940 .

rather , he had been a candidate at the democratic primary .

the resolution concluded: "resolved , that the house of representatives does not regard the said locke miller as a person competent to bring a contest for a seat in the house and his notice of contest , served upon the sitting member , michael j. kirwan , is hereby dismissed ; and no petition or other paper relating to the subject matter contained in this resolution shall be received by the house , or entertained in any way whatever. .

nature of the contest — contestant clark charged that election officials had engaged in fraud , irregularities , and violations and disregard of state election laws to the extent that he was deprived of votes that would have resulted in his winning the election .

the elections committee determined that no fraud was perpetrated on the contestant by any election official so as to deprive him of votes ; that the election officials saw to it that every person entitled to vote was granted the opportunity ; that no person not entitled to vote was permitted to vote ; and that the result of the balloting as certified by the officials was correct .

the committee did find that some irregularities occurred , including failure to maintain registration books in some of the precincts as prescribed by oklahoma law , but concluded that , "[it] is not the business nor the province of this committee to attempt indirectly to compel the state of oklahoma to enforce its laws with respect to certain provisions therein which patently were not complied with , but grossly disregarded .

the electors , the people , of the district did choose between two candidates and they should not be deprived of their rights by the failure to those responsible for the administration of the law to do their duty. .

the committee decided that , while the constitution and laws of oklahoma required registration books to be kept in the precincts , failure to comply with this requirement was not such an irregularity as to vitiate an election "unless the performance of the act of keeping the book be declared by law to be essential to the validity of the election. .

according to the committee , under oklahoma law , "[i]t follows , therefore , that the provision is merely directory and the final test as to legality of the election is whether or not the electors have been given an opportunity to express and have fairly expressed their will. .

the committee determined that the alleged irregularities were insufficient to constitute a claim of fraud .

that is , due to the fact that the irregularities were not of such a nature to invalidate the election , because the provisions of law governing the alleged irregularities were directory and not mandatory , the committee decided that the contestant had failed to sustain the burden of proof .

disposition of the contest — h.res .

the recount indicated some irregularities in the ballots for both parties , and was suspended by the contestant , after about 42% of the ballots had been recounted , with no substantial change in favor of the contestant .

the committee concluded that the results of the partial recount did not warrant a full recount , and that the contestant had failed to sustain his allegations by sufficient proof .

the committee announced that it is the obligation of the contestant , not the committee , to secure evidence .

disposition of the contest — on april 6 , 1943 , the house passed a resolution extending the time for taking testimony in the case ( h.rept .

after debate in the house as to whether the statutory procedure for contesting elections to the house applied only to candidates ( as adoption of the resolution would have determined ) or whether non - candidates had to file petitions asking for consideration of a contest rather than utilize the statutory notice of contest route , the resolution dismissing the contest was adopted , 245 to 102 ( 111 cong .

it was argued that precedent supported limiting the use of statutory procedure to candidates alone , and that to permit non - candidates to use it would enable those without a serious interest in the actual determination of the election to carry on numerous , spurious contests .

nature of contests — the above listed contests were considered simultaneously .

the questions involved failure of the contestants to avail themselves of the legal steps to challenge alleged discrimination among voters prior to the election and challenge the issuance of the certificates of election to the contestees after the elections were held ; the denial of seats to members - elect because of alleged discriminatory practices involving disenfranchised groups of voters ; and the standing of contestants to proceed under the federal contested elections act , codified at 2 u.s.c .

sections 201-226 .

at the november 1964 general election , the contestees were elected .

in contrast , the contestants were selected at an unofficial "election" held by persons in mississippi from october 30 through november 2 , 1964 , during which time it was alleged , "all citizens qualified were permitted to vote. .

the latter "election" was held without any authority of law in the state .

the contestants were all citizens , none of whom had been candidates in the november elections .

they alleged that disenfranchisement of negroes in mississippi violated the constitution and u.s. law ; that the house had the authority to consider the contests and unseat the contestees ; that the house had a duty to guarantee that the election of its members be in accordance with the requirements of the constitution ; and that where large numbers of negroes had been excluded from the electoral process , where intimidation and violence had been utilized to further such exclusion , and where the free will of the voters had been prevented from being expressed , the house should unseat the contestees , vacate the elections , and order new elections .

on the first day of the new congress , member - elect ryan objected to the oath of office being administered to abernethy , whitten , williams , walker , and colmer , based "upon facts and statements which i consider to be reliable. .

member - elect ryan also noted that he made this objection "on behalf of a significant number of colleagues who are now standing with me. .

on september 13 and 14 , 1965 , the house committee on administration , subcommittee on elections held hearings and on september 15 , 1965 , issued its report , noting that the contestees had been sworn in by vote of the house on january 4 , 1965 , after they had been asked to step aside , which established the prima facie right of each contestee to his seat .

the report noted that the contestants had not availed themselves of legal steps to challenge in court , the alleged exclusion of negroes from the ballot nor the issuance of the certificates of election to the contestees .

the report found that the contestants had not been candidates at the election and thus , under house precedents , had no standing to invoke the house contested election statute .

according to the report , there been an election in mississippi in november 1964 for members of the u.s. house of representatives , under statutes which had not been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction , and that at the same election , presidential electors and a u.s .

senator had been elected without question .

the report further observed that a case challenging the mississippi registration and voter laws was progressing through the u.s. courts and that the question of the constitutionality of the statutes was a proper one for the courts to determine .

according to the report , it was doubtful that any disenfranchisement , even if proven , would have actually affected the outcome of the november 1964 mississippi congressional elections in any district .

the report concluded that the house , in following its rules and procedures , should dismiss the cases because the contestants did not qualify to utilize the house contested elections statute , and because the contestees had been elected under laws that had not been set aside at the time of the election .

the report did state , however , that in arriving at such conclusions the committee did not condone disenfranchisement of voters in the 1964 or previous elections , nor was a precedent being established to the effect that the house would not take action , in the future , to vacate seats of sitting members .

it noted that the voting rights act of 1965 had been enacted in the interim and that if evidence of its violation were presented to the house in the future , appropriate action would be taken .

disposition of the contest — on the first day of the new congress , after the speaker collectively administered the oath to the other members - elect , the house adopted h. res 1 , authorizing and directing the speaker "to administer the oath of office" to abernethy , whitten , williams , colmer , and walker , who "presented themselves at the bar of the house" and were administered the oath ( 111 cong .

an amendment was adopted striking out the phraseology entitling the contestees to their seats , as language inappropriate in a procedural matter ( 111 cong .

nature of contest — this case involved alleged violations of state elections law .

at the november 1964 election , contestee was certified to have received 83,455 votes , and the contestant , 83,036 votes .

on december 31 , 1964 , contestant filed a notice of contest , alleging violations of iowa law , including burning of ballots on the day after the election , the casting of more ballots than there were names listed on the polls , the recording of absentee ballots in a back room by one person , and disappearance of a tally sheet .

contestant requested a recount .

on september 28 , 1965 , the subcommittee on elections of the committee on house administration held hearings .

on october 8 , 1965 , it issued its report .

the committee found that the proof presented did not sustain the charges brought and recommended dismissal of the contest .

specifically , the committee found that although there may have been human errors committed at the polls on election day , there was no evidence of fraud or willful misconduct .

it found that the burned ballots were unused ballots and the practice of burning such had been a uniform one for numerous years .

the allegation of more ballots cast than names listed on the polls was discharged by the conclusion that some inadvertent errors had been made , but the errors were insufficient to change the result even if all the excess ballots were added to the total of the contestant .

the charge respecting the counting of absentee ballots was found to apply to one polling place and the circumstances were such as to make it inadequate as a charge .

the disappearing tally sheet was located and involved technical operation of a voting machine , not the counting of the results .

it was further disclosed by the contestant that the request for a recount was in the nature of a "fishing expedition" and that he knew of no fraud by which to substantiate it .

the committee acknowledged that iowa had no recount statute applicable to a u.s. house election , but found that the matter had no effect on the jurisdiction of the committee , that the committee would proceed to a recount if substantial allegations of irregularity or fraud were alleged , and the likelihood existed that the result of the election would be different were it not for such irregularity or fraud .

under the circumstances of the case , it declared that the evidence did not justify a recount because the contestant had not clearly presented proof sufficient to overcome the presumption that the returns of the returning officers were correct .

disposition of the contest — on october 8 , 1965 , h.res .

602 , dismissing the contest , was reported by the committee on house administration .

on october 11 , 1965 , the house considered the resolution and it was adopted ( 111 cong .

rec .

26499-26504 ) .

nature of contest — the issue involved the counting of so - called "overvotes" on punch card voting machines during the november 1966 election .

contestant alleged that the computers that tallied the votes erroneously failed to count about 7,000 votes , and that the procedures for duplicating defective ballots were improper .

election officials , acting in accordance with their interpretation of georgia law , had programmed the computing machines that counted the ballots to reject those cards where a voter had punched a straight party ticket and had also punched out the scored block for the congressional candidate of the opposing party .

on the first day of the new congress , member - elect davis objected to the oath of office being administered to blackburn , based "upon facts and statements i consider to be reliable. .

the speaker then asked blackburn to "step aside and remain seated" ( 113 cong .

rec .

14 ( january 10 , 1967 ) ) .

subsequently , the speaker administered the oath collectively to the other members - elect .

while the contested election was under consideration , suit was filed in the georgia courts concerning the interpretation of georgia law relating to canvassing of punch card votes .

on march 30 , 1967 , the litigation was effectively terminated when the georgia supreme court declined to reconsider a january 25 , 1967 , georgia court of appeals decision favoring the state election officials' interpretation of the law ( blackburn v. hall , georgia court of appeals , no .

42505 , decided january 25 , 1967 , rehearing denied february 17 , 1967 , cert .

in brief , the judicial decision sustained the election of the contestee .

on april 13 , 1967 , the contestant notified the house that he was withdrawing his notice of contest .

on june 14 , 1967 , the committee on house administration issued its report in conjunction with h.res .

542 , stating that the contestee was the duly elected representative from the 4 th congressional district of georgia and was entitled to his seat .

on july 11 , 1967 , a resolution to that effect was considered and adopted by the house .

during house debate , the fact that difficulties had occurred in the counting and handling of punch card ballots and in voter use of "automatic" voting machines was discussed .

these difficulties , however , were deemed not to be crucial to the outcome of the election .

disposition of the contest — on the first day of the new congress , after the speaker collectively administered the oath to the other members - elect , the house adopted h. res 2 , authorizing and directing the speaker "to administer the oath of office" to blackburn .

the resolution further provided "[t]hat the question of the final right of benjamin b. blackburn to a seat in the ninetieth congress be referred to the committee on house administration," which "shall have the power to send for persons and papers and examine witnesses on oath in relation to the subject matter of this resolution. .

immediately afterwards , blackburn "appeared at the bar of the house" and took the oath of office ( 113 cong .

rec .

27 ( january 10 , 1967 ) ) .

nature of contest — this case involved the question of contestant's standing to utilize the procedures of the house contested elections statute , codified at 2 u.s.c .

sections 201-226 , and the right of a primary loser in a party different from that of the contestee , to challenge the contestee .

contestant had filed notice under the contested elections statute and had subsequently filed a petition with the house requesting that contestee's seat be declared vacant on the grounds that the procedures for nomination of the candidate of contestant's party who ran in the general election in november against the contestee and was defeated , were contrary to the georgia election statutes .

the winner of the primary of contestant's party , in which the contestant had been a candidate , withdrew after the primary election and a successor nominee was substituted for the primary winner by the local county party executive committee .

contestant alleged that the georgia statutes and the rules of the democratic party of georgia authorized a county executive committee to make a substitute nomination only where the vacancy occurred after a nomination had been made by the state democratic party convention .

he alleged that the substitute nomination in this case had been made prior to the state convention and that in such circumstances there should have been a special election to nominate a democratic candidate for the congressional seat .

the committee on house administration issued its report on june 14 , 1967 .

the report declared that based on precedent , due to the fact that the contestant had been an unsuccessful candidate in the democratic primary and did not claim any right to the seat , he had no standing to proceed under the contested elections statute .

acting pursuant to the authority granted to it by house rule xi , section 9 ( k ) to consider questions surrounding the election of members of congress ( house rules manual , 90 th cong .

precedents have authorized the committee to consider petitions by non - candidates ( see cannon's precedents of the house of representatives , vol .

vi , §78 ) .

the committee noted that the contestant made no charges of fraud or irregularities by the contestee in connection with the republic primary or the general election , and the contestee received the highest vote at the general election .

it then declared that , assuming arguendo that the substitute nomination of the democratic candidate for congress was contrary to georgia law , it did not follow that the house would unseat the republican contestee .

the committee stated that it was unaware of any precedent for depriving a member of his seat solely on the basis of the irregularity of the nomination of his opponent in the general election .

it pointed out that this was not a case where fraud or irregularity in the returned member's nomination was charged .

the committee then noted what it deemed the "potential danger" in declaring an election void , due to a finding of an unlawful nomination of losing candidate .

according to the committee , doing so would open the door for the party of a losing candidate in a general election to impeach the election of the winning candidate by claiming that the election was invalid because the losing candidate had not been nominated in accordance with election laws and party rules .

the committee also noted that a suit brought in the georgia courts by the "contestant" seeking a special primary had been dismissed .

the "contestant" had been a write - in candidate in the general election , but his candidacy had been of only a few days' duration and he had publicly announced his withdrawal from the race several days prior to the general election .

the committee declared that the "contestant" had not been a candidate on election day .

the committee recommended that the case be dismissed .

nature of contest — the case involved allegations of malconduct , irregularity and fraud by poll officers in 40 precincts in the democratic primary in which the "contestant" had unsuccessfully sought the nomination , losing to charles weltner .

thompson , the winner of the general election , was the candidate of the republican party .

the major issue presented was whether a losing candidate in a primary had standing to contest the election of a member who was the candidate of another party on the grounds that his opponent in the general election was improperly chosen .

the committee on house administration recommended dismissal , noting that none of the irregularities alleged involved thompson , nor did they directly involve his opponent .

additionally , the committee found that house precedent would deny lowe standing to contest under the statute because the "contestant" was not a candidate in the general election disposition of the contest — on april 23 , 1969 , the house adopted h.res .

nature of contest — contestant alleged that the affidavits of registration of 11,137 voters in riverside county , california , had been wrongfully and illegally canceled , depriving approximately 10,616 qualified voters of the right to vote .

a motion to dismiss was filed by the contestant , based on the defense that the notice failed to state grounds sufficient to change the result of the election .

 ( federal contested election act , p.l .

on may 11 , 1971 , the subcommittee on elections of the committee on house administration held hearings on the motion .

the committee recommended dismissal of the contest , noting that the contestant had not made a substantial offer to prove that those whose names were stricken were qualified voters of the district ; that those stricken offered to vote and were not permitted to do so ; that of those who might have been improperly denied the vote of sufficient number would have voted for contestant to change the results of the election .

a preliminary injunction was obtained in the state court restraining the governor of pennsylvania from issuing a certificate of election .

the committee on house administration recommended administering the oath to the apparent winner , based on certified returns , referring the question of final right to the committee ( h.res .

nature of the contest — on december 23 , 1974 , young served mikva and the clerk of the house of representatives with notice of his intention to contest the election of mikva .

the contestant alleged that votes were obtained by fraud and through widespread violations of the law .

specifically , the contestant alleged ( 1 ) that the contestee disseminated false information about the contestant prior to the election , and ( 2 ) that the contestee accepted and failed to report a campaign contribution in violation of federal election campaign act of 1971 .

no specific evidence was offered to support the general allegations of misrepresentation and failure to report contributions , nor did the contestant sustain the burden of proof to show misconduct influencing sufficient votes to change the result of the election .

the contestee moved to dismiss the contest for failure to state grounds sufficient to change the results of the election .

h.rept .

94-759 contains a full discussion of house precedents regarding the contestant's burden of proof , the assumption of regularity of the returns , and the requirement that fraud be proven .

as to the argument that a full recount would change the result , illinois state election law provides for a partial recount and leaves the decision as to whether or not further proceedings are warranted to the houses of congress .

the contestant had a partial recount conducted in 124 of 533 precincts selected by the contestant .

the house administration committee determined that there was an insufficient showing that a full recount would change the outcome of the election because the result of the partial recount had been to reduce contestee's 2,860 vote majority by only 471 votes .

disposition of the contest — the committee on house administration decided that the contestant had failed to sustain the burden of proof necessary to award the contested seat to him .

on december 19 , 1975 , the house passed h.res .

h13055 ( daily ed. , december 19 , 1975 ) ) .

nature of the contest — under maine state law , a recount is permitted when more than 100,000 votes are cast and the percentage difference of the vote between the two candidates is 1 / 2 of 1% or less ; the voting in the emery / kyros election fell within those requirements .

kyros requested a state recount and in the recount , both parties agreed that all questionable ballots would be set aside as disputed .

both kyros and emery agreed and stipulated that only the u.s. house of representatives could determine the validity of the ballots .

on december 27 , 1974 , the contestant filed a notice of contest , sending copies to the clerk of the house of representatives and the contestee , emery .

the ballots under dispute were divided into three types , plus a fourth miscellaneous category .

the three categories were ( 1 ) right hand ballots , ( 2 ) apex ballots , and ( 3 ) distinguishing or irregular marks .

where state law was uncertain , the subcommittee on elections used the "obvious voter intent" standard to determine the validity of ballots ; where state law was certain , the subcommittee would have been guided by those state laws only if it found a legitimate state interest , such as the safeguarding of the integrity of the electoral process .

as it was , the subcommittee found no such interest in the interpretations of state law proposed , so the subcommittee was again guided by overriding considerations of equity and used the "obvious voter intent" standard to evaluate ballots .

disposition of the case — the contestant withdrew from the case in the middle of the subcommittee's review of the ballots , and on december 19 , 1975 , the house dismissed the election contest ( 121 cong .

the grounds of contest were numerous , including alleged violations of the federal election campaign act of 1971 , specifically , receipt of contributions by federal government contractors , misuse of the franking privilege , and misconduct of the contestee .

disposition of the case — the committee declared that insufficient evidence had been presented to support the contestant's allegations and found that evidence of wrongdoing in election campaigns , other than the one being contested , is not relevant .

the house then adopted h.res .

nature of the contest — on december 10 , 1974 , mack delivered a notice of intention to contest to the clerk of the house of representatives .

as to the grounds of the contest , he questioned the qualifications of stokes to be a representative , rather than specific objections to the manner in which the election was conducted .

generally , the notice alleged that stokes was "not a bona fide inhabitant possessing the requisite qualifications set forth in article i , section 2 , clauses 1 and 2 of the u.s .

constitution. .

though the committee stated it would have been more appropriate to have had the case raised by a petition or a memorial and presented to the house , the committee retained the case and decided it on its merits , saying that similar standards were applicable .

under those standards , the contestant "must state adequate grounds" for disqualification "with sufficient particularity" to justify the continuance of the proceeding and make a "substantial offer to prove that contestee is disqualified. .

disposition of the contest — the committee found that the contestant had not made any factual allegations sufficient to cast doubt upon contestee's qualifications and recommended dismissal .

on december 19 , 1975 , the house dismissed the case , h.res .

nature of the contest — on december 30 , 1974 , ziebarth filed a notice of intention to contest stating as grounds for the contest the closeness of the election , the existence of overcounting and undercounting in precinct tallies , the opinion of a statistical recount expert that a recount would change the results of the election , and the fact that the state of nebraska had no provisions for recounts .

in response , the contestee filed a motion to dismiss based on a failure of the notice of contest to state grounds sufficient to change the results of the election .

the subcommittee gave the contestant 10 days to set forth a more definite statement , as "the house has consistently refused to grant a request for a recount solely on the grounds of a close vote and / or the absence of a state provision for recounting a congressional election. .

the amended notice of the contestant did not provide the requested details of the charge .

the answer to the amended notice of contest attached an affidavit from the secretary of state of nebraska refuting the general allegations of the overcount and undercount .

the contestant furnished no more particulars nor did he substantiate any of his generalities .

disposition of the case — after carefully stating the reasons for rejecting a recount request merely because of closeness and / or the lack of state recount provisions , the committee found that the contestant had not pled with sufficient particularity nor had he offered preliminary proof of mistake in the original count , and recommended dismissal of the contest .

on december 19 , 1975 , the house adopted h.res .

a panel of the committee met to consider a motion to dismiss , concluding that although the contestant's pleadings were in proper form and alleged instances of irregular and perhaps even illegal voting , he failed to demonstrate that any or all of the allegations would have changed the result of the election .

therefore , the committee recommended that a resolution dismissing the contest be reported to the house of representatives .

in response , the contestee filed a motion to dismiss .

an ad hoc panel of the committee convened to take testimony .

the panel found that the contestant did not meet its burden of proof to overcome a motion to dismiss or to order a recount .

as in earlier cases , the contestant failed to show that but for specific irregularities or acts of fraud , the results of the election would have been different .

the house passed the measure on october 27 , 1977 .

nature of the contest — in the primary election , the contestee received 29,094 votes , contestant hill received 574 votes , and contestant panasigui received 957 votes .

this case was brought by the "concerned citizens committee of the first congressional district" ( ccc ) on behalf of the named contestants .

initially , ccc petitioned the board of election commissioners for a new primary election based on its claim that voting irregularities and fraud had occurred .

after an investigation , the board of election commissioners found that the complaint was without merit .

ccc then filed suit in both state and federal courts .

these suits were both dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction .

ccc also filed a notice of complaint pursuant to the fcea and requested a formal investigation by the justice department .

the justice department concluded that the complaint was without foundation .

the committee also found that the allegations were without foundation and that there were insufficient grounds to change the election results .

moreover , the committee concluded that the notice of contest and subsequent pleadings did not sustain the contestants' claim of a right to the contestee's seat .

the house passed the measure on october 27 , 1977 .

in a runoff election , which did not include the contestant , the contestee received 54,378 votes and lewis , not a party to this action , received 32,732 votes .

the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea which claimed that the contestee was ineligible to run for elected office and that there was a presumption of fraud or irregularities .

the contestee filed a motion to dismiss , alleging that the contestant lacked standing and failed to state sufficient grounds to change the result of the election .

an ad hoc panel of the house administration committee found that the contestee was not ineligible to run for congressional office because he failed to resign from the city council prior to seeking another elected office .

the panel also found that the disparity between the number of votes received by the contestant in his 1970 ( 36,194 votes ) and 1977 ( 276 votes ) election bids did not raise a presumption of fraud or irregularities .

moreover , the panel found that the minor discrepancies in the number of unused ballots returned were either explicable or normal .

thus , the ad hoc panel concluded that the allegations were unfounded and that there was insufficient evidence to overcome the contestee's motion to dismiss .

disposition of the contest — the committee unanimously recommended that the house adopt h.res .

he also claimed that a special election should have been held to fill the unexpired term .

the contestee filed three separate motions to dismiss .

an ad hoc panel of the house administration committee recommended that the first motion be granted based on the fact that the contestant failed to provide documented proof of service of the notice of contest on the contestee .

the ad hoc panel also found that the contestant failed to provide any documentary evidence supporting his allegations and that he failed to demonstrate that the allegations , if true , would have changed the outcome of the election .

the ad hoc panel did not deem it necessary to reach the question of whether the contestant failed to claim a right to the contestee's seat .

thereafter , the contestant filed a notice of intention to contest under the fcea .

here , the contestant alleged inadequate and insufficient police protection of voting machines , conspiracy between the contestee and election officials , malfunction of voting machines due to tampering , improper and illegal certification of the contestee , and various acts of fraud , violence , intimidation , assault , theft , extortion , and "dirty tricks. .

the contestee made a motion to dismiss .

the ad hoc panel of the committee determined that the contestant had failed to demonstrate by documentary evidence or otherwise , that the fraud , violence , intimidation , assault , theft , extortion , or "dirty tricks," as alleged to have been involved in the conduct of the election , would have changed the results of the election .

the contestant , rayner , originally filed a civil suit claiming that there had been errors , irregularities , fraud and mistakes which impaired his right to vote and the right to have his vote counted .

the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss based on the fact that the house of representatives has exclusive jurisdiction of the matter .

thereafter , the contestant filed a complaint under the fcea , making the same allegations as in the civil suit and further alleging irregularities in the vote totals displayed on the backs of the voting machines , instances of illegal assistance of voters in casting their votes , the exclusion of the contestant's vote - watchers from polling places , numerous counting errors , and electioneering .

the contestee filed a motion to dismiss .

the ad hoc panel of the committee recommended that the motion be granted because the contestant failed to timely file the contest ; failed to name the proper party to the contest ; failed to include a statement in the notice of contest that the contestee had 30 days in which to file an answer ; failed to serve the contestee properly ; and failed to state grounds sufficient to change the results of the election .

the contestee was later acquitted of these charges .

after reviewing information presented by the department of justice , the ad hoc panel of the house administration committee found that fraud and irregularities were involved in the election .

however , there was no finding of involvement by the contestee in any such activities .

moreover , the contestant failed to demonstrate that the fraud was of sufficient magnitude to have changed the result of the election .

based on this conclusion , the panel voted , 2 to 1 , to recommend dismissing the contest .

disposition of the contest — by a vote of 11 to 8 , the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

575 , dismissing the election contest .

on march 4 , 1980 , the house adopted the measure .

nature of the contest — the results of the general election returned 64,661 votes for contestee daschle and 64,647 votes for contestant thorsness , a margin of 14 votes .

a recount increased the contestee's election margin to 105 votes .

the contestant , followed by the contestee , filed writs with the state court .

the court conducted a post - election review of 1,084 contested ballots and determined that the contestee won the election by 110 votes .

following this decision , the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea .

the contestant alleged that a review of more than 2,000 contested ballots would prove that he had received a plurality of the vote and that representatives of the contestee fraudulently and illegally conducted training sessions for members of the recount board .

the contestee filed a motion to dismiss .

upon stipulations by both parties the second charge was dismissed .

an ad hoc panel of the house administration committee , upon unanimous vote , determined that the first count should also be dismissed because the panel was satisfied with the recount performed by the south dakota supreme court .

moreover , the panel found that the contestant failed to state grounds sufficient to change the result of the election .

disposition of the case — the committee unanimously adopted a motion to report h.res .

576 , dismissing the election contest .

on march 4 , 1980 , the house adopted the measure .

no election contests .

nature of the contest — the election results showed that contestee packard received 66,444 votes , that contestant archer received 57,995 votes , and another candidate received 56,297 votes .

this gave the contestee a plurality of 8,449 votes .

the contestant initiated an election contest in both state court and in the house of representatives , alleging a variety of inadequacies in the conduct of the election itself and in the conduct of the officials charged with overseeing the election .

he also claimed that he obtained the highest number of legally cast votes .

the court dismissed the case after concluding that the evidence was insufficient to show improprieties which would have changed the election .

 ( an investigation by the san diego district attorney's office concluded that no criminal prosecution should be instituted in this case. ) .

the committee found that the contestant did not demonstrate with sufficient evidence that any of the alleged irregularities affected the outcome of the election .

the committee also found that , with the exception of the defacement of some voting machines , there were no criminal violations involved .

the committee's conclusion was based on the opinion of the superior court and the district attorney's report .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

305 , dismissing the election contest .

the house passed the measure on november 15 , 1983 .

nature of the contest — the official vote count showed that the contestee , clarke , received 85,410 votes and the contestant , hendon , received 84,085 votes .

the contestant filed a request for a recount with five county boards of elections and the state board of elections , claiming that the ballots in these counties were ambiguous and that certain laws governing the election were unconstitutional .

this request was denied .

the contestant then filed suit in u.s. district court for the western district of north carolina requesting a recount .

the court ruled against the contestant .

the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit , although agreeing that parts of the law governing the election were unconstitutional , refused to order a recount or invalidate the outcome of the election .

the contestant then filed a notice of contest under the fcea , claiming that the program used to tabulate the computer - counted ballots violated the equal protection clause of the 14 th amendment of the constitution and that had not votes been erroneously counted for the contestee the election result would have been different .

the contestant sought either a recount or invalidation of the vote .

the contestee filed a motion to dismiss .

the house administration committee recommended dismissal on two grounds .

first , the contestant's evidence was too speculative to meet the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the election was affected by the manner in which the five counties counted ambiguously marked ballots .

second , the committee found that a recount was an unwarranted remedy .

moreover , invalidation of the election would be improper because the contestant failed to challenge the ambiguities of the ballots in court prior to the election in question .

the committee considered the rationale of the court of appeals in making its determinations .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

304 , dismissing the election contest .

the house passed the measure on november 15 , 1983 .

nature of the contest — the election of november 6 , 1984 , ended with democratic incumbent mccloskey ahead by 72 votes over republican challenger mcintyre .

following a recount , however , on december 14 , 1984 , the indiana secretary of state certified mcintyre the winner by 34 votes .

on the first day of the new congress , member - elect wright objected to the oath of office being administered to mcintyre based "upon facts and statements which i consider to be reliable. .

the speaker then stated that challenged member - elect mcintyre "will be seated," and "the remaining members will take the oath of office ( 131 cong .

rec .

380 ( january 3 , 1985 ) ) .

subsequently , the speaker administered the oath collectively to the other members - and delegates - elect and resident commissioner .

on february 6 , 1985 , the committee on house administration organized a task force to investigate the election .

after finding that indiana's election process and recount procedure were unreliable , the task force met to develop counting rules to be applied in a house recount .

pursuant to these rules , with the assistance of the general accounting office , the task force recounted the votes from the november 6 , 1984 , election .

this recount gave mccloskey a 4 vote margin of victory over mcintyre .

on may 1 , 1985 , mccloskey was sworn in as a member of the house of representatives .

disposition of the contest — immediately after the speaker collectively administered the oath to the other members - elect on the first day of the new congress , the house considered h. res 1 , providing that the question of the right of mccloskey or mcintyre to a seat be referred to the committee on house administration and that neither mccloskey nor mcintyre "shall be sworn until the committee on house administration reports upon and the house decides such question. .

the resolution further provided that for each day , beginning with the day of the resolution's adoption until the day the house decides the question , both mccloskey and mcintrye shall be paid from "the contingent fund" as a member of the house , and that the clerk of the house is directed to provide clerical assistants and full administrative functions with respect to the eighth congressional district ( 131 cong .

on may 1 , 1985 , the house adopted h.res .

146 , which had been reported by the committee on house administration , dismissing the election contest .

nature of the contest — the guam election commission ( the "commission" ) reported the results as 15,725 for contestee blaz , and 15,402 for contestant won pat .

due to a disparity in the vote total , the commission ordered a recount which resulted in 15,839 votes for the contestee and 15,485 votes for the contestant .

a similar disparity caused another recount which gave the contestee 15,853 votes and the contestant 15,498 votes .

the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea claiming ( 1 ) that the contestee did not win the election because he did not receive a majority of the votes cast as required by law and ( 2 ) that the election results should be rejected because the commission failed to comply with the requirements of the overseas citizens voting rights act and the federal voting assistance act .

the committee , agreeing with the commission's decision not to include blank ballots in the vote total , found that the contestee did receive a majority of the votes cast .

the committee also determined that the commission did not violate either of the statutes cited by the contestant .

disposition of the contest — the committee unanimously adopted a motion to report h.res .

229 , dismissing the election contest .

the house passed the measure on july 24 , 1985 .

nature of the contest — the official canvass of votes showed that contestee stallings received 101,266 votes and contestant hansen received 101,133 votes .

a recount of approximately 10% of the district was conducted in those precincts requested by the contestant .

after the partial recount , the official vote tally gave the contestee 101,287 votes and the contestant 101,117 votes .

the contestant then filed a notice of contest under the fcea , claiming that illegal votes had been cast by persons not properly registered , which , if removed , would have changed the outcome of the election .

he also maintained that he was denied a full recount , which , if conducted , would have changed the outcome of the election .

on the first day of the new congress , member - elect myers objected to the oath of office being administered to stallings based "upon statements and information which i deem reliable. .

the speaker then stated that challenged member - elect stallings "will be seated," and administered the oath collectively to the remaining members - elect .

 ( 131 cong .

rec .

380 ( january 3 , 1985 ) ) .

relying upon results of an investigation by the idaho attorney general concluding that there were no instances in which an unqualified person voted , the committee found that voters were registered in accordance with idaho law .

hence , the committee determined that there was no basis for finding that the election was tainted by illegal votes .

the committee also found that the idaho attorney general and the idaho supreme court denied contestant's request for a full recount because the partial recount did not reveal sufficient material differences in the result , when projected district - wide , to change the result of the election .

disposition of the contest — after the speaker collectively administered the oath to the other members - elect on the first day of the new congress , the house adopted h. res 2 , directing and authorizing the speaker to administer the oath of office to stallings .

in a statement on the floor , myers stated that he asked for stallings to "stand aside" because "even though it is not required by statute to do this , historically we have asked seats in question to stand aside , and then be sworn in without prejudice" ( 131 cong .

rec .

388 ( january 3 , 1985 ) ) .

the speaker then administered the oath of office to member - elect stallings ( 131 cong .

the certifying credentials issued by the governor gave the contestee 113,009 votes and the contestant 102,918 votes .

thereafter , the contestant filed a complaint in circuit court seeking a protective order regarding the voting machines used in the election .

the court granted the order and , subsequently , ordered several inspections of these machines .

the court later dismissed the complaint , citing lack of jurisdiction , but retained jurisdiction over the voting machines .

the contestant then filed a notice of contest under the fcea claiming that the ballots and voting machines misled voters and that defective voting machines produced inaccurate totals .

the committee dismissed the first allegation , finding that no irregularity sufficient to change the result of the election could reasonably be inferred from the design of the voting apparatus .

the committee also heard testimony concerning past problems with the programming of voting machines , although the expert who testified did not find that such problems existed in this election .

consequently , the committee found that there was no merit to the contestant's second allegation .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

182 , dismissing the election contest and on may 25 , 1993 , the house passed the measure .

nature of the contest — the official election returns showed that the contestee rose received 62,670 votes and contestant anderson received 58,849 votes .

the contestant filed a complaint with the north carolina board of elections and a notice of contest with the house of representatives alleging election irregularities and fraud .

moreover , the contestant claimed that the contestee was not a resident of the 7 th district of north carolina ( the committee left this determination to north carolina authorities ) .

although the contestant presented credible allegations highlighting serious and potentially criminal violations of election laws , if proven , they were insufficient to change the outcome of the election .

thus , the contestant's evidence was not able to overcome the motion to dismiss filed by the contestee .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

538 , dismissing the election contest and on september 26 , 1996 , the house passed the measure .

nature of the contest — the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea claiming that the contestee failed to file an affidavit attesting to the fact that he was not a subversive person as defined by new hampshire law .

the contestant further claims right to the office because he was the only qualified candidate who submitted such an affidavit .

the committee on house administration found that the law relied upon by the contestant had been declared unconstitutional by the u.s. supreme court and that it had been repealed by the new hampshire legislature prior to the election .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

539 , dismissing the election contest , and on september 26 , 1996 , the house passed the measure .

nature of the contest — after two recounts , contestee gejdenson was declared the winner by 21 votes .

the contestant filed a notice of contest claiming that errors of judgment were made by the vote counters .

without alleging fraud , the contestant claimed that 1,200 residents had been added improperly to the voting polls .

the house oversight task force voted 2 to 1 against dismissing the contest .

one month later the contestant withdrew his challenge .

disposition of the contest — challenge withdrawn by the contestant .

nature of the contest — contestant brooks had been the apparent winner on election night , with 82,415 to 82,322 votes .

however , after mail - in votes were counted , the result showed that the contestee harman had won by 93,939 to 93,127 votes .

the contestant then filed a notice of contest under the fcea , claiming that the 812-vote margin of victory was based on illegal ballots , including votes from nonresidents , minors and voters illegally registered at abandoned buildings and commercial addresses .

the contestee filed a motion to dismiss , claiming that the contestant filed her notice of contest after the statutory period had expired .

after deciding that the challenge merited further investigation , the task force voted , 2 to 1 , to request for more information .

the contestant withdrew her challenge two weeks after the task force held a field hearing .

disposition of the contest — challenge withdrawn by the contestant .

nature of the contest — on november 22 , 1996 , the orange county registrar of voters certified contestee sanchez the winner by 984 votes .

subsequently , contestant dornan requested a recount .

on december 9 , 1997 , as a result of the recount , sanchez's margin of victory was reduced to 979 votes .

on december 26 , 1996 , the contestant filed a notice of contest .

this notice , amended on april 19 , 1997 , alleged non - citizen voting and voting irregularities , such as improper delivery of absentee ballots , double voting and phantom voting .

the task force on elections made a comparison between the orange county voters' registration files and ins databases .

the task force reported its findings as follows: the task force was able to clearly and convincingly document that 624 persons had illegally registered and thus were not eligible to cast ballots in the november 1996 election .

in addition , the task force discovered 196 instances where there was a circumstantial indication that a voter registered illegally .

further , the orange county registrar of voters voided 124 improper absentee ballots .

in total , the task force found clear and convincing evidence that 748 invalid votes were cast in this election .

however , the number of ballots for which the task force and committee has clear and convincing evidence that they were cast improperly by individuals not eligible to vote in the november 1996 election is less than the 979-vote margin in this election .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

355 , dismissing the election contest , and on february 12 , 1998 , the house passed the resolution .

no election contests .

no election contests .

nature of the contest — the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea asserting that when the contestant challenged the late representative patsy mink in the 2002 democrat primary , where he received 15% of the vote , representative mink should have been disqualified as a primary candidate because she was seriously ill at the time of the primary election and passed away one week later .

contestant argued that he should have been declared the democrat nominee by default and that as the nominee , he therefore would have been the inevitable winner of the general election .

the committee found that the fcea does not contemplate considering notices of contest that are based on the conduct of primary elections .

therefore , the committee concluded that the basis for the contestant's notice of contest was outside the scope of the fcea , and voted to dismiss as a frivolous election contest .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

317 , dismissing the election contest , and on july 15 , 2003 , the house passed the measure .

nature of the contest — the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea alleging that contestee gordon committed violations of the constitution amounting to acts of insurrection because contestee , as an incumbent member of congress , did not resign his seat prior to seeking re - election , and because as an inactive member of the tennessee bar , contestee violated the separation of powers principle in the u.s. constitution by remaining a "judicial officer of the courts of tennessee" while serving as a "legislative officer of the united states. .

the contestant made no allegations of irregularities , fraud , or wrongdoing with respect to the election .

the committee on house administration announced that in order to have standing under the fcea , a contestant must have been a candidate for election to the house of representatives in the last preceding election and claim a right to the contestee's seat .

the committee found that the contestant met the first prong of the two - part test .

with regard to the second prong , the committee found that by claiming a right to the contestee's seat because the contestee was ineligible / not qualified to appear on the november 5 , 2003 , ballot , the contestant "fails to explain the logical connection between the contestee's alleged ineligibility and the contestant's entitlement to the contestee's congressional seat. .

however , the committee chose not to resolve the issue of whether failure to explain the nexus between the alleged election deficiencies and the contestant's right to the seat is sufficient to establish standing .

instead , the committee stated that as a threshold matter , it would proceed to consider a notice of contest only if the notice states grounds sufficient to change the result of the election .

that is , the committee found that a contestant must allege irregularities , fraud , or wrongdoing that , if proven , would likely overturn the original election outcome .

due to the fact that the contestant did not advance allegations of irregularity or fraud or objections to the accuracy of the vote totals , which showed him receiving 2% of the vote and the contestee receiving 66% , the committee voted to dismiss as a frivolous election contest .

disposition of the contest — the committee adopted a motion to report h.res .

318 , dismissing the election contest , and on july 15 , 2003 , the house passed the measure .

no election contests .

nature of the contest — of the 238,249 votes cast in the election , the contestant received 118,737 and the contestee received 119,105 , a margin of 368 votes .

the election results generated controversy due to one county in the district — sarasota county — reporting that of the 123,901 ballots cast , approximately 18,000 did not indicate that a vote was cast for any congressional candidate , resulting in an undervote of almost 15% .

in comparison with other counties in the district , this undervote percentage was unusually high .

the contestant filed a contested election suit in the florida courts arguing that florida's certified vote totals excluded thousands of legally cast votes due to malfunctioning electronic voting equipment .

while pursuing state remedies , the contestant also filed a notice of contest under the fcea alleging widespread voting machine irregularities .

in response , the contestee filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the contest was based on conjecture and speculation .

while awaiting a timely state resolution of the case , the committee on house administration deferred acting on the contest for five months .

with no state resolution forthcoming , the committee initiated an investigation on may 5 , 2007 .

enlisting assistance from the government accountability office ( gao ) , the committee's investigation focused on whether voting machine malfunction in sarasota county caused the unusually large number of undervotes .

in february 2007 , gao reported its findings to the committee , concluding that voting machine malfunction did not contribute to the undervote in sarasota county .

while acknowledging that it is the "constitutional duty of the house of representatives to investigate a valid election contest," the committee noted that "only clear and convincing evidence can provide the basis to overcome the presumption of the regularity accorded a state's certified results. .

without such evidence , the committee concluded that florida's certification of the election results in the 13 th district must be confirmed by the house .

therefore , the committee voted to dismiss the contest .

disposition of the contest — on february 12 , 2008 , the committee unanimously voted to dismiss the contest and on february 14 , reported as an original resolution h.res .

989 .

on february 25 , the house passed the measure .

nature of the contest — the contestant maintained that the official election results were incorrect because of irregularities associated with the electronic voting machines .

specifically , the contestant alleged that the electronic voting machines did not accurately record votes cast , producing unreliable and incorrect results , based on the theory that the machines were hacked or had their data tabulations altered by electronic means , and that an accurate recount of the votes could never be conducted because the electronic voting machines were not equipped with a verified voter paper audit trail .

the contestant further argued that the vote totals were unreliable because the supervisor of elections failed to comply with certain testing and fielding requirements for electronic voting machines , pursuant to florida law .

in response , the contestee filed a motion to dismiss the contest based on the contestant's failure to file a timely notice of contest with the clerk of the house , pursuant to the fcea filing requirements .

the committee on house administration determined that in order to survive a motion to dismiss , a contestant must proffer allegations that , if proven , would have altered the outcome of the election .

in his notice of contest , the contestant relied on affidavits from voters in a precinct holding an election for another congressional district indicating a discrepancy in vote totals .

the committee concluded that the contestant's reliance on allegations of electronic voting machine error in another congressional district is irrelevant and not persuasive , and even if proven true , did not establish that the electronic voting machines used in the contestant's race are inherently unreliable and failed to record votes accurately .

disposition of the contest — on june 12 , 2007 , the house passed h.res .

459 , dismissing the contest .

nature of the contest — the contestant maintained that the official election results were incorrect due to alleged irregularities associated with electronic voting machines .

specifically , the contestant asserted that the software of the electronic voting machines was manipulated and the machines hacked , and due to the fact that the machines did not produce a verified voter paper audit trail , an accurate count could never be discerned .

the contestant further argued that the election results were also compromised by the failure of the local boards of election to impose necessary procedural safeguards .

in response , the contestee filed a motion to dismiss the contest because the contestant failed to claim a right to the office and to support the claim of voting irregularities with specific credible allegations of irregularities or fraud that if proven true , would be sufficient to change the result of the election .

the committee on house administration found that the contestant had failed to make a credible and specific claim that he was entitled to the office , and that his claims were conjecture and speculation , unsupported by specific and credible allegations of irregularity sufficient to put into doubt the outcome of the election .

disposition of the contest — on may 8 , 2007 , the committee on house administration agreed to a motion to report h.res .

461 , dismissing the contest , and on june 12 , the house passed the measure .

nature of the contest — the contestant alleged that the official election results were incorrect due to purported irregularities associated with electronic voting machines .

specifically , the contestant asserted that the electronic voting machines produced unreliable and incorrect results based on a theory that the machines were hacked or had their data tabulations altered by electronic means .

the contestant further argued that an accurate recount of the votes could never be discerned because the electronic voting machines were not equipped with a verified paper audit trail .

in response , the contestee filed a motion to dismiss the contest based on the contestant's failure to file a timely notice of contest with the clerk of the house , pursuant to the fcea filing requirements .

the committee on house administration determined that in order to survive a motion to dismiss , a contestant must proffer allegations that , if proven , would have altered the outcome of the election .

in his notice of contest , the contestant relied on affidavits from voters indicating a discrepancy of 6 votes between the contestant and the contestee , and therefore argued that there was sufficient evidence to place into doubt the overall results .

the committee concluded that because the contestee was certified as the winner by 53,462 votes , far exceeding the 6 vote differential proffered by the contestant , that his allegations were unsubstantiated speculation , insufficient to change the results of the election .

disposition of the contest — on june 12 , 2007 , the house passed h.res .

463 , dismissing the contest .

nature of the c ontest — the contestant filed a notice of contest under the fcea alleging that the official election results should be invalidated because the contestee deliberately avoided a debate with the contestant and that but for the contestee's alleged refusal to debate , the contestant would have won the election .

the committee on house administration found that the certificates of election were signed by hawaii's chief election officer on november 24 , 2008 ; therefore , in order to be timely pursuant to section 382 ( a ) of the fcea , the contestant would have had to file a notice of contest by december 24 , 2008 .

the contestant filed a notice of contest on january 16 , 2009 .

the committee noted that due to an elections contest filed by the contestant in the supreme court of hawaii , the certificate of election was not delivered by the state to the u.s. house of representatives until december 16 , 2008 , when the court made a final determination .

noting that the fcea expressly provides that a notice of contest must be filed within 30 days of elections results being declared , the committee announced that the contestant's notice of contest was untimely .

nonetheless , acknowledging that the contestant may have received inaccurate advice on timely filing , the committee decided to evaluate the contestant's claims on the merits .

the committee determined that the contestant failed to make a credible and specific claim that he was entitled to the office because in order to prevail , a contestant must proffer allegations that , if proven , would have altered the election outcome .

according to the committee , the contestant failed to provide any information demonstrating that a public debate would have altered the election outcome and submitted unsupported speculation that did not cast sufficient doubt on the election results to merit further investigation .

drawing any other conclusion , the committee announced , would remove the presumption of regularity that attaches to the state certification of election results .

accordingly , the committee found that the contestant failed to meet the required burden under the fcea .

disposition of the contest — on march 31 , 2009 , the house passed h.res .

303 , dismissing the contest .

no election contests .
