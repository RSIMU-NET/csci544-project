this report describes president george w. bush's proposal for fy2009 appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs , as submitted to congress on february 4 , 2008 , and amended on august 1 , 2008 , and the congressional response to that proposal .

it compares the president's fy2009 request to the fy2008 l - hhs - ed enacted amounts .

it tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the regular l - hhs - ed appropriations , as well as to the supplemental appropriations provided in arra .

discussions focus primarily on discretionary programs .

the report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory l - hhs - ed programs — such as medicare or social security — nor does it follow any authorizing legislation related to the president's budget initiatives .

for a glossary of budget terms and relevant websites , see the appendix , "terminology and web resources. .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills , not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion and for human embryonic stem cell research .

this bill provides discretionary and mandatory funds to three federal departments and 13 related agencies , including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

discretionary funding represents only one - quarter of the total in the bill .

among the various appropriations bills , l - hhs - ed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic ( non - defense ) federal programs ( the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs ) .

this section presents several overview tables on funding in the bill , particularly discretionary funding ; summarizes major funding changes proposed and enacted for l - hhs - ed ; and discusses related issues such as 302 ( b ) allocations and advance appropriations .
