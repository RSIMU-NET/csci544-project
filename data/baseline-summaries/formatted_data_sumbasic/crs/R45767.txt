according to a 2014 study conducted by the national center for education statistics ( nces ) within the u.s. department of education ( ed ) , 53% of public elementary and secondary schools need to spend money on repairs , renovations , and modernizations to put their onsite buildings in good overall condition .

the study estimated that the nationwide spending necessary to reach this standard would be approximately $197 billion , or about $4.5 million per school that needs improvements .

the 2014 study was the first by nces to estimate such costs since a 2000 report and is the most recent available .

as there is no ongoing federal data collection on the physical condition of schools , it is difficult to assess the current state of the nation's school facilities and the need for infrastructure investment .

while the construction , renovation , repair , and maintenance of public school facilities have primarily and typically been the responsibility of state and local governments , the federal government has provided some funding for construction and renovation for specific purposes .

this report provides a description of and background for selected provisions of the rebuild america's schools act of 2019 ( h.r .

865 / s. 266 ) , which was ordered to be reported by the house committee on education and labor on february 26 , 2019 .

h.r .

865 proposes to authorize $70 billion in grants and facilitate $30 billion in school infrastructure tax credit bonds to be used toward the construction and repair of public elementary and secondary school facilities .

grant funds and school infrastructure bond limits would be allocated to states proportionally based on their prior - year local educational agency ( lea ) grant allocations under title i - a of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) .

additional funds would also be authorized for impact aid construction payments authorized under section 7007 of the esea for fy2020 through fy2023 .

funding public schools has traditionally been primarily the responsibility of state and local governments .

in school year 2015-2016 , for instance , public elementary and secondary schools in the united states collectively received about 47% of their revenue from state governments and about 45% from local governments .

of the local revenue , the majorityâapproximately 81%âwas derived from property taxes .

while different states and leas have access to various other funding streams and mechanisms to finance school construction , a common practice to raise funds for this purpose is to issue a general obligation bond ( backed by the credit of the state or local government ) and repay the debt over time with revenue from sources such as property taxes .

nationwide , public schools spent approximately $48 billion on facilities acquisition and construction in the 2015-2016 school year .

while state and local governments typically provide the majority of support for facilities - related expenditures in public k - 12 schools , the federal government also provides some direct and indirect support for school infrastructure .

federal direct support is provided through loans and grants to k - 12 schools with specific needs or serving certain populations of students .

for example , there are school infrastructure grant programs respectively for schools with high populations of students with disabilities or students who are alaska natives , native hawaiians , american indians , or children of military parents .

funding is also available to schools affected by natural disasters or located in rural areas .

additionally , there are facilities financing assistance programs to encourage the development of charter schools .

although ed administers several of the grant programs funding facilities at elementary and secondary schools , other agencies , such as the department of the interior and the department of defense , also administer programs .

aside from the targeted efforts , a one - time appropriation of $1.2 billion was made under the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 ( p.l .

106-554 ) for emergency school renovation and repair activities , as well as activities under part b of the individuals with disabilities education act and technology activities .

most recently , congress provided a one - time appropriation in 2009 , as part of the response to the great recession , that could be used for renovation and construction , among other purposes .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) authorized a $54 billion state fiscal stabilization fund ( sfsf ) .

states were required to use at least 81.8% of their share of the sfsf to restore support of public elementary , secondary , and postsecondary schools , and , as applicable , early childhood education programs and services .

among the allowable uses of restoration funds were modernization , renovation , or repair of public school facilities .

states were required to use the remaining 18.2% of their share of the sfsf for education , public safety , and other government services , which included modernization , renovation , or repair of public school and public or private college facilities , depending on the criteria that the state's governor used to allocate the funds .

ed issued guidance specifically allowing a portion of the sfsf to be used for the construction of k - 12 schools but not institutions of higher education .

another large source of federal contributions to school facilitiesâthe forgone revenue attributable to the exemption of interest on state and local governmental bonds used for school construction , modernization , renovation , and repairâis indirect .

the internal revenue code ( irc , or chapter 26 of the u.s. code ) provides for the federal government to exempt interest income earned on bonds issued by state , local , and tribal governments for a "public" purpose from federal income tax ( 26 u.s.c .

â§103 ) .

â examples of public projects include elementary , secondary , and postsecondary schools ; public buildings ; and roads .

the tax exemption lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments because investors are generally willing to accept a lower rate of return when it is not subject to federal taxation .

there is no bond volume cap on tax exempt state and local government bonds .

h.r .

865 would support public elementary and secondary school construction through several approaches .

ed would administer federal grants , the department of the treasury would administer tax credit bonds , and regular reports on the condition and need for school facilities would fill a knowledge gap in order to inform future federal support .

the following sections summarize the major provisions of the four titles included in h.r .

865 .

title i would authorize grants for the long - term improvement of public school facilities , title ii would authorize school infrastructure bonds , title iii would cover general provisions , and title iv would authorize a temporary increase in funding for impact aid construction .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that enactment of h.r .

865 would result in an increase of approximately $8.4 billion in direct spending , a decrease of approximately $1.2 billion in revenues , and an increase of approximately $55.6 billion in outlays subject to appropriation in the period from fy2019 to fy2029 .

in producing this estimate , cbo assumes that h.r .

865 would be enacted near the end of fy2019 and that authorized and estimated funds would be appropriated every year .
