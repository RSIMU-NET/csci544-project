over the past two decades , mexico has transitioned from a centralized political system dominated by the institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) to a true multiparty democracy .

since the pri last governed in the 1990s , presidential power has become increasingly constrained by mexico's congress , its supreme court , and increasingly powerful governors .

partially as a result of those constraints , two successive national action party ( pan ) administrations struggled to enact the structural reforms needed to boost mexico's economic competitiveness and effectively address the country's security challenges .

weak institutions remain an impediment to democratic consolidation in mexico .

until the early 1980s , mexico had a closed and statist economy and its independent foreign policy was often at odds with the united states .

those policies began to shift , however , under president miguel de la madrid ( 1982-1988 ) , and changed even more dramatically under president carlos salinas de gortari ( 1988-1994 ) and president ernesto zedillo ( 1994-2000 ) .

president salinas opened mexico's economy to trade and investment , while president zedillo adopted electoral reforms that leveled the playing field for opposition parties and increased cooperation with the united states on drug control and border issues .

president fox ( 2000-2006 ) encouraged strong relations with the united states , and called for greater cooperation under nafta and for a bilateral migration agreement that would regularize the status of undocumented mexicans in the united states .

in the aftermath of the september 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , the focus of relations shifted to border security issues as the united states became increasingly concerned about homeland security .

relations became strained during the debate on immigration reform in the united states .

after then - president george w. bush approved the secure fence act of 2006 , mexico , with the support of 27 other nations , denounced the proposed border fence at the organization of american states .

under the calderón government , security cooperation , rather than immigration or trade , dominated the u.s. - mexican relationship .

during then - president bush's march 2007 visit to mexico , president calderón called for u.s. assistance in combating drug and weapons trafficking .

calderón's willingness to increase narcotics cooperation with the united states led to the development of the mérida initiative , a multi - year u.s. assistance effort announced in october 2007 to help mexico and central america combat drug trafficking and crime .

the mérida initiative signaled a major diplomatic step forward for bilateral counterdrug cooperation as the mexican government put sovereignty concerns aside to allow extensive u.s. involvement in its domestic security policies .

u.s. - mexican relations continued to be close under the first obama administration , with security cooperation intensifying under a new mérida initiative strategy that encompassed institution - building , border issues , and development in mexico .

in january 2009 , president calderón visited then president - elect obama in washington , dc .

that pre - inaugural meeting , which has become somewhat of a tradition for recent u.s. presidents , demonstrated the importance of strong relations with mexico .

president obama met frequently with president calderón throughout his first term , both on a bilateral basis and at trilateral north american leaders' summits convened with canadian prime minister stephen harper .

although security issues frequently dominated these discussions , enhancing north american competitiveness and energy cooperation also figured prominently .

u.s. - mexican presidential summits were reinforced by frequent cabinet - level meetings between the two governments , as well as the creation of bilateral working groups formed to address specific topics .

on september 18 , 2012 , u.s. and mexican cabinet - level officials met for the fourth time to review the results of five years of mérida cooperation , reaffirm their commitment to its strategic framework , and pledge to deepen the cooperation the mérida initiative has established .

u.s. - mexican security cooperation continued even as tension emerged in bilateral relations , including after the resignation of the u.s .

ambassador to mexico in march 2011 and two incidents in which u.s. agents were shot while working in mexico .

as mexico is experiencing a domestic shift in power from pan to pri rule , u.s. - mexican relations could also be in for some changes .

2013 marks the first time in 12 years that u.s. and mexican presidential terms are beginning at roughly the same time .

while president obama and president peña nieto both face a full slate of domestic challenges , analysts have urged both leaders to work together on issues that are of critical importance to both countries , particularly those aimed at boosting trade and job creation .

at a pre - inaugural meeting in late november 2012 , president obama embraced peña nieto's desire to bolster economic ties and to focus on a broad array of bilateral issues rather than focusing predominantly on security issues .
