trade agreements evoke strong reactions from supporters and opponents alike .

nowhere isthis debate more alive than in the u.s. congress , which for eight years was at an impasse overpassage of trade promotion authority ( tpa ) until it renewed tpa in august 2002 as part of thetrade act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-210 ) .

without tpa , the politically charged nature of trade negotiationsmade passage of implementing legislation for multilateral and regional agreements more uncertain .

in addition to complex multilateral trade arrangements , the united states has pursued simplerbilateral agreements that were expected to be less politically sensitive and therefore more likely togain congressional approval , especially if tpa had not been renewed .

on september 28 , 2001 , forexample , president bush signed into law the implementing legislation for the u.s. - jordan fta ( p.l.107-43 ) .

bilateral ftas with singapore and chile were pursued with the expectation of similarsupport .

opposition to bilateral ftas , however , has heated up for both economic and politicalreasons .

economists , even those who support free trade , point out that bilateral ( and regional ) agreements are poor substitutes for multilateral arrangements .

although both countries in a bilateralarrangement may see their welfare improve through trade creation , the agreement may also causetrade ( and investment ) diversion , which can negatively affect those both in and outside of theagreement .

although trade diversion is often difficult to assess , it is a real consideration in pursuingnegotiations below the multilateral level .

 ( 1 ) in addition to economists' questions over the trade effects of bilateral agreements , there isvehement opposition by various interest groups .

perhaps first among many are the import - competingindustries that bear the brunt of the adjustment costs of a trade agreement .

despite the welfare gainsto society as a whole ( e.g .

more efficient resource allocation , lower priced imports , greater selectionof goods ) , those industries subject to increased competition face potentially serious pressure to adjusttheir operations to become more efficient , lower - cost producers .

competition is generally acceptedas a tenet of doing business in a market economy , and on a national level , these adjustment costs maybe small and lead to greater productivity .

when the rules change because of trade agreements,however , affected workers and industries resist strongly and their concerns are an integral part of thetrade liberalization debate .

strong criticism of virtually all trade agreements also arises from groups arguing that anyarrangement is unacceptable unless it includes strong provisions addressing the impact of the tradeagreement on labor and environmental conditions .

when joined with other groups protesting"globalization" in general , a formidable coalition is created .

collectively , these interest groups raisethe question of whether trade agreements enhance the social welfare of participating countries .

given the intensity of debate and amount of effort and resources needed to consummate an fta,some questioned whether the marginal gains from a u.s. - chile bilateral agreement would bejustified given that chile is a small and distant u.s. trade partner , and already has a relatively openeconomy .

advocates of the u.s. - chile fta responded that it offered both economic and political gains,with chile seen as a potential strategic foothold in south america , a region historically linkedclosely with europe and asia .

from an economic perspective , u.s. business interests consideredchile a prime target for expanding exports and repeatedly stressed the need to reduce the highertariffs they faced relative to canada and other countries that already had ftas with chile .

lower - cost u.s. imports from chile also provided benefits to individual and business consumers .

further , some of chile's exports to the united states have zero or low tariffs already , suggesting thatthe adjustment costs to import - competing firms could be low ( see appendix c ) .

u.s. investors alsosaw chile's political and economic stability as attractive for foreign investment .

from a trade strategy perspective , it was argued that a u.s. - chile fta would support u.s.initiatives with the free trade area of the americas ( ftaa ) , currently under negotiation , byencouraging greater chilean support for u.s. issues and perhaps even helping define key negotiatingparameters ( e.g .

labor and environment provisions ) that could be precedent - setting .

 ( 2 ) the u.s. - chile fta was alsooffered as a compelling case for passage of tpa legislation , which would serve as a signal to latinamerica and the rest of the world of the u.s. commitment to pursue and complete trade agreements .

chile also saw a logic in prioritizing an fta with the united states because exportpromotion has been a building block of its growth and development strategy .

guaranteed access tothe large u.s. market offers opportunities for increased and perhaps more diversified trade .

chilealso envisioned increased foreign investment as an attendant benefit of the fta , and argued that itswell - established track record on economic and trade reform made it the latin american country mostready to negotiate a bilateral fta .

in short , despite its relatively small economy , chile presenteditself as a country ready , willing , and able to negotiate a mutually beneficial fta with the unitedstates .

in addition to the benefits that were expected to accrue to u.s. businesses , investors , andconsumers , an fta with chile was also seen as an opportunity for the united states to supporteconomic and trade reform in latin america , for which chile had become a regional model .

tradewas a big part of the economic growth and development story in chile , and linked directly toincreased productivity , higher standards of living , greater diffusion of technology , and overallmodernization of the country .

therefore , the united states , it was argued , should support these gainsbecause they are a foundation for continued economic , social , and political stability and progress inthe region .

trade agreements were also presented as playing a role in development and have theadded benefit of "locking in" reforms , lending a sense of permanence to economic and politicalconditions that is conducive to attracting and keeping foreign trade and investment .

clearly , there were competing viewpoints on the desirability of a u.s. - chile fta .

a lookat chile's economic development is one way of addressing many , if not all , of the issues highlightedabove precisely because chile has been an early and aggressive reformer of economic and tradepolicy in latin america .

in this light , to the extent that the welfare of chilean society has improvedwith economic openness , it may be one indication that freer trade can support a broad array ofeconomic and political goals .

it is with this approach in mind that this report integrates a discussionof chile's economic growth and development with trade policy issues raised in both the united statesand chile .

chile has become one of the most open , reformed , and developed economies in latinamerica , a rebuilding process initiated under the military dictatorship of augusto pinochet ( 1973-90 ) and accelerated under civilian government following the return of democratic rule in 1990 .

chile transformed its state - dominated economy into one grounded in market - based economicprinciples , first by stabilizing the economy and then restructuring it ( eg , lifting price controls,deregulating labor markets , privatizing state enterprises , reducing trade and exchange raterestrictions ) .

as part of the process , chile weathered some devastating domestic setbacks , includingthe 1982 economic collapse , followed by the sudden onset of the latin american debt crisis .

chilesurvived it all , however , and eventually thrived economically , although not without incurringsignificant social costs along the way .

 ( 3 ) economic reform has continued into the 21st century and actually coincided with a period ofstrong economic growth that held for most of the last decade ( see table 1 ) .

currently , chile isadjusting to the slower economic growth experienced both at home and abroad over the past twoyears .

in 2002 , chile's gross domestic product ( gdp ) rose by only 1.7% , which was higher thanmany of its neighbors .

although , this reflects a slower growth rate compared to average economicgrowth of over 5% in the late 1990s , chile's economy has proven resilient in the face a globaleconomic downturn and contagion from the argentine financial crisis .

table 1 .

chile: selected economic and financialindicators data source: international monetary fund and central bank of chile .

chile's current macroeconomic management rests on three policy pillars: a flexible exchangerate ; inflation - targeting monetary policy ; and strict fiscal discipline aimed at generating a publicsector surplus .

on the positive side , tight fiscal control has kept chile's public external debt positionrelatively low , helping restrain inflation to 2.4% in 2002 and leaving room for monetary policy tosupport economic growth as well as price stability .

productivity levels have been sufficient to seereal wage growth , as well .

on the negative side , unemployment has remained around 9% , a naggingproblem facing chilean policy makers .

trade reform began in the 1970s and helped transform the economy .

by dismantling itsmultilevel tariff schedule and reducing nontariff barriers , chile sought to engage foreign marketsmore aggressively and open itself to international competition .

the uniform average nominal importtariff rate fell from 105% in 1973 to 15% in 1988 , and to 11% in 1991 under civilian government .

chile then reduced the tariff rate by 1 percentage point each year until it reached 6% on january 1,2003 .

although not without adjustment costs , the competitive pressures of trade reform have clearlyincreased productivity and economic growth .

continuing a trend since the mid - 1980s , chile has recently made a number of simplifyingcapital market reforms , including abandoning its exchange rate band in favor of a floating system,eliminating most controls on foreign capital , including the one - year , non - remunerated reserverequirement , and reducing and equalizing capital gains treatment of domestic and foreigninvestment .

 ( 4 ) changes incapital controls and exchange rate management have been essential to spurring chile's export - ledgrowth .

privatization and deregulation have also progressed beyond financial services to includetelecommunications , energy , and selected public infrastructure , with chile also leading latinamerica in the divestiture of public - owned enterprises .

chile's record of reform , growth , and development corresponds with increased measures ofincome and social well being .

in 2001 , chile's per capita income level was second only toargentina's in latin america and will likely be first once data reflect argentina's financial crisis .

in addition , chile's human development index ( hdi ) for 2002 ranked second in latin americabehind argentina and ahead of the much larger economies of brazil and mexico .

 ( 5 ) welfare gains for the poorersegments of chilean society are also being seen , with a relatively low child mortality rate andabsolute measures of poverty declining over the past decade and registering lower than most otherlatin american countries .

 ( 6 ) high unemployment and a skewed income distribution in line withthe rest of the region , however , point to the need to increase the quality and quantity of workforceparticipation , which is related to improving education , health care , and other public policies .

over the past decade , chile's increasingly expansive and independent trade policy portraysa strategy that is commonly referred to as "open regionalism. .

this approach combines unilateralismwith the formation of sub - regional integration groups open to future expansion , such as the andeancommunity and the southern common market ( mercado comun del sur - - mercosur ) , amongothers , while also leaving open the possibility for bilateral and extra - regional trade agreements .

aspointed out in one study , it differs from earlier , fundamentally unsuccessful , attempts at economicintegration in latin america by emphasizing trade opening rather than collective sub - regionalprotectionism .

 ( 7 ) the "open regionalism" policy took shape in the early 1990s when chile signed economiccomplementarity agreements ( simplified free trade agreements ) with bolivia , mexico , venezuela,colombia , and ecuador under guidelines set out by the latin american integration association ( association latinoamericana de integracion - - aladi ) .

similar arrangements followed with peruand argentina .

chile has signed ftas with canada , mexico , and central america .

in april andoctober 2002 respectively , chile completed negotiations for an fta with the european union andsouth korea .

it is currently courting other countries including japan , new zealand , and singapore,and closing in on an agreement with the european free trade association ( efta ) , see appendixd .

all are considered part of a strategy to open industrial economies further to chilean exports .

chile joined mercosur as an associate member in 1996 , limiting its commitment largely because ofmercosur's higher common external tariff .

chile is also an active participant in the world tradeorganization ( wto ) , seeing it as the venue to settle controversial issues less suited to regional orbilateral discussions .

figure 1 .

growth in chilean trade with majorpartners , 1993-2001 trade data reflect chile's open and independent trade policy .

its exports to the worldexpanded by 89% over the eight years 1993-2001 ( see figure 1 ) and imports grew by 56% .

although chile is not part of the andean community or a full partner of mercosur , its fastest exportgrowth has been intra - regional , a testament to chile's trade strategy that combines unilateralreductions in tariff and nontariff barriers with an aggressive effort to enter into bilateralarrangements .

from 1993 to 2001 , chilean exports expanded by 126% to latin america , comparedto 100% to the united states , 43% to japan , 70% to the rest of asia , and 71% to the europeanunion .

chile's trade with canada points to another interesting trend .

although the dollar value ofexports is very small , it grew by some 380% , an issue that was not lost on many u.s. businessadvocates of a u.s. - chile fta , who argued that the chile - canada fta put u.s. firms at acompetitive disadvantage until a similar or better agreement could be reached with the united states .

figure 2 .

chile direction of trade , 2002 as seen in figure 2 , chile has diversified export markets , which not only increasesopportunities for trade , but also reduces dependence on a few markets and thereby softens exposureto foreign shocks ( e.g .

argentina ) .

its largest export market is the european union , which accountedfor 23% of exports in 2002 , followed by the united states with 20% , and latin america with 19% .

japan accounted for 11% of chilean exports and the rest of asia 17% .

these figures reflect somerelative change over the past decade , as seen in the growth patterns in figure 1 .

there was adecrease in the european union's and japan's share of chilean exports , as well as to latin america .

although chile's exports to latin america had been rising during the 1990s , slow regional growthat the turn of the century reduced its export market share .

the export shares to asia and the unitedstates , two areas that have experienced relatively faster growth , have risen recently .

there was alsoa large increase in chilean export share to canada , although from a very small base .

latin america is chile's largest importing area , accounting for 35% of imports , followed bythe eu with 18% , the united states with 15% , and asia with 13% .

japan and canada follow at adistance with 3% and 2% , respectively .

the eu trade presence in chile has declined over the pastdecade , as it did with other latin american countries .

the relative importance of the united statessuggests that chile has had a strong incentive to pursue a bilateral fta , other than a generalpreference for expanding its export base .

chile's open regionalism and export driven trade policy have been challenged , however , fornot focusing enough on diversifying the country away from minimally refined agriculture and miningproducts ( copper , fish , grapes , and wood ) .

manufactured products account for less than 15% of totalexports , suggesting two potential problems .

first , relying on traditional commodities can providestrong export earnings , but earnings are unpredictable given the volatile nature of commodity prices ( see chile's swings in its terms of trade in table 1 ) .

 ( 8 ) second , little movement toward a manufacture - based , value - added approach to exportpromotion can limit long - term economic growth , a point developed by an inter - americandevelopment bank ( idb ) study arguing that the relatively poor income growth performance ofcommodity exporting countries can be traced to this lack of export diversification .

although manylatin american countries have expanded their intra - regional trade , deepening integration withdeveloped economies seems necessary to achieve greater export diversification .

the large gains in export manufactures of mexico and the central american countries in the1990s , for example , were related , in some measure , to preferential trade arrangements with theunited states .

other latin american countries had much slower growth of manufacturedexports .

 ( 9 ) whether chilewill adopt export diversification as part of its long - term development strategy is unclear , but chile'sefforts to develop trade relationships with developed economies , including the u.s. - chile fta,would seem to be an important component of such a goal .

on chile's import side , most from developed countries are capital goods , highlighting thelink between an open trade policy ( lower tariffs on capital goods ) and development ( capital goodsform the investment base for other production ) .

importantly , there is strong competition in thechilean capital goods market from firms around the world .

given chile's many trade negotiationsunderway , there was pressure exerted by u.s. firms to expedite the chile - fta .

a closer look at thestructure of u.s. - chile trade suggests there is potential for mutual benefit from strengthening tradeties between the two countries .

the united states is chile's largest single - country trading partner , accounting for 20% ofchilean exports and 15% of imports in 2002 .

by contrast , chile is the united states' 34th largestexport destination and 36th largest import contributor , accounting for 0.3% of u.s. trade ( 2002 data ) .

chile's relatively small share of u.s. trade has actually slipped slightly in recent years , but itsincreasing openness to u.s. trade is evident in the numbers .

in 2002 , chile's per capita imports fromthe united states were $163 , higher than other major south american countries considered lessliberalized in their trade policies such as argentina ( $44 ) and brazil ( $71 ) .

 ( 10 ) figure 3 .

u.s. - chile merchandise trade , 1992-2002 trends in u.s. - chile merchandise trade are shown in figure 3 ( data appear in appendix b ) and mirror the trend in chile's economic growth .

u.s. exports grew significantly in the first half ofthe last decade , rising by 77% from 1992 to 1997 .

after that , they fell precipitously for two years,coinciding with the precipitous fall in chile's economic growth from 7.4% in both 1996 and 1997to 3.4 % in 1998 and - 1.1% in 1999 ( see table 1 ) .

as economic growth picked up again in 2000,rising to 5.4% , so too did the demand for u.s. goods , but economic and u.s. export trends falteredagain in 2001 and 2002 , with the united states running a merchandise trade deficit with chile forthe first time since 1988 .

in 2002 , u.s. exports were not much above levels ten years earlier .

thispattern parallels declining exports levels to latin america , as a whole , reflecting weaker economicconditions and therefore demand for imports in general .

u.s. imports from chile have grown steadily since 1992 , reflecting continuing u.s. interestin chilean products and the extended expansion of the u.s. economy .

u.s. imports grew by 172%from 1992 to 2002 , a higher rate of import growth than from either latin america , excluding mexico ( 107% ) , or the world ( 118% ) .

the united states maintained a trade surplus with chile from 1989until 2000 ; in 2001 the trade balance turned to a deficit equal to 6% of total trade between the twocountries and 18% in 2002 .

major u.s. products exported to chile are mostly capital goods ( see appendix c ) .

theseinclude: machinery ( 31% ) , particularly computers , office machinery , and industrial equipment suchas gas turbines and bulldozers ; electrical machinery ( 16% ) including television and radiotransmission apparatus , telephone equipment , spare parts , integrated circuits , sound recordingequipment and media ; vehicles ( 8% ) mostly trucks and passenger cars ; aircraft and parts ( 5% ) , andoptical / medical instruments ( 5% ) .

in recent years , the u.s. export trends have exhibited a slowingin transportation equipment such as airplanes and automobiles , and an increase in computer andelectronic equipment relative to other goods .

the top five u.s. imports from chile are natural resource based goods that reflect somerefining of the basic resource , but little value - added manufacturing activity .

they account for nearly70% of total imports from chile and include: copper articles ( 19% ) , mostly refined alloys ; ediblefruits and nuts ( 18% ) , most of which are grapes ; fish ( 15% ) , mostly salmon ; wood ( 13% ) , varioustypes of lumber ; and beverages ( 4% ) , virtually all wine .

recent trends have seen an increase in grapeand fish imports , with a steady level or slight decline in demand for copper , wood , and wine productsrelative to other goods .

the congressional debate over trade agreements invariably turns to their potential economiceffects on the united states , including both aggregate macroeconomic , as well as , sectoral effects .

assessing these effects is the responsibility of the united states international trade commission ( itc ) , which in june 2003 released a comprehensive study as part of the congressional consultationprocess .

the report provides both quantitative and qualitative estimates of the fta's possibleimpact .

the overall estimate of the itc study was that by 2016 , when the full effect of the tariffeliminations would be felt , u.s. exports to chile would increase in a range between 18% and 52% ; u.s. imports would rise between 6% and 14% .

the study noted that this would be very smallrelative to total u.s. trade and that the economy - wide effects on trade , production , and overalleconomic welfare would be small to negligible ( in a range of negative 0.001% to a positive 0.003%of gdp ) .

this is in keeping with general expectations from the outset of the negotiations thatrecognized the limited benefits that could be achieved by the fta given chile is already a relativelysmall open economy with a relatively small trade position with the united states .

the itc finding,however , serves as an estimate of confirmation , focusing largely on the implications of tariffreduction , which may be quantified , unlike changes in many nontariff barriers .

 ( 11 ) the rest of this section briefly summarizes the major policy issues that had to be reconciledin the negotiating process and references the itc's conclusions with respect to each major issue area,where applicable .

in recent years , the united states has signed bilateral ftas with jordan , singapore , andchile .

all three have common elements , but each reflects country specific issues .

a recurringquestion for the u.s. congress with respect to the trade negotiation process has been , to what extentdoes one agreement become a model for another ? .

for example , when the u.s. - chile fta wassigned in december 2002 , united states trade representative robert zoellick announced that itcould serve as a "template" for u.s. - central american free trade agreement ( cafta ) .

 ( 24 ) as the 108th congress considered the u.s. - chile fta implementing legislation , a few issuesbecame highly controversial and some members suggested that some language in this agreementshould not be considered as a model for future ftas .

one or more of these issues were raised inhearings before the house ways and means and senate finance committees , as well as bothjudiciary committees .

this section provides a brief summary of the relevant provisions in theu.s. - chile fta and amplifies the debate over three controversial aspects of the agreement .
