president carter's 1978 energy tax act introduced the excise tax exemption for alcohol fuelblends ( at 100% of the gasoline tax , which was then 4â¢ / gallon ) to achieve energy and , more recently,certain environmental and agricultural policy objectives .

 ( 1 ) in 2004 this exemption , which was 5.2â¢ / gallon and was scheduledto decline to 5.1â¢ on january 1 , 2005 , reduced the gasoline excise tax for "gasohol," from 18.4â¢ to13.2â¢ / gallon .

the reduction was realized at the time when the gasoline tax was otherwise imposed:typically when the fuel was loaded from the terminal onto trucks for distribution .

the 5.2â¢exemption could also be claimed later ( i.e. , when blenders filed their income tax return ) as a 52â¢excise tax credit per gallon of alcohol used to make a fuel mixture , which was also scheduled todecline to 51â¢ in tandem with the exemption on january 1 , 2005 .

from 1978-2004 , this exemptionfrom the motor fuels excise taxes provided the major subsidy to the ethanol fuel industry - - withoutthe exemption the ethanol fuels industry would either not exist or be substantially smaller .

 ( 2 ) the exemption , however , which effectively lowered the excise tax on the blended fuel,reduced revenues for the highway trust fund by an estimated $14 , 000 million through fy2004.as a consequence , the congress enacted the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-357 ) ,also known as the "jobs bill," which restructured the basic tax subsidy for alcohol fuels .

it replacedthe excise tax exemption with a new excise tax credit: the "alcohol fuel mixtures excise tax credit .

"although , the two incentives are equivalent in gross , before - tax terms - - they are both equal to 51â¢per gallon of ethanol - - interactions between the excise tax credit and the income tax system increasethe value of the incentives under this restructured or reformed system .

in addition to the new"alcohol fuel mixtures excise tax credit," current federal tax law provides for a small ethanolproducer credit , and several other tax incentives that , although little used , might further benefitalcohol fuels in the future .

the senate version of h.r .

6 , the energy policy act of 2005 , proposes to notonly expand the small ethanol producer credit , but to introduce a renewable fuels standard ( whichis effectively an ethanol standard ) , a requirement that gasoline suppliers ( refiners and blenders ) blendat least 8 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year in producing gasoline .

such a requirement , ifenacted , would more than double the amount of ethanol blended with gasoline above the currentprojected baseline level of ethanol use , and significantly increase federal tax revenue losses .

this report explains the provisions of the new alcohol fuels mixtures tax credit and comparesthe tax benefits under the new credit with the tax benefits under the old exemption .

an exampleillustrates the mechanics of the new credit and compares it with the old exemption .

the secondsection examines the revenue and highway trust fund implications of the new tax incentive bothwith and without a renewable fuels standard .

the final section discusses the remaining three taxsubsidies for alcohol fuels , which , although little used , are nevertheless part of the current federaltax laws and might be used in the future .

under the new alcohol fuels mixtures tax credit , â§40 of the internal revenue code ( irc ) ,gasohol blenders may claim a 51â¢ / gallon tax credit for alcohol used to produce a qualified mixture ( a mixture of alcohol and gasoline , or a mixture of alcohol and any other special motor fuel ) .

 ( 3 ) unlike most tax credits , which are claimed against income tax liability ( because the incometax otherwise owed is reduced or "credited" by the amount of the credit ) , the new alcohol mixturescredit is claimed against the motor fuels ( gasoline ) excise tax .

however , both approaches reduce theeffective excise tax burden on each gallon of ethanol used to make a 90:10 gallon of a mixture bythe same amount - - 5.1â¢ / gallon of a blend or 51â¢ / gallon of ethanol - - regardless of whether thereduction is called a tax credit or excise tax exemption .

this new excise tax credit , which becameeffective on january 1 , 2005 , will replace the old excise tax exemption as the basic tax incentiveclaimed on most sales of fuel ethanol - - it will provide the biggest subsidy to the industry .

 ( 4 ) as under the previous exemption , to qualify for the full 51â¢ tax credit , the alcohol must beat least 190 proof ( 95% pure alcohol , determined without regard to any added denaturants orimpurities ) .

the credit is 37.78â¢ per gallon if the ethanol is between 150 and 190 proof ; no creditis provided for alcohol below 150 proof .

this mixture credit is available only to the blender , whomust not only produce the mixture but must either use the mixture as a motor fuel in a trade orbusiness or sell it for use as a fuel .

the blender may be the producer , the terminal operator , or thewholesaler , distributor , or marketer .

technically , both ethanol and methanol qualify for theexemption as long as they are not derived from petroleum , natural gas , coal , or peat .

in practice,however , virtually all fuel alcohol is ethanol produced from corn ; very little , if any , methanol isproduced from wood and other biomass ( or renewable ) sources because it is generallyuneconomic .

 ( 5 ) currentlymost methanol is produced from natural gas , is too expensive as a blended motor fuel and does notqualify for the tax breaks .

as did the exemption before it , the new federal tax credit for alcohol fuels also applies tocertain fuel additives called oxygenates , provided they are produced from renewables such as cornand not from fossil fuels such as natural gas .

etbe is a compound derived from a chemical reactionbetween ethanol and isobutylene ( a byproduct of both the petroleum refining process and natural gasliquids ) .

 ( 6 ) in this reaction,the ethanol is chemically transformed and is not present as a separate chemical in the final product .

in 1995 , the irs ruled that blends of etbe ( ethyl tertiary butyl ether ) and gasoline would alsoqualify for the reduced partial excise tax exemption .

in effect these rulings ensured that theoxygenate required under the clean air act would also qualify for the tax subsidies .

allowingetbe to qualify for this tax exemption was intended to further stimulate the production of ethanol .

allowing etbe to qualify for the federal tax subsidies reduces the growth of mtbe ( methyl tertiarybutyl ether ) , its main competitor .

etbe costs more to produce and therefore , without the taxsubsidies , could not otherwise compete with the less costly mtbe .

the recent banning andphasing - out of mtbe by many states ( california , new york , and connecticut , and others ) reducesthe competitive advantage of mtbe and also increases the demand for ethanol as an oxygenate .

 ( 7 ) the credit for methanol .

the mixtures credit isalso available for methanol blended with gasoline at the rate of 60â¢ per gallon of methanol - - theequivalent of 6.0â¢ on 90:10 blends - - if the alcohol is at least 190 proof , and 45â¢ if the methanol isbetween 150 and 190 proof .

no credit is available for either ethanol or methanol that is less than 150proof .

as noted above , the alcohol in methanol cannot be produced from any fossil fuels - - it mustbe produced from organic or biomass materials .

from fy1932 , when it was first enacted , until fy2003 , the gasoline tax has generated over$400,000 million in gross tax revenues ; billions more have been generated from the tax on diesel andother special highway motor fuels .

 ( 13 ) net revenues have been about 25% , or about $100,000 million,less due to the deductibility of the excise taxes as a cost of doing business , leaving a net total ofabout $300,000 million .

in fy2003 , the year for which the latest data are available , the gasoline tax alone generated$20,100 million in tax revenues for the highway trust fund ; $8.6 billion more were generated fromthe excise tax on diesel ; and millions more were generated from the excise taxes on other highwaymotor fuels .

in total , the htf collected $33,700 billion in excise tax receipts in fy2003 , about 90%from motor fuels taxes and most of that from the gasoline tax .

 ( 14 ) these totals includereceipts generated from the taxation of gasoline blended with alcohol , almost all ethanol , whichtotaled in gross terms about $4,100 million in fy2003 ( about $3,000 million net due to about $1,000million in income tax offsets ) .

but , while the excise tax on gasoline alcohol blends generated billions in tax revenue , thelower tax rate due to the exemptions ( a tax rate of 13.1â¢ in 2003 due to an exemption of 5.3â¢ ; a taxrate of 13.2â¢ in 2004 due to an exemption of 5.2â¢ ) meant that these blends did not generate as muchrevenue for the htf as they would have otherwise had the ethanol blends been taxed at the same rateas pure ( unblended ) gasoline .

from 1978 , when the excise tax exemption for alcohol fuels was firstenacted , to fy2004 , it is estimated that the exemption cost the federal treasury approximately$14,000 million in foregone federal revenues in net terms ( i.e. , gross excise tax receipts less incometax receipts ) .

gross receipts ( i.e , losses to the htf ) would have been about $18,600 million .

forfy2003 , for example , had ethanol blends been taxed at 18.4â¢ / gallon ( instead of the actual13.1â¢ / gallon because the exemption was 5.3â¢ / gallon ) , gross revenues for the htf would have beenabout $1,400 million higher .

the net revenue loss was $350 million or 25% less , again because thelower tax rate implied a smaller income tax offset .

the above effects on the htf exclude additional losses in receipts due to a tax codeprovision , enacted in 1990 and repealed by the 2004 jobs bill , which allocated 2.5â¢ of the taxableportion of the excise tax on ethanol blends ( the 13.1â¢ in 2003 ) to remain in the general fund .

ircâ§9503 ( b ) provided that part of the taxable portion of the tax on gasohol blends ( the 13.1â¢ for 90:10blends , the 14.342â¢ for 92.3:7.7 blends , and the 15.422â¢ for 94.3:5.7 blends ) was not allocated tothe htf in 2003 , but was instead allocated into the general fund .

more specifically , for the 90 / 10blends , the law in 2003 provided that 3.1â¢ of the 13.1â¢ tax remain in the general fund ; for blendscontaining less than 10% ethanol , 2.5â¢ remains in the general fund and is not allocated into the htf .

for 2003 about $700 million was allocated to the general fund instead of the htf under thisprovision .

thus the total htf revenue loss resulting from the alcohol fuels exemption was about$2,100 million for fy2003 .

although the new alcohol fuels mixtures excise tax credit will , as the exemption before it,become the major tax incentive for ethanol fuels , there are also others .

this technical appendix calculates the economic or subsidy value of the new alcohol fuelsexcise tax credit as compared to the old excise tax exemption and the non - subsidized 100% gasoline .

that subsidy value is measured as the difference in marginal costs for a profit - maximizing gasolinesupplier .

pre - income tax profits , with a unit excise tax , such as a gasoline tax , is: ( 1 ) where p is price , q is output , c ( q ) is a total cost function , and t 1 is a unit excise tax .

maximizing before - tax profits with respect to output qleads to the following condition: ( 2 ) which implies that , ( 3 ) i.e. , profit maximization leads the firm to produce at that point where price p is equal to the marginalcost c' ( q ) and the excise tax t 1 .

in other words , in a competitive market , a profit maximizing firmfacing a unit tax on gasoline faces a higher marginal cost curve by the amount of the tax - - themarginal cost curve shifts up ( or is higher than the non - taxed marginal costs ) by 18.4â¢ / gallon .

a pure income or profits tax t is completely neutral ( it does not affect the profit maximizinglevel of output ) under these conditions , as is shown next .

 ( 4 ) ( 5 ) which implies that , ( 6 ) equation ( 6 ) is the same as equation ( 3 ) because the ( 1 - t ) term cancels - - the equilibrium level ofoutput and price is unaffected by the pure business income tax even with the imposition of a unit tax,such as the 18.4â¢ gasoline tax .

now , however , assume that there are two unit excise taxes , t 1 is the excise tax per gallonactually paid , and t 2 is the excise tax rate deductible for purposes of the income tax .

then , theafter - tax profit function becomes: ( 7 ) ( 8 ) finding the level of q that maximizes profits lead to the following condition: ( 9 ) which reduces to: ( 10 ) where p and c' ( q ) are , as before , price and marginal costs , and [ t 1 - t â· t 2 ] / ( 1- t ) is the shift in themarginal cost curve after allowance for the deductibility of excise taxes as an expense against theincome tax .

to illustrate , when a gasoline distributor is paying 18.4â¢ / gallon ( t 1 = 18.4â¢ ) , and deductingthe same amount against the income tax ( t 2 = 18.4â¢ ) then the tax terms in equation ( 10 ) become: ( 11 ) note that because t 1 = t 2 the ( 1 - t ) terms cancel and the shift in marginal cost is simply t 1 = 18.4â¢ .

this is also true when a gasoline blender is paying 13.3â¢ because of the exemption - - the blender isalso deducting 13.3â¢ against the income tax and the shift or increase in marginal costs equals theamount of the tax , 13.3â¢ .

however , when t 1 and t 2 differ , as they do under the new restructured alcohol fuels taxincentives , then the shift in marginal costs is defined by equation ( 10 ) .

under present law , i.e. , sincejanuary 1 , 2005 , t 1 = 13.3â¢ , but t 2 = 18.4â¢ .

thus , assuming the marginal corporate income tax rateis 25% ( t = .25 ) , the tax term in equation ( 10 ) - - the shift or increase in marginal costs - - becomes: ( 12 ) 13.3â¢ - .25 ( 18.4â¢ ) / ( 1 - .25 ) ( 13 ) = 13.3â¢ - 4.6â¢ / .75 ( 14 ) = 11.6â¢ that represents the increase in marginal costs under the new alcohol fuels excise tax credit ( row 4,column 3 in table 1 ) .

this is 6.8â¢ less than the increase under the gasoline tax , and 1.7â¢ less thenthe increase in costs under the old exemption ( the subsidy value is 6.8â¢ / gallon rather than5.1â¢ / gallon ) .
