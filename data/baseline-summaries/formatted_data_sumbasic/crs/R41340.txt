on april 14 , 2011 , the house and the senate passed h.r .

1473 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act of 2011 , which the president signed into law ( p.l .

112-10 ) the following day .

the house and the senate financial services and general government ( fsgg ) subcommittees considered their own appropriations bills and voted on a series of continuing resolutions ( crs ) before h.r .

1473 was enacted .

to simplify the presentation of fy2011 appropriations legislation , table 1 , below , reflects only the status of h.r .

1473 at key points in the appropriations process .

the house and senate committees on appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures in early 2007 .

each chamber created a new fsgg subcommittee .

in the house , the jurisdiction of the fsgg subcommittee was formed primarily of agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on transportation , treasury , housing and urban development , the judiciary , the district of columbia , and independent agencies , commonly referred to as "tthud. .

in addition , the house fsgg subcommittee was assigned four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies subcommittee .

in the senate , the jurisdiction of the new fsgg subcommittee was a combination of agencies from the jurisdiction of three previously existing subcommittees .

the district of columbia , which had its own subcommittee in the 109 th congress , was placed under the purview of the fsgg subcommittee , as were four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies subcommittee .

additionally , most of the agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on transportation , treasury , the judiciary , housing and urban development , and related agencies were assigned to the fsgg subcommittee .

as a result of this reorganization , the house and senate fsgg subcommittees have nearly identical jurisdictions .

on february 1 , 2010 , president obama issued his fy2011 fsgg budget request , which included $48.219 billion , an increase of $1.785 billion over fy2010 appropriations .

on july 29 , 2010 , senator durbin introduced , and the senate appropriations committee approved , s. 3677 , the financial services and general government appropriations act , 2011 .

s. 3677 would provide $48.296 billion for fy2011 , an increase of $1.862 billion above fy2010 appropriations and $77 million above the president's request .

on february 11 , 2011 , representative harold rogers introduced h.r .

1 , which the house passed on february 19 , 2011 .

h.r .

1 would have provided fsgg agencies with $43.298 billion for fy2011 , $3.136 billion below fy2010 enacted appropriations and $4.921 billion below the president's request .

at the outset of fy2011 , the government operated on funds appropriated through a series crs .

the first four crs generally provided funding at fy2010 levels , but subsequent crs reduced funding below fy2010 levels for many agencies and programs .

on april 15 , 2011 , president obama signed h.r .

1473 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act of 2011 , into law ( p.l .

112-10 ) .

the authority for congressional review and approval of the district of columbia's budget is derived from the constitution and the district of columbia self - government and government reorganization act of 1973 ( home rule act ) .

the constitution gives congress the power to "exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever" pertaining to the district of columbia .

in 1973 , congress granted the city limited home rule authority and empowered citizens of the district to elect a mayor and city council .

however , congress retained the authority to review and approve all district laws , including the district's annual budget .

as required by the home rule act , the city council must approve a budget within 56 days after receiving a budget proposal from the mayor .

the approved budget must then be transmitted to the president , who forwards it to congress for its review , modification , and approval .

on april 1 , 2010 , the mayor of the district of columbia submitted a proposed $10.4 billion general operating fund budget , including enterprise funds , to the district of columbia council .

also , on april 1 , 2010 , the mayor forwarded to the council for its approval a proposed plan intended to address a projected $230 million budget shortfall for fy2010 .

both the president and congress may propose financial assistance to the district in the form of special federal payments in support of specific activities or priorities .

table 7 shows details of the district's special federal payments , including the fy2010 enacted amounts , the amounts included in the president's fy2011 budget request , the amounts provided under h.r .

in fy2011 a collection of more than two dozen independent entities are slated to receive funding through the fsgg appropriations bill .

table 8 lists fsgg appropriations as enacted for fy2010 , as requested by the president for fy2011 , as approved by the house for fy2011 , amounts recommended by the senate committee on appropriations for fy2011 , and enacted amounts for fy2011 in h.r .

the financial services and general government appropriations language includes general provisions which apply either government - wide or to specific agencies or programs .

an administration's proposed government - wide general provisions for a fiscal year are generally included in the budget appendix .

most of the provisions continue language that has appeared under the general provisions title for several years because congress has decided to reiterate the language rather than making the provisions permanent .

the fy2011 budget proposed , however , discontinuing some of the government - wide general provisions that were included in p.l .

111-117 , the consolidated appropriations act for fy2010 .

the provisions proposed to be discontinued ( the section numbers refer to the provisions as they were included in p.l .

111-117 ) and whether they are included in s. 3677 , as reported , are listed below .

if enacted , section 517 of s. 3677 would clarify the authorized purposes of the acquisition workforce training fund .

currently , the authorized purpose is to "support the training of the acquisition workforce of the executive agencies. .

by implementing section 517 , the authorized purposes of the fund would change to include fostering and promoting the development of the federal government's acquisition workforce , collecting and analyzing acquisition workforce data , and , as directed by the head of the office of federal procurement policy , performing other research or career management functions .

section 728 , as it appears in the president's fy2011 budget request , would prohibit the use of any funds appropriated by this act , or any other appropriations act for the same fiscal year ( fy2011 ) , to begin or announce a public - private competition .

the prohibition would apply to a "public - private competition regarding the conversion to contractor performance of any function performed by federal employees pursuant to office of management and budget circular a - 76 or any other administrative regulation , directive , or policy. .

that is , this section apparently would apply only to competitions that involve work being performed by federal employees , but it would not apply to public - private competitions involving work being performed by contractor employees .

conversion to contractor performance is only one of the possible outcomes of a public - private competition , however , which might lead some observers to conclude that the provision is somewhat ambiguous .

this provision is the same as section 735 of p.l .

111-117 .

while details are not yet available , the senate appropriations committee's report on s. 3677 suggests that section 734 contains a prohibition similar to the one found in section 728 ( see above ) .

section 741 of s. 3677 would , if implemented , make technical modifications to section 743 of p.l .

111-117 , which requires executive agencies to compile inventories of their service contracts .

technical changes to section 743 ( a ) ( 3 ) and section 743 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( g ) , respectively , would do the following: expand the inventory contents to include task orders awarded pursuant to service contracts , and specify how to determine the number and work location of contractor and subcontractor employees .

whereas section 743 ( e ) ( 2 ) ( b ) of p.l .

111-117 directs each agency to give "special management attention to functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions," the technical change effected by section 741 would require each agency to ensure that service "contracts exclude to the maximum extent practicable functions that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions. .

finally , section 741 would establish a requirement for a new report .

an executive agency could not begin , plan for , or announce a public - private competition involving the conversion of a function performed by government employees to contractor performance until after it has submitted a report to omb .

the report would include "actions taken to convert from contractor to federal employee performance functions that are not inherently governmental , closely associated with governmental functions , critical , or should not otherwise be reserved for performance by federal employees. .

since the early 1960s , u.s. policy toward communist cuba has consisted largely of efforts to isolate the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions , including prohibitions on u.s. financial transactions — the cuban assets control regulations ( cacr ) — that are administered by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) .

despite current u.s. economic sanctions policy , some u.s. commercial agricultural exports to cuba have been allowed since 2001 pursuant to the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 , or tsra ( title ix of p.l .

106-387 ) .

however , there are numerous restrictions and licensing requirements for these exports .

for instance , exporters are denied access to u.s. private commercial financing or credit , and all transactions must be paid for in cash in advance or with financing from third countries .

the bush administration tightened sanctions on cuba in february 2005 by further restricting how u.s. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product .

ofac amended the cacr to clarify that the term "payment of cash in advance" for u.s. agricultural sales to cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods .

this differed from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods , a practice that had been utilized by many u.s. agricultural exporters to cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001 .

u.s. agricultural exporters and some members of congress strongly objected to this "clarification" on the grounds that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of tsra , and could jeopardize millions of dollars in u.s. agricultural sales to cuba .

then ofac director robert werner maintained that the clarification "conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade. .

since 2002 , the united states has been one of cuba's largest suppliers of food and agricultural products .

cuba has purchased over $3.5 billion in agricultural products from the united states since late 2001 .

overall u.s exports to cuba rose from about $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004 and to a high of $712 million in 2008 , far higher than in previous years , in part because of the rise in food prices and because of cuba's increased food needs in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms that severely damaged the country's agricultural sector .

in 2009 , however , u.s. exports to cuba declined to $533 million , 25% lower than the previous year .

the decline was largely related to cuba's shortage of hard currency .

in 2010 , u.s. agricultural exports to cuba fell to $370 million , a 30% drop from 2009 .

analysts again cite cuba's shortage of hard currency as the main reason for the decline .

in december 2009 , congress took action in the fy2010 omnibus appropriations measure ( section 619 of division c of the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 , p.l .

111-117 ) to define , during fy2010 , "payment of cash in advance" as used in tsra as payment before the transfer of title to , and control of , the exported items to the cuban purchaser .

this overturned ofac's february 2005 clarification that payment had to be received before vessels could leave u.s. ports .

supporters of the provision maintained that it restored congressional intent on the matter , and would make it easier for u.s. agricultural producers to export to cuba , while opponents maintained that the provision constituted a foreign policy change included in a must - pass spending bill without appropriate congressional consideration .

the administration issued regulations implementing this provision in early march 2010 .

the regulations maintained that the definition applied to items delivered by september 30 , 2010 , or delivered pursuant to a contract entered into by september 30 , 2010 , and shipped within 12 months of the signing of the contract .

for fy2011 , the senate appropriations committee - reported version of the financial services and general government appropriations bill , s. 3677 ( s.rept .

111-238 ) included , in section 621 , a provision that would continue to define during fy2011 "payment of cash in advance" under tsra as payment before the transfer of title to , and control of , the exported items to the cuban purchaser .

no further action was taken on the bill .

while the house appropriations committee version of the bill was not officially introduced , it reportedly would have included a provision similar to that in the senate bill that would continue to clarify the requirement for payment of cash in advance for agricultural goods sold to cuba under tsra .

while the 111 th congress did not complete action on the fy2011 financial services and general government appropriations measure , it approved a series of short - term continuing resolutions and then in april 2011 ultimately approved a full - year measure ( p.l .

112-10 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act of 2011 ) under conditions provided in enacted fy2010 appropriations measures .

this essentially continued the "payment of cash in advance" provision until through fy2011 .

several legislative initiatives introduced in the 111 th congress would have permanently changed the definition of "payment of cash in advance" for export sales to cuba under tsra , but no action was completed on these measures .

most notably , on june 30 , 2010 , the house agriculture committee reported out h.r .

4645 ( peterson ) , which would have permanently changed the definition of "payment of cash in advance," allowed direct transfers between u.s. and cuban financial institutions for payment for products sold to cuba under tsra , and also would have lifted all restrictions on travel to cuba .

the house committee on foreign affairs was scheduled to hold a markup of the bill on september 29 , 2010 , but postponed its consideration , and in the aftermath of the november 2010 u.s. legislative elections no further action was taken .
