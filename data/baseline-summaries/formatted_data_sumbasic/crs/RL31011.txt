on december 20 , 2001 , congress cleared for the president's signature a$15.35 billion foreign operations appropriations for fy2002 ( h.r .

2506 ) .

president bush signed the measure on january 10 , 2002 ( p.l .

107-115 ) .

passage of the bill broke a month - long impasse over house - senate disagreementsconcerning international family planning and abortion issues .

as enacted , h.r .

2506 drops senate language that would have overturned thepresident's abortion restrictions on bilateral u.s. population assistance , butappropriates funding for family planning programs closer to the higher amountsrecommended by the senate: $446.5 million for usaid activities and $34 million forthe u.n. population fund ( unfpa ) .

subsequently , the white house placed a holdon unfpa funds while it reviews the organization's program in china .

no decisionon how much , if any , of the $34 million will be released has been made .

the $15.35 billion appropriation is roughly midway between levels passed earlier by the house ( $15.17 billion ) and the senate ( $15.52 billion ) , and $178million higher than requested by the president .

this marks one of the few occasionswhen congress has approved more spending for foreign operations than sought bythe administration .

the amount is about $400 million , or 2.7% higher than forfy2001 ( excluding the $1.1 billion for foreign operations programs allocated fromthe terrorism emergency supplemental measure ; p.l .

107-38 ) .

highlights of theenacted bill include: $779 million for the export - import bank , nearly $100 millionmore than requested ; $475 million for hiv / aids , up from the $429 million proposal ; and $625 million for the andean counternarcotics initiative , a cut of $106 millionfrom the request .

h.r .

2506 further allows the president to waiverestrictions on aid to azerbaijan through at least december 31 , 2002 .

azerbaijanis one of several regional states that has offered support in the war againstterrorism .

the measure also provides armenia with $90 million in economic aid and$4.3 million in military assistance .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislativevehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the u.s. foreign assistancebudget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally .

 ( 1 ) it containsthe largest share - - about two - thirds - - of total international affairs spending by theunited states ( see figure 1 ) .

the legislation funds all u.s. bilateral developmentassistance programs , managed mostly by the u.s. agency for internationaldevelopment ( usaid ) , together with several smaller independent foreign aidagencies , such as the peace corps and the inter - american and african developmentfoundations .

most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations,including usaid's disaster program and the state department's refugee reliefsupport .

 ( 2 ) foreign operations includes separateaccounts for aid programs in theformer soviet union ( also referred to as the independent states account ) andcentral / eastern europe , activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the statedepartment .

security assistance ( economic and military aid ) for israel and egypt isalso part of the foreign operations spending measure , as are smaller security aidprograms administered largely by the state department , in conjunction with usaidand the pentagon .

u.s. contributions to the world bank and other regionalmultilateral development banks , managed by the treasury department , and voluntarypayments to international organizations , handled by the state department , are alsofunded in the foreign operations bill .

finally , the legislation includes appropriationsfor three export promotion agencies: the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) , the export - import bank , and the trade and development agency .

from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in u.s.foreign aid policymaking , the foreign operations bill has taken on even greatersignificance during the past 16 years .

congress has not enacted a foreign aidauthorization bill since 1985 , leaving most foreign assistance programs withoutregular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees .

as aresult , foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriationscommittees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues andplayed a major role in shaping , authorizing , and guiding both executive andcongressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives .

it has been largelythrough foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aidpolicy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war .

thelegislation has also been a key tool used by congress to apply restrictions andconditions on administration management of foreign assistance , actions that havefrequently resulted in executive - legislative clashes over presidential prerogatives inforeign policy making .

 table 1 .

status of foreign operationsappropriations , fy2002 president bush submitted his fy2002 federal budget request to congress on april 9 , 2001 , including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriationsprograms .

house and senate appropriations committees are holding hearings on theproposal prior to marking up funding legislation .

the house foreign operationssubcommittee adopted a draft spending bill on june 27 , a measure that was amendedand approved by the full appropriations committee on july 10 .

the bill - - h.r .

2506 - - was reported on july 17 .

the house passed h.r .

2506 on july 24 after adopting several amendments .

the senateappropriations committee ordered reported its fy2002 foreign operationsappropriations measure on july 26 , but did not file its report until september 4 .

thesenate passed h.r .

2506 on october 24 , adopting numerousamendments , including some addressing anti - terrorism issues .

conferees met onnovember 14 to work out differences between the two bills , but could not finalizea few issues in dispute until december 19 when a conference report was filed .

thehouse passed the conference measure on the same day ( 356-66 ) , while the senateadopted it on december 20 by voice vote .

president bush signed the legislation onjanuary 10 , 2002 ( p.l .

107-115 ) .

earlier , the senate , as part of h.r .

2216 ( fy2001 supplemental appropriations act ) , voted to include $100 million for an initial u.s. contributionto a new global fund to fight hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis .

confereesapproved the additional $100 million for the global fund , partially offsetting the newresources with $20 million rescissions in prior year child survival and esfappropriations .

congress cleared the measure on july 20 ( p.l .

107-20 ) .

theadministration requested $200 million , $100 million of which would be drawn fromforeign operations spending , but for fy2002 , not from fy2001 as p.l .

107-20 provided .

in real terms , taking into account the effects of inflation , foreign operationsfunding levels have fluctuated widely over the past 25 years .

some of these swings,however , are not the result of policy decisions , but due to technical budgetaccounting changes involving how congress "scores" various programs .

forexample , the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels , butrather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriationsrather than as "off - budget" items .

part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985came as a result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aidloans rather than only a partial appropriation required in the past .

beginning infy1992 , congress changed how all federal credit programs are "scored" inappropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded inforeign operations .

all of these factors make it very difficult to present a precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels .

nevertheless , the data shown infigure 2 can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisionsregarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 25 years .

after peaking at nearly $33 billion in fy1985 ( constant fy2002 dollars ) , foreign operations appropriations began a period of decline to $13.6 billion infy1997 , with only a brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to specialsupplementals for panama and nicaragua ( 1990 ) , countries affected by the gulf war ( 1991 ) , and the former soviet states ( 1993 ) .

table 2 .

foreign operations appropriations , fy1995 to fy2002 ( discretionary budget authority in billionsof current dollars ) * fy1999 excludes $17.861 billion for the imf .

fy2001 and fy2002 exclude $5 million and $1.188 billion , respectively , allocated from the terrorism emergencysupplemental appropriation ( p.l .

107-38 ) for foreign operations programs .

with a much smaller supplemental ( $80 million for the global health fund ) enacted for fy2001 , foreign operations fell to $15.4 billion , in real terms .

the fy2002 enacted amount is $15.35 billion , slightly less than fy2001 , calculated usingconstant fy2002 dollars .

table 2 , above , presents the enacted foreign operationsfunding levels for recent years , expressed in nominal , or current dollars that does nottake into account the effects of inflation .

examined in nominal terms , the fy2002amount represents a 2.7% increase over fy2001 .

as a share of the entire $1.9 trillion u.s. budget for fy2001 , foreign operations represented a 0.79% share .

as a portion of discretionary budget authority - - that part of the budget provided in annual appropriation acts ( other thanappropriated entitlements ) - - foreign operations consumed 2.3% .

by comparison,at the high point of foreign operations spending in fy1985 , foreign aid fundsrepresented 2% of the total u.s. budget and 4.6% of discretionary budget authority .

the bush administration's fy2001 supplemental appropriations proposallargely included additional funds for defense and domestic farm relief , but sought noadditional resources for foreign operations programs .

the senate appropriationscommittee , however , added $100 million for a new global fund to fight hiv / aids,malaria , and tuberculosis to its bill ( s. 1077 ) when it reported themeasure on june 21 .

 ( 15 ) president bush hadproposed $200 million in fy2002 for theglobal fund ( $100 million from foreign operations and $100 million from healthand human services ) .

the request recommended , however , that all of the moneywould be transferred from previously enacted and proposed funding for fy2002 .

the house bill ( h.r .

2216 ) included no funds for the hiv / aids andother disease fund .

conferees meeting on h.r .

2216 approved the senate provision and added $100 million for the global fund to the legislation .

congress cleared themeasure on july 20 ( p.l .

107-20 ) .

this action by congress accelerated the u.s.contribution to the global fund , but required usaid to find $20 million in cuts fromprior year child survival and esf programs .

during initial debate on the bill , thesenate defeated an amendment by senator feingold that would have rescinded nearly$600 million for the navy osprey aircraft procurement and added $593 million foran additional u.s. contribution to the global health fund .

 table 6 .

foreign operations accounts discretionary budget authority ( millions of dollars ) source: house and senate appropriations committee and crs calculations .

a .

each account for fy2001 has been adjusted in reflect the across - the - board 0.22% rescission enacted in the consolidated appropriations act , fy2001 ( h.r .

4577 ) , signed into law on dec. 21 , 2000 .

the total amountreduced for foreign operations was $33 million .

b. fy2002 request amended on june 11 , 2001 , to add an additional $200 million for hiv / aids , malaria , and tb global fund .

of the total , $100 million was derivedby transfer from the department of health and human services and does not appearin the foreign operations budget .

the other $100 million came from reductions tothe existing fy2002 foreign operations request: esf ( - $35 million ) ; peacekeeping ( - $15 million ) ; child survival ( - $20 million that had been originally allocated forthe global fund ) ; east european aid ( - $5 million ) .

the amendment further madeavailable $25 million from unobligated , prior year esf and child survivalappropriations .

congress modified the president's request by approving $100million for the global fund under foreign operations funding in the fy2001supplemental appropriations ( p.l .

107-20 ; h.r .

2216 ) .

p.l .

107-20 further rescinded $20 million in prior year child survival and esf appropriationsto partially offset the new global fund spending .

for fy2002 , the house , senate,and enacted levels included $100 million for the global fund drawn from the childsurvival and other bill accounts .

c. for fy2002 , congress proposed a modified structure for the child survival / health ( csh ) and development aid ( da ) accounts .

basic education , which had previouslybeen included in the csh account , is transferred to the da account .

familyplanning , previously enacted in the da account , is moved to the csh account .

further , funding for the inter - american and african development foundations wasprovided in separate accounts ( listed below ) and not in the da account as in recentyears .

amounts for fy2001 enacted and for fy2002 requested have been adjustedto be consistent with the congressional structure .

d. population and hiv / aids aid funding include small amounts from other foreign operations accounts .

the figures here represent totals "across all accounts," notjust those within the development aid subtotal .

e. the administration request includes the ireland fund as part of the economic support fund .
