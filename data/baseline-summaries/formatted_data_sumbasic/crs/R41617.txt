on january 14 , 2013 , cuba's new travel policy went into effect whereby cubans wanting to travel abroad no longer need an exit permit and letter of invitation .

under the new policy , travel requires only an updated passport and a visa issued by the country of destination , if required .

thousands of cubans lined up at government migration offices and travel agencies on the first day .

while on its face , the new policy can be viewed as a human rights improvement , how significant that improvement is will depend on how the law is implemented .

 ( see " cuba alters its policy regarding exit permits " below. ) .

on january 3 , 2012 , the cuban commission on human rights and national reconciliation ( ccdhrn ) reported that there were at least 6,602 short - detentions for political reasons in 2012 , ( a 60% increase over 2011 ) .

 ( see " cuban government's change of repressive tactics " below. ) .

on december 10 , 2012 ( human right day ) , the state department issued a press statement expressing deep concern about cuba's "repeated use of arbitrary detention and violence to silence critics , disrupt peaceful assembly , and intimidate independent society. .

 ( see " policy developments in 2012 " below. ) .

on december 5 , 2012 , the senate approved s.res .

609 ( moran ) by voice vote , calling for the immediate and unconditional release of alan gross , the usaid subcontractor imprisoned in cuba since december 2009 , and urging the cuban government to address his medical issues .

on november 16 , 2012 , gross filed suit ( along with his wife ) in u.s. district court in washington , dc , against the u.s. government and his employer , development alternatives inc. , alleging that they "failed to disclose adequately.... the material risks that he faced" during his trips to cuba .

gross had been working in cuba on a u.s. - funded democracy project .

 ( see " december 2009 imprisonment of alan gross " below. ) .

on november 19 , 2012 , official peace talks between the colombian government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) began in havana .

 ( see " terrorism issues " below. ) .

on november 7 , 2012 , cuban security agents arrested government critic antonio rodiles , and charged him with "resisting authority. .

rodiles ultimately was released on november 26 , 2012 , and charges of "resisting authority" were dropped , but according to amnesty international ( which had issued an urgent appeal for his release ) , rodiles was warned not to continue with his activism in cuba .

rodiles is one of the coordinators of an initiative begun in june 2012 known as the "citizens' demand for another cuba," which calls on the cuban government to implement the legal guarantees and policies in the universal declaration of human rights and to ratify two u.n. human rights conventions .

 ( see " cuban government's change of repressive tactics " below. ) .

on november 2 , 2012 , cuba announced that an oil well being drilled offshore cuba by the venezuelan state oil company , pdvsa , was not commercially viable .

the italian - owned oil rig , scarabeo - 9 , departed cuba on november 14 , reportedly to west africa .

this was the third well drilled by foreign oil companies offshore cuba this year that did not find oil , and was a significant setback for the cuban government's efforts to develop its deepwater offshore hydrocarbon resources .

 ( see " cuba's offshore oil development " below. ) .

political and economic developments in cuba and u.s. policy toward the island nation , located just 90 miles from the united states , have been significant congressional concerns for many years .

since the end of the cold war , congress has played an active role in shaping u.s. policy toward cuba , first with the enactment of the cuban democracy act of 1992 ( p.l .

102-484 , title xvii ) and then with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) .

both of these measures strengthened u.s. economic sanctions on cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s , but the measures also provided roadmaps for a normalization of relations dependent upon significant political and economic changes in cuba .

a decade ago , congress modified its sanctions - based policy toward cuba somewhat when it enacted the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 ( p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) allowing for u.s. agricultural exports to cuba that led to the united states becoming a major source for cuba's food imports .

over the past decade , much of the debate over u.s. policy in congress has focused on u.s. sanctions , especially over u.s. restrictions on travel to cuba .

the george w. bush administration initially liberalized u.s. family travel to cuba in 2003 , but subsequently tightened restrictions on family and other categories of travel in 2004 because of cuba's crackdown on political dissidents .

in 2009 , congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure ( p.l .

111-8 ) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports , marking the first congressional action easing cuba sanctions in almost a decade .

the obama administration took further action in april 2009 by lifting all restrictions on family travel and on cash remittances by family members to their relatives in cuba and restarting semi - annual migration talks that had been curtailed in 2004 .

in january 2011 , the administration announced the further easing of restrictions on educational and religious travel to cuba and on non - family remittances , and it also expanded eligible airports in the united states authorized to serve licensed charter flights to and from cuba .

this report is divided into three major sections analyzing cuba's political and economic situation , u.s. policy toward cuba , and selected issues in u.s. - cuban relations .

the first section on the political and economic situation includes a brief historical background , a discussion of the human rights situation and political prisoners , and an examination of economic policy changes that have occurred to date under raúl castro .

the second section on u.s. policy provides a broad overview of u.s. policy historically through the george w. bush administration and then provides a brief discussion of the broad debate on the direction of u.s. policy toward cuba .

policy under the obama administration is then examined in more detail .

the third section analyzes many of the key issues in u.s. - cuban relations that have been at the forefront of the u.s. policy debate on cuba and have often been the subject of legislative initiatives .

these include u.s. restrictions on travel , remittances , and agricultural exports to cuba ; a sanction that denies protection for certain cuban trademarks ; the status of anti - drug cooperation with cuba ; the status of cuba's offshore development and implications for disaster response preparedness ; terrorism issues , especially in consideration of cuba remaining on the state department's state sponsors of terrorism list ; u.s. funding for democracy and human rights projects ; u.s. government - sponsored broadcasting to cuba ( radio and tv martí ) ; and migration issues .

department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 .

continued funding in fy2011 for cuba broadcasting ( radio and tv martí ) and cuba democracy programs .

continued provision in the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l .

111-117 ) , including a continuation during fy2011 of the clarifying provision regarding "payment of cash in advance" for licensed agricultural and medical exports to cuba .

both senate and house passed the bill on april 14 , 2011 ; president signed into law april 15 , 2011 .

p.l .

consolidated appropriations act , 2012 .

the bill was originally introduced as the fy2012 military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations bill in may 2011 , and subsequently approved by the house and senate , respectively , in june and july 2011 .

on december 15 , 2011 , the bill became the vehicle for a fy2012 "megabus" appropriations measure , the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 , that combined nine full - year appropriations bills .

the conference report for the bill ( h.rept .

112-331 ) was filed on december 15 , 2011 , and approved by the house and senate on december 16 and 17 , 2011 , respectively .

the president signed the measure into law on december 23 , 2011 .

as enacted , the measure continued fy2012 funding for cuba broadcasting and cuba democracy funding .

the conference report to the bill provided full funding for the administration's request of $28.475 million for cuba broadcasting , and supported the administration's request for $20 million in esf for cuba democracy and human rights funding .

before the approval of the measure , a legislative battle ensued over the potential inclusion of two cuba provisions .

the first had been in the house appropriations committee - approved version of the fy2012 financial services appropriations bill , h.r .

2434 , and would have rolled back to january 2009 the obama administration's actions easing restrictions on remittances and on family travel .

the second provision also had been in h.r .

2434 , as well as in the senate appropriations committee - approved version of the fy2012 financial services appropriations bill , s. 1573 , and would have continued to clarify — for the third year in a row — the definition of "payment of cash in advance" for u.s. agricultural and medical exports to cuba so that the payment would be due upon delivery in cuba as opposed to being due before the goods left u.s. ports .

 ( the text of these two cuba provisions were also included in division c , section 632 and section 634 , of h.r .

3671 , a "megabus" appropriations bill introduced by house republicans on december 14 , 2011. ) .

ultimately congressional leaders agreed to not include the two cuba provisions in h.r .

2055 .

the white house reportedly had exerted strong pressure not to include the cuba provision that would have rolled back the administration's easing of restrictions on travel and remittances .

dropping the second provision on the definition of "payment of cash in advance" for u.s. agricultural and medical products appears to have been a political tradeoff made to compensate for the travel rollback provision being dropped .

both bills had a provision ( §618 of h.r .

the senate bill had another cuba provision ( §624 ) that would have prohibited restrictions on direct transfers from a cuban financial institution to a u.s. financial institution in payment for licensed agricultural and medical exports to cuba .

the house bill had another cuba provision ( §901 ) that would have repealed any amendments to certain sections of the cuban assets control regulations relating to family travel ( 31 cfr 515.560 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 31 cfr 515.561 ) , carrying remittances to cuba ( 31 cfr 515.560 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ) ) , and sending remittances to cuba ( 31 cfr 515.570 ) made since january 2009 .
