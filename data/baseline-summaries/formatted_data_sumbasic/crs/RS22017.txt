the u.s. strategy in pursuing the war on international terrorism involves a variety of missions conducted by military and civilian intelligence personnel characterized as "special operations" or paramilitary operations .

the separate roles of the department of defense ( dod ) and the central intelligence agency ( cia ) are not always clearly reflected in media accounts and at times there has been considerable operational overlap .

proposals such as those made by the 9 / 11 commission to change organizational relationships will , however , be evaluated on the basis of separate roles and missions , operating practices , and relevant statutory authorities .

dod defines special operations as "operations conducted in hostile , denied , or politically sensitive environments to achieve military , diplomatic , informational , and / or economic objectives employing military capabilities for which there is no broad conventional force requirement. .

dod defines paramilitary forces as "forces or groups distinct from the regular armed forces of any country , but resembling them in organization , equipment , training or mission. .

in this report , the term "paramilitary operations" will be used for operations conducted by the cia whose officers and employees are not part of the armed forces of the united states .

 ( in practice , military personnel may be temporarily assigned to the cia and cia personnel may temporarily serve directly under a military commander. ) .

in general , special operations are distinguishable from regular military operations by degree of physical and political risk , operational techniques , and mode of employment among other factors .

dod special operations are frequently clandestineâdesigned in such a way as to ensure concealment ; they are not necessarily covert , that is , concealing the identity of the sponsor is not a priority .

the cia , however , conducts covert and clandestine operations to avoid directly implicating the u.s. government .

ussocom was established by congress in 1987 ( p.l .

99-661 , 10 u.s.c .

â§167 ) .

ussocom's stated mission is to plan , direct and execute special operations in the conduct of the war on terrorism in order to disrupt , defeat , and destroy terrorist networks that threaten the united states .

the cia was established by the national security act of 1947 ( p.l .

80-253 ) to collect intelligence through human sources and to analyze and disseminate intelligence from all sources .

it was also to "perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the president or the national security council may direct. .

this opaque phrase was , within a few months , interpreted to include a range of covert activities such as those that had been carried out by the office of strategic services ( oss ) during world war ii .

although some observers long maintained that covert actions had no statutory basis , in 1991 the national security act was amended ( by p.l .

102-88 ) to establish specific procedures for approving covert actions and for notifying key members of congress .

the statutory definition of covert action ( "activity or activities of the united states government to influence political , economic , or military conditions abroad , where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly...." ) is broad and can include a wide range of clandestine effortsâfrom subsidizing foreign journals and political parties to participation in what are essentially military operations .

in the case of paramilitary operations , there is a clear potential for overlap with activities that can be carried out by dod .

in general , the cia would be designated to conduct operations that are to be wholly covert or disavowable .

in practice , responsibilities for paramilitary operations have been assigned by the national security council on a case - by - case basis .

recommendation 32 of the 9 / 11 commission report states: "lead responsibility for directing and executing paramilitary operations , whether clandestine or covert , should shift to the defense department .

there it should be consolidated with the capabilities for training , direction , and execution of such operations already being developed in the special operations command. .

the 9 / 11 commission's basis for this recommendation appears to be both performance and cost - based .

the report states that the cia did not sufficiently invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with u.s. personnel prior to 9 / 11 , and instead relied on improperly trained proxies ( foreign personnel under contract ) resulting in an unsatisfactory outcome .

the report also states that the united states does not have the money or people to build "two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations," and suggests that we should "concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. .

some observers question whether procedures are in place to insure overall coordination of effort .

press reports concerning an alleged lack of coordination during afghan operations undoubtedly contributed to the 9 / 11 commission's recommendation regarding paramilitary operations .

although such accounts have been discounted by some observers , the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( p.l .

108-458 ) included a provision ( section 1013 ) that requires dod and cia to develop joint procedures "to improve the coordination and deconfliction of operations that involve elements" of the cia and dod .

when separate missions are underway in the same geographical area , the cia and dod are required to establish procedures to reach "mutual agreement on the tactical and strategic objectives for the region and a clear delineation of operational responsibilities to prevent conflict and duplication of effort. .

the 109 th congress did not address this issue legislatively .

on november 23 , 2004 , president bush issued a letter requiring the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review matters relating to recommendation 32 and submit their advice to him by february 23 , 2005 .

in unclassified testimony to the senate select committee on intelligence in february 2005 , the director of the cia testified that the cia and dod disagreed with the 9 / 11 commission's recommendation .

in june of 2005 it was reported that the secretary of defense and the director of the central intelligence agency responded to the president , stating that "neither the cia nor dod endorses the commission's recommendation on shifting the paramilitary mission or operations. .

the administration reportedly rejected the 9-11 commission's recommendation to shift the responsibility for paramilitary operations to dod .

the 110 th congress saw the enactment of p.l .

110-53 , implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 which did not address either paramilitary operations by cia or special operations by dod .

opposition by the pentagon , the intelligence community , and the bush administration undoubtedly affected the congressional response to the 9 / 11 commission's recommendation to vest responsibilities for paramilitary operations in dod .

cia's reputation may have also been assisted by the generally favorable assessments given to the agency's post - 9 / 11 performance , especially in the initial phases of the afghan campaign that led to the collapse of the taliban regime in december 2001 .

although most observers believe that there remains little inclination among members to transfer responsibilities for all paramilitary operations out of cia , some members have expressed concerns about apparent blurring of lines between dod clandestine operations and cia intelligence - gathering operations .
