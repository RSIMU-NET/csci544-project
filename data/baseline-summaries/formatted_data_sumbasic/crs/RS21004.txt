fast - track is an expedited procedure for congressional consideration of certain trade agreements .

this process is tied to the president's authority provided by congress to enter into trade agreements to reduce u.s. tariff and non - tariff barriers with other countries .

the fast - track authority provides that congress will consider trade agreement implementing bills within mandatory deadlines , with a limitation on debate , and without amendment , as long as the president meets prescribed requirements set out by law .

under the reciprocal trade agreements act of 1934 ( p.l .

73-316 ) , congress delegated renewable authority to the president to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions .

the trade act of 1974 ( p.l .

93-618 ) expanded this authority to include negotiations of nontariff trade barriers , but required more extensive reporting and consultations between congress and the president during trade negotiations .

this act also had a provision under which congress would consider implementing bills for trade agreements under expedited congressional procedures , known as fast - track .

table 1 shows how congress renewed fast - track authority on particular dates .

in the years following the expiration of fast - track authority in 1994 , there were several legislative proposals to reauthorize the trade authority procedures ; these bills , including h.r .

2621 in the 105 th congress , did not pass .

in the 107 th congress , several legislative proposals on trade promotion authority ( tpa ) were considered .

the original house version of the bipartisan trade promotion authority act ( h.r .

3005 ) passed by one vote on december 6 , 2001 ( 215-214 ) .

another bill , h.r .

3009 , was amended several times in the house and the senate to include additional trade issues .

following house and senate negotiations and agreement to the conference report for h.r .

3009 , the president signed h.r .

3009 , as p.l .

107-210 , the trade act of 2002 , on august 6 , 2002 .

this major piece of trade legislation has the tpa provisions in title xxi , section 210l , as the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 .

tpa procedures apply to implementing bills for trade agreements entered into before july 1 , 2007 .

although tpa expired on july 1 , 2007 , four proposed u.s. free trade agreements ( ftas ) were signed in time to be considered by congress under tpa procedures in the 110 th congress ; the u.s. ftas were negotiated separately with the countries of peru , colombia , panama , and south korea .

the implementing legislation for the u.s. - peru trade promotion agreement was passed by congress and signed by the president on december 14 , 2007 ( p.l .

110-138 ) .

also in the 110 th congress , h.r .

5724 was introduced as implementing legislation for the u.s. - colombia trade promotion agreement .

on april 10 , 2008 , the house passed h.res .

1092 , relating to h.r .

5724 ; this resolution provided a rule that disallowed the use of time limitations for consideration of the implementing bill .

no further legislative action on h.r .

5724 occurred in the 110 th congress .

in the 111 th congress , no legislation for the three proposed u.s. trade agreements ( with the countries of colombia , panama , and south korea ) was introduced .

the fate of the three ftas is uncertain in the 112 th congress .

more detailed information on congressional and executive procedures for tpa and free trade agreements can be found in the "resources for additional information," at the end of this report .

in table 1 , some of the listed bills focus solely on fast - track trade negotiating authority or tpa .

other bills are major landmarks of trade legislation , of which fast - track is only one of many trade provisions .

these major trade acts , in boldface , include the trade act of 1974 , the trade agreements act of 1979 , the trade and tariff act of 1984 , the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 , and the trade act of 2002 .

congress has applied fast - track legislative procedures to approve several reciprocal bilateral and multilateral trade agreements .
