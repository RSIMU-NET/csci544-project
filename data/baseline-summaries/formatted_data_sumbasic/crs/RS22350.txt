the railroad retirement board ( rrb ) , an independent federal agency , administers retirement , survivor , disability , unemployment , and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the railroad retirement act ( rra ) and the railroad unemployment insurance act ( ruia ) .

these acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries , railroad associations , and railroad labor organizations .

lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of social security benefits ; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or social security , depending on the length of their railroad service .

the number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s , although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all - time low of 215,000 workers in january 2010 .

recently , railroad employment peaked in april 2015 to 253,000 workers , the highest level since november 1999 , and then declined through fy2017 , falling to 221,000 workers .

the total number of beneficiaries under the rra and ruia decreased from 623,000 in fy2008 to 574,000 in fy2017 , and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time .

during fy2017 , the rrb paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement , disability , and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries .

almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants .

this report explains the programs under rra and ruia , including how each program is financed , the eligibility rules , and the types of benefits available to railroad workers and family members .

it also discusses how railroad retirement relates to the social security system .

for a quick overview of this topic , see crs in focus if10481 , railroad retirement board: retirement , survivor , disability , unemployment , and sickness benefits .

the rra authorizes retirement , survivor , and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families .

in december 2017 , there were a total of 526,100 rra beneficiaries , decreasing from 672,400 in 2001 .

this decline might partly result from the decline in railroad employment in the past five decades .

the average monthly benefit for each beneficiary was about $1,986 in 2017 , which increased from $1,043 in 2001 , reflecting the growth in average wages and prices ( see figure 1 ) .

railroad workers may qualify for daily unemployment and sickness benefits under the railroad unemployment insurance act ( ruia ) .

these monetary benefits are paid in addition to any paid leave or private insurance an employee may have .

for sickness benefits , a worker must be unable to work because of illness or injury .

sickness benefits are distinct from disability benefits because they are intended to cover a finite , temporary period of time .

workers may not earn any money while receiving unemployment or sickness benefits .

figure 3 displays the monthly number of beneficiaries with unemployment and sickness benefits from january 2002 to july 2018 , respectively .

although the number of sickness beneficiaries stayed relatively stable over time , the number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries increased significantly during and after the most recent economic recession from 2007 to 2009 .

railroad unemployment and sickness benefits are financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes , based on the taxable earnings of their employees .

employers' tax rates depend on the past rates of unemployment and employees' sickness claims .

for calendar year 2018 , the employer tax rate ranges from 2.2% to 12.0% on the first $1,560 of each employee's monthly earnings .

the payroll tax proceeds not needed immediately for unemployment and sickness insurance benefits or operating expenses are deposited in the railroad unemployment insurance account maintained by the treasury .

this account , together with similar unemployment insurance accounts for each state , forms a federal unemployment insurance trust fund whose deposits are invested in u.s. government securities , and the railroad unemployment insurance account receives interest based on these deposits .

during fy2017 , payroll tax contributions from railroad employers totaled $126.4 million and interest income was about $4 million .

the ruia provides for employers to pay a surcharge if the railroad unemployment insurance account falls below an indexed threshold amount .

the surcharge is added to the employer's tax rate .

however , the total tax rate plus the surcharge cannot exceed the maximum rate of 12.0% , unless the surcharge is 3.5% , in which case the maximum tax rate is increased to 12.5% .

from 2004 through 2010 , the surcharge was 1.5% .

the surcharge in 2011 was 2.5% and 1.5% in 2012 with no surcharges in 2013 or 2014 .

the surcharge in 2018 was 1.5% , the same as the level in the past three years .

eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings .

the annual benefit year begins on july 1 .

eligibility is based on work in the prior year , or the base year .

to qualify in the benefit year beginning july 1 , 2018 , railroad workers must have base year earnings of $3,862.50 in calendar year 2017 , counting no more than $1,545 per month .

new railroad workers must also have at least five months of covered railroad work in the base year .

to receive unemployment benefits , a worker must be ready , willing , and able to work .

the maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began july 1 , 2018 , is $77 , and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770 .

however , due to sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 , as amended ) , the maximum daily benefit of $77 is reduced by 6.2% to $72.23 and the maximum biweekly benefit is reduced by 6.2% to $722.26 through september 30 , 2019 .

railroad workers receive these benefits only to the extent that they are higher than other benefits they receive under the rra , the social security act , or certain other public programs , including workers compensation .

unemployment and sickness beneficiaries may receive normal benefits for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year or until the benefits they receive equal their creditable earnings in the base year if sooner .

employees with at least 10 years of covered railroad service may qualify for extended benefits for 13 weeks after they have exhausted normal benefits .

workers who apply for unemployment benefits are automatically enrolled in a free job placement service operated by railroad employers and the rrb .
