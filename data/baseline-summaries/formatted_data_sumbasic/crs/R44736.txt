congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding .

broadly , the term authorization is used to describe legislation that establishes , continues , or modifies the organization or activities of a federal entity or program .

by itself , such legislation does not provide funding for such purposes .

instead , the authority to obligate payments from the treasury is left to separate appropriations measures .

this distinction between appropriations and general legislation as two separate classes of measures , and their consideration in separate legislative vehicles , is a construct of congressional rules and practices .

it has been developed and formalized by the house and senate pursuant to the constitutional authority for each chamber to "determine the rules of its proceedings. .

this power permits each chamber of congress to enforce , modify , waive , repeal , or ignore its rules as it sees fit .

because the two chambers exercise this rulemaking authority independently , they have developed differing ( albeit generally similar ) rules and practices .

this report addresses solely developments in the house .

according to hinds' precedents , the origin of a formal rule mandating the separation of general legislation from appropriations can be traced to 1835 , when the house debated the increasing problem of delay in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of "debatable matters of another character , new laws which created long debates in both houses" and suggested that the committee on ways and means should "strip the appropriation bills of every thing but were legitimate matters of appropriation. .

in the following congress ( 25 th congress , 1837-1839 ) , language was added to house rules that stated: no appropriation shall be reported in such general appropriation bills , or be in order as an amendment thereto , for any expenditure not previously authorized by law .

this rule was applied broadly on occasion to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures as well , such as a case in 1838 when it was used to exclude an amendment that included a provision for refurnishing the white house .

gradually , the rule "became construed through a long line of decisions to admit amendments increasing salaries but as excluding amendments providing for decreases. .

as a consequence of this , in 1876 , the language was expanded ( at the suggestion of representative william holman of indiana ) to further state: nor shall any provision in any such bill or amendment thereto , changing existing law , be in order except such as , being germane to the subject matter of the bill , shall retrench expenditures .

as described by one scholar , this provision effectively granted the appropriations committee authority to include virtually any legislative provision in an appropriations measure so long as it reduced the number and salary of federal officials , the compensation of any person paid out of the treasury , or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill .

according to one contemporary account , a broad initial construction of the rule by the house resulted in "putting a great mass of general legislation upon the appropriation bills. .

the rule was retained in this form until 1880 ( 46 th congress ) , when it was modified to define retrenchments as the reduction of "the number and salary of officers of the united states , the reduction of compensation of any person paid out of the treasury of the united states , or the reduction of the amounts of money covered by the bill. .

that form of the rule remained a part of house rules until the 49 th congress eliminated it in 1885 .

it was reinserted in the rules for the 52 nd and 53 rd congresses ( 1891-1895 ) but was again dropped for the 54 th through 61 st congresses ( 1895-1911 ) before being readopted in the 62 nd congress .

although the holman rule has remained a part of house rules since that time , its language was amended at the start of the 98 th congress ( 1983-1984 ) .

at that time , it was restructured to narrow the exception to the general prohibition against legislation to allow only retrenchments reducing amounts of money covered by the bill .

in addition , the house rules for the 98 th congress changed when retrenchment amendments could be offered .

amendments that only alter the items or amounts in an appropriation bill are generally in order when the measure is read for amendment and must be offered as the relevant paragraph or section of the bill is read .

the new version of the rule provided , however , that germane amendments to retrench expenditures ( as well as limitation amendments ) would be in order only after the reading of a general appropriation bill and if a preferential motion that the committee of the whole rise and report ( essentially ending consideration of the bill ) were rejected .

further stylistic changes were made when the house recodified its rules in the 106 th congress ( 1999-2000 ) to make explicit that retrenchment amendments are in order if the motion to rise and report is not offered — as well as if the motion is rejected .

it also clarified that the effect of a point of order against legislation in an appropriations bill ( and , by extension , the application of the holman rule exception ) is surgical so that it lies against an offending provision in the text and not against consideration of the entire bill .

the holman rule currently states the following: a provision changing existing law may not be reported in a general appropriation bill , including a provision making the availability of funds contingent on the receipt or possession of information not required by existing law for the period of the appropriation , except germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill [emphasis added] .

the holman rule , thus , does not circumscribe congress's lawmaking authority but rather provides a limited exception to the general prohibition in house rules against legislation in appropriation measures .

for the 115 th congress , the house included a separate order as section 3 ( a ) of h.res .

5 , adopting the rules of the house , that provides the following: during the first session of the one hundred fifteenth congress , any reference in clause 2 of rule xxi to a provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill shall be construed as applying to any provision or amendment ( offered after the bill has been read for amendment ) that retrenches expenditures by — ( 1 ) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill ; ( 2 ) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the united states ; or ( 3 ) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the treasury of the united states .

as stated in a section - by section summary included in the congressional record by representative pete sessions , the chairman of the house rules committee , the purpose of this provision is "to see if the reinstatement of the holman rule will provide members with additional tools to reduce spending during consideration of the regular general appropriation bill. .

the applicability of this separate order was extended under section 5 of h.res .

787 ( 115 th congress ) which provided that "section 3 ( a ) of house resolution 5 is amended by striking 'the first session of.' .

this separate order was not adopted for the 116 th congress , so the application of the rule reverts to being guided by prior precedents rather than this language .

since the period immediately after the initial adoption of the rule in the 19 th century , the house has interpreted it through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application .

for example , early precedents established that while it was not always necessary that a retrenchment specify the amount of a reduction of expenditures , it must appear as a necessary result of the legislation to be in order and that it is not sufficient that such reduction would probably ( or would in the opinion of the chair ) result therefrom .

for example , legislation that would simply confer discretionary authority to terminate employment of federal employees is not in order under the holman exception because any resulting savings would be speculative .

the reduction also may not be contingent on an event .

furthermore , the rule is not applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill .

the holman rule then is intended to apply only when an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill is achieved by the provision in question , such as the cessation of specific government activities , or through a specific reduction of total appropriations in the bill .

in addition , the exception does not apply to limitations ( on the grounds that such language is not legislative ) or legislative language unaccompanied by a reduction of funds in the bill .

legislation that is too broad has also typically not been allowed under the holman rule exception .

the house has held , for example , that a provision that stated no part of an appropriation could be expended for a specific , designated purpose qualified as a retrenchment .

however , a proposal that effectively repealed the law under which appropriations for that purpose were authorized was held not to come within the exception .

in another case , the house held that even when a provision does reduce expenditures , it may not be accompanied by additional legislative provisions not directly contributing to the reduction .

the separate order for the 115 th congress effectively reinstated language that had been stricken from the rule in 1983 .

while the full scope of amendments might be in order as a consequence of this language , it is possible to analyze its potential impact based on past precedents and the limited experience of the 115 th congress .

the additional language opened the door to the consideration of retrenchments resulting from a reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the united states or the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the treasury of the united states .

there are precedents regarding provisions allowed under the older , pre - 1983 form of the rule that may be illustrative for understanding what might be in order .

for example , a proposal that pay for a class of employees be limited to a smaller number of employees than authorized by law was allowed , as were proposals that would reduce the number of officers .

the holman rule also allowed proposals that would consolidate or eliminate offices .

on at least one occasion , the holman rule was the basis for allowing a proposal to replace civilian employees with lower paid u.s. army enlisted personnel .

in another case , the rule allowed for an amendment that capped the salaries of certain employees .

in the 115 th congress , one amendment was considered in order based on a plain reading of the text of the separate order to allow for "the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the treasury of the united states. .

although the amendment failed of passage , it would have provided that: the salary of mark gabriel , the administrator of the western area power administration , shall be reduced to $1 .

as cited above , however , neither the rule nor the separate order allows for retrenchments that would be applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill .

in addition , the application of the broader exceptions in the separate order were still subject to the general requirement for germaneness .

the holman rule is not intended to open the door for legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill .

as a consequence , even with the additional scope provided by the language of the separate order , it would likely not be in order to include broad legislative provisions in , or amendments to , a specific appropriation bill that would apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures .

furthermore , house precedent establishes that simply providing for a reduction of the number and salaries of officers in a paragraph when it is complicated by other elements does not necessarily bring a proposition within the exception .

the holman rule was also cited as the basis for allowing the consideration of one additional amendment during the 115 th congress .

that amendment also failed to pass , but it would have abolished the budget analysis division of the congressional budget office , comprising 89 employees with annual salaries aggregating $15 million , transferring responsibility for any duties imposed by law and regulation to the office of the director of the congressional budget office .

when discussing the application of rules and precedents , it is important to note that the house parliamentarian is the sole definitive authority on questions relating to the chamber's precedents and procedures and should be consulted if a formal opinion on any specific parliamentary question is desired .
