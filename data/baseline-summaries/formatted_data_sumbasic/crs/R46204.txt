multiple decades of scientific studies find that human activities induce global climate change by emitting greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) from fuel combustion , certain industries , deforestation , and other activities .

scientists researched and assessed the science of ghg - induced climate change for more than 150 years before government policymakers around the world agreed to cooperate to consider how to address its risks to humans and ecosystems .

following several international scientific meetings in 1985-1987 , governments decided to establish the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , under the auspices of the united nations environment programme and the world meteorological organization , to provide them with assessments of climate change science , projected social and economic impacts , and potential response strategies .

in 1989 , the u.n. general assembly provided a mandate to negotiate what became , in 1992 , the u.n .

framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) .

the unfccc has been the primary multilateral vehicle since 1992 for international cooperation among national governments to address ghg - induced climate change .

while the unfccc is a focal point for national governments , its periphery is one forum , among others , for information sharing , collaboration , and activism also for subnational governments , financial institutions , the private sector , and nongovernmental organizations .

this report is not describing these other , increasingly important aspects of international cooperation on climate change .

this report summaries the content of the unfccc and its two subsidiary international treaties: the 1997 kyoto protocol ( kp ) and the 2015 paris agreement ( pa ) .

it also describes the existing guidelines to implement the pa , known as the 2018 katowice climate package .

the report highlights information relevant to the 2019 climate change conference , known as cop25 .

this report is not comprehensive .

a number of other crs reports provide greater detail and nuance on these and other aspects of the international climate change negotiations and cooperation .

some are listed at the end of this report .

the unfccc has been the primary multilateral vehicle since 1992 for international cooperation to address ghg - induced climate change .

as of january 1 , 2020 , there are 197 parties to the unfccc that have ratified , accepted , or acceded to the international treaty , including the united states .

there is broad agreement that participation of all countries would be necessary to achieve the objective of the unfccc , which is stated as follows: to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system , in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development .

achieving the objective would require both abatement of ghg emissions and facilitation of adaptation to adverse impacts of climate change in order to enable sustainable development .

stabilizing ghg concentrations in the atmosphere requires that net ghg emissionsâthe balance of "gross" emissions of ghg to the atmosphere and removals of ghg from the atmosphereâreach "net zero" or "carbon neutrality. .

removals and sequestration can occur by photosynthesis ( vegetation , sea algae ) or through advanced technologies .

some increased level of removals , or "sinks," could allow for some amount of human - related ghg emissions to continue .

the united states and other parties to the unfccc agreed to this objective when they ratified the treaty .

as a framework convention , this international treaty provides the structure for collaboration and evolution of efforts over decades , as well as the first qualitative step in that collaboration .

the unfccc does not , however , include quantitative and enforceable objectives and commitments for any party .

the unfccc was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994 .

the unfccc's governing body , the conference of the parties ( cop ) , met in its 25 th session ( cop25 ) from december 2 to 13 , 2019 , in madrid , spain .

initially , chilean president sebastiã¡n piã±era stepped forward to host cop25 in place of brazil following the election of president jair bolsonaro .

piã±era sought to underscore his efforts to address climate change but ultimately decided that the summit should take place elsewhere due to mass protests in chile .

all parties to the unfccc , including the united states , have a set of common obligations under the treaty: to inventory , report , and mitigate their human - related ghg emissions , including emissions and removals from land uses ; to cooperate in preparing to adapt to climate change ; and to assess and review , through the cop , the effective implementation of the unfccc , including the commitments therein .

certain obligations are additional or more specific for the countries that had higher incomes in 1992 , and those countries are listed in annex i of the agreement .

they are commonly referred to as annex i parties .

all others are non - annex i parties .

these additional or more specific obligations included more frequent reporting and providing financing and technology transfers , among others .

the bifurcation of parties and commitments has been a major point of contention and , some would argue , delay in negotiation and implementation of the climate change agreements ( see text box ) .

the unfccc and its subsidiary agreements do not define the terms developing country or developed country .

in the 1990s , the annex i parties anticipated that developing country parties would "graduate" into specific commitments and become donor countries as their incomes and emissions grew .

as discussed later , related disagreements directly contributed to u.s. nonparticipation in the kp , the collapse of negotiations in copenhagen in 2009 , and the withdrawal or decision of some parties not to adopt ghg abatement targets in the second period of the kp from 2013 to 2020 .

the first subsidiary agreement to the unfccc was the 1997 kp , which entered into force in 2005 .

the united states signed but did not ratify the kp and so is not a party to it .

the kp established legally binding targets for 37 high - income countries and the european union ( eu ) to reduce their ghg emissions on average by 5% below 1990 levels during 2009-2012 .

it precluded ghg mitigation obligations for developing countries .

all parties with the quantified emissions limitation and reduction obligations ( qelros ) under the kp ( i.e. , ghg targets ) were judged in compliance after the end of the first commitment period of 2009-2012 .

the domestic ghg emissions of some parties were higher than their targets , but as envisioned under the kp , parties could fulfil their obligations by acquiring emission reduction credits through the three market mechanisms of the treaty: the clean development mechanism , joint implementation , and emissions trading .

most of the high - income partiesâmostly the eu members and other european nationsâtook on further ghg reduction targets for 2013-2020 .

the secretariat's assessment of the emissions of the kp parties with qelros , as of november 2018 , found: annex i parties are progressing towards their 2020 targets but gaps remain .

individual parties have made varying progress towards their 2020 targets: most parties' emission levels are already below their 2020 targets ; some parties must make further efforts to meet their targets by strengthening implementation of their existing [policies and measures] ; and using units from mbms [market - based mechanisms] , if needed , and the contribution from lulucf [land use , land use change , and forestry] , if applicable ; other parties' emissions remained above their base - year level , owing mainly to inadequacy of domestic [policies and measures] , high marginal mitigation costs or energy system constraintsâthey indicated that the use of units from mbms and , if applicable , the contribution from lulucf are expected to make a sizable contribution towards achieving their targets .

the united states did not join the kp , and canada withdrew before the end of the first commitment period .

at least in part , their reasons for disengaging from the kp included the non - annex i parties' objections to acceding to quantified ghg reduction commitments .

while negotiating the second kp commitment period , australia , japan , and other parties also decided to seek an agreement that included commitments on the same terms from all parties .

this led to a mandate , negotiated at the 2011 cop17 in durban , south africa , to develop a protocol , another legal instrument , or an agreed outcome with legal force under the unfccc applicable to all parties no later than 2015 .

the durban mandate resulted in the 2015 pa , discussed below .

the pa is the second major subsidiary agreement under the unfccc .

the pa is to eventually replace the kp as the primary subsidiary vehicle for process and actions under the unfccc .

obama administration officials stated that the pa is not a treaty requiring senate advice and consent to ratification .

the u.n .

climate conference in madrid included cop25 and the second session of the "conference of the parties serving as the meeting of the parties to the paris agreement" ( cma2 ) , along with meetings of other related bodies .

though the united states has given notice of withdrawal from the pa , its withdrawal is to take effect no earlier than november 4 , 2020 .

until then , the united states may participate as a party .

after withdrawal takes effect , the united states may participate in a more limited way as an observer state .

the pa was intended to be legally binding on its parties , though not all provisions in it are mandatory .

the pa requires that parties submit nonbinding pledges , in ndcs , to mitigate their ghg emissions and enhance removals .

ndcs may also articulate goals to adapt to climate change and cooperate toward these ends , including mobilization of financial and other support .

some provisions are binding , such as those regarding reporting and review , while others are recommendations or collective commitments to which it would be difficult to hold an individual party accountable .

key aspects of the agreement include: temperature goal .

the pa defines a collective , long - term objective to hold the ghg - induced increase in temperature to well below 2 o celsius ( c ) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 o c above the pre - industrial level .

as discussed below , a periodic "global stocktake" is to assess progress toward the goals .

single ghg mitigation framework .

the pa establishes a process , with a ratchet mechanism in five - year increments , for all countries to set and achieve ghg emission mitigation pledges until the long - term goal is met .

for the first time under the unfccc , all parties participate in a common framework with common guidance , though some parties are allowed flexibility in line with their capacities .

accountability framework .

to promote compliance , the pa balances accountability to build and maintain trust ( if not certainty ) with the potential for public and international pressure ( "name - and - shame" ) .

also , the pa establishes a compliance mechanism designed to use expert - based and facilitative review and response rather than punitive measures .

many parties and observers are to closely monitor the effectiveness of this strategy .

adaptation .

the pa also requires "as appropriate" that parties prepare and communicate their plans to adapt to climate change .

parties agreed that adaptation communications would be recorded in a public registry .

collective financial obligation .

the pa reiterates the collective obligation in the unfccc for developed country parties to provide financial resourcesâpublic and privateâto assist developing country parties with mitigation and adaptation efforts .

it urges scaling up from past financing .

the parties agreed to set , prior to their 2025 meeting , a new collective quantified goal for mobilizing financial resources of not less than $100 billion annually to assist developing country parties .
