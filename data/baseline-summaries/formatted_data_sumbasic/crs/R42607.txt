on march 21 , 2013 , congress sent to the white house h.r .

933 , the consolidated and continuing appropriations act , which the president signed into law ( p.l .

113-6 ) on march 26 , 2013 .

division c of that legislation was a fully detailed dod appropriations act for fy2013 that provided $597.1 billion for programs funded by that bill .

including funds provided for military construction in division e of h.r .

933 , the bill provided a total of $607.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for dod .

this is $323.8 million less than the administration's request , but exceeds the funding cap set by the bca and thus triggers a sequestration of up to $35.0 billion .

the administration had not allocated that reduction among specific dod appropriations accounts as of may 15 , 2013 .

the obama administration's fy2013 budget request , submitted to congress on february 13 , 2012 , included $646.97 billion for the so - called "national defense" function of the federal budget ( budget function 050 ) .

this included funding for global operations of the department of defense ( dod ) , defense - related nuclear programs conducted by the department of energy ( doe ) , and other defense - related activities .

for discretionary dod budget authority , the request included $613.93 billion , of which $525.45 billion is for "base" defense budget costs — that is , day - to - day operations other than war costs — and the remaining $88.48 billion was for "overseas contingency operations" ( oco ) — that is , military operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .

the function 050 total also included discretionary budget authority of $17.98 billion for doe defense - related programs ( dealing with nuclear weapons and warship powerplants ) , $4.75 billion for fbi national security programs , and $2.42 billion for a number of smaller accounts , including selective service and civil defense ( table 3 ) .

the administration's proposed dod budget called for the third consecutive annual decrease in total dod funding ( including oco ) since fy2010 .

most of that decline reflected the decrease in oco spending for operations in iraq and afghanistan .

however , while the decline in war costs accounted for most of this reduction , the president's fy2013 request also would have reduced the base budget ( in current dollars ) for the first time since 1996 .

the base budget request was $5.2 billion less than was appropriated for the base budget in fy2012 and $45.3 billion less than the fy2013 request the administration had projected in february 2011 ( figure 1 ) .

that reduction from the previously planned fy2013 request — and additional planned reductions of more than $50 billion per year compared to dod's february 2011 budget projections through fy2021 — reflected the administration's plan to reduce federal spending as required by the budget control act ( bca ) of 2011 , enacted on august 2 , 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 ) .

compared with the long - range spending plan published by dod in february 2011 , the february 2012 plan reduced dod base budgets by $259.4 billion from fy2012 through fy2017 ( figure 2 ) .

for the 10-year period covered by the bca ( fy2012-fy2021 ) , the administration's revised spending plan reduced dod budgets by a total of $486.9 billion .

further reductions in dod base budgets over the next 10 years may be in store as a result of the bca .

in addition to the $900 billion worth of deficit reduction in fy2012-fy2021 ( counting both defense and non - defense spending ) that results from the bca , the act also requires additional deficit reduction measures totaling $1.2 trillion through fy2021 ( which would result in a total deficit reduction through fy2021 of $2.1 trillion ) .

in fy2013 , the bca requires an across the board cut in budget authority ( or "sequester" ) that would be levied against almost all discretionary spending .

for the national defense budget function ( of which the dod budget comprises more than 95% ) , some $59 billion — about 10% — would be cut from the administration's budget request , with equal percentages cut from each program , project and activity .

in subsequent years , the bca sets lowered spending caps to achieve the required savings .

each year , to the extent that congress appropriates more than the caps allow , the administration would sequester funds through across - the - board cuts to ensure that the required savings are achieved .

if the sequestration process and the lowered spending caps remain law , the administration's february 2012 projection for defense budgets over the next 10 years would be cut by an additional $515 billion — about 9% .

the obama administration presented its fy2013 dod budget plan both as an effort to address the long - term spending limits set by the bca and as an opportunity to refocus u.s. defense planning as dod winds down large - scale deployments of u.s. troops in iraq and afghanistan .

the administration preceded the announcement of its fy2013 budget request with the publication on january 5 , 2012 , of new "strategic guidance," which , it said , took account of both the new budgetary and strategic environments .

the administration's $88.5 billion request for fy2013 war costs ( oco ) amounts to $26.6 billion less than congress appropriated for war costs in fy2012 .

this reduction reflects: the cessation of u.s. combat operations in iraq by the end of the first quarter of fy2012 ; and the reduction of the number of u.s. troops in afghanistan , by the end of fy2012 , to 68,000 personnel , thus ending the "surge" into that country of 33,000 additional u.s. troops announced by president obama on december 1 , 2009 .

the oco budget request assumed that 68,000 u.s. troops will remain in afghanistan through the end of fy2013 , although president obama has said that , after the number had been drawn down to 68,000 by the summer of 2012 , it would continue to decline "at a steady pace. .

on september 20 , 2012 , then - defense secretary leon panetta announced that the president's goal of reducing the number of u.s. troops in afghanistan to 68,000 had been met .

the compromise final version of the fy2013 ndaa , signed by the president on jan. 2 , 2013 ( p.l .

112-239 ) , authorized $648.7 billion for dod and defense - related nuclear activities of doe , which amounts to $1.7 billion more than the administration requested .

for dod's base budget , the final bill would authorize $527.5 billion , practically splitting the difference between the $528.6 billion that would have been authorized by the house - passed version of the bill , and the $525.8 billion that would have been authorized by the senate - passed version .

the final bill made a slight reduction to the amount requested for war costs and larger — though still relatively small — reduction to the amount requested for energy department nuclear programs ( table 6 ) .

the fy2013 dod appropriations bill reported by the house appropriations committee may 25 , 2012 ( h.r .

5856 ) , would provide a total of $599.89 billion for dod activities other than military construction , $3.09 billion more than the president requested .

amendments to the bill , adopted by the house on july 18-19 , 2012 , reduced the appropriation to $597.71 billion .

in exceeding the president's budget request — and in many of its details — the house - passed version of the dod appropriations bill parallels h.r .

4310 , the house - passed version of the companion fy2013 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) .

by the same token , the house - passed appropriation is consistent with the defense funding cap set by h.con.res .

112 , the fy2013 budget resolution adopted by the house on march 29 , 2012 .

thus , it exceeds defense spending cap set by the budget control act of august 2011 .

on those grounds , the administration warned that the president's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the house - passed bill in its current form .

the version of h.r .

5856 reported by the senate appropriations committee on august 2 , 2012 , would provide $596.64 billion — $155.0 million less than the administration's request and $1.06 billion less than the house - passed version ( table 14 ) .

the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

5856 would each add billions of dollars to the administration's budget request — $5.5 billion in the case of the house bill — reversing some of the administration's dod budget reduction initiatives , summarized in table 15 .

in each version of the bill , that gross increase , along with other congressional initiatives summarized in table 16 , is partly offset by funding reductions summarized in table 17 .

as reported by the house appropriations committee , h.r .

5856 also would add to the budget request upwards of $6.0 billion for certain programs for which congress typically increases funding above the proposed level .

as is customary in annual dod appropriations bills , the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

5856 would offset some of its proposed additions to the budget request with a small number of relatively large funding reductions ( in addition to dozens of smaller cuts justified in terms of specific problems with specific programs ) .

following are additional highlights of h.r .

5856 as passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee .

h.r .

933 as enacted funds the 1.7% increase in "basic pay" for military personnel proposed by the administration , as the versions of h.r .

5856 passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee would have done .

that rate is based on the labor department's employment cost index ( eci ) , which is a survey - based estimate of the rate at which private - sector pay has increased .

the enacted bill , as well as the versions that had been passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee each accepted the administration's proposal to reduce the active - duty end - strength of the army ( reduced by 9,900 ) and marine corps ( reduced by 4,800 ) during fy2013 .

in its report on the fy2013 defense bill , the house appropriations committee expressed concern that the administration's plan to reduce those two services by an additional 77,300 spaces by the end of fy2017 was based on budgetary pressures rather than military requirements .

the enacted bill , like the version reported by the senate committee , added to the budget request $2.38 billion to continue manning , operating and modernizing as previously had been scheduled in fy2013 and fy2014 all seven of the aegis cruisers and both of the amphibious landing ships the administration had planned to retire during that time .

the funds are in a newly created "ship modernization , operations and sustainment fund" that would remain available through fy2014 ( section 8105 of h.r .

933 ) .

the house bill would have added to the request only the funds needed to modernize and continue operating during fy2013 three of the four aegis cruisers that would have been retired during that year under the administration's plan .

the house bill would have allowed the retirement of a fourth cruiser — uss port royal , which was severely damaged in 2009 when it grounded on a coral reef off honolulu .

the house bill would have added $124.6 million for operation and maintenance of the three other cruisers and $426.7 million to upgrade their equipment ( including the purchase of five mh - 60r helicopters ) .

the final version of the appropriations bill added to the administration's request nearly $900 million dollars to sustain several flying squadrons that the budget would have disbanded and to continue acquiring and operating two types of aircraft that would have been disposed of under the budget request .

like the house and senate armed services committees , the house and senate appropriations committees both rejected a proposal to disband seven air force squadron and mothball or dispose of nearly 300 f - 16s and a - 10s operated by those units .

in its report h.r .

5856 , the house appropriations committee said the planned cutbacks would fall disproportionately on the air force reserve and air national guard .

together , those two reserve components would absorb 85% of the planned reduction in airplanes and 60% of the planned manpower cuts , the committee said .

as enacted , h.r .

933 includes a provision ( sec .

8115 ) that prohibits both the proposed dissolution the squadrons and disposal of their aircraft .

it also adds to the amount requested $557.2 million to continue operating those squadrons and to fund the nearly 7,000 air force , air force reserve and air national guard personnel assigned to them .

in its report to accompany h.r .

5856 , the house appropriations committee had directed the air force to submit by october 1 , 2012 , a cost - benefit analysis of the proposed retirements and reorganizations that was to be reviewed by the government accountability office ( gao ) .

conferees on h.r .

933 explicitly dropped the requirement , but said they expected that any future proposals to change the air force's force structure would be "transparently and comprehensively justified. .

the final defense bill also adds to the request $341.3 million to for the previously planned procurements of "block 30" global hawk long - range surveillance drones and small cargo planes designated c - 27s and to continue operating block 30s and c - 27s that already had been acquired .

it also includes a provision ( sec .

8118 ) requiring the air force to spend funds appropriated in earlier budgets for block 30s and c - 27s .

the enacted version of fy2013 dod appropriations bill ( h.r .

933 ) cut the $2.94 billion requested by the four services for routine personnel transfers by 5% ( $146.8 million ) .

this amounted to half the reduction that would have been made by the version of the bill reported by the senate appropriations committee ( h.r .

5856 ) , which would have cut transfer costs by 10% ( $293.6 million ) .

in its report on the defense bill , the senate committee said dod rotates an average of one - third of military personnel from one duty station to another in any year and that the average time between such reassignments is about two years .

the joint explanatory statement accompanying h.r .

933 directed the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness to report to congress ( within 180 days of enactment ) on potential budget savings that could be realized by longer tours of duty at any one station as well as potential improvements in service members' job performance and in the quality of life for service members and their families .

the enacted version of the fy2013 defense appropriations bill — like the versions passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee - cut the administration's budget request in an effort to reduce what the committees described in their reports as an excessive backlog of scheduled maintenance work by the services' depots , which perform major overhauls of aircraft , ground vehicles , engines , electronic equipment and other major items .

essentially , the appropriations committees took the position that they would reduce the amount of additional funds appropriated for overhauls in fy2013 while the depots would keep working at their regular tempo performing work that had been paid for in prior budgets , thus drawing down the backlogs .

the issue , which the gao has been scrutinizing for years , is referred to as "excess carryover" and is described by a july 2008 gao report on army depots: the five army depots operate under the working capital fund concept , where customers are to be charged for the anticipated full cost of goods and services .

to the extent that the depots do not complete work at [sic – apparently means "by"] year - end , the funded work will be carried into the next fiscal year .

carryover is the reported dollar value of work that has been ordered and funded ( obligated ) by customers but not completed by working capital fund activities at the end of the fiscal year .

the congressional defense committees recognize that some carryover is needed to ensure a smooth flow of work during the transition from one fiscal year to the next .

however , past congressional defense committee reports raised concerns that the level of carryover may be more than is needed .

excessive amounts of carryover financed with customer appropriations are subject to reductions by the department of defense ( dod ) and the congressional defense committees during the budget review process .

the house - passed version of h.r .

5856 would have cut a total of $2.46 billion from the amounts requested for army operation and maintenance ( o&m ) and for the army's other procurement accounts , explaining the action in a summary table as , "excess working capital fund carryover. .

citing the same rationale , the senate committee - reported version of the bill would have cut a total of $331.7 million from the amounts requested for the o&m accounts of the four armed services .

h.r .

933 as enacted cuts $332.3 million from the o&m requests .

the administration's $16.15 billion request for dod's tricare medical insurance program assumed certain increases in various fees paid by participants .

while some of those proposed increases were allowed by current law , most of them would have required legislative changes , most of which were rejected by the house and senate armed services committees in drafting the enacted version of the fy2013 national defense authorization act .

as reported by the house appropriations committee , h.r .

5856 incorporated the tricare cost savings that would result from the administration's proposed fee hikes .

in its report on the bill , the house committee said it would "continue to evaluate the proposed changes," pending enactment of the companion defense authorization bill .

h.r .

933 as enacted — like the senate appropriations committee - reported version of h.r .

5856 — added to the budget request $273.0 million to cover higher than budgeted costs expected to result from congress's rejection of some of the proposed tricare fee increases .

following the lead of the senate appropriations committee , the enacted version of h.r .

933 cuts $807.4 million from the fy2013 tricare request , a reduction of 5% which — conferees said — should have no adverse impact on the program .

citing the government accountability office ( gao ) as its source , the senate committeee said in its report on h.r .

5856 that the tricare program had "underexecuted" its budget ( i.e. , had spent less than was appropriated ) by $771.6 million in fy2010 and by $1.36 billion in fy2011 , and that it was on track to spend $1.04 billion less than had been appropriated for fy2012 .

similarly , the house - passed version of h.r .

5856 would have cut $400.0 million from the tricare request on the assumption that this pattern of "historic underexecution" would continue in fy2013 .

congressional action on appropriation of funds for selected ground combat systems is summarized in table a - 4 .

following are some highlights .

h.r .

933 as enacted incorporates $383.0 million worth of house - passed additions to the amounts requested for three armored vehicle programs , as follows: the budget requested $74.4 million for to support the fielding of m - 1 tanks that had been upgraded to the so - called "m - 1a2sep" version , which incorporates improvements to the power train , communications gear , and night - vision equipment .

the final appropriations bill would add $181.0 million to upgrade additional tanks .

h.r .

933 would nearly double — to $288.2 million , from $148.2 million requested — funding to upgrade bradley armored troop carriers with improved night vision equipment , digital communications gear , and power train modifications .

the bill would add $62.0 million to the $107.9 million requested for m - 88a2 hercules tank recovery vehicles — tracked vehicles designed to tow to safety a disabled 70-ton abrams tank .

the enacted version of the appropriations bill — like the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

5856 — would provide $639.9 million , as requested , to continue development of the army's ground combat vehicle ( gcv ) , which is intended to replace the bradley armored troop carrier .

in its report on h.r .

5856 , the senate appropriations committee had questioned the emphasis the army was placing on the gcv , considered in the context of its overall spending plans for modernization of its armored combat vehicle fleet .

under current army plans , the senate committee said , the gcv would account for about 10% of the army's entire fleet of combat vehicles .

in the fy2013 budget request , it accounts for more than 70% of the total amount requested for modernization of the ground combat fleet .

over the five - year period fy2013-fy2017 , gcv would absorb more than 80% of the service's projected spending on combat vehicle modernization .

the committee directed the army to provide to congress the results of a business case analysis — currently underway — of its combat vehicle fleet modernization plans .

in their respective reports on h.r .

5856 , the appropriations committees of both the house and senate decried the administration's plan to reduce the number of warships projected for funding in fy2013-fy2017 compared with the navy's previous five - year plan .

both committees warned that the projected reduction in shipbuilding would increase costs and weaken the nation's shipbuilding industrial base .

the house committee also contended that the administration's plan was inconsistent with its increased emphasis on u.s. military power in the pacific region , where naval forces would play a particularly significant role .

congressional action on appropriation of funds for selected naval systems is summarized in table a - 6 .

following are highlights .

like the armed services committees of the house and senate , the house and senate appropriations committee had objected to the administration's plan to buy one virginia - class attack submarine and one aegis destroyer in fy2014 , rather than two ships of each type , as had been planned .

h.r .

933 as enacted — like the senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

5856 — adds nearly $1.8 billion to the amount requested for navy shipbuilding in fy2013 to support multi - year contracts to procure 10 submarines and 10 destroyers in fy2013 through fy2017 , with the aim of achieving cost - cutting efficiencies .

like the senate committee version of h.r .

5856 , h.r .

933 adds to the budget request: $778 million for long lead - time funding to buy components that would allow the navy to start work on two submarines rather than one in fy2014 ; and $1.0 billion to fund a third destroyer in fy2013 , in addition to the two ships requested .

the house - passed version of h.r .

5856 added $723 million for the submarine components as well as $1 billion for a third destroyer .

the final bill — like the senate committee version of h.r .

5856 — added to the amount requested $150 million for the repair of the virginia - class submarine uss miami , damaged by fire on may 23 , 2012 , and undergoing an overhaul at the portsmouth naval shipyard in kittery , maine .

on august 22 , 2012 , the navy announced that it plans to repair the ship , at an estimated cost of $450.0 million , by april 30 , 2015 , after which the ship would be good for an additional 10 years of service .

the anticipated unit - cost of a new virginia - class submarine in the fy2013 budget is $2.55 billion .

the enacted appropriation , like the senate committee version of the bill , added $263.3 million for long lead - time components that would allow funding in fy2014 of an lpd - 17 class amphibious transport dock ship .

in its report on the h.r .

5856 , the senate appropriations committee noted that the navy has fewer amphibious landing transports than current dod plans call for and that the number of such ships is slated to decline further .

congressional action on appropriation of funds for selected aircraft and long - range strike programs is summarized in table a - 10 .

following are some highlights .

h.r .

933 appropriates $8.29 billion — 95% of the amount requested — to continue development and production of the f - 35 joint strike fighter .

several reductions totaling $404.0 million reflected what the house and senate conferees described as funding requests the were premature or that incorporated unjustified price increases .

the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

5856 each would have made generally similar reductions .

the final bill would provide $5.59 billion to buy a total of 29 f - 35s of three types: a carrier - based version for the navy , a short - takeoff version for the marine corps , and a conventional , land - based version for the air force .

it also would provide $2.68 billion to continue development of the plane .

the enacted bill would add $21.5 million to the amount requested for modifications to the air force's f - 22 fighters , with the additional funds intended to install a backup oxygen supply for the pilots in each aircraft .

the air force has been investigating complaints by some f - 22 pilots that they have experienced symptoms similar to those caused by hypoxia ( oxygen deprivation ) .

on august 1 , 2012 , an air force official said that a faulty pressurization program in the f - 22's oxygen system was responsible for hypoxia - like symptoms its pilots were suffering .

the faulty pressurization programming caused a pressurized vest — designed to protect pilots' lungs in case of rapid decompression — to inflate , restricting the pilots' ability to breathe , maj. gen. charles lyons usaf , told reporters .

instead of the 7 c - 130 cargo planes requested in the fy2013 budget ( most of which would be equipped for specialized missions such as mid - air refueling and search - and - rescue ) , the enacted defense bill would provide 14 of the planes plus a down - payment on 18 additional c - 130 to be funded in future fiscal years .

for procurement of new c - 130s ( of various types ) and modifications to existing planes , the budget requested $1.12 billion and h.r .

933 provides $1.73 billion .

the enacted bill also adds a total of $20.0 million to the air force's procurement and r&d accounts to continue the c - 130 avionics modernization program ( amp ) , a project to upgrade the cockpit electronics of older planes .

the administration's budget would have scrapped the program .

the enacted version of h.r .

933 appropriates $8.30 billion for programs of the missile defense agency , an increase of 6.6% above the $7.79 billion request .

the largest single component of the net increase is the house committee's addition of $280.0 million for four israeli missile defense systems , which includes $211.0 million for the iron dome system designed to intercept short - range rockets and artillery shells .

another component of the net increase for mda in the bill is the addition of $75.0 million to the $903.2 million requested for the ground - based missile defense ( gmd ) system currently deployed at sites in alaska and hawaii .

congressional action on appropriation of funds for selected missile defense programs is summarized in table a - 2 .

following the lead of the senate appropriations committee , the enacted bill appropriates $380.9 million for the medium extended air defense system ( meads ) , a joint u.s. - german - italian effort to develop a mobile air and missile defense system that incorporates the patriot pac - 3 missile , which is designed to protect combat units in the field .

plans to deploy meads have been shelved , but the three partner countries are continuing work on the system in hopes of developing components and technologies that could be used in other systems .

the administration maintains that , under the tripartite memorandum of understanding governing the program , the united states would incur significant cash penalties if it unilaterally pulled out of the program .

the house - passed version of the appropriations bill would have denied the entire $400.9 million requested for meads in the fy2013 budget .

the fy2013 national defense authorization act ( h.r .

4310 ; p.l .

112-235 ) had authorized no funds for meads and included a provision ( section 221 ) prohibiting the use of funds for the program .

however , dod holds that the funds appropriated for meads by h.r .

933 can be used for that purpose since , by the usual rule of legislative construction , any particular piece of legislation can be superseded by subsequent legislation .

h.r .

933 allows dod to use the fund appropriated either to complete the meads development program or to pay the fee the u.s. government would incur through termination .

in its report on h.r .

5856 , the senate appropriations committee said the costs would be about the same in either case .

as enacted , h.r .

933 would provide $86.95 billion for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) — basically , operations in afghanistan and iraq and supporting activities — which is $1.26 billion less than was requested .

the house - passed version of h.r .

5856 would have provided $87.11 billion for oco costs , while the senate committee - reported version of that bill would have provided $93.03 billion .

following are oco funding highlights in the fy2013 dod appropriations bill .

as enacted , h.r .

933 would provide $1.20 billion of the $1.30 billion requested for payments to pakistan from dod's coalition support fund .

the payments from the fund — for which the administration requested $1.75 billion in fy2013 — are intended to reimburse pakistan , jordan and other u.s. coalition partners for expenses they incur from supporting u.s. military operations in afghanistan and iraq .

as reported by the house appropriations committee , h.r .

5856 would have provided the $1.75 billion requested for csf .

however , section 9015 of that bill would have barred any payments from the fund to pakistan unless the secretaries of defense and state certify that the government of pakistan is cooperating with u.s. policy in certain respects , including supporting counterterrorism operations against al qaeda and certain other groups with bases in pakistan .

an amendment adopted during house debate on h.r .

5856 cut $650 million from the csf request , with the intent of cutting pakistan's payment by 50% to $650 million .

 ( see h.amdt .

1412 , table 19 . ) .

the final version of the bill restores $550 million of the house cut and retains the house restriction on aid to pakistan but would allow the administration to waive that requirement on national security grounds ( section 9014 ) .

the enacted version of h.r .

933 contained three provisions , substantially the same as provisions of previous defense appropriations bills and provisions in the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of h.r .

5856 , that restrict the transfer to any other location of detainees held at the u.s. facility at guantanamo bay , cuba who are neither u.s. citizens nor members of the u.s. armed forces .

three provisions of h.r .

933 are section 8109 , which would prohibit the transfer to ( or release within ) u.s. territory of any such detainee ; section 8110 , which would prohibit the transfer to any other country of any such detainee except to a country where the host government would likely retain the detainee in custody and render him unable to threaten u.s. interests ; and section 811 , which would prohibit the use of any funds to build , acquire , or modify any facility in u.s. territory to house guantanamo detainees .

following are selected amendments on which the house took action during consideration of h.r .
