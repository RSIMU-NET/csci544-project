indonesia , like many east asian economies , suffered a severe economic shock when the "asian financial crisis" struck the country in mid - 1997 .

prior to thisperiod , indonesia had enjoyed relatively healthy economic growth: from 1980-1989 , real gdp growth averaged5.5% , and from 1990 to 1996 , it averaged 8.0% ( one of the highest gdp growth rates in the world ) .

according to the world bank , the proportion of people livingbelow poverty declined from 60% in 1970 toan estimated 11% by mid - 1997 .

 ( 3 ) the 1997 economic crisis ( which began in thailand and quickly spread to indonesia and several other east asian economies ) , ( 4 ) resulted in a sharp depreciationof indonesia's currency ( the rupiah ) , ( 5 ) large - scalecapital flight , high inflation , widespread corporate bankruptcies ( caused in part by large short - term debt ofmany companies and corrupt business practices ) , and a near collapse of the banking system .

 ( 6 ) in 1998 , real gdp plunged by 13.2% ; exports andimports fell by 8.6% and 34.5% , respectively , and living standards ( per capita gdp on a purchasing power parity basis ) droppedby nearly 13% ( see table 1 ) .

finally , thepoverty rate doubled between mid - august 1997 ( pre - crisis ) and late 1998 / early 1999 .

 ( 7 ) political unrest followed the economic crisis , eventually leading to the resignation in may 1998 of president suharto ( or soeharto ) who had ruled the countrysince 1967 .

the collapse of the suharto regime helped usher in a new era of democratic political reforms inindonesia , although the transition to democracy hasnot been easy and political instability remains a problem .

indonesia's near economic meltdown forced it to turn tointernational lending institutions , such as theinternational monetary fund , the world bank , the asian development bank , and foreign governments for billionsof dollars in loans , debt rescheduling , andeconomic aid .

indonesia has been somewhat successful in bringing the economy back to at least pre - crisis levels , but several problems remain .

on the positive side , real gdpfrom 2000-2003 grew at a relatively healthy pace , averaging 4.0% ( although it was half the average level of realgdp growth during the early 1990s ) .

inaddition , indonesia's living standards ( measured according to per capita gdp in purchasing power parity ) finallyreached and exceeded pre - crisis levels in 2002 ( $3,320 in 2002 versus $3,201 in 1997 ) .

living standards improved by 12.7% in 2003 .

finally , indonesian exports ( in dollar terms ) in 2003 were 6.6% higherthan 1997 levels .

on the negative side , indonesian imports in 2003 were 21.1% lower than pre - crisis levels,reflecting the effects of the sharp devaluation of therupiah .

in addition , the stock of foreign direct investment ( fdi ) in indonesia dropped each year from 1997-2002 .

while the stock of fdi is estimated to haverisen slightly in 2003 , it is $14.8 billion ( or 20.3% ) lower than what it was in 1997 .

 ( 8 ) finally , the rate of unemployment in indonesia has steadily risen over thepast few years , from 6.1% in 2000 to 8.7% in 2003 .

*ppp data are measurements of foreign data in national currencies converted into u.s. dollars based on a comparable level of purchasing power these datawould have in the united states .

the short - term economic prospects for indonesia are relatively positive .

for example , global insight , an international forecasting firm , predicts thatindonesia's real gdp will rise by 4.6% in 2004 and 5.0% in 2005 .

 ( 9 ) however , indonesia faces a number of challenges that threaten to undermine long - termgrowth prospects .

these include widespread government corruption and a weak legal system , ( 10 ) large public debt , extensive government controlof keyeconomic sectors ( such as oil and gas ) , a high level of corporate non - performing loans , a weak banking system,uncertainties surrounding the centralgovernment's efforts to decentralize fiscal and political authority to local governments , and failure by thegovernment to provide adequate protection ofintellectual property rights ( ipr ) .

in addition , the existence and activities of several separatist movements andterrorist groups in indonesia constitute majorthreats to political and economic stability .

 ( 11 ) inoctober 2002 , terrorists with reported links to al qaeda bombed a club in bali frequented by western tourists,killing over 200 people ( including seven americans ) and wounding hundreds more .

 ( 12 ) in august 2003 , terrorists bombed a u.s. - run hotel in jakarta , killing12 people and wounding 150 .

the bombings have had a chilling effect on indonesia's tourism industry and raisedmajor concerns over the safety of foreigntourists and businesspeople in indonesia .

ethnic , religious , and separatist violence in the country has displaced 1.3million indonesians .

u.s. data indicate that indonesia is not a large u.s. trading partner .

in 2003 , u.s. exports to , and imports , from indonesia were $2.5 billion and $9.5 billion,respectively , making indonesia the 37th largest u.s. export market and its 26th largestsource of imports .

as indicated in table 3 and figure 1 , u.s. exports toindonesia declined sharply in 1998 and 1999 and have been relatively flat since .

overall , u.s. exports to indonesiain 2003 were 44.4% lower than 1997 levels .

u.s. imports from indonesia grew slightly from 1997-2000 , but have been relatively flat since .

u.s. imports fromindonesia in 2003 were only 3.6% higherthan 1997 levels .

the top three u.s. exports to indonesia in 2003 were soybeans , textile fibers , and animal feed,while the top u.s. imports from indonesiawere clothing and apparel , telecommunications equipment ( mainly audio and video equipment ) , and crude rubber .

according to u.s. investment data ( whichlists the value of u.s. fdi on a historical cost basis , i.e. , the cumulative book value of investment ) , u.s. fdi inindonesia stood at $7.5 billion at year - end 2002,down by $700 million from 2001 and by $1.4 billion from its peak in ( $8.9 billion ) in 2000 .

currently , 77% of u.s.fdi in indonesia is in the mining sector ( mainly oil and gas ) .

 ( 16 ) because indonesia is a developing country and meets other criteria set in u.s. law , $1.3 billion worth of its exports entered the united states duty - free under thegeneralized system of preferences ( gsp ) .

in an effort to boost u.s. - indonesian commercial relations , promotepolitical stability in indonesia , and combatterrorism , the bush administration on september 19 , 2001 announced that the united states would add 11 productsimported from indonesia ( valued at about$100 million ) that would be eligible for gsp treatment and pledged that the united states would provide up to $400million in financial aid and loan guaranteesunder u.s. trade programs operated by the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) , the export - importbank ( eximbank ) , and the trade anddevelopment agency ( tda ) , largely targeted at indonesia's oil and gas sector .

indonesia has gradually reformed its trade regime over the past 10 years , reducing its average un - weighted tariff from 20.0% in 1994 to 7.3% in 2003 .

in 1999,indonesia agreed to eliminate various discriminatory trade policies on auto trade after it lost a case in the wtodispute brought mainly by the united states andeuropean union .

indonesia's enforcement of u.s. ipr has been a major issue of concern for u.s. firms .

accordingto the international intellectual propertyalliance ( iipa ) , piracy levels in indonesia are "among the highest in the world," rivaling those of china andvietnam .

iipa estimates that ipr piracy inindonesia cost u.s. firms $260 million in lost trade in 2002 .
