in july 2005 , president bush announced his intention to conclude a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with india .

india , which is not a party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty ( npt ) , is considered under u.s. law to be a non - nuclear weapon state , yet has tested nuclear weapons and has an ongoing nuclear weapons program .

for these reasons , the president would need to make certain waivers and determinations pursuant to the atomic energy act ( aea ) before nuclear cooperation with a state such as india could proceed .

the administration proposed legislation ( introduced as h.r .

4974 / s. 2429 ) in march 2006 that , in addition to providing waivers of relevant provisions of the aea ( sections 123 a .

 ( 2 ) , 128 , and 129 ) , would have allowed a nuclear cooperation agreement with india to enter into force without a vote from congress , as though it conformed to aea requirements .

on july 26 , 2006 , the house passed h.r .

5682 by a vote of 359 to 68 .

on november 16 , 2006 , the senate passed h.r .

5682 by a vote of 85 to12 , substituting the text of s. 3709 as an engrossed amendment ; the senate insisted on its amendment , necessitating a conference to resolve differences between the bills .

on december 7 , conferees filed a conference report , and on december 8 , the house approved the conference report by a vote of 330 to 59 ; the senate approved the conference report by unanimous consent in the early hours of december 9 .

on december 18 , president bush signed the bill into law , p.l .

109-401 .
