prior to enactment of the fy2003 legislative appropriations bill , and effective in fy1978 , the legislative branch appropriations bill was divided into two titles .

title i , congressional operations,contained budget authorities for activities directly serving congress .

included in this title were thebudgets of the house , the senate , joint items ( joint house and senate activities ) , the office ofcompliance , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , the architect of the capitol ( aoc ) ( exceptthe library of congress ( loc ) buildings and grounds ) , the congressional research service ( crs ) within the library of congress , and congressional printing and binding activities of the governmentprinting office ( gpo ) .

title ii , related agencies , contained budgets for activities not directly supporting congress .

included in this title were budgets of the botanic garden , the library of congress ( except thecongressional research service ) , the library buildings and grounds maintained by the architect ofthe capitol , the government printing office ( except congressional printing and binding costs ) , andthe general accounting office ( gao ) .

periodically since fy1978 , the bill contained additionaltitles for such purposes as capital improvements and special one - time functions .

in the 2003 bill , appropriations for legislative branch agencies are contained in one title , title i .

title ii now contains general administrative provisions , and appropriations for two activities , thejohn c. stennis center for public service training and development and the congressional awardact .

figure 1 shows fy2002 appropriations as funded in titles i and ii .

title i budget authority was69.9% of the total appropriation of $3.25 billion .

title ii budget authority was 30.1% of the totalappropriation .

it included permanent budget authority for both federal fundsand trust funds , and other budget authority .

 ( 2 ) note: includes regular annual appropriations in p.l.107-68 ; emergency response funds pursuant to p.l.107-117 ; and fy2002 supplemental appropriation in p.l .

permanent federal funds are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action .

 ( 3 ) permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose .

trust funds do not appear in the annual legislativebill since they are not budget authority .

they are included in the u.s. budget either as budgetreceipts or offsetting collections .

they are funded in other appropriation bills , but are placed in the legislative section by the office ofmanagement and budget for bookkeeping purposes .
