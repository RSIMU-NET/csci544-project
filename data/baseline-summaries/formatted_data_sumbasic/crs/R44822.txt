on december 22 , 2018 , cuba's national assembly approved a draft constitution that will be subject to a national referendum planned for february 24 , 2019 .

on november 15 , 2018 , the trump administration updated its list of restricted cuban entities controlled by the cuban military , intelligence , or security services or personnel with which direct financial transactions would disproportionately benefit those services or personnel at the expense of the cuban people or private enterprise in cuba .

currently , there are 205 entities on the list , including 99 hotels .

104-114 ) to allow lawsuits in u.s. federal court against those "trafficking" in confiscated property in cuba , an action that would significantly ratchet up u.s. sanctions on cuba .

on november 1 , 2018 , the united nations general assembly approved a resolution ( as it has annually since 1991 ) opposing the u.s. embargo on cuba .

on october 26 , 2018 , u.s. media reports highlighted a disturbing tv martí program originally aired in may 2018 that disparaged u.s. businessman george soros through anti - semitic language and unfounded conspiracy theories .

subsequently , the office of cuba broadcasting pulled the program from its website and the chief executive officer of the u.s. agency for global media stated that the program was "inconsistent with our professional standards and ethics. .

on october 15 , 2018 , the cuban government released cuban political opposition activist tomás núñez magdariaga from prison after a 62-day hunger strike .

the state department had called for his release , maintaining that he was imprisoned on false charges and convicted in a sham trial .

 ( see " human rights ," below. ) .

on october 6 , 2018 , president trump signed into law the faa reauthorization act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-254 ) with a provision requiring the transportation security administration to brief congress on certain aspects of cuban airport security , develop and implement a mechanism to better track public air charter flights between the united states and cuba , and direct public air charters to provide updated data on such flights .

 ( see " u.s. travel to cuba ," below. ) .

political and economic developments in cuba and u.s. policy toward the island nation , located just 90 miles from the united states , have been significant congressional concerns for many years .

especially since the end of the cold war , congress has played an active role in shaping u.s. policy toward cuba , first with the enactment of the cuban democracy act of 1992 ( cda ; p.l .

102-484 , title xvii ) and then with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity ( libertad ) act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) .

both measures strengthened u.s. economic sanctions on cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s but also provided road maps for a normalization of relations , dependent upon significant political and economic changes in cuba .

congress partially modified its sanctions - based policy toward cuba when it enacted the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 ( tsra ; p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) allowing for u.s. agricultural exports to cuba .

over the past decade , much of the debate in congress over u.s. policy has focused on u.s. sanctions .

in 2009 , congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure ( p.l .

111-8 ) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports , marking the first congressional action easing cuba sanctions in almost a decade .

the obama administration took further action in 2009 by lifting all restrictions on family travel and on cash remittances by family members to their relatives in cuba .

in 2011 , the obama administration announced the further easing of restrictions on educational and religious travel to cuba and on donative remittances to other than family members .

in december 2014 , just after the adjournment of the 113 th congress , president obama announced a major shift in u.s. policy toward cuba , moving away from a sanctions - based policy aimed at isolating cuba toward a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations .

the policy shift led to the restoration of diplomatic relations , the rescission of cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism , and the easing of some restrictions on travel and commerce with cuba .

there was mixed reaction in congress , with some members of congress supporting the change and others opposing it .

legislative initiatives in the 114 th congress reflected this policy divide , with some bills introduced that would have further eased u.s. economic sanctions and others that would have blocked the policy shift and introduced new sanctions .

this report examines u.s. policy toward cuba in the 115 th congress .

it is divided into three major sections analyzing cuba's political and economic environment ; u.s. policy toward cuba ; and selected issues in u.s. - cuban relations , including restrictions on travel and trade , funding for democracy and human rights projects in cuba and for u.s. government - sponsored radio and television broadcasting , migration , antidrug cooperation , u.s. property claims , and u.s. fugitives from justice in cuba .

legislative initiatives in the 115 th congress are noted throughout the report , and appendix a lists enacted measures and other bills and resolutions .

appendix b provides links to u.s. government information and reports on cuba .

for many years , congress has played an active role in u.s. policy toward cuba through the enactment of legislative initiatives and oversight on numerous issues .

these issues include u.s. economic sanctions on cuba , such as restrictions on travel , remittances , and agricultural and medical exports ; terrorism issues , including cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism ; human rights issues , including funding and oversight of u.s. - government sponsored democracy and human rights projects ; funding and oversight for u.s. - government sponsored broadcasting to cuba ( radio and tv martí ) ; migration issues ; bilateral antidrug cooperation ; and u.s. claims for property confiscated by the cuban government .

first vice president miguel díaz - canel succeeded raúl castro as president in april 2018 , but any near - term change to the government's one - party communist political system is unlikely .

cuba is now in the midst of rewriting its 1976 constitution , with a planned national referendum on february 24 , 2019 .

among the changes are the addition of a new appointed prime minister to oversee government operations , age and term limits on the president , and some market - oriented economic reforms , including the right to private property .

however , the new constitution still would ensure the state sector's dominance over the economy and the role of the communist party in the political system as the only official party .

raúl castro is continuing as first secretary of the party until 2021 , and he played a key role heading the commission rewriting the constitution .

nevertheless , the government of díaz - canel , who is 58 years of age , brings to power a leader from a new generation and can be viewed as the culmination of generational change in cuba's governmental institutions that began several years ago .

the government of raúl castro began the implementation of significant economic policy changes , moving toward a more mixed economy with a stronger private sector , but its slow gradualist approach did not produce major improvements to the cuban economy .

in december 2018 , president díaz - canel backtracked on implementing regulations that likely would have shrunk the private sector , and he slowed down implementation of a controversial decree regulating artistic expression , actions that appeared to demonstrate his responsiveness to public criticism and concerns and his independence from the previous castro government .

looking ahead , president díaz - canel continues to faces two significant challenges — moving forward with economic reforms that produce results and responding to desires for greater freedom .

the obama administration's shift in u.s. policy toward cuba opened up engagement with the cuban government in a variety of areas .

economic linkages with cuba increased because of the policy changes , although to what extent they will continue to increase is uncertain given that the overall embargo and numerous other sanctions against cuba remain in place .

president trump's partial rollback of obama - era changes and introduction of new economic sanctions has limited opportunities for u.s. business engagement and contributed to a downturn in american travel to cuba in the second half of 2017 and first part of 2018 , although reports indicate that travel increased in the second part of the year because of a large increase in those visiting via cruise ships .

the u.s. decision to downsize the diplomatic staff of the u.s. embassy in havana in response to unexplained injuries to u.s. diplomatic personnel in cuba resulted in the suspension of most visa processing at the embassy and reduced other embassy operations , which has made bilateral engagement and existing areas of government - to - government cooperation more difficult .

just as there were diverse opinions in the 114 th congress over u.s. policy toward cuba , debate over cuba policy continued in the 115 th congress , especially with regard to u.s. economic sanctions .

most significantly , in the 2018 farm bill , p.l .

115-334 , enacted in december 2018 , congress approved a provision permitting funding for two u.s. agricultural export promotion programs in cuba .

although any such future funding likely would be small , this was the first congressional action easing u.s. economic sanctions on cuba in almost a decade .

the human rights situation in cuba remained a key congressional concern in the 115 th congress and likely will remain a key concern in the future , although there are diverse views regarding the best approach to influence the cuban government .
