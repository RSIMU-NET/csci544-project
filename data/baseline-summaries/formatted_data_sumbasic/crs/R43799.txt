all senate committees must adopt rules of procedure , unless exempted from doing so , and publish them in the congressional record by march 1 of the first year of a new congress .

an amendment to a committee's rules during a two - year congress does not take effect until the amendment is published in the congressional record .

if the senate establishes a committee after february 1 of the first year of a new congress , the rules of that committee must be published in the congressional record not later than 60 days after the establishment of the committee .

a committee's rules must be "not inconsistent" with the senate's rules .

 ( rule xxvi , paragraph 2. ) .

a committee typically adopts the rules that were in effect in the previous congress , with any change agreed to by the committee usually being incremental .

a committee's rules develop over time and fit the jurisdiction , practices , and culture of a committee , leaving little reason for major changes , even when control of the senate changes .

a change in a senate rule or standing order might cause committees to reexamine their rules .

many senate rules , standing orders , and other decisions of the senate , such as committee funding , affect committees' conduct of their legislative and executive business .

however , the two principal senate rules related to committees' activities are rule xxv , which contains committees' jurisdictions , and rule xxvi , which details committee procedures .

a number of committees specifically acknowledged the primacy of senate rules in their own rules .

these were the committees on armed services ; energy and natural resources ; foreign relations ; health , education , labor , and pensions ; small business and entrepreneurship ; veterans' affairs ; and indian affairs .

some of these committees' rules also acknowledged the preeminence of senate resolutions and the legislative reorganization acts of 1946 and 1970 .

the foreign relations committee , in addition , made its rule i its jurisdictional statement from rule xxv , paragraph 1 ( j ) .

most committees appended their jurisdictional statements to their rules .

in addition to their rules , some committees have adopted resolutions , manuals , and other guidance that may affect their operations .

the primary legislative function of the standing committees of the u.s. senate is to evaluate the thousands of bills and resolutions that senators introduce in each two - year congress , which are normally referred upon introduction to the appropriate committee , and measures passed by the house .

senate committees also annually evaluate thousands of executive nominations , and the foreign relations committee has jurisdiction over treaties submitted by the president for the advice and consent of the senate .

this report catalogues and compares the rules in the 114 th congress of the 18 senate committees with legislative authority â€” committees having authority to report legislation to the senate .

the report is organized topically rather than by senate rule or paragraph of a senate rule or by committee .

broad topics based principally on provisions of senate rule xxvi , such as committee meetings , are divided into more specific topics , such as regular meeting days , additional committee meetings , and meetings initiated by committee members .

topics also include nominations , treaties , and related responsibilities covered by committees' rules .

all these topics might be further divided .

for most topics , a summary of the relevant provision or provisions of any senate rule appears first .

this summary is followed by an explanation and a comparison of individual committees' rules , which appear in both text and tables .

relevant provisions of standing orders applicable to all committees or specific committees , which pertain to legislative or executive business , are also cited .

the report is not intended to be read from beginning to end but might be used by chairs , ranking minority members , and committee staff considering amendments to rules , by committee members and their legislative staff seeking to increase their knowledge of committee rules , and by new senators and staff building procedural knowledge .

the principal headings in the report are as follows: " subcommittees " " committee meetings " " quorum requirements " " open and closed meetings " " hearing procedures " " oversight " " referral of legislation " " markup procedures " " voting in committee " " reports " " nominations " " foreign relations committee's treaty procedures " " committees' other , related responsibilities " " committee records .

the foreign relations committee has the unique responsibility among all congressional committees to review treaties submitted by the president and report on them to the senate .

proceedings on treaties that were reported to the senate but not acted on terminate at the end of a congress ; they resume at the convening of the next congress as if no proceedings had occurred earlier .
