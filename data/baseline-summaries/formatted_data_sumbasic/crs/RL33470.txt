appropriations bills reflect the jurisdiction of the subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees in which they are considered .

jurisdictions for the subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees were changed at the beginning of the 109 th congress .

in the 108 th congress , both the house and senate subcommittees had identical jurisdiction and produced the commerce , justice , state , the judiciary and related agencies appropriations bills .

in the 109 th congress , jurisdiction for the judiciary appropriation was removed to the treasury , transportation , hud subcommittees in the house and the senate .

science appropriations , namely the national aeronautical and space administration and the national science foundation , were transferred to the former cjs subcommittees in both chambers .

in the senate , appropriations for the department of state were transferred to the foreign operations subcommittee ; however , they remain under the jurisdiction of ssjc in the house .

in addition , the senate appropriations committee has placed the national institute of science and technology and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration under its title iii science agencies .

for the purposes of comparison , this report will retain reference to these agencies in title ii commerce agencies .

department of justice the president's fy2007 budget request proposes the consolidation of the state , local , and tribal law enforcement grant programs , the weed and seed program , and juvenile justice programs into the justice assistance account of the office of justice programs ( ojp ) .

title ii includes the appropriations for the department of commerce and related agencies .

the origins of the department date to 1903 with the establishment of the department of commerce and labor ( 32 stat .

825 ) .

the separate department of commerce was established on march 4 , 1913 ( 37 stat .

7365 ; 15 u.s.c .

1501 ) .

the department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied , but its activities center on five basic missions: ( 1 ) promoting the development of u.s. business and increasing foreign trade ; ( 2 ) improving the nation's technological competitiveness ; ( 3 ) encouraging economic development ; ( 4 ) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment ; and ( 5 ) compiling , analyzing , and disseminating statistical information on the u.s. economy and population .

the following agencies within the commerce department carry out these missions: economic development administration ( eda ) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions .

minority business development agency ( mbda ) seeks to promote private and public sector investment in minority businesses .

bureau of the census collects , compiles , and publishes a broad range of economic , demographic , and social data .

economic and statistical analysis programs provide ( 1 ) timely information on the state of the economy through preparation , development , and interpretation of economic data and ( 2 ) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities .

much of the analysis is conducted by the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) .

international trade administration ( ita ) seeks to develop the export potential of u.s. firms and to improve the trade performance of u.s. industry .

bureau of industry and security enforces u.s. export laws consistent with national security , foreign policy , and short - supply objectives ( formerly the bureau of export administration ) .

national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) advises the president on domestic and international communications policy , manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum , and performs research in telecommunications sciences .

the president's fy2007 budget request called for $6.18 billion for the commerce department .

this represented a decrease of $293.8 million , or about 4.5% , from the fy2006 appropriation for the department of $6.47 billion ( after the fy2006 rescission ) .

the house bill , h.r .

5672 , would have cut the department's appropriation further , to $5.77 billion , about 6% less than the current level and 10% less than the request .

the principal reductions made by the house were in the accounts for noaa , eda , census , and departmental management .

the revised continuing appropriations resolution 2007 ( p.l .

110-5 ) enacted funding level for the commerce department for fy2007 was reported to be $6.53 billion .

the eeoc enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability .

in the past few years , appropriators have been particularly concerned about the agency's implementation of a restructuring plan .

the three - phase restructuring plan includes the national contact center , a two - year pilot project , that began in march 2005 ; the january 2006 commencement of field structure and staff realignment that the commission approved in mid - 2005 ; and the examination of headquarters' structure and operations to streamline functions and clarify roles and responsibilities .

the 110 th congress passed the revised continuing appropriations resolution , 2007 , and it was signed into law ( p.l .

110-5 ) on february 15 , 2007 .

the enacted funding level for the eeoc for fy2007 was reported to be $327.0 million , which is the same as the agency's budget in fy2006 .

the administration had proposed a budget of $322.8 million for the eeoc , or $4.2 million less than the fy2006 appropriation .

 ( the fy2006 figure of $327.0 million includes rescissions of $0.9 million and $3.3 million from the $331.2 million contained in the science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies appropriations act , 2006 [ p.l .

109-108 ] ) .

the budget request would have reduced staffing by 19 full - time equivalents and provided up to $28 million for payments to state and local entities with which the agency has work - sharing agreements to address workplace discrimination within their jurisdictions ( i.e. , fair employment practices agencies , fepas , and tribal employment rights organizations , teros ) .

last year , the administration requested up to $33 million for fepas and teros ; this is the amount to which congress had , in prior years , raised the eeoc's request .

 ( the agency estimated it would spend $30.5 million on these work - sharing arrangements in fy2006. ) .

in addition to the proposed reduction in the state and local contract maximum , the commission anticipated offsetting its request for an additional $4.4 million to cover the staff's total compensation with cutbacks in general operating expenses and information technology ( it ) expenditures .

h.r .

5672 , which the house passed in june 2006 , included funding for the eeoc at the level requested by the administration ( $322.8 million ) .

the bill further concurred in the administration's request that agency payments to fepas and teros not exceed $28 million .

as in the past , the house would have prohibited the commission from implementing any workforce repositioning , restructuring , or reorganization until it notified the committees on appropriations of such proposals .

this also was stated in h.rept .

109-520 , which further directed the eeoc to submit to the committee a comprehensive analysis of current staffing levels by department and the full impact the headquarters repositioning , restructuring , or reorganization will have on all core services , including the number of staff to be redeployed to the field .

in addition , h.rept .

109-520 instructed the agency to continue submitting quarterly status reports on projected and actual spending levels , by function , and highlighting any changes that result from repositioning activities .

the house appropriations committee also expected the eeoc to use findings from the inspector general's evaluation of the national contact center to improve the project's operation .

the senate appropriations committee reported its bill in july 2006 .

s.rept .

109-280 provided a larger appropriation of $327.0 million to the eeoc .

most of the additional funding would have gone toward agency payments to fepas and teros — up to $33 million rather than $28 million .

the committee would have prohibited any sums to be used to fund the position of "chief operating officer" and to operate the national contact center .

the chair of the eeoc was further directed to assign at least 57 full - time permanent positions to the commission's baltimore office , among them a district director and regional attorney .

s.rept .

109-280 instructed the agency not to implement any workforce repositioning , restructuring , or reorganization until it notified the senate committee on appropriations of such proposals .

the administration requested an fy2006 appropriation of $331.2 million for the eeoc , an increase of $4.4 million from the $326.8 million ( including rescissions ) provided by the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ( p.l .

108-447 ) .

following the appropriations committees' recommendations , the house and senate endorsed the administration's budget proposal for the commission .

in november 2005 , president bush signed the fy2006 appropriations bill ( h.r .

2862 ) , which included a rescission of 0.28% .

in december 2005 , the president signed the department of defense , emergency supplemental appropriations to address hurricanes in the gulf of mexico , and the pandemic influenza act , 2006 ( h.r .

2863 , p.l .

109-148 ) , which contained an additional rescission of 1.0% .

the conference agreement adopted , by reference , language in h.rept .

109-118 that requires the commission to continue submitting quarterly reports on projected and actual spending levels by function and to highlight any changes due to repositioning activities .

the conference agreement also adopted , by reference , language in s.rept .

109-88 that ( 1 ) prohibits the agency from implementing a repositioning plan that reduces the salary of eeoc employees or reduces the number of officers or employees serving as mediators , investigators , or attorneys at any commission office and that ( 2 ) directs the commission to submit to congress , before implementation of any repositioning , restructuring or reorganization plan , a comprehensive analysis ( conducted for each district , field , area , and local office ) of current investigations and enforcement levels and the full impact of such plan on all core services .

the conference agreement further provided that the eeoc should not undertake any workforce repositioning , restructuring , or reorganizing without advance notification of the committees on appropriations .

in addition , the conferees directed the commission to continue working toward resolution of concerns regarding the pending repositioning plan .

the federal communications commission , created in 1934 , is an independent agency charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio , television , wire , satellite , and cable .

the fcc is also charged with promoting the safety of life and property through wire and radio communications .

the mandate of the fcc under the communications act is to make available to all people of the united states a rapid , efficient , nationwide , and worldwide wire and radio communication service .

the fcc performs five major functions to fulfill this charge: spectrum allocation , creating rules to promote fair competition and protect consumers where required by market conditions , authorization of service , enhancement of public safety and homeland security , and enforcement .

the fcc obtains the majority of its funding through the collection of regulatory fees pursuant to title i , section 9 , of the communications act of 1934 ; therefore , its direct appropriation is considerably less than its overall budget .

for fy2007 , the senate recommended an overall budget of $301.500 million for the salaries and expenses of the fcc , all of which is to be collected through regulatory fees ( no direct appropriation ) .

the senate fy2007 recommendation was $1.042 million less than the bush administration request of $302.542 million and $11.742 million more than the fy2006 enacted appropriation of $289.758 million .

the senate expressed its continued concern about the declining standards of broadcast television and the impact that decline is having on america's children and also strongly urged the fcc to act expeditiously upon the complaint filed under section 616 of the communications act regarding washington nationals baseball .

for fy2007 , the house of representatives recommended an overall appropriation of $294.261 million for the salaries and expenses of the fcc .

of that figure , $293.261 million was to be collected through regulatory fees , with a direct appropriation of $1.0 million .

the house fy2007 recommendation was $8.281 million less than the bush administration request of $302.542 million and $4.503 million more than the fy2006 enacted appropriation of $289.758 million .

the recommended fy2007 funding level would cover efforts to promote the deployment of broadband services , deregulate where competition exists , enhance public safety and homeland security , ensure the viability of the universal service fund , promote the efficient use of spectrum , and review media regulation to foster competition and diversity .

the revised continuing appropriations resolution 2007 ( p.l .

110-5 ) enacted funding level for the fcc for fy2007 was reported to be a direct appropriation of $1.0 million , which is the same as the agency's budget in fy2006 .

the federal trade commission ( commission or ftc ) is an independent agency .

it seeks to protect consumers and enhance competition by eliminating unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the marketing of goods and services and by ensuring that consumer markets function competitively .

for fy2007 , the administration had requested a program level of $223 million for the ftc , an increase of slightly more than $13 million , or 6.2% , over fy2006 funding .

the house - passed bill provided the ftc with $213 million for fy2007 , which was $3 million above the previous - year funding .

for its part , the senate followed the recommendation of the appropriations committee , which set funding for the agency for fy2007 at the $223 million level .

of the amounts provided , $129 was to be derived from hart - scott - rodino pre - merger filing fees and $18 million from so - called do - not - call fees ( more formally known as the telemarketing sales rule , promulgated under the telephone consumer fraud and abuse prevention act ) .

the total amount of direct appropriations for fy2007 was therefore $76 million .

in recent years , the ftc has mostly funded its operations by means of its pre - merger filing fees collections and , to a lesser extent , from do - not - call fees .

by way of an historical footnote , for fy2000 through fy2002 , zero ( $0 ) direct appropriations were required , because the entire program level was covered by a combination of fees and prior - year collections .

the lsc is a private , non - profit , federally funded corporation that provides grants to local offices that , in turn , provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( non - criminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annual appropriations bills , congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases .

p.l .

109-108 ( enacted on november 22 , 2005 ) included $330.8 million for the lsc for fy2006 , the same amount that was originally passed by the house , instead of $358.5 million as passed by the senate .

the lsc fy2006 appropriation included $312.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $12.8 million for management and administration ; $1.3 million for client self - help and information technology , $2.5 million for the office of the inspector general , and $1.8 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census - based reallocations .

in addition , p.l .

109-108 included language that advised the lsc to reduce its rent for its office space ( by eliminating some office space and negotiating a more competitive cost per square foot ) and included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

p.l .

109-108 also included a general rescission equal to 0.28% of funding for the science , state , justice , commerce , and related agencies appropriation ( which includes the lsc ) .

moreover , p.l .

109-148 ( enacted on december 30 , 2005 ) included a 1% government - wide rescission on discretionary programs .

thus , the lsc appropriation for fy2006 was lowered to $326.6 million .

for fy2007 , the bush administration requested $310.9 million for the lsc .

this amount is almost $16 million below the fy2006 funding level for the lsc .

the budget request included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

the lsc would receive $288.6 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $14.4 million for management and administration ; $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology ; $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $2.0 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census - based reallocations .

the house appropriations committee recommended a total of $313.860 million for the lsc ( h.r .

5672 ; h.rept .

109-520 ) and included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

this is $3 million above the fy2007 budget request and $12.7 million below the fy2006 final appropriation .

since the lsc is a private , nonprofit corporation , it is not required to comply with federal laws related to employment , travel , and other administrative procedures , but the committee bill requires that the lsc submit a report to the committee no later than february 1 , 2007 , describing whether , in fact , lsc procedures adhere to federal law and , if discrepancies exist , proposals to modify lsc procedures so that they will comply with federal law .

on june 27 , 2006 , the house passed a floor amendment ( by representative obey , 337 yeas to 185 noes ) that increased the lsc funding level by $25 million , from $313.9 million ( h.r .

5672 ; h.rept .

109-520 ) to $338.9 million .

under the house - passed bill , the lsc would receive $321.9 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $12.7 million for management and administration ; $1.2 million for client self - help and information technology ; and $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general .

the senate appropriations committee recommended a total of $358.527 million for the lsc ( h.r .

5672 ; s.rept .

109-280 ) and included existing provisions restricting the activities of lsc grantees .

this is $47.7 million above the fy2007 budget request , $31.9 million above the fy2006 final appropriation , and $19.7 million above the house - passed version of the bill .

the lsc would receive $337.8 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $12.8 million for management and administration ; $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology ; $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $2.0 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census - based reallocations .

congress passed a fourth continuing resolution ( h.j.res .

20 ) , which included provisions to fund most of the government agencies , including the lsc , through fy2007 .

h.j.res .

20 passed the house on january 31 , 2007 , and passed the senate on february 14 , 2007 .

the final version ( p.l .

110-5 ) included language that specified that the lsc would be funded at $348.6 million for fy2007 .

the lsc fy2007 appropriation included $330.8 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $12.7 million for management and administration ; $2.1 million for client self - help and information technology , and $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general .

the sec administers and enforces federal securities laws to protect investors from fraud and to maintain fair and orderly markets .

the sec's budget is set through the normal appropriations process , but funds for the agency come from fees on sales of stock , new issues of stocks and bonds , corporate mergers , and other securities market transactions .

the sec is required to adjust the fee rates periodically to make the amount collected approximately equal to the agency's budget .

when the fees are collected , they go to a special offsetting account available to appropriators , not to the treasury's general fund .

the administration's request for fy2006 was $888.1 million , a decrease of 2.7% from fy2005 .

of that total , $25.0 million was to be from prior - year unobligated balances , and the remaining $863.1 would be from offsetting fee collections .

the house , the senate , and the conference all approved an amount equal to the request: $888.1 million , of which $25.0 million came from prior - year unobligated balances , and the remainder ( $863.1 million ) from current - year fee collections .

there was no direct appropriation from the general fund .

for fy2007 , the administration requested $890.8 million , an increase of 0.3% over fy2006 .

the house approved $900.5 million for the sec , 1.4% above the fy2006 appropriation and 1.1% above the administration's request .

of that total , $20.0 million was to come from prior - year unobligated balances , and the remainder from current - year fee collections .

the senate committee recommended $890.8 million for the sec in fy2007 , the amount of the administration's request .

finally , enacted budget authority under the continuing resolution was $892.6 million , of which $25.0 million was prior - year unobligated balances .

there was no direct appropriation from the general fund .

the sba is an independent federal agency created by the small business act of 1953 .

although the agency administers a number of programs intended to assist small firms , arguably its three most important functions are to guarantee — principally through the agency's section 7 ( a ) general business loan program — business loans made by banks and other financial institutions ; to make long - term , low - interest loans to small businesses , nonprofits , and households that are victims of hurricanes , earthquakes , other physical disasters , and acts of terrorism ; and to serve as an advocate for small business within the federal government .

the sba's total budget for fy2007 increased to $572 million from fy2006's $456 million .

the increase of $116 million was to fund the disaster loan program .

in addition , $13.4 million of unobligated balances from previous years was rescinded .

lending authority would stay the same for all loan programs .

the state justice institute ( sji ) is a private , nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts and funds research , technical assistance , and informational projects aimed at improving the quality of judicial administration in state courts across the united states .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sji is authorized to present its budget request directly to congress , apart from the president's budget .

with enactment of p.l .

110-5 , congress determined that sji would receive the same appropriation amount for fy2007 , $3.46 million , as it received for fy2006 .

sji had requested an appropriation of $4.5 million for fy2007 , a 30.2% increase .

by contrast , the bush administration , as in its budgets for the previous four years , proposed the complete elimination of federal funding for the institute in fy2007 .

in its passage , on june 29 , 2006 , of h.r .

5672 , the ssjc appropriations bill for fy2007 , the house ( following the recommendation of its appropriations committee ) provided $2 million for sji , $1.46 million less than the fy2006 funding amount .

in its amended version of h.r .

5672 , reported on july 13 , 2006 , the senate appropriations committee recommended , as sji had requested , $4.5 million , $1.05 million above fy2006 funding .

for the five fiscal years prior to fy2007 , appropriations conferees in congress had encouraged sji to obtain funds , at least in part , from sources other than congress .

in response to a directive from house - senate conferees for the fy2006 appropriations act , sji , in its fy2007 request , noted that it has adopted a 50% "cash match requirement" from its grantees .

also in its request , the institute stated that it continues to pursue grant - making partnerships with the department of justice's office of justice programs ( ojp ) , the legal services corporation ( lsc ) , and other public and private entities , looking to "pool its resources with ojp , lsc , and others to fund innovations in areas of mutual concern. .

in the fy2006 appropriations process , the house appropriations committee endorsed an approach of providing some directly appropriated funds to sji , but with the institute as well seeking additional funding from department of justice grant programs .

the house committee ( in h.rept .

109-118 , p.154 ) stated that it understood that sji had "been unable to generate stable sources of non - federal funding" and that the sji had contacted bar associations and court organizations as possible alternative sources of funding .

however , the committee noted , these groups were "not inclined to contribute to operations of the sji beyond providing matching grant funds for individual projects. .

for this reason , the committee said , it continued to recommend funding for sji even though the president's fy2006 request did not .

the committee commended sji for beginning to work with ojp on issues involving state courts and encouraged sji to continue seeking funds from ojp grant programs .

the $3.5 million approved by congress for sji in fy2006 marked the second fiscal year in a row in which funding for the institute had been increased — following a number of years during which appropriators in congress considered whether to provide any funding for sji .

for fy2007 , the house appropriations committee recommended $2 million for sji in fy2007 , $1.46 million less than the institute's fy2006 appropriation .

the committee , in its report on the ssjc appropriation bill for fy2007 , commended sji for "continuing to work with the office of justice program ( ojp ) on issues involving state courts," and it encouraged sji "to continue to seek funding from ojp grant programs. .

the committee also "applauded" sji for "recent successes in obtaining dollar - for - dollar matching funds for grants awarded," adding that it expected "this goal to remain in place during fiscal year 2007. .

for its part , the senate appropriations committee recommended $4.5 million for sji in fy2007 , $1.05 million above the level enacted for fy2006 .

in its report , the committee's discussion of recommended funding for sji simply noted that the institute had been created in 1984 to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in state courts .

after the house passed ( but prior to senate passage of ) the fy2007 continuing appropriations resolution , sji's newsletter characterized the $3.46 million approved by the house for fy2007 as a "'hard freeze' at our fiscal year ( fy ) 2006 funding level. .

it commented that although "the 'glass is half empty' crowd might lament that figure , we are very comfortable with it," adding .

"we are grateful to congress for their continued support and look forward to continuing to meet their high expectations of us. .
