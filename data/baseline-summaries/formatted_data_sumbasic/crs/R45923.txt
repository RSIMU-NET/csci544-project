the u.s. coast guard is the agency charged by law with overseeing the safety of vessels and maritime operations .

for at least four decades , congress has been concerned about the coast guard's ability to maintain an adequate staff of experienced marine safety personnel with technical knowledge of vessel construction and accident investigation .

recent incidents , particularly the 2015 sinking of the u.s. - flag cargo ship el faro with the loss of 33 lives during a hurricane near the bahamas , have revived questions about the coast guard's persistent difficulty with hiring and training a marine safety workforce .

the safety inspections of the vessel were found to have been inadequate .

in the hamm alert maritime safety act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-265 , â§210 ) , congress directed the coast guard to brief congressional committees of jurisdiction on its efforts to enhance its marine inspections staff , the staff responsible for ensuring that vessels are meeting safety standards .

in the frank lobiondo coast guard authorization act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-282 , â§501 ) congress requested a report from the coast guard detailing the courses and other training a marine inspector must complete to be considered qualified , including any courses that have been dropped from the training curriculum in recent years .

this report examines the staffing challenges the coast guard faces in assuring marine safety at a time when its responsibilities in this area are increasing significantly .

it also considers proposals to realign marine safety functions within the federal government .

the coast guard engages in two distinct activities with respect to marine safety: vessel inspection .

the coast guard has a staff of 671 marine inspectorsâ533 military and 138 civilianâwho are responsible for inspecting u.s. - registered passenger and cargo vessels , foreign - flag vessels calling at u.s. ports , mobile offshore drilling units , and towing vessels and barges carrying hazardous cargoes .

foreign - flag vessels are those registered in jurisdictions other than the united states .

accident investigation .

the coast guard employs 158 accident investigatorsâ120 military and 38 civilianâwho conduct casualty investigations of u.s. - and foreign - flag vessels to detect and correct safety hazards , prepare investigation reports , analyze trends , and recommend enforcement action .

these two assignments fall under the coast guard's prevention policy workforce headed by the assistant commandant for prevention policy , a rear admiral .

reporting to the assistant commandant is the director of inspections and compliance , a captain , who oversees the office of commercial vessel compliance and the office of investigations and casualty analysis , among other safety - related offices .

the prevention policy workforce is especially critical for the commercial u.s. - flag fleet because a majority of this fleet is much older than the 15 to 20 years of age at which ships in the worldwide oceangoing fleet are typically scrapped .

about 60% of the 217 ships in the dry - cargo u.s. - flag commercial fleet and 53% of u.s. - flag offshore supply vessels ( which service oil rigs ) are older than 20 years ; the el faro had been in service for 40 years .

some 72% of the 1,497 vessels in the u.s. - flag passenger and ferry fleet are over 20 years old .

in general , older vessels require more frequent inspection ; the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) raised questions about the quality of the coast guard's inspections in its investigation of the el faro sinking , after which the coast guard revoked the safety certificate for another vessel of the same design and similar age , forcing its removal from service .

generally , inspections of vessels carrying passengers or hazardous cargo , and inspections of older vessels , are more frequent than inspections of general - cargo vessels and newer vessels .

vessels transporting cargo or passengers domestically ( from one u.s. point to another u.s. point ) must be u.s. - built , as required by the jones act .

the cost of u.s. - built vessels , particularly deep - draft ships , can be multiples of world prices , which may retard vessel replacement .

u.s. - flag vessels on international voyages need not be u.s. - built , and this fleet is younger than the jones act fleet .

congress's request for information about the coast guard's inspection staff comes at a time when the number of vessels requiring inspection is increasing by about 50% because towing vessels have been added to the list .

congress has been increasing the agency's role in fishing vessel safety as well , putting additional demands on the safety workforce .

adding to the coast guard's safety responsibilities is the construction of several liquefied natural gas ( lng ) export terminals , whose siting , operations , and security are partly or entirely under coast guard jurisdiction , as well as the increasing use of lng as ship fuel .

the coast guard repeatedly has made statements in recent decades laying out its plans to improve the quality of its inspection workforce .

often , these pronouncements have been in response to heightened congressional scrutiny of the agency's marine inspection program in the aftermath of a major marine casualty in which investigators found that subpar vessel inspections played a contributing role .

this cycle was described by a retired coast guard senior official in 2015: [t]he marine safety program is a low profile mission within the coast guard's multi - mission portfolio .

that is true until a confluence of factors markedly raises its visibility and causes great introspection .

the program's purpose is to keep bad things from happening .

non - events are virtually impossible to measure .

marine safety is normally not a major budget item of interest to the service .

the coast guard , especially in what has generally been a declining resource environment , will always have many pressing and competing budget needs .

and if a major incident occurs , congress is willing to throw the service a lifesaver in the form of significant dollars .

as employees of a military organization , coast guard personnel typically change mission assignments and / or locations every two or three years , so they do not develop the knowledge and experience required of a proficient marine inspector or investigator .

as noted , the scope of the vessel types the coast guard inspects ranges from small passenger boats to oceangoing ships to mobile offshore drilling rigs .

geographic reassignments can change the category of vessels an individual inspector must evaluate .

vessel technology can be complex and is constantly changing , and the safety regulations are voluminous and technical .

an internal coast guard study in 2012 revealed that "41% of marine inspectors were not confident interacting with maritime industry personnel concerning marine inspection issues. .

even if personnel rotate back into marine inspection after a different assignment , they need time to regain proficiency .

the coast guard recognizes the difficulty of building marine inspection and investigation proficiency among uniformed officers who rotate assignments frequently .

consequently , each commandant's initiative or plan to revamp marine inspections has stated a goal of boosting the civilian inspector and investigator workforce and creating more attractive long - term career paths by extending promotion potential .

however , a perception inside the agency that marine safety is an area that retards promotion could be thwarting efforts to boost the inspection workforce .

this is asserted in a study by a career coast guard official who spent his last several years working in human resources for the agency: [t]he coast guard's internal manpower management processes are considered to be at odds with the need to build and maintain a competent marine safety officer corps â¦ the perception for decades is that it is difficult for marine safety officers to succeed in the coast guard's military officer promotion system .

the service endeavors to manage individual officer specialties , such as marine safety , while at the same time operate an "up or out" promotion system that is mandated by law.... officers who follow a marine safety career path consider themselves disadvantaged as they become more senior and face stiffer competition for promotion... .

currently , the perception of disadvantage continues .

as the above history indicates , the measure most often proposed to increase the competence of marine safety personnel is to shift this mission to a civilian workforce in a civilian subagency , either under the coast guard or somewhere else in the executive branch with complementary maritime functions .

while such a shift could have the advantages stated , one cannot necessarily expect it , in and of itself , to solve the issue completely .

civilian agencies with inspection workforces covering technically demanding industries also have had difficulty retaining experienced staff .

for instance , the federal aviation administration has been criticized for increasing its reliance on private - sector inspectors paid by industry rather than enhancing its in - house inspection workforce .

the rationale for this reliance on private - industry inspectors is that the pace of technological development in aviation has overwhelmed the capability of government inspectors .

similarly , the department of transportation's pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration , which regulates pipeline safety , has found that experienced inspectors are often hired away as safety compliance officers by pipeline companies .

the department of the interior has voiced much the same concern with respect to the offshore oil rig inspection workforce of the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement .

even under a civilian agency , vessel inspectors would be subject to recruitment by private industry , as experienced inspectors are sought by ship owners , banks that finance ships , and insurers , all of which want to ensure ships are built to , and are being maintained to , safety standards .

inspectors are employed by private ship classification societies for this purpose .

another consideration with respect to realigning the government's marine safety function is the benefit of housing maritime - related missions in a single agency .

as commandants have argued , there are synergies among these missions .

for example , the knowledge of and familiarity with vessels and crews that safety inspectors gain via their interactions with them provide risk intelligence relevant to the agency's security mission .

personnel involved in the often perilous mission of search and rescue directly benefit from a competent and effective safety inspection workforce that can reduce the number of such missions .

the vessel safety inspection function has synergies with vessel environmental inspections related to oil pollution , ballast water , and emissions .

the marine safety function is also complimentary to the coast guard's responsibility for deploying and maintaining channel marker buoys and lights and breaking ice in winter .

fisheries enforcement has synergies with fishing safety and security missions .

all of these missions require special knowledge for operating on the water , and most require a fleet to do so .

thus , there are both human resource and capital equipment synergies among these missions .

notwithstanding these factors , one can also rationalize dismantling parts of the coast guard and reorganizing them under other agencies .

the coast guard has a close relationship with the navy , even in peacetime .

in 1982 , members of congress sponsored bills to transfer the agency to the navy or the department of defense ( h.r .

4996 , h.r .

5567 ) .

these proposals were partly in response to the reagan administration's proposal to drastically reduce the size of the coast guard , replace the commandant with a civilian administrator , and transfer the coast guard's aids to navigation mission to the army corps of engineers .

during the partial government shutdown in january 2019 , when coast guard personnel were the only military personnel not paid , calls for shifting the coast guard to the navy or department of defense were renewed .

while some supporters hope that transferring the coast guard to the military might boost the agency's budget , others have argued that the coast guard's nondefense - related missions would suffer , as these missions are not a priority for the military .

it would appear that such a transfer might not assist the coast guard in addressing the issue of rotating staff in the marine safety program .

in addition to realigning marine safety functions , congress has discussed rearranging navigation - related functions in the federal government more broadly .

some members of congress , dissatisfied with the army corps of engineers' performance in the provision of navigation channel infrastructure , have proposed transferring that function to the department of transportation .

the trump administration also has proposed this transfer as part of a larger reorganization plan involving multiple agencies .

congress has requested a national academy of sciences study related to this idea .

if such a transfer were to occur , navigation infrastructure functions could be combined with a marine safety inspection and accident investigation within the department of transportation .

this combination of safety and infrastructure provision parallels the primary missions of the department with respect to other transportation modes .

however , congress has shown reluctance to eliminate any of the coast guard's missions .

both in 1967 , when the department of transportation was created and the coast guard was transferred there from the department of the treasury , and in 2003 after the department of homeland security was created , and the agency was transferred there from the department of transportation , the coast guard was transferred as a distinct entity .
