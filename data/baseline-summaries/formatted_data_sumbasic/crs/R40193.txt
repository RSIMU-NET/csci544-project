on december 23 , 2010 , the roman catholic archdiocese of havana announced that two more political prisoners would be released .

this brought to 57 the number of political prisoners released since july , with 56 agreeing to be sent to spain and 1 released on humanitarian parole to remain in cuba .

it also includes 41 of 52 prisoners arrested in 2003 that the government had agreed in july 2010 to release .

cardinal jaime ortega maintains that the remaining 11 political prisoners on the list from july ( some who want to remain in cuba and some who want to travel to the united states ) would be released in coming months .

overall , human rights groups estimate that there are around 100 remaining political prisoners in cuba .

 ( see " political prisoners " below. ) .

on december 3 , 2010 , the state department issued a statement on the one - year anniversary of the detention of usaid subcontractor alan gross in cuba , calling for his release and maintaining that "the continued detention of alan gross is a major impediment to advancing the dialogue between our two countries. .

on november 8 , 2010 , president castro announced that the cuban communist party's sixth congress would be held in april 2011 , and would concentrate on updating the cuban economic model , and outlining the economic and social policy of the party and the revolution .

the last party congress was held in 1997 .

in september 2010 , the cuban government announced a significant series of reforms designed to reduce the public sector and increase private enterprise .

on september 13 , 2010 , the government announced that by the end of march 2011 it would identify half a million state workers that would be laid off , with most expected to find work in the expanding private sector .

on september 24 , the government announced an expansion of self - employment , identifying 178 categories of work allowed with 83 of those allowing small businesses to hire non - family members .

 ( see " economic changes under raúl " below. ) .

on september 13 , 2010 , president obama issued his annual determination with respect to foreign governments' efforts regarding trafficking in persons .

with regard to cuba , which has been on the state department's list of countries ( tier 3 ) that do not cooperate in the fight against trafficking since 2003 , the president provided a partial waiver to allow for educational and cultural exchange programs .

on july 29 , 2010 , the senate committee on appropriations reported s. 3677 ( s.rept .

111-238 ) , the fy2011 financial services and general government appropriations act , with a provision in section 621 that would continue to define during fiscal year 2011 "payment of cash in advance" under the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 as payment before the transfer of title to , and control of , the exported items to the cuban purchaser .

this would extend a similar provision for fy2010 .

for entries from 2010 and 2009 , see appendix a .

raúl castro officially became cuba's president on february 24 , 2008 .

on that day , cuba's legislature selected him as president of the 31-member council of state , a position that officially made him cuba's head of government and state .

most observers expected this since he already had been heading the cuban government on a provisional basis since july 2006 when his brother fidel castro , cuba's long - ruling communist leader , stepped down as president because of poor health .

for many years , raúl , as first vice president of the council of state and the council of ministers , had been the officially designated successor and was slated to become chief of state with fidel's departure .

raúl also had served as minister of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) since the beginning of the cuban revolution .

when fidel stepped down from power in late july 2006 because of poor health , he signed a proclamation that ceded political power to raúl on a provisional basis , including the positions of first secretary of the cuban communist party ( pcc ) , commander in chief of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) , and president of the council of state .

despite the change in government in february 2008 , fidel still holds the official title of first secretary of the pcc .

while it was not a surprise to observers for raúl to succeed his brother fidel as head of government , the selection of josé ramón machado ventura as the council of state's first vice president was a surprise .

born in 1930 , machado is a physician by training and is part of the older generation of so - called históricos of the 1959 cuban revolution ( fidel castro was born on august 13 , 1926 , while raúl castro was born on june 3 , 1931 ) .

he has been described as a hard - line communist party ideologue , and reportedly has been a close friend and confident of raul for many years .

machado's position is significant because it makes him the official successor to raúl , according to the cuban constitution .

many observers had expected that carlos lage , one of five other vice presidents on the council of state , would have been chosen as first vice president .

born in 1951 , lage was responsible for cuba's economic reforms in the 1990s , and represented a younger generation of cuban leaders .

several key military officers and confidants of raúl also became members of the council , increasing the role of the military in the government .

general julio casas regueiro , who already was on the council , became one of its five vice presidents .

most significantly , casas , who had been first vice minister in the far , was selected by raúl as the country's new minister of the far , officially replacing raúl in that position .

casas also is chairman of gaesa ( grupo de administracion empresarial , s.a. ) , the cuban military's holding company for its extensive business operations .

two other military appointments to the council were gen. alvaro lópez miera , the army's chief of staff , and gen. leopoldo cintra frías , who commanded the western army , one of cuba's three military regions .

cuba has a poor record on human rights , with the government sharply restricting freedoms of expression , association , assembly , movement , and other basic rights .

it has cracked down on dissent , arrested human rights activists and independent journalists , and staged demonstrations against critics .

some observers anticipated a relaxation of the government's oppressive tactics in the aftermath of the january 1998 visit of pope john paul ii , but government attacks against human rights activists and other dissidents have continued since that time .

the cuban government conducted a severe crackdown in march 2003 ( often referred to as the primavera negra , or black spring ) and imprisoned 75 democracy activists , including independent journalists and librarians and leaders of independent labor unions and opposition parties .

in may 2010 , however , cuba's catholic cardinal jaime ortega met with president castro in talks that led to the release of several political prisoners .

after a subsequent meeting on july 7 , 2010 , along with visiting spanish foreign minister miguel ángel moratinos , the church announced that authorities would free 52 political prisoners , with 5 to be released soon and 47 others over the next 3 to 4 months .

by the end of 2010 , human rights groups estimated that around 100 political prisoners remained .

 ( see discussion of " political prisoners " below. ) .

after the collapse of the former soviet union , russian financial assistance to cuba practically ended , and as a result , cuba experienced severe economic deterioration from 1989-1993 , with estimates of economic decline ranging from 35% - 50% .

since then , however , there has been considerable improvement .

from 1994-2000 , as cuba moved forward with some limited market - oriented economic reforms , economic growth averaged 3.7% annually .

economic growth was strong in the 2005-2007 period , registering an impressive 11.2% in 2005 ( despite widespread damage caused by hurricanes dennis and wilma ) , 12.1% in 2006 , and 7.3% in 2007 .

the economy benefitted from the growth of the tourism , nickel , and oil sectors , and support from venezuela and china in terms of investment commitments and credit lines .

cuba also benefits from a preferential oil agreement with venezuela , which provides cuba with more than 90,000 barrels of oil a day .

the market value of venezuela's oil to cuba reportedly amounted to over $2 billion annually in 2006 and 2007 , and over $3 billion in 2008 .

venezuela also helped cuba upgrade an oil refinery in cienfuegos , which was inaugurated in 2007 .

in 2008 , economic growth slowed to an estimated 4.1% .

this was prompted by several problems , including the declining price of nickel , which accounts for a major share of cuba's exports , the rising cost of food imports , and the devastation wrought by hurricanes gustav and ike , particularly in the agricultural sectors .

the global financial crisis had a negative effect on the cuban economy in 2009 because of lower world prices for nickel and a reduction in tourism from canada and europe .

as a result , economic growth slowed to 1.4% in 2009 while the estimate for 2010 is for 1.5% growth .

in 2009 , the government announced austerity measures that included energy rationing and cutbacks in transportation and some food programs .

over the years , cuba has expressed pride for the nation's accomplishments in health and education .

according to the u.n. development program's 2010 human development report , life expectancy in cuba in 2010 was 79 years and adult literacy was estimated at almost 100% .

cuba has also boasted a 2009 infant mortality rate of 4.8 per 1,000 live births .

when cuba's economic slide began in 1989 , the government showed little willingness to adopt any significant market - oriented economic reforms , but in 1993 , faced with unprecedented economic decline , cuba began to change policy direction .

beginning in 1993 , cubans were allowed to own and use u.s. dollars and to shop at dollar - only shops previously limited to tourists and diplomats .

self - employment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993 , most in the service sector , and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations .

also in 1993 , the government divided large state farms into smaller , more autonomous , agricultural cooperatives ( basic units of cooperative production , ubpcs ) .

it opened agricultural markets in 1994 , where farmers could sell part of their produce on the open market , and it also permitted artisan markets for the sale of handicrafts .

in 1995 , the government allowed private food catering , including home restaurants ( paladares ) , in effect legalizing activities that were already taking place , and approved a new foreign investment law that allows fully owned investments by foreigners in all sectors of the economy with the exception of defense , health , and education .

in 1996 , it authorized the establishment of free trade zones with tariff reductions typical of such zones .

in 1997 , the government enacted legislation to reform the banking system and established a new central bank ( bcc ) to operate as an autonomous and independent entity .

after cuba began to recover from its economic decline , the government began to backtrack on some of its reform efforts .

regulations and new taxes made it extremely difficult for many of the nation's self - employed .

some home restaurants were forced to close because of the new regulations .

in 2004 , the cuban government limited the use of dollars by state companies for any services or products not considered part of their core business .

some analysts viewed the measure as an effort to turn back the clock on economic reform measures .

also in 2004 , fidel castro announced that u.s. dollars no longer would be used in entities that at the time accepted dollars ( such as stores , restaurants , and hotels ) .

instead , dollars had to be exchanged for "convertible pesos," with a 10% surcharge for the exchange .

dollar bank accounts are still allowed , but cubans are not able to deposit new dollars into the accounts .

beginning in april 2005 , convertible pesos were no longer on par with the u.s. dollar , but instead were linked to a basket of foreign currencies .

this reduces the value of dollar remittances sent to cuba and provides more hard currency to the cuban government .

during the cold war , cuba had extensive relations with and support from the soviet union , with billions in annual subsidies to sustain the cuban economy that helped fund an activist foreign policy and support for guerrilla movements and revolutionary governments abroad in latin america and africa .

with the dissolution of the soviet union , an end to the cold war , and the loss of soviet financial support , cuba was forced to abandon its revolutionary exploits abroad .

as its economy reeled from the loss of soviet support , cuba was forced to open up its economy and economic relations with countries worldwide , and developed significant economic linkages with canada , spain , other european countries , and china .

in recent years , venezuela — under populist president hugo chávez — has become a significant source of support for subsidized oil imports and investment .

relations with russia have also intensified recently , with the visit of russian president dmitry medvedev to havana in november 2008 , the visit of several russian warships to cuba in december 2008 , and raúl castro's visit to moscow in late january 2009 .

chinese president hu jintao also visited cuba in november 2008 , signing a dozen agreements .

with el salvador's restoration of relations with cuba in june 2009 , all latin american nations now have official diplomatic relations with cuba .

cuba has increasingly become more engaged in latin america beyond the already close relations with venezuela .

brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva visited cuba twice in 2008 , and cuba seems especially interested in expanding relations with brazil .

cuba became a full member of the 23 member rio group of latin american and caribbean nations in november 2008 ; some observers see the group , which excludes the united states , as an alternative to the organization of american states ( oas ) .

raúl castro made his first foreign trip as president in december 2008 , when he traveled to venezuela , and then to bahia , brazil , where he attended the latin american and caribbean integration and development summit , a regional initiative of president lula .

cuba is an active participant in international forums , including the united nations and the controversial united nations human rights council .

cuba hosted the 14 th summit of the non - aligned movement ( nam ) in 2006 , and held the secretary generalship of the nam until its july 2009 summit in egypt .

cuba is a member of the bolivarian alternative for the americas , ( alba ) , a venezuelan - led integration and cooperation scheme founded as an alternative to u.s. efforts to negotiate a region - wide free trade area of the americas ( ftaa ) .

cuba was excluded from participation in the oas in 1962 because of its identification with marxism - leninism , but in early june 2009 , the oas overturned the 1962 resolution in a move that could eventually lead to cuba's reentry into the regional organization .

while the cuban government welcomed the oas vote to overturn the 1962 resolution , it asserted that it would not return to the oas .

 ( for additional information on the oas vote , see " cuba and the organization of american states ." ) .

111-237 ) , the fy2011 department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations act with several cuba provisions .

the measure would continue a general prohibition against direct assistance for cuba ( section 7007 ) and continue a requirement that any assistance would only be provided through the regular notification procedures of the committees on appropriations ( section 7015 ( f ) ) .

the bill ( section 7034 ( g ) ( 6 ) ) and the report would transfer $2 million in esf appropriated for cuba to the national endowment for democracy for democracy programs .

the report recommends $28.789 million for cuba broadcasting , $390,000 less than the request , and requires the broadcasting board of governors to submit a multi - year strategic plan for broadcasting to cuba .

on july 7 , 2010 , cuba's catholic church announced that cuban authorities would free 52 political prisoners , with 5 to be released soon and 47 others over the next three to four months .

secretary of state clinton said that the church's announcement of the prisoner release was a "positive sign" and that the united states welcomed it .

on july 5 , 2010 , the independent cuban commission on human rights and national reconciliation ( ccdhrn ) documented in its july 5 , 2010 , report that cuba held at least 167 political prisoners , down significantly from the 201 prisoners documented in january 2010 .

the figures reflect a continuing decline from previous years .

despite the reduction in the number of political prisoners , the group maintains that the overall human rights situation has not improved , with the government adopting lower - profile tactics of political repression , including arbitrary short - term detentions and other forms of harassment or intimidation .

on june 30 , 2010 , the house agriculture committee reported out ( by a vote of 25-20 ) h.r .
