the u.s. election assistance commission ( eac ) is an independent federal agency charged with helping improve the administration of federal elections .

it was established by the help america vote act of 2002 ( hava ; p.l .

107-252 ; 116 stat .

1666 ; 52 u.s.c .

â§â§20901-21145 ) as part of congress's response to administrative issues with the 2000 elections .

the eacâand the legislation that created itâmarked a shift in the federal approach to election administration .

congress had set requirements for the conduct of elections before hava , but hava was the first federal election administration legislation also to back its requirements with substantial federal support .

in addition to setting new types of requirements , it provided federal funding to help states meet those requirements and facilitate other improvements to election administration and created a dedicated federal agencyâthe eacâto manage election administration funding and collect and share election administration information .

there was broad support in congress during the hava debate for the idea of providing some assistance along these lines .

both at the time and since , however , opinions have differed about exactly what kind of assistance to provide and for how long .

members have disagreed about whether the eac should be temporary or permanent , for example , and about whatâif anyâregulatory authority it should have .

changes in the election administration landscape and in congress have brought different aspects of the debate to the forefront at various times .

the 112 th congress saw the start of legislative efforts in the house to limit or eliminate the eac , for example , while the agency's participation in the federal response to attempted foreign interference in the 2016 elections has been cited as new grounds to extend or expand it .

this report provides an introduction to the eac in the context of such developments .

it starts with an overview of the eac's duties , structure , and operational funding , and then summarizes the history of the eac and legislative activity related to the agency .

the report closes with some considerations that may be of interest to congress as it conducts oversight of the eac and weighs whether or how to take legislative action on either the agency or election administration more broadly .

the eac was created by hava , congress's primary legislative response to problems with the administration of the 2000 elections .

issues with the vote count in florida delayed the results of the 2000 presidential race for weeks .

subsequent investigations revealed widespread problems with states' conduct of elections .

they also generated recommendations about how to prevent similar problems in the future , including via more expansive federal partnerships with states and localities .

exactly what those partnerships should look like was a matter of debate .

there was broad agreement that they should involve some federal assistance to states and localities .

proposals from members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of congress included federal funding for improvements to election administration and federal guidance on voting system standards , for example .

members disagreed , however , about other features of the partnerships .

these disagreements were rooted in part in competing concerns .

some members were concerned that certain types of federal involvement would shift the balance of election administration authority from states and localities , which have traditionally had primary responsibility for administering elections , to the federal government .

others worried that states and localities would notâor could notâmake necessary changes to their election systems without federal intervention .

disagreements about the federal government's role in election administration played out in at least two discussions that were relevant to the eac: ( 1 ) whether new federal election administration responsibilities should be assumed by extant federal entities like the federal election commission's ( fec's ) office of election administration ( oea ) or an entirely new agency ; and ( 2 ) whether the new responsibilities should be focused solely on supporting states and localities or should also include more expansive authority to compel states and localities to act .

the eac , like hava as a whole , was a compromise .

it was a new agency , but its role was envisioned primarily as a support role .

as one of the primary architects of hava , representative robert ney , noted in the markup of the 2001 version of the bill , [t]he name that we did choose , by the way , for this commission is not an accident .

the purpose of this commission is to assist state and local governments with their election administration problems , basically taking the attitude we are the government , we are here to help .

its purpose is not to dictate solutions or hand down bureaucratic mandates .

the following subsections provide an overview of the agency that emerged as a compromise from hava .

they describe the eac's duties , structure , and operational funding .

it took some time for the eac to become operational .

hava called for members to be appointed to the agency's commission within 120 days of the act's enactment ( on october 29 , 2002 ) , but the first four commissioners did not take office for more than a year .

without commissioners , the agency drew limited appropriations , and the lack of commissioners and funding led to inactivity and missed deadlines .

after nearly a decade of agency operations , the 112 th congress saw the start of efforts to limit or eliminate the eac , as some members of congress questioned whether there was still a need for the agency .

more recentlyâfollowing reports of attempted foreign interference in the 2016 electionsâproponents of the eac have cited the agency's participation in federal election security efforts as new grounds to preserve it .

this section traces the history of the eac from its origins in the wake of the 2000 elections to its position after the 2016 elections .

the eac has continued to be a subject of legislative activity since its creation by hava .

it has been part of the appropriations process , receiving operational funding each fiscal year .

for more on appropriations activity on the eac , see the " operational funding " section of this report .

it has also featured in a range of authorizing legislation .

some post - hava authorization bills have tapped into the existing role of the agency , while others have proposed changes to that role .

there have also been proposals that focused less on the nature of the role the eac performs than on how it performs that role .

congress has the authority to conduct oversight of the eac and to legislate on both the eac in particular and election administration more generally .

in addition to issues raised by previous legislative proposals , such as whether to terminate the agency , the following issues may be of interest to members as they consider whether or how to undertake such activities or whether to maintain the status quo: providing for new expertise .

the eac was structured to ensure input from a range of election administration stakeholders , from voters to technical specialists to accessibility experts .

however , new developments , such as new election security threats , might call for experience or expertise not currently represented at the agency .

if congress seeks to assure the eac access to such experience or expertise , how might it do so ? .

some possible options include directing the eac to consult with specialist organizations or agencies , funding specialized professional staff or creating specialized departments within the agency , adding members to one or more of the advisory bodies , and establishing new advisory bodies or task forces .

are there reasons to prefer some of these options over others ? .

for example , the eac's advisory bodies play a particularly central role in the functioning of the agency .

are there reasons to want certain stakeholders to haveâor not to haveâsuch direct access to eac actions and decisionmaking ? .

assigning ( and reassigning ) responsibilities .

the eac is the only federal agency dedicated to election administration as a whole .

as such , it is often taken to be the obvious choice to assume federal election administration responsibilities .

as noted above , however , some members have suggested that some of the duties currently in the eac's portfolio might be better performed by other agencies or in other ways .

are there election administration - related issues about which parts of the federal government other than the eac might have relevant expertise ? .

for example , the eac has traditionally been the primary federal repository of election administration best practices , but dhs also provides resources related to election security .

questions might arise , with respect to certain elections - related duties , about which agencyâor combination of agenciesâis best positioned to perform them .

more broadly , how might the eac's and other agencies' comparative advantages guide assignment of new federal election administration responsibilities or reassignment of existing responsibilities ? .

assessing and meeting resource needs .

the eac has been described variously as both overfunded and underfunded .

developments like the emergence of new election security threats have prompted calls for additional resources for agency operations and for distribution to states via the eac .

how do current levels of funding match up to the agency'sâand its grantees'âresource needs ? .

are there tools , such as concurrent budget submission or research into appropriate funding levels for hava payments , that might help congress better assess those needs ? .

are there resources other than funding , such as security clearances for commissioners or professional staff , that the eac needs and does not currently have ? .

considering the role of the quorum requirement .

the quorum requirement for official action by the commission has led at times to delays and inactivity , such as deferred updates to the vvsg .

does congress seek to consider ways to reduce the likelihood or frequency of such delays ? .

if so , would it prefer an approach that eliminated the need for a quorum in certain cases , such as by exempting certain actions from the quorum requirement , or one that reduced the likelihood of the commission being without a quorum ? .

options for the latter approach might include structural changes to the commission , such as adding or removing a seat , or procedural changes to the way commissioners are seated , such as revising the roles of the president and congressional leadership in the candidate selection process .

scheduling eac action .

hava envisioned that the eac would adopt voluntary guidance about how to meet the act's national election administration requirements before the states actually had to meet them .

the idea was to give states the opportunity to review the federal guidance before finalizing their actions on the requirements .

subsequent legislative proposals have similarly called for new national election administration requirements and eac guidance about how to meet them .

how might deadlines be set in such proposals to give the eac time to research and adopt meaningful guidance and the states time to make best use of it ? .

are there additional conditions that might need to be setâor support that might need to be providedâto ensure that the deadlines can be met ? .
