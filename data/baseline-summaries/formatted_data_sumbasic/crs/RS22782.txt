the railroad retirement act authorizes retirement , survivor , and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families .

the railroad retirement board ( rrb ) , an independent federal agency , administers these benefits .

workers covered by the rrb include those employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries , railroad associations , and railroad labor organizations .

these benefits are earned by railroad workers and their families in lieu of social security .

railroad retirement benefits are divided into two tiers .

tier i benefits are generally computed using the social security benefit formula , on the basis of earnings covered by either the railroad retirement or social security programs .

in some cases , rrb tier i benefits can be higher than comparable social security benefits .

for example , rrb beneficiaries may receive unreduced tier i retirement benefits as early as aged 60 if they have at least 30 years of railroad service ; social security beneficiaries may receive unreduced retirement benefits only when they reach their full retirement ages , currently rising from aged 65 to 67 .

rrb tier ii benefits are similar to private pension benefits and are based only on railroad work .

the tier i railroad retirement benefit that is equivalent to social security benefits is mainly finance by tier i payroll taxes ( typically the same rate as the 12.4% social security payroll tax ) and social security's financial interchange transfers .

tier ii benefits , tier i benefits in excess of social security benefits , and supplemental annuities are mainly financed by tier ii payroll taxes ( currently 13.1% on employers and 4.9% on employees ) and transfers from the national railroad retirement investment trust ( nrrit ; hereinafter , the trust ) .

beginning in 2002 , tier ii tax revenues in excess of obligatory benefits and associated administrative costs have been transferred from the railroad retirement accounts to the trust , which is invested in private stocks , bonds , and other investments .

prior to the railroad retirement and survivors' improvement act of 2001 ( rrsia ; p.l .

107-90 ) , surplus railroad retirement assets could be invested only in u.s. government securities â€” just as the social security trust funds must be invested .

the rrsia established the trust to manage and invest assets in the railroad retirement account in much the same way that the assets of private - sector retirement plans are invested .

the rrb also receives transfers from the trust , as needed , to pay railroad retirement and survivor benefits .

assets in the social security equivalent benefits account , which are used for rrb tier i benefits that are equivalent to social security benefits , continue to be invested solely in u.s. government bonds , as required by law .

since february 2002 when railroad retirement funds were first invested through the trust , a total of $21.3 billion has been transferred to the trust from the rrb , and $21.1 billion in earnings have been transferred from the trust to the rrb to pay railroad benefits and administrative expenses .

from its inception to the end of fy2017 , the trust has earned a total of $26.3 billion .

at the end of fy2017 , the market value of the trust's managed assets was $26.5 billion .

to date , the trust's average annual performance slightly exceeds expectations expressed by the rrsia's drafters , which had assumed that trust investments would earn an average annual rate of return of 8.0% .

from fy2003 to fy2017 , the trust's annual rates of return , net of fees , have averaged 8.3% .

for the first half of the trust's existence , its returns largely exceeded expectations .

prior to fy2008 , the average rate of return on trust investments was 14.7% and the average rate of return exceeded the expected rate of 8.0% through fy2010 .

the trust then had negative rates of return in fy2008 ( - 19.1% ) and fy2009 ( - 0.7% ) but rebounded with an 11.2% rate of return in fy2010 followed by a slightly negative rate of return of - 0.1% in fy2011 .

the fy2012 rate of return of 16.4% brought the average annual rate of return of the trust above the expected level of 8.0% for the first time in two years ( since fy2010 ) .

the rate of return was 13.4% in fy2017 .

the trust's annual rates of return have generally compared favorably to its benchmarks .

a benchmark is a standard used for comparison when measuring investment performance , and the nrrit strategic policy benchmark is based on a series of benchmarks corresponding to each of the major asset classes in the trust .

for example , the current benchmark for the trust's investments in domestic equities is the russell 3000 index .

as shown in figure 3 , in the majority of years between fy2003 and fy2017 , trust performances exceeded its strategic policy benchmarks .

in fy2006 and fy2007 , the trust's performances was roughly equal to its benchmarks , whereas in fy2008 , fy2009 , fy2011 , and fy2016 , the trust's investments had lower returns than its strategic policy benchmarks .

in fy2017 , the trust's rate of return of 13.4% ( net of fees ) exceeded the benchmark of 12.3% .

the trust's administrative expenses steadily increased through fy2011 as its investment portfolio diversified .

however , as shown in table 2 , beginning in fy2012 , the trust's administrative expense ratio decreased , mirroring a national trend of decreasing expense ratios for mutual and money market funds .

the trust's administrative expenses remain low compared with industry standards .

in fy2017 , the trust's expense ratio was 31 basis points ( expenses were 0.31% of average net assets ) .

in comparison , in 2017 , average expense ratios were 59 basis points for equity funds , 48 basis points for bond funds , 70 basis points for hybrid funds , and 25 basis points for money market funds .
