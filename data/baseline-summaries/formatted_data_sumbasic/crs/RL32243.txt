in august 2003 , a political accord was signed that formally ended over three and one - half yearsof armed civil conflict in liberia , a small west african country of about 3.3 million people .

sincethat time , the country has made steady progress toward consolidating peace , initiating post - warresettlement and socio - economic reconstruction , and establishing functional interim stateinstitutions .

despite such progress , there are indications that these and other related goals - - suchas the conduct of credible and transparent democratic elections , the creation of a durably transparentand effective governance regime , and a transition from reconstruction to long - term economic growth - - face diverse and substantial obstacles .

numerous medium to long - term challenges face liberia and its donors .

these include: achieving a transition from a situation of humanitarian crisis requiring emergency assistance to one characterized by resettlement and economicrecovery .

the re - establishment of state authority throughout liberia's national territory .

the rebuilding and reform of government institutions , facilities , and capacities , notably those of the functional ministries , revenue - earning and regulatory independent agencies , thepolice , and the justice system .

general socio - economic recovery and rehabilitation of national physical infrastructure .

other current peace and security - related operational issues that face the ntgl , unmil , and liberia's international donors include continued implementation of the cpa , particularly with regardto maintenance of security ; completion of ddrr ; progress in preparing for elections ; and resolutionof the status of charles taylor , both as an exile in nigeria and as a war crimes indictee .

for much of 2002 until june 2003 , bush administration policy toward liberia centered on threeactivities: urging the taylor administration and its armed opponents to uphold human rights norms,cease armed hostilities , and engage in direct negotiations ; providing emergency humanitarianassistance ; and providing relatively small amounts of development assistance ( da ) .

da,administered by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , supported internationaland local ngo projects .

these sought to increase access to basic health care ; bolster food securityby improving food crop production , processing and marketing capacities and small - scalecommunity - level income generation and infrastructure building capacities ; and support adult literacyand providing civic education and public information .

usaid also focused on improving prospectsfor successful electoral change , primarily through capacity building efforts targeted at civil societygroups and local independent media .

responses to increasing conflict .

beginning in late may and early june 2003 , administration activities relating to liberia shifted toward ensuringthe protection of americans and u.s. government personnel and assets in liberia , and facilitatingthe liberian cease - fire and peace negotiations in accra , ghana ( june - august 2003 ) .

several u.s.military teams were dispatched to the region to bolster security for the u.s. embassy , which was hitby mortar fire and stray bullets during heavy fighting in monrovia , and to evacuate americans .

thefrench military also evacuated americans from liberia .

embassy attacks .

on june 25 , 2003 greystone , a u.s. embassy storage compound occupied by thousands of civilians fleeing fighting and mortarfire , was hit by two explosions during a second major assault by lurd on monrovia .

three personswere killed , including two local embassy workers , and 16 were injured .

the state department issueda sharp condemnation of the attack , after earlier labeling the lurd assault a "serious violation ofthe cease - fire" and stated that the attack might remove "any international credibility or recognition"retained by lurd ( 56 ) .

on june 26 , liberian crowdspiled eleven bodies , including children , in frontof the u.s. embassy , in a demonstration calling for immediate u.s. intervention to halt the fighting .

on july 20 , a team of 21 u.s. marines , part of a 41 member fleet anti - terrorism security team ( fast ) trained to guard u.s. diplomatic installations , was deployed to monrovia .

upon its arrival,the fast faced a hail of mortar fire falling in the vicinity of the embassy .

its deployment wasbacked by u.s. air transport teams based in senegal and sierra leone ; the latter carried out severalevacuations from monrovia .

in late july 2003 , all of these u.s. military elements became part ofa larger u.s. military effort , dubbed joint task force liberia .

conflict resolution efforts .

the united states , a key member of the icgl , actively participated in the peace negotiations in ghana .

these effortssought to improve the security environment in monrovia ; enable then - suspended or otherwiseinterrupted emergency relief operations to resume ; and to further resolve the conflict and a transitionof state power .

after a cease - fire agreement was signed on june 17 , the united states repeatedly andstrongly urged the liberian belligerents to adhere to it , and to prevent civilian casualties .

in late july,deputy assistant secretary of state pamela bridgewater traveled to guinea , where she reportedlymet with lurd chairman sekou conneh and guinean government officials to emphasize the needfor an end to the conflict and for guinean support of lurd .

her visit was quickly followed by avisit to guinea by walter kansteiner , assistant secretary of state for africa , who reiteratedbridgewater's message to guinean officials .

in july and august 2003 , the united states assisted the deployment of ecomil to liberia ( see "overview and recent developments," above ) - - a course of action that was preceded by extensivepublic debate about the potential and relative merit of a direct u.s. military intervention .

onceecomil had deployed , u.s. policy makers pushed for the creation of a u.n. peacekeeping missionin liberia .

the united states also acted to protect the interests of some liberians living in theunited states by granting to those who qualified for temporary protected status ( tps ) .

 ( 57 ) .

after increasing briefly following liberia's 1989-1997 war , u.s. assistance forliberia steadily declined , reflecting the clinton and bush administrations' generallycritical views of the taylor administration .

in fy2002 , aid began to be channeled"only through non - governmental organizations" and was "focused narrowly on healthand food security needs in rural communities , along with a modest effort to assistcivil society. .

 ( 72 ) the decreasing level of assistanceappeared to be a response to"liberia's negative role in regional security" and fomenting of conflict in sierraleone and guinea "by supporting the [ruf] through illicit diamond and armstrafficking. .

 ( 73 ) subsequent bush administrationcongressional budget justificationsfor liberia reflected similar concerns .

the administration's regular fy2004 requestfor liberia , for instance , stated that "[t]he primary u.s. national interests in liberiaare to prevent the government of liberia from fomenting violence and instability inneighboring countries , and to promote comprehensive internal reform and goodgovernance in liberia. .

 ( 74 ) while regulardevelopment assistance to liberia graduallydeclined , u.s. emergency assistance to liberia began to increase as the country'ssecond civil war burgeoned and humanitarian conditions deteriorated .
