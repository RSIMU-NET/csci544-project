electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution .

the combustion of fossil fuels ( petroleum , natural gas , and coal ) , which accounts for about two - thirds of u.s. electricity generation , results in the emission of a stream of gases .

these gases include several pollutants that directly pose risks to human health and welfare , including particulate matter ( pm ) , sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) , nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , and mercury ( hg ) .

particulate matter , so 2 , and nox are currently regulated under the clean air act ( caa ) , and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has promulgated rules to regulate mercury beginning in 2010 .

other gases may pose indirect risks , notably carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) , which contributes to global warming .

table 1 provides estimates of so 2 , nox , and co 2 emissions from electric generating facilities .

annual emissions of hg from utility facilities are more uncertain ; current estimates indicate about 48 tons .

utilities are subject to an array of environmental regulations , which affect in different ways both the cost of operating existing generating facilities and the cost of constructing new ones .

the evolution of air pollution controls over time and as a result of growing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts has led to a multilayered and interlocking patchwork of controls .

moreover , additional controls are in the process of development , particularly with respect to nox as a precursor to ozone , to both nox and so 2 as contributors to pm 2.5 , and to hg as a toxic air pollutant .

also , under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) , the united states agreed to voluntary limits on co 2 emissions .

the current bush administration has rejected the kyoto protocol , which would impose mandatory limits , in favor of a voluntary reduction program .

in contrast to the administration's position , in june 2005 , the senate passed a sense of the senate calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases that would be designed not to impose significant harm on the economy .

for many years , the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for a simplified approach .

now , with the potential both for additional control programs on so 2 and nox and for new controls directed at hg and co 2 intersecting with the technological and policy changes affecting the electric utility industry , such calls for simplification have become more numerous and insistent .

one focus of this effort is the "multi - pollutant" or "four - pollutant" approach .

this approach involves a mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutants in various proposals — so 2 , nox , hg , and co 2 .

the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of effective controls across the pollutants covered with the industry goal of a stable regulatory regime for a period of years .

in february 2002 , the bush administration announced two air quality proposals to address the control of emissions of so 2 , nox , hg , and co 2 .

the first proposal , called "clear skies," would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so 2 , nox , and hg .

implemented through a tradeable allowance program , the emissions caps would be imposed in two phases: 2010 ( 2008 in the case of nox ) and 2018 .

as part of a complete rewrite of title iv of the clean air act , the administration's proposal was introduced in the 108 th congress as h.r .

999 and s. 485 .

revised versions of clear skies legislation were introduced in the 109 th congress as h.r .

227 and s. 131 .

the proposal has not been reintroduced in the 110 th congress .

the second administration proposal initiates a new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program , similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h. w. bush and clinton administrations .

developed in response to the u.s. ratification of the 1992 unfccc , these previous plans projected u.s. compliance , or near compliance , with the unfccc goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary measures .

the bush administration proposal does not make that claim , projecting only a 100 million metric ton reduction in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 .

total emissions would continue to rise .

instead , the plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy , reducing 2002 emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 .

it proposes several voluntary initiatives , along with increased spending and tax incentives , to achieve this goal .

the administration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about one - quarter of the objective , while three - quarters of the projected reduction is seen as occurring through existing efforts .

in the 110 th congress , five bills have been introduced that would impose multi - pollutant controls on utilities .

they are all four - pollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide .

s. 1168 , introduced by senator alexander , and s. 1177 , introduced by senator carper , are revised versions of s. 2724 , introduced in the 109 th congress .

s. 1201 , introduced by senator sanders , and s. 1554 , introduced by senator collins , are similar but revised versions of s. 150 , introduced in the 109 th congress .

in contrast , h.r .

3989 , introduced by representative mchugh , represents a new proposal .

all of these bills involve some form of emission caps , beginning in 2009-2012 time frame .

s. 1168 , s. 1177 , and s. 1201 include a second phase beginning in 2013-2015 ; h.r .

3989 includes a multi - phase program for co 2 only .

they would employ a tradeable credit program to implement the so 2 , nox , and co 2 caps while all but h.r .

3989 permit plant - wide averaging in complying with the hg requirements .

the provisions concerning so 2 , nox , and hg in the five bills are generally more stringent than the comparable provisions of s. 131 of the 109 th congress .

it is difficult to compare the co 2 caps contained in these bills with the administration's proposal concerning co 2 — both because the administration's proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader ( covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co 2 emissions ) .

the five bills are summarized in the appendix .

each of these bills generally builds on the so 2 allowance trading scheme contained in title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments ( caaa ) .

under this program , utilities are given a specific allocation of permitted emissions ( allowances ) and may choose to use those allowances at their own facilities , or , if they do not use their full quota , to bank them for future use or to sell them to other utilities needing additional allowances .

all five bills introduced in the 110 th congress provide for a tradeable allowance scheme to implement their emission caps on so 2 , nox , and co 2 .

however , allowance allocation schemes in the bills differ , with s. 1201 and s. 1554 containing detailed provisions for allocating so 2 , nox , and co 2 allowances to various economic sectors and interests .

in most cases , these interests ( or their trustees in the case of households and dislocated workers and communities ) would auction off ( or otherwise sell ) their allowances to the affected utilities and use the collected funds for their own purposes .

in addition , s. 1201 requires the increasing use of auctions , mandating 100% of the annual allowance allocation be auctioned within 15 years of enactment .

in contrast , s. 1168 bases its allowance formulas on fuel usage adjusted by factors specified in the bill , along with a requirement that 25% of the allowances be auctioned .

s. 1177 specifies co 2 and nox limitations based on electricity output , and so 2 limitations based on the current title iv program .

the bill sets a schedule for increasing the percentage of the annual allowance allocation that is to be auctioned with 100% required in 2036 and thereafter .

finally , h.r .

3989 auctions 100% of its co 2 allowances while providing discretion to epa to allocate so 2 and nox allowances .

on mercury , all five bills focus on achieving a 90% reduction by 2011 ( s. 1554 and h.r .

3989 ) , 2013 ( s. 1201 ) or 2015 ( s. 1168 and s. 1177 ) .

in contrast , the emissions goal of s. 131 of the 109 th congress would have allowed about three times more emissions and three to five more years for compliance .

in addition , all but h.r .

3989 restrict hg credit trading to plant - wide averaging of emissions , in contrast with the cap - and - trade program of s. 131 .

h.r .

3989 is even more stringent , imposing the emissions rate limitation on a unit - by - unit basis .

the bills currently introduced in the 110 th congress specify co 2 reductions .

in contrast , the administration's co 2 proposal relies on various voluntary programs and incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gases from diverse sources , including co 2 emissions from electric generation .

these voluntary reductions should not be taken as a given , as neither the george h. w. bush administration's nor the clinton administration's voluntary programs achieved their stated goals .

thus , in one sense , comparing a mandatory reduction program such as that proposed by s. 1168 , s. 1177 , s. 1201 , and s. 1554 with the administration's voluntary program is comparing apples to oranges .

the first is legally binding , the second has been criticized as merely an exhortation .

the co 2 reduction requirements of s. 1168 , s. 1201 , and s. 1554 are similar , except that s. 1201 and s. 1554 requires affected sources also offset co 2 emissions from small electric generating units .

in contrast , s. 1177 imposes a cap that starts out slightly higher than the other two bills and declines on a slower schedule .

finally , h.r .

3989 has the most detailed reduction scheme with substantial reductions from coal - fired facilities scheduled through 2050 .

all but h.r .

3989 have provisions to create offsets and facilitate sequestration efforts .

among its titles , s. 1168 has extensive provisions providing for greenhouse gas offsets from landfill methane ( ch 4 ) , sulfur hexafluoride ( sf 6 ) projects , afforestation or reforestation , energy efficiency , agricultural practices ( manure management ) , and biomass .

the provisions in s. 1177 include allowance allocations for incremental nuclear capacity , clean coal technology , and renewable energy , along with programs to encourage sequestration .

likewise , s. 1554 includes allowance allocations to encourage renewable energy , energy efficiency , and sequestration .

finally , s. 1201 requires the epa to develop standards for providing allowances for geologic and biological sequestration .

in addition to emissions caps , s. 131 of the 109 th congress would have substantially modified or eliminated several provisions in the clean air act with respect to electric generating facilities .

the bill would have eliminated new source performance standards ( nsps ) ( section 111 ) and replaced them with statutory standards for so 2 , nox , particulate matter , and hg for new sources .

modified sources could have also opted to comply with these new statutory standards and be exempted from the applicable best available control technology ( bact ) determinations under prevention of significant deterioration ( psd ) provisions ( caa , part c ) or lowest achievable emissions rate ( laer ) determinations under non - attainment provisions ( caa , part d ) .

compliance with these provisions would have exempted such facilities from new source review ( nsr ) , psd - bact requirements , visibility best available retrofit technology ( bart ) requirements , maximum achievable control technology ( mact ) requirements for hg , and non - attainment laer and offset requirements .

the exemption would not have applied to psd - bact requirements if facilities were within 50 km of a psd class 1 area .

existing sources could have also received these exemptions if they agreed to meet a particulate matter standard specified in the bill along with good combustion practices to minimize carbon monoxide emissions within three years of enactment .

in addition , s. 131 would have provided these exemptions for industrial sources that choose to opt into the clear skies program .

s. 131 also would have included an exemption for steam electric generating facilities from hg regulation under section 112 of the caa ( including the residual risk provisions ) , and relief from enforcement of any section 126 petition ( with respect to reducing interstate transportation of pollution ) before december 31 , 2014 .

the five bills in the 110 th congress generally omit the regulatory changes of s. 131 , while introducing new provisions .

all five bills would revise the current new source review ( nsr ) program to require affected electric generating units 40 years or older ( 30 years old in the case of h.r .

3989 ) to meet more stringent so 2 and nox performance standard by either 2015 ( s. 1201 ) , 2016 ( s. 1554 ) , 2020 ( s. 1168 and s. 1177 ) , or five years after enactment ( h.r .

3989 ) .

all except s. 1554 and h.r .

3989 contain provisions establishing a new performance standard for co 2 .

s. 1168 and s. 1177 would also eliminate the annual nox and so 2 caps contained in the recently promulgated clean air interstate rule ( cair ) .

in addition to the above , s. 1201 and s. 1554 would create several new regulatory programs and standards , including an efficiency performance standard , and a renewable portfolio standard .

these programs would be implemented through a credit trading program .
