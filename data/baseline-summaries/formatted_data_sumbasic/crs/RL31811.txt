on january 22 , 2004 , the senate passed ( 65-28 ) the conference report on h.r .

2673 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2004 .

division d ofthe legislation includes a reconciled version of foreign operations funding forfy2004 as approved earlier by the house and senate as h.r .

2800 .

thehouse approved ( 242-176 ) the conference agreement on december 8 .

presidentbush signed the measure on january 23 ( p.l .

108-199 ) .

the conference agreement on h.r .

2673 provides $17.48 billion for foreign operations , a figure that includes a 0.59% across - the - board rescissionand additional amounts for the millennium challenge account specified in divisionh of the bill .

this represents a $1.4 billion , or a 7.4% reduction from the president'srequest , but $1.3 billion , or 7.9% higher than approved in regular foreign operationsspending for fy2003 .

the actual reduction to the executive's budget fy2004proposal , however , is unlikely to be as significant as this comparison suggests .

byutilizing funds provided in the iraq reconstruction supplemental ( p.l .

108-106 ) andauthority included in h.r .

2673 to transfer iraq reconstruction moneyfor requested regular foreign operations programs , the president could makeavailable as much as $575 million to fund his original fy2004 proposal withoutdrawing on the $17.48 billion provided in h.r .

2673 .

if theadministration chooses to utilize these resources from the iraq reconstructionsupplemental , the difference between the fy2004 request and the conferenceagreement would be about $850 million , or a 4.5% cut .

despite the overall reduction , the conference agreement increases spending for international hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis programs to $1.646 billion .

whenthis amount is combined with appropriations in the pending labor / hhs / educationappropriation ( division e of h.r .

2673 ) , the total for global hiv / aidsand other infectious diseases is $2.4 billion , or roughly $400 million above thepresident's request .

conferees further agreed to a $400 million contribution to theglobal fund for aids , malaria , and tuberculosis that together with an additional$150 million for the fund in division e , would bring the total level to $550 million,rather than the administration's $200 million proposal .

the conference agreement further authorizes and appropriates funds for the millennium challenge account ( mca ) , one of the top presidential aid initiatives .

division d of h.r .

2673 provides $650 million for the mca , whiledivision h includes an additional $350 million , for a total mca appropriation of $1billion .

on another major policy matter , the conferees dropped senate language thatwould have effectively reversed the president's "mexico city" abortion - relatedrestrictions placed on international family planning programs during the bushadministration .

the conference agreement further appropriates $34 million for theu.n .

population fund ( unfpa ) , but under the same conditions ( "kemp - kasten"amendment ) that has led to the withholding of u.s. contributions to the unfpa thepast two years because of the organization's program in china .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislativevehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the u.s. foreign assistancebudget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy makinggenerally .

 ( 1 ) it contains the largest share - - abouttwo - thirds - - of total internationalaffairs spending by the united states ( see figure 1 ) .

the legislation funds all u.s. bilateral development assistance programs , managed mostly by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) ,together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies , such as the peacecorps and the inter - american and african development foundations .

mosthumanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations , including usaid'sdisaster program and the state department's refugee relief support .

foreignoperations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union ( also referred to as the independent states account ) and central / eastern europe,activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department .

security assistance ( economic and military aid ) for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure , as are other security aid programsadministered largely by the state department , in conjunction with usaid and thepentagon .

u.s. contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateraldevelopment banks , managed by the treasury department , and voluntary paymentsto international organizations , handled by the state department , are also funded inthe foreign operations bill .

finally , the legislation includes appropriations for threeexport promotion agencies: the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) ,the export - import bank , and the trade and development agency .

for nearly two decades , the foreign operations appropriations bill has been theprincipal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and forcongressional involvement in foreign policy making .

congress has not enacted acomprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 , leaving most foreignassistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislativeoversight committees .

as a result , foreign operations spending measures developedby the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyondspending issues and played a major role in shaping , authorizing , and guiding bothexecutive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives .

it hasbeen largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states hasmodified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war .

the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilizedforeign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11,2001 .

the appropriations measure has also been a key instrument used by congressto apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreignassistance , actions that have frequently resulted in executive - legislative clashes overpresidential prerogatives in foreign policy making .

2673 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2004 .

president bush submitted his fy2004 federal budget request to congress on february 3 , 2003 , including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriationsprograms .

subsequently , on march 25 , the white house requested fy2003emergency supplemental funds for costs of military operations in iraq , relief andreconstruction of iraq , ongoing u.s. costs in afghanistan , additional aid to coalitionpartners and nations cooperating in the global war on terrorism , and homelandsecurity .

house and senate appropriations committees held several hearings onboth the fy2004 and fy2003 supplemental requests , and approved the supplemental ( p.l .

108-11 ) on april 12 .

subsequently , the administration requested on september17 another iraq military operations and reconstruction supplemental for fy2004 ( h.r .

3289 ) which congress cleared on november 3 ( p.l .

108-106 ) .

for the regular fy2004 foreign operations bill , the house foreign operations subcommittee marked up draft legislation on july 11 , while the full house panelapproved the legislation on july 16 and reported the measure on july 21 .

the housepassed h.r .

2800 on july 23 ( 370-50 ) .

the senate committee reportedits companion bill , s. 1426 , on july 17 , and passed the measure as h.r .

2800 on october 30 .

on november 17 , a foreign operationsconference committee met and reached agreement on most , but not all issues indisagreement .

conferees adjourned pending the resolution of the outstandingmatters , most of which related to international family planning funding and policyissues .

after resolving these remaining issues , however , instead of filing a separate conference report on h.r .

2800 , the house and senate appropriationcommittees decided to incorporate the foreign operations bill into h.r .

2673 , the consolidated appropriations act , fy2004 .

h.r .

2673 included seven appropriation bills that had not received final action as separatemeasures .

the house approved the conference report on the consolidatedappropriations bill on december 8 , followed by the senate on january 22 , 2004 .

thepresident signed the bill on january 23 .

as shown in figure 2 below , foreign operations funding levels , expressed inreal terms taking into account the effects of inflation , have fluctuated widely over thepast 27 years .

 ( 2 ) after peaking at over $33 billion in fy1985 ( constant fy2004dollars ) , foreign operations appropriations began a period of decline to $13.9 billionin fy1997 , with only a brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due tospecial supplementals for panama and nicaragua ( 1990 ) , countries affected by thegulf war ( 1991 ) , and the former soviet states ( 1993 ) .

arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined u.s.foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influenceoverseas events , clinton administration officials and other outside groups vigorouslycampaigned to reverse the decade - long decline in the foreign policy budget .

foreignaid spending increased slightly in fy1998 , but beginning the following year andcontinuing to the present , foreign operations appropriations have trended upwarddue in large part to the approval of resources for special , and in some casesunanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives .

although funding forregular , continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period,supplemental spending for special activities , such as central american hurricanerelief ( fy1999 ) , kosovo emergency assistance ( fy1999 ) , wye river / middle eastpeace accord support ( fy2000 ) , a counternarcotics initiative in colombia and theandean region ( fy2000 and fy2002 ) , aid to the front line states in the war onterrorism and iraq - war related assistance ( fy2003 ) , was chiefly responsible for thegrowth in foreign aid appropriations .

the average annual funding level during thefy1999-fy2002 period of $17.29 billion represents a level 24% higher than the lowpoint in foreign operations appropriation in fy1997 .

although foreign operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years , amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 have reached unprecedented levelsover the past 40 years .

regular appropriations approved in these two years haveroughly been on par with amounts of the previous few years .

but substantialsupplementals of $7.5 billion and $21.2 billion , respectively , for assistance to thefront line states in the war on terrorism and afghanistan and iraq reconstruction , havepushed spending upward .

the regular foreign operations bill , signed by thepresident on january 23 , 2004 , combined with an earlier iraq supplemental approvedin november 2003 ( p.l .

108-106 ) , bring current year appropriations to $38.7 billion,the highest level , in real terms , since the early 1960s .

supplemental resources for foreign operations programs , which in fy2004 exceed the regular funding amount , have become a significant channel of funding foru.s .

international activities .

due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas eventsand the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the u.s. nationalinterest to respond , it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources fromtime to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplementalspending outside the regular appropriation cycle .

supplementals have providedresources for such major foreign policy events as the camp david accords ( fy1979 ) ,central america conflicts ( fy1983 ) , africa famine and a middle east economicdownturn ( fy1985 ) , panama and nicaragua government transitions ( fy1990 ) , thegulf war ( fy1991 ) , and bosnia relief and reconstruction ( fy1996 ) .

table 2 .

foreign operations appropriations , fy1995 to fy2004 ( discretionary budget authority in billionsof current and constant dollars ) notes: fy1999 excludes $17.861 billion for the imf ; fy2004 includes $19.42 billion for iraq reconstruction .

without iraq funds , fy2004 totals $19.27 billion .

but after a period of only one significant foreign aid supplemental in eight years,beginning in fy1999 congress has approved foreign operations supplementalappropriations exceeding $1 billion in each of the past six years .

relief for centralamerican victims of hurricane mitch , kosovo refugees , and victims of the embassybombings in kenya and tanzania in fy1999 totaled $1.6 billion , and was followedin fy2000 by a $1.1 billion supplemental , largely to fund the president's newcounternarcotics initiative in colombia .

as part of a $40 billion emergencysupplemental to fight terrorism enacted in september 2001 , president bush andcongress allocated $1.4 billion for foreign aid activities in fy2001 and fy2002 .

another $1.15 billion supplemental cleared congress in fy2002 to augment afghanreconstruction efforts and assist other "front - line" states in the war on terrorism .

until fy2003 , these additional resources have accounted for between 7% and 11% of total foreign operations spending .

the $7.5 billion iraq war supplementalfor fy2003 , however , went well beyond these standards , representing nearlyone - third of the fy2003 foreign operations budget , and surpassed , as noted above,only by fy2004 supplemental appropriations .

as a share of the entire $2.24 trillion u.s. budget for fy2003 , foreign operations represented a 1.06% share , significantly higher than the traditional levelof around 0.75% .

this was due largely to enactment of the $7.5 billionsupplemental for iraq reconstruction , aid to coalition partners , and assistance to otherfront - line states in the war on terrorism .

the total fy2004 foreign operationsappropriation level , including the iraq and afghanistan reconstruction supplemental,is projected to further increase foreign aid as a percent of u.s. federal spending to1.66% .

as a portion of discretionary budget authority - - that part of the budgetprovided in annual appropriation acts ( other than appropriated entitlements ) - - foreign operations consumed 2.8% in fy2003 , a level that will rise significantly toabout 4.45% in fy2004 .

by comparison , at the previous high point of foreignoperations spending in fy1985 , foreign aid funds represented 2% of the total u.s.budget and 4.6% of discretionary budget authority .

on march 25 , 2003 , the president requested a nearly $75 billion fy2003supplemental that included $7.6 billion for near - term iraq reconstruction and relief,additional aid to coalition partners and other states cooperating in the global war onterrorism , and related usaid administrative expenses .

by comparison , thesupplemental request totaled a little less than half of the $16.2 billion appropriatedpreviously by congress for fy2003 foreign operations activities .

the proposal , asdetailed below in table 6 , was roughly divided into two components: iraq relief andreconstruction ( about $2.85 billion ) and aid to coalition partners and other nationsengaged in the war on terrorism ( about $4.7 billion ) .

while the foreign operations appropriations bill can include virtually anyforeign policy issue of interest to congress , the annual debate usually focuses onseveral major policy and spending issues .

for fy2004 , substantial debate hasfocused on the following .

1 .

 ( back ) although the foreign operationsappropriations bill is often characterized as the "foreign aid" spending measure , it does not includefunding for all foreign aid programs .

food aid , an international humanitarian aid program administered under thep.l .

480 program , isappropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill .

foreign operations also include funds for the export - importbank , an activity that isregarded as a trade promotion program , rather than "foreign aid. .

in recent years , funding for food aid and theeximbank have been aboutthe same , so that foreign operations and the official "foreign aid" budget are nearly identical .

throughout thisreport , the terms foreignoperations and foreign aid are used interchangeably .

2 .

 ( back ) some of these swings , however , are notthe result of policy decisions , but due to technical budget accounting changes involving howcongress "scores" various programs .

for example , the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher fundinglevels , but rather the factthat export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as "off - budget" items .

part of thesubstantial rise in spendingin fy1985 came as a result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than onlythe partial appropriationrequired in the past .

beginning in fy1992 , congress changed how all federal credit programs are "scored" inappropriation bills whichfurther altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations .

all of these factors make it verydifficult to present a preciseand consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels .

nevertheless , the data shown in figure 2 canbe regarded as illustrativeof general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 25 years .
