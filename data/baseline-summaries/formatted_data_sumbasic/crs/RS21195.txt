section 803 set forth conditions to be met before a dod acquisition program can be pursued as an ea / sd effort , and required dod provide annual status reports for the next five years on each research and development program being pursued under ea / sd .

section 132 required the air force to submit to congress a list of programs that it had designated as acquisition reform "pathfinder programs," set forth conditions under which those programs can proceed , and applied to them the requirement for filing status reports established under section 803 .
