persistent annual budget deficits and a large and increasing federal debt have generated discussions over the long - term sustainability of current budget projections .

federal budget deficits declined from 9.8% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in fy2009 to 3.8% of gdp in fy2018 .

however , recent estimates forecast that the government will run deficits ( i.e. , federal expenditures will exceed revenues ) in every year through fy2029 .

federal debt totaled $21.516 trillion at the end of fy2018 , and as a percentage of gdp ( 106.0% ) was at its highest value since fy1947 ; $15.761 trillion of that debt ( or 77.8% of gdp ) was held by the public .

this report explores distinctions in the concept and composition of deficits and debt and explains how they interact with economic conditions and other aspects of fiscal policy .

federal deficit and debt outcomes are interdependent ; budget deficits increase federal debt levels , which in turn increase future net deficits because of the need to service higher interest payments on the nation's debt .

the nature of the relationship between deficits and debt varies depending on the type of debt considered .

this section describes the relationship between federal deficits and debt .

this section provides a primer of how government deficits and debt are integrated into the larger economy in both the short and long run , and provides some ways to measure such interactions .

the nature of interaction between fiscal outcomes and economic performance may have ramifications for how congr ess wishes to distribute its activity both within a recession or expansion and for what fiscal targets it wishes to set in the long run .

the fy2018 real deficit equaled 3.8% of gdp , which was higher than the average federal deficit from fy1969 to fy2018 ( 2.9% of gdp ) .

both real deficits and real debt are projected to increase over the course of the 10-year budget window , which runs through fy2029 .

in its latest economic forecast , the cbo projected that the total burden of u.s. debt held by the public would steadily increase over the course of the budget window , from 77.8% of gdp in fy2018 to 92.7% of gdp in fy2029 .

table 2 provides the most recent forecasts for publicly held debt issued by the cbo .

each forecast projects an increase in publicly held debt over the next 5 , 10 , and 25 fiscal years .

the cbo baseline assumes that current law continues as scheduled .

specifically , the cbo baseline assumes that discretionary budget authority from fy2020 through fy2021 will be restricted by the caps created by the budget control act ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) , as amended , and that certain tax policy changes enacted in the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) and in other laws will expire as scheduled under current law .

cbo also provides alternative projections where such assumptions are revised .

if discretionary spending increases with inflation after fy2019 , instead of proceeding in accordance with the limits instituted by the bca , and if tax reductions in the 2017 tax revision are extended , cbo projects that federal debt held by the public would increase to 97% of gdp by fy2029 .

cbo also produces a long - term baseline that uses a number of additional assumptions to extend its standard baseline an additional 20 years ( thus the 2018 long - term baseline runs through fy2049 ) .

the current long - term forecast projects that publicly held federal debt will equal 147% of gdp in fy2049 , which would exceed the highest stock of federal debt experienced in the fy1940-fy2018 period ( 106% of gdp in fy1946 ) .

cbo projects increases in both interest rates and publicly held federal debt over the next 10 years , leading to a significant rise in u.s. net interest payments .

as noted above , cbo projects that publicly held federal debt will rise from 77.8% of gdp in fy2018 to 92.7% of gdp in fy2029 , and projects that the average interest rate on three - month treasury bills will rise from 1.66% in fy2017 to 2.81% in fy2029 .

those factors combine to generate federal net interest payments of 3.0% of gdp in fy2029 under the cbo projections , which would be just under the highest amount paid from fy1940 through fy2017 ( 3.2% of gdp in fy1991 ) .

it may be useful to compare the recent u.s. federal borrowing trajectory with the practices of international governments , because future interest rate and fiscal space considerations will both be affected by the behavior of other major actors .

table 3 includes the general government debt history and projections for g - 7 countries and the european area from fy2000 to fy2023 .

the worldwide impact of the great recession led to increased general gross debt levels for all g - 7 countries in 2013 relative to their 2000-2009 average .

as shown in table 3 , u.s. debt levels rose by 40% of gdp over that time period , which was larger than increases in canada and the european area but smaller than rises in the united kingdom and japan .

general debt levels largely stabilized from 2013 to 2018 , with decreases in germany and the european area and small increases in other countries .

future projections of debt included in table 3 are characterized by a divergence between u.s. general gross debt levels and those in other g - 7 countries .

the imf forecast projects that u.s. general gross debt will rise from 106% to 117% from 2018 to 2023 , while those same projections forecast a decrease in debt owed by all other g - 7 governments and in the european area .

addressing the potential consequences of those projections will likely involve policy adjustments that reduce future budget deficits , either through tax increases , reductions in spending , or a combination of the two .

under cbo's extended baseline , maintaining the debt - to - gdp ratio at today's level ( 78% ) in fy2048 would require an immediate and permanent cut in noninterest spending , increase in revenues , or some combination of the two in the amount of 1.9% of gdp ( or about $400 billion in fy2018 alone ) in each year .

maintaining this debt - to - gdp ratio beyond fy2047 would require additional deficit reduction .

if policymakers wanted to lower future debt levels relative to today , the annual spending reductions or revenue increases would have to be larger .

for example , in order to bring debt as a percentage of gdp in fy2048 down to its historical average over the past 50 years ( 40% of gdp ) , spending reductions or revenue increases or some combination of the two would need to generate net savings of roughly 3.0% of gdp ( or $630 billion in fy2018 alone ) in each year .
