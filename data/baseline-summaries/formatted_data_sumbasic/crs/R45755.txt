the senate - reported bill did not include this provision .

formerly known as the office of compliance , the office of congressional workplace rights ( ocwr ) was renamed by the congressional accountability act of 1995 reform act ( p.l .

115-397 ) .

it is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch , and it was originally established to administer and enforce the congressional accountability act of 1995 .

the act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to congress and certain legislative branch entities .

the fy2019 enacted level was $6.3 million , which was continued in the fy2020 request , the house - reported and senate - reported versions of the bill , and the fy2020 act .

cbo is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to congress .

cbo cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may affect revenues or expenditures .

the fy2019 level was $50.7 million .

in comparison , levels considered for fy2020 include the following: requested: $53.6 million ( +5.6% ) house - reported: $52.7 million ( +3.8% ) senate - reported: $54.9 million ( +8.3% ) enacted: $54.9 million ( +8.3% ) .

since the closure of ota , which was a legislative branch agency established in 1972 and last funded in fy1996 , congress has periodically reexamined funding for scientific and technological studies by the legislative branch .

some members have expressed support for the refunding of ota through the distribution of "dear colleague" letters , at committee hearings and in committee prints , and through the introduction of legislation or amendments .

since fy2002 , funding for technology assessments has also been provided to gao , with frequent references in appropriations and conference reports on the legislative branch appropriations bills .

more recently , and in response to language in the fy2019 senate and conference reports , gao announced the formation of a new science , technology assessment , and analytics team on january 29 , 2019 .

additionally , the conference report to accompany the fy2019 legislative branch appropriations bill ( h.r .

5895 ) required a study on technology assessments available to congress: technology assessment study: the committees have heard testimony on , and received dozens of requests advocating for restoring funding to the office of technology assessment , and more generally on how congress equips itself with the deep technical advice necessary to understand and tackle the growing number of science and technology policy challenges facing our country .

the conferees direct the congressional research service ( crs ) to engage with the national academy of public administration or a similar external entity to produce a report detailing the current resources available to members of congress within the legislative branch regarding science and technology policy , including the gao .

this study should also assess the potential need within the legislative branch to create a separate entity charged with the mission of providing nonpartisan advice on issues of science and technology .

furthermore , the study should also address if the creation of such entity duplicates services already available to members of congress .

crs should work with the committees in developing the parameters of the study and once complete , the study should be made available to relevant oversight committees .

the fy2020 house - reported bill would have provided $6.0 million for restarting ota .

the funding would remain available through fy2021 .

h.rept .

116-64 further stated the following: to do its job in this modern era , congress needs to understand and address the issues and risks resulting from a wide range of rapid technological developments such as cryptocurrencies , autonomous vehicles , gene editing , artificial intelligence , and the ever - expanding use of social media platforms , to give just a few examples .

a re - opened ota will play an important role in providing accurate , professional , and unbiased information about technological developments and policy options for addressing the issues those developments raise .

in that role , ota will complement the work of the government accountability office in the area of science and technology... .

since the de - funding of ota in 1995 , there have been several unsuccessful attempts to restore the office .

during that time , it has become increasingly clear that congress does not have adequate resources available for the in - depth , high level analysis of fast - breaking technology developments and their public policy implications that was formerly provided by ota .

while the government accountability office ( gao ) has increased its technology assessment activities attempting to fill that gap , the structure and culture of gao somewhat constrain its ability to replicate ota .

the office's governance by a bipartisan board and its ability to tap outside expert resources and rely on a technology assessment advisory council provide the capacity to offer policy recommendation options to congress , which are not available from other congressional sources .

the senate - reported bill would not restart ota , but s.rept .

116-124 states that the committee looks forward to reviewing the recommendations of the national academy of public administration study currently underway , including the evaluation of options available to congress in the area of science and technology .

the committee will continue to engage key authorizing committees and interested members as these discussions continue .

s.rept .

116-124 also addresses the role of the new gao science , technology assessment , and analytics team ( staa ) , stating in consultation with internal and external stakeholders , academic and nonprofit organizations , and members of congress , the staa team submitted its plan for staffing needs , resources , areas of expertise , and the products and services that the team will provide or are currently providing to congress .

the plan demonstrates staa's value and ability to assess upcoming technological and digital innovations .

presently , the staa is providing congress with technology assessments , technical assistance , and reports in the areas of oversight of federal technology and science programs , as well as best practices in engineering sciences and cybersecurity .

the committee applauds the efforts of gao's staa team and encourages staa to continue providing congress with unbiased explanatory data while also exploring new areas for independent science and technology guidance , relevant to congress .

the national academy of public administration ( napa ) study was released on november 14 , 2019 .

it examined three options: option 1âenhancing existing entities option 2âcreating a new agency option 3âenhance existing entities and create an advisory office napa recommended enhancing technology assessment capabilities of both crs and gao , while also establishing ( 1 ) an office of the congressional science and technology advisorâled by an appointee of the house and senate leadership and assisted by a small staffâand ( 2 ) a congressional science and technology coordinating councilâchaired by the congressional science and technology advisorâto enhance coordination between gao and crs .

the fy2020 act did not provide funding for restarting ota .

rather , the explanatory statement accompanying h.r .

1865 stated the following: science and technology needs in congress : the report released on november 14 , 2019 , by the national academy of public administration ( napa ) identified the existing gaps in science and technology expertise and resources available to congress .

the committees , members , stakeholders and other committees of jurisdiction working together will continue to evaluate the recommendations in the report to address this gap.... science and technology issues : the funding provided will allow gao to increase support for congress' work on evolving science and technology issues .

the 2019 report from the national academy of public administration ( napa ) identified the need for gao to focus its advice to congress on technical assessments and short - to - medium term studies .

the study also highlighted that although gao's support requests from congress have increased , gao should consider expanding its outreach to the science and technology community and coordination with crs to better fill these gaps .

gao is encouraged to dedicate a specific number of experts to work exclusively on gao's science , technology assessment , and analytics ( staa ) team that was created in january 2019 , a recommendation that was included in the napa report .

the architect of the capitol ( aoc ) is responsible for the maintenance , operation , development , and preservation of the u.s. capitol complex , which includes the capitol and its grounds , house and senate office buildings , library of congress buildings and grounds , capitol power plant , botanic garden , capitol visitor center , and uscp buildings and grounds .

the aoc is responsible for the supreme court buildings and grounds , but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill .

the fy2019 level was $733.7 million .

in comparison , levels considered for fy2020 include the following: requested: $831.7 million ( +13.3% ) house - reported: $624.7 million ( - 2.4% , not including senate - items ) senate - reported: $585.8 million ( +9.2% , not including house - items ) enacted: $695.9 million ( - 5.2% ) operations of the aoc are funded in the following 10 accounts: capital construction and operations , capitol building , capitol grounds , senate office buildings , house office buildings , capitol power plant , library buildings and grounds , capitol police buildings and grounds , capitol visitor center , and botanic garden .

additional funding information on the individual aoc accounts is presented in table 9 .

the aoc also requested one administrative provision that prohibits the use of funds for bonuses for contractors behind schedule or over budget .

this provision has been included in the annual appropriations acts since fy2015 .

the house - reported version of the provision would apply to fy2020 and each succeeding fiscal year .

the senate - reported bill included the annual provision , which was included in p.l .

116-94 .

the loc serves simultaneously as congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the united states .

its broader services to the nation include the acquisition , maintenance , and preservation of a collection of more than 167 million items in various formats ; hosting nearly 1.9 million visitors annually ; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities ; administration of u.s. copyright laws by its copyright office ; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped .

its direct services to congress include the provision of legal research and law - related services by the law library of congress , and a broad range of activities by crs , including in - depth and nonpartisan public policy research , analysis , and legislative assistance for members and committees and their staff ; congressional staff training ; information and statistics retrieval ; and continuing legal education for members of both chambers and congressional staff .

the fy2019 level was $696.1 million .

in comparison , levels considered for fy2020 include the following: requested: $747.1 million ( +7.3% ) house - reported: $720.3 million ( +3.5% ) senate - reported: $735.8 million ( +5.7% ) enacted: $725.4 million ( +4.2% ) these figures do not include additional authority to spend receipts .

the house appropriations committee report ( h.rept .

116-64 ) explains a change in the technology funding practice that affected the four loc appropriations headings: appropriations shifts to reflect centralized funding for information technology : during fiscal year 2018 , in an effort to reduce duplication , increase efficiency , and better utilize specialized expertise , the library of congress began providing more information technology ( it ) services centrally though its office of the chief information officer ( ocio ) rather than in the library's various component organizations .

in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 , library components which have separate appropriations accounts reimbursed the main library of congress salaries and expenses account through intra - agency agreements for the it services being provided to them centrally by the ocio under this initiative .

for fiscal year 2020 , however , the library has requested that funding for centralized it services be appropriated directly to the main salaries and expenses account for use by the ocio instead of to the component organizations receiving the services , in order to reflect where services are actually being performed and avoid the need for repeated reimbursement transactions .

the committee has agreed to this request .

as a result , the committee bill reflects a shift in appropriations totaling $13,556,000 to the library of congress salaries and expenses account , with $2,708,000 of that shift coming from the copyright office , $8,767,000 coming from the congressional research service , and $2,081,000 coming from the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped .

h.rept .

116-64 further contains a "note regarding it centralization" accompanying each heading , comparing the fy2020 house - reported level to the fy2019 enacted level after accounting for this shift .

the senate appropriations committee report ( s.rept .

116-124 ) similarly addressed the centralization , stating the following: the recommendation for this account also reflects a shift in appropriations associated with the centralization of information technology [it] funding from across the library into the office of chief information officer [ocio] .

a total of $13,556,000 will move to the ocio in fiscal year 2020 , reflecting the cost of it activities that were funded previously within the congressional research service , copyright office , and the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped .

the realignment of these funds will help facilitate the final phases of it centralization across the library .

the committee expects the library to provide a detailed spend plan , including any increase in fte levels for the it modernization intended to be addressed with the funds provided in fiscal year 2020 .

the loc headings include the following: 1 .

the open world leadership center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the united states .

congress first authorized the program in 1999 to support the relationship between russia and the united states .

the program encouraged young federal and local russian leaders to visit the united states and observe its government and society .

established at the loc as the center for russian leadership development in 2000 , the center was renamed the open world leadership center in 2003 , when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries .

in 2004 , congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees , subject to congressional consideration .

the center is housed in the loc and receives services from the loc through an interagency agreement .

the legislative branch bills have included a provision since fy2016 , also contained in the fy2020 act: that funds made available to support russian participants shall only be used for those engaging in free market development , humanitarian activities , and civic engagement , and shall not be used for officials of the central government of russia .

the location and future of open world , attempts to assess its effectiveness , and its inclusion in the legislative branch budget have been discussed at appropriations hearings and in report language for more than a decade .

the funding level for open world has also varied greatly during this period .

for additional discussion , see the "prior year discussion of location and funding of open world" section in crs report r44899 , legislative branch: fy2018 appropriations , by ida a. brudnick .

the center was created by congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs .

the fy2020 request , the house - and senate - reported versions of the bill , and the fy2020 act contain $430,000 , which is approximately the same level provided annually since fy2006 .
