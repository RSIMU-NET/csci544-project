the balanced budget act of 1997 ( p.l .

105-33 , bba - 97 ) established the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) under a new title xxi of the social security act .

chip builds on medicaid by providing health care coverage to low - income , uninsured children in families with incomes above applicable medicaid income standards .

official numbers show that chip enrollment reached a total of nearly 7.4 million children and nearly 335,000 adults in fy2008 .

in fy2008 , federal chip spending totaled $7.0 billion , with states' projected spending expected to equal $7.9 billion in fy2009 .

in bba 97 , congress authorized and appropriated funds for fy1998-fy2007 , with no federal appropriations slated for fy2008 and beyond .

the absence of future federal appropriations triggered chip legislative attention during the 110 th congress .

one of the first acts of the 111 th congress was to reauthorize the program .

on february 4 , 2009 , president obama signed the children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-3 , chipra ) into law .

this report summarizes the changes to prior law made by chipra , including a national appropriation for chip allotments totaling $68.9 billion over five years , distributed to states and territories using a new formula primarily based on their past and / or projected federal chip spending .

for fy2009 onward , annual allotments would be available for two years , with unspent funds available for redistribution first to shortfall states and then toward bonus payments , described below .

a new contingency fund ( for making payments to states for certain shortfalls of federal chip funds ) , which receives deposits through a separate appropriation each year through fy2013 , and makes payments of up to 20% of the available national allotment for chip for each eligible shortfall state ; new performance bonus payments ( for states exceeding certain child enrollment levels and states that implement certain outreach and enrollment initiatives ) , which are funded with a fy2009 appropriation of $3.225 billion and deposits of certain unspent chip funds through fy2013 ; additional grants for outreach and enrollment totaling $100 million each year through fy2013 ; provisions to remove barriers to enrollment including a state option to rely on findings from specified "express lane" agencies for eligibility determinations in medicaid and chip ; a state option to extend coverage to pregnant women under chip through a state plan amendment when certain conditions are met ; provisions to terminate chip adult coverage waivers , and establish conditions to continue existing waivers under medicaid ; a state option to waive the five - year bar for medicaid or schip coverage to pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the united states and are otherwise eligible for such coverage ; provisions to provide a specific alternative for states to verify proof of citizenship , and a requirement for citizenship documentation in schip ; provisions related to benefits ( eg , dental , mental health ) ; a state plan option for premium assistance to enroll in employer - based health insurance , and elimination of barriers to providing premium assistance ; provisions to strengthen quality of care and health outcomes of children ; a medicaid and chip payment and access commission ; program integrity and miscellaneous provisions , including some that affect the medicaid program ; and tobacco tax changes .

the appendix provides a summary of the major chip legislation during the 110 th and 111 th congresses .

the children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 ( chipra , h.r .

2 ) was passed in the house on january 14 , 2009 , and an amended version was passed in the senate on january 29 , 2009 .

on february 4 , 2009 , the house passed h.r .

2 ( as amended by the senate ) , and later that day president obama signed the bill into law as p.l .

111-3 , the children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 ( chipra ) .

one of the provisions of chipra permits using chip as the program's acronym , instead of schip .

this report reflects this change , using chip instead of schip .

chipra is effective april 1 , 2009 , which is the beginning of the second half of the federal fiscal year .

states will be given additional time to come into compliance with the requirements of chipra , if applicable , based on the timing of state legislative sessions .

if fy2009 chip allotment amounts provided for the first two quarters of fy2009 have not been obligated , they will be rescinded and will effectively be replaced with funding provided in this act .

the amount of allotments provided under chipra in the second half of fy2009 will be reduced by spending that occurred from a state's fy2009 allotment in the first half of the fiscal year .

provisions in the act will be considered effective on the dates specified regardless of whether implementing regulations have been issued .

in addition , states cannot be denied medicaid and chip payments if they acted in good faith reliance on the provisions of the act , even if those expenditures do not comply with the final regulations ultimately issued .

cost estimates from the congressional budget office ( cbo ) indicated that chipra would increase outlays by $32.8 billion over 5 years and by $66.1 billion over 10 years .

those costs would be offset primarily by increases in federal tobacco taxes , which were estimated to increase on - budget revenue by $32.8 billion over 5 years and by $66.6 billion over 10 years .

on any given day in 2007 , approximately 9 million children were without health insurance .

most of these children came from two - parent families ( 53% ) .

most had a parent who worked full time all year ( 60% ) .

and other data indicate most uninsured children are eligible for medicaid or chip ( 62% ) .

cbo estimated chipra will increase average monthly fy2013 medicaid and chip enrollment by 6.5 million over prior - law estimates , for a total of 37.7 million projected enrollees .

about 80% of the increased enrollment would occur among current eligibility groups , rather than new ones .

of the 6.5 million increased average monthly enrollment in fy2013 , cbo estimates that 2.4 million ( 37% ) would have private coverage in the absence of the legislation and that 4.1 million ( 63% ) would be uninsured .

the overall structure of chipra is similar to its two predecessors , h.r .

976 and h.r .

3963 from the 110 th congress .

the remainder of this report summarizes changes to prior law as enacted by chipra .

under current law , states may provide chip coverage under their medicaid programs , create a new separate chip program , or both .

under separate chip programs , states may elect any of three benefit options: ( 1 ) a benchmark plan , ( 2 ) a benchmark - equivalent plan , or ( 3 ) any other plan that the secretary of hhs deems would provide appropriate coverage for the target population ( secretary - approved coverage ) .

benchmark plans include ( 1 ) the standard blue cross / blue shield preferred provider option under the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) , ( 2 ) the coverage generally available to state employees , and ( 3 ) the coverage offered by the largest commercial hmo in the state .

benchmark - equivalent plans must cover basic benefits ( i.e. , inpatient and outpatient hospital services , physician services , lab / x - ray , and well - child care including immunizations ) , and must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the selected benchmark plan for specific additional benefits ( i.e. , prescription drugs , mental health services , vision care , and hearing services ) .

chipra adds or modifies several benefits available to children under chip .

it also addresses payment of premiums and related sanctions .

the source of revenue for chipra would be an increase in tobacco excise taxes .

the vast majority of tobacco taxes are on cigarettes , which account for 97% of federal tobacco tax revenue .

under prior law , excise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products included the following rates: federal cigarette taxes: $0.39 per pack ; small cigars: $.04 per package of 20 ; large cigars: 20.719% of sales price , not to exceed $48.75 per 1,000 units ( i.e. , a maximum tax of almost $.05 per cigar ) ; chewing tobacco: $.01 per ounce ; snuff: $.04 per ounce ; and pipe and roll - your - own tobacco: $.07 per ounce .

there are also taxes on cigarette paper and cigarette tubes .

these taxes are imposed per pound and under prior law the rates were as follows: ( 1 ) $0.195 for chewing tobacco , ( 2 ) $0.585 for snuff , and ( 3 ) $1.0606 for pipe and roll - your - own tobacco .

there are also taxes on large cigarettes that are essentially non - existent ( although a tax is necessary for administrative reasons ) .

chipra increases taxes on cigarettes and tobacco - related products ( effective april 1 , 2009 ) to the following rates: federal cigarette taxes would be increased to $1.0066 per pack ; small cigars would have their taxes increased to the same level as cigarettes ; large cigars would be subject to a tax of 52.75% of sales price with a maximum of $0.4026 per cigar ; chewing tobacco would be increased to approximately $.03 per ounce ( and $0.5033 per pound ) ; snuff would be increased to $.09 per ounce ( $1.51 per pound ) ; pipe tobacco would be increased to $.18 per ounce ( $2.8311 per pound ) ; roll - your - own tobacco would be increased to $1.55 per ounce ( $24.78 per pound ) ; cigarette papers taxes would rise from $1.22 per 40 , to $3.15 ; cigarette tubes would rise from $2.44 to $6.30 .

chipra also includes provisions affecting floor stock taxes that would apply to items removed from the manufacturer before the april 1 , 2009 , effective date , and subsequently sold after that date .

the person holding the items on april 1 , 2009 , will be liable , and there will be a $500 credit per person .

 ( a person is considered to be a controlled group .

for example , a corporation cannot receive the $500 credit for each of its subsidiaries. ) .

the floor stocks tax will also apply to products in a foreign trade zone ( i.e. , imports ) .

the purpose of the floor stock tax will be to prevent the stockpiling of tobacco products before april 1 , 2009 , the effective date for future sales .

chipra imposes regulatory and reporting requirements on manufacturers and importers of processed tobacco other than the tobacco products subject to excise taxes , and expands the definition of roll – your - own tobacco to include tobacco that could be used to make cigars .

chipra expands the scope of penalties for not paying the tobacco - related tax , clarifies the statute of limitations , and mandates a study of tobacco smuggling .

under prior law , quarterly estimated corporate tax payments due in july , august , and september of 2013 are 120% of the normal required payment , with the next such payment reduced accordingly .

chipra increases the ratio to 120.5% and shifts $300 million of corporate taxes from fy2014 to fy2013 .

the prior - law 120% withholding provision does not apply to firms with assets of less than $1 billion , and the withholding increase under chipra will not alter that exemption .

during the 110 th congress , a number of chip bills saw legislative action .

a majority of the chip changes enacted in public laws included provisions to add additional appropriations to chip , but did not make any major substantive changes to the program .

the 110 th congress enacted provisions to address certain states' shortfalls in fy2007 federal chip funding ( u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act , 2007 , p.l .

110-28 ) ; provide temporary fy2008 appropriations for chip through december 31 , 2007 through continuing resolutions ( p.l .

110-92 , p.l .

110-116 , p.l .

110-137 , p.l .

110-149 ) ; and provide additional appropriations through march 31 , 2009 ( the medicare , medicaid , and chip extension act of 2007 , p.l .

110-173 ) .

the 110 th congress also considered chip reauthorization legislation that would have made important changes to medicaid and chip .

numerous bills were introduced , and two that were passed by congress ( h.r .

976 and h.r .

3963 ) were vetoed by president bush .

table a - 1 includes a timeline of the legislative floor action on the major chip reauthorization bills during the 110 th and 111 th congresses .

the 110 th congress's h.r .

976 ( chipra i ) and h.r .

3963 ( chipra ii ) shared many common elements , including national allotment appropriations totaling $61.4 billion over five years ( which represented an increase of $36.2 billion over the prior law baseline of $25.2 billion ) , distributed to states and territories using a new formula primarily based on their past and / or projected federal chip spending ; a new contingency fund ( for making payments to states for certain shortfalls of federal chip funds ) , which would have received deposits through a separate appropriation each year through fy2012 and made payments of up to 20% of the available national allotment for chip ; new performance bonus payments ( for states exceeding certain child enrollment levels and states that implement certain outreach and enrollment initiatives ) , which were to be funded with an fy2008 appropriation of $3 billion and deposits of certain unspent chip funds through fy2012 ; additional grants for outreach and enrollment that would have totaled $100 million each year through fy2012 ; provisions to remove barriers to enrollment ; provisions related to benefits ( eg , dental , mental health , and early and periodic , screening , diagnosis and treatment [epsdt] ) ; provisions to eliminate barriers to providing premium assistance ; provisions to strengthen quality of care and health outcomes of children ; program integrity and miscellaneous provisions , including some that affect the medicaid program ; and tobacco tax changes .

cost estimates from the congressional budget office ( cbo ) indicated that h.r .

976 would have increased outlays by $34.9 billion over 5 years and by $71.5 billion over 10 years , and h.r .

3963 would have increased outlays by $35.4 billion over 5 years and by $71.5 billion over 10 years .

costs in both bills would have been offset by an increase in the federal tobacco tax ( mostly from an increase in the federal tax by 61 cents per pack of cigarettes ) and other changes , which the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) estimated would have increased on - budget revenue by $35.5 billion over 5 years and by $71.7 billion over 10 years .

according to the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , the two vetoed chipra bills both would have increased average monthly fy2012 medicaid and chip enrollment by 5.8 million , for a total of 34.1 million projected enrollees .

in both bills , about 80% of the increased enrollment would have occurred among current eligibility groups , rather than new ones .
