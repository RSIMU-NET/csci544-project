president obama's budget outline for fy2010 includes several proposals to reduce federal spending by $16 billion over 10 years on the farm commodity and crop insurance programs .

the issue was highlighted in the president's address to congress on february 24 , 2009 , when he said , "in this budget , we will ... end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. .

mr. obama also highlighted the farm commodity programs when , as president - elect , he cited a gao report on improper payments to farmers by remarking that , "there's a report today that , from 2003 to 2006 , millionaire farmers received $49 million in crop subsidies even though they were earning more than the $2.5 million cutoff for such subsidies .

now , if this is true ... it is a prime example of the kind of waste that i intend to end as president. .

criticism over parts of the farm subsidy program from an administration is not new .

throughout the 2008 farm bill debate , the bush administration wanted tighter income eligibility limits on farm subsidies , and it vetoed the farm bill — albeit unsuccessfully — partly for such reasons .

reaction to the proposal has been generally negative from groups affiliated with or supportive of agriculture .

the most vehement reaction has been to a proposal to eliminate direct payments to farms with more than $500,000 of sales .

several members of the house and senate agriculture committees have spoken out against the proposal in part or in whole .

support , although not explicitly expressed , would likely originate from some groups or individuals who supported tighter payments limits in the 2008 farm bill and would want tighter payment limits in any form .

the fy2010 budget proposal for the farm commodity and crop insurance programs is separate from the discretionary budget that funds usda operations .

the discretionary budget usually is the centerpiece of the administration's annual proposal , but that element of the budget is delayed in the first year of a president's term , and is not expected until april .

pending that submission , the administration has proposed a budget outline that , in the context of fiscal discipline , includes several proposals to reduce mandatory spending programs .

the mandatory farm commodity programs are not subject to annual appropriations , but are part of the five - year 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) .

the fy2010 budget indicates that most of the proposed $16 billion in farm commodity reductions would be used to offset $9.9 billion of proposed increases in child nutrition , although the savings could be used in any number of ways throughout the federal government .

given the nature of the mandatory programs , it is important to note — relative to the administration's proposal — that: any changes would require legislative action by congress and would likely need to originate in the agriculture authorizing committees .

they would not be part of the annual appropriations process .

such action would be viewed as "reopening" the 2008 farm bill , which most in the agriculture community see as a five - year contract with farmers .

the agriculture committees are neither obligated nor likely to take up the proposal ( some committee members have spoken out against the proposal in part or in whole ) .

if budget reconciliation is ordered by the budget committees , and the agriculture committees are tasked to find savings of a certain magnitude , then the president's farm proposals may draw more attention from congress .

even then , the proposal likely would be modified or a different budget - saving approach chosen , given the reaction by farm groups and agriculture committee members .

specifically , the president's fy2010 budget proposes four reductions in the farm subsidies , including direct payments , payment limits , cotton storage payments , and crop insurance .

the savings are estimated by the administration to total $16 billion over 10 years ( table 1 ) .

1 .

prohibit "direct payments" to farmers with sales exceeding $500,000 per year .

7 this would be a new and different type of "payment limit. .

about 76,500 farms in 2007 receiving government payments had sales over $500,000 ( 11% of farms receiving government payments , table 4 ) .

midwestern farms would be affected in the greatest number , but the proportion of cotton and rice farms affected would be greater than for corn , soybean , and wheat farms .

the administration estimates savings of $9.8 billion over 10 years .

relative to the $44 billion of direct payments that usda expects to pay from fy2010-fy2019 in the baseline under the 2008 farm bill , the proposal would reduce total direct payments by 22% over 10 years ( table 2 , figure 1 ) .

2 .

tighten payment limits ( maximum amount of subsidies paid ) to $250,000 per person .

the proposal is not detailed , but indications suggest it would re - impose limits on marketing loan benefits and tighten the limit on direct and counter - cyclical payments .

this would be similar to prior - year proposals for the same amount ( eg , s.amdt .

3695 , 110 th congress ) .

current law has a per - person limit of $210,000 for direct and counter - cyclical payments , with no limit on marketing loan benefits .

prior law had a $360,000 limit that included marketing loans ( although the limit could be avoided ) .

the administration estimates $126 million of savings over 10 years .

3 .

eliminate storage payments for cotton .

only cotton has a payment program to pay storage costs for crops placed under government loan .

the administration estimates savings of $570 million over 10 years .

4 .

reduce crop insurance subsidies .

the proposal is not detailed , but savings could be achieved by reducing the subsidy on premiums that farmers pay , reducing underwriting gains received by the insurance companies that sell the policies , or reducing administrative and operating expense reimbursements to the insurance companies .

the administration estimates savings of $5.2 billion over 10 years .

relative to the $72 billion of crop insurance subsidies estimated from fy2010-fy2019 in the cbo baseline , the proposal would reduce the crop insurance baseline by 7.2% over 10 years ( table 3 , figure 2 ) .

the budget also mentions reductions in the market access program ( map ) and elimination of the resource conservation and development ( rc&d ) program , both of which are outside the scope of the farm commodity programs .

much of the attention given to the administration's budget proposal has centered on the proposal to eliminate direct payments to farms with sales of more than $500,000 .

several observations may be made about the effect of using a limit on sales , and on the number and types of farms that would be affected .

a limit on sales would add a new type of "payment limit" for farm commodity support .

currently there is ( 1 ) a limit on amount of payments that a farmer can actually receive , and ( 2 ) an adjusted gross income ( agi ) limit to determine eligibility .

the proposal would add a third type of payment limit — an eligibility test of $500,000 of gross farm sales .

a $500,000 limit on sales generally would be more restrictive than the existing agi limit of $750,000 of "farm agi" ( after expenses ) and $500,000 of "nonfarm agi. .

the agi measure is after expenses are subtracted from income ; farms with $750,000 of farm agi likely have sales exceeding $1-$2 million or more .

the proposed limit on sales would be on a gross basis — that is , before expenses .

gross farm sales may be more variable than net farm sales ( "farm agi" ) .

net farm sales are less variable because higher expenses may offset higher sales .

thus , many opponents to the proposal have argued that farms exceeding a $500,000 sales limit may have very little profit or even a loss .

the high magnitude of commodity price increases during 2007-2008 changed the share of farms with sales over $500,000 from the 3% - 4% share of the previous nine years to 5.5% in 2007-2008 .

 ( figure 3 ) .

although this share may decline in the future given the drop in commodity prices since the fall of 2008 , it highlights that sales may be variable and more subject to "bracket creep" than net measures of income .

sales vary directly with prices and yields .

years with high prices or yields could push farms over the limit .

in contrast , a net income measure may be more constant if higher production expenses occur or tax management tools are used .

for example , expenses may vary in proportion to production ( eg , costs per acre , fertilizer - to - yield ) .

some expenses may be fixed regardless of production ( eg , land costs or sunk production costs ) .

other expenses may be manipulated to manage taxable income ( eg , purchasing equipment , and prepaying expenses ) , or delayed to reduce outlays in low - income years ( eg , postponing repairs or capital improvements , reducing withdrawals for family living expenses ) .

usda data show about 76,500 farms in 2007 receiving government payments and having sales over $500,000 .

they accounted for 11% of farms receiving government payments , and they received 47% of government payments ( table 4 ) .

when estimating the number of farms affected , it is important to look both at farms receiving government payments and farms with sales greater than $500,000 .

about 116,000 farms ( 5.3% of all farms in 2007 ) had sales over $500,000 , but only about 38% of all farms received government payments ( figure 4 ) .

many large fruit , vegetable , or livestock farms have sales over $500,000 but do not receive subsidies that accrue primarily to grains , oilseeds , and cotton .

large farms , although fewer in number , account for most of the production and government payments .

the 116,000 farms with sales over $500,000 produced 74% of the value of production and received 47% of government payments .

the effect on farms by region is visible in table 4 .

overall , the states with the highest number of farms affected are iowa ( about 8,200 farms ) , illinois ( 6,500 farms ) , minnesota ( 5,300 farms ) , and nebraska ( 5,100 farms ) .

about one - third of the 76,500 affected farms in the nation are in these four states .

about 13% - 16% of farms in these states receive government payments and have sales over $500,000 .

the table also shows the importance of combining information about high sales and government payments , and the effect of producing non - subsidized commodities .

for example , in california the effect of fruit and vegetable production on large farms is apparent with only 9% of farms receiving government payments .

more california farms have sales over $500,000 ( 8,600 farms ) than receive government payments ( 7,100 farms ) .

delaware has the highest ratio of farms ( 28% ) with sales exceeding $500,000 , likely an indicator of the state's concentrated poultry production on a relatively small amount of land ( compare figure 6 and figure 7 ) .

by commodity , a limit on sales would affect a higher percentage of cotton and rice farms ( in the southern tier of the united states ) than corn , soybean , or wheat farms .

cotton and rice farms on average are larger than corn , soybean , or wheat farms , and their value of production per acre is much higher — making them more likely to exceed a sales threshold .

government payments to cotton and rice farms also are higher ( figure 5 , figure 7 ) .

this comparison is similar to arguments that have been made in the payment limits debate for many years .

specific to the administration's proposal , about 17% - 21% of farms selling corn , soybeans , or wheat have sales over $500,000 .

their sales account for 51% - 59% of the national production of corn , soybeans , and wheat ( table 5 ) .

about 36% of farms selling cotton , and 43% of farms selling rice have sales over $500,000 .

their sales account for 75% of the national production ( table 5 ) .

but given the predominance of acreage devoted to corn , soybeans , and wheat compared with cotton and rice , the sheer number of corn , soybean , and wheat farms affected is larger than for cotton and rice .

this is indicated by the number of farms with sales over $500,000 ( table 5 ) and the rank of states like iowa , illinois , minnesota , and nebraska in table 4 .
