title i of the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 ( p.l .

106-170 ) established the ticket to work and self - sufficiency program ( hereinafter referred to as the ticket to work or ticket program ) , which is administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) .

the purpose of this program is to enhance work incentives for social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) beneficiaries .

the legislation created a "ticket" system to expand choices in the numbers and types of providers that ssdi and ssi beneficiaries may choose to assist them in receiving employment services .

the legislation also expanded medicare and medicaid coverage for individuals with a disability who are working or could work .

most notably , the ticket to work program created a market for public and private providers of support services known as employment networks ( ens ) to which social security disability beneficiaries can voluntarily assign their tickets in exchange for a range of employment support services .

the goal of the ticket program is to reduce dependence on disability benefits and help social security disability beneficiaries enter or reenter the workforce .

ens would then be eligible to receive payments from ssa based on ticket holders achieving employment "milestones" or outcomes .

this report provides an overview of how the ticket to work program operates and addresses several issues related to the ticket program .

first , it provides a brief background on the ssdi and ssi programs and a legislative history on how the ticket program evolved .

second , this report provides an in - depth explanation on the various components and regulations of the ticket to work program in its current form and prior to major regulatory changes in july 2008 .

third , it examines other work incentive programs created by ticket to work legislation and concludes with a discussion on the issues surrounding implementation of the ticket program .

ssa administers two disability programs , ssdi and ssi , titles ii and xvi of the social security act respectively .

ssdi is an insurance program for workers and their dependents for which benefits are paid to individuals who have a disability and have worked and made contributions to the u.s. social security system .

individuals who collect ssdi also become entitled to coverage under the medicare health insurance program ( title xviii of the social security act ) after a 24-month waiting period .

ssi is a means - tested disability program for low - income individuals who are aged , blind , or disabled and have limited resources .

in general , individuals are eligible for ssi if their countable income falls below the federal benefit rate ( fbr ) and they have countable resources of less than $2,000 for an individual .

in most states , beneficiaries who collect ssi are automatically entitled to coverage under the federal - state medicaid health insurance program ( title xix of the social security act ) .

individuals are considered to have a disability if they meet the definition established under the social security act .

disability is defined as the inability to engage in any "substantial gainful activity" ( sga ) due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death .

sga is defined in federal regulations as paid work involving significant and productive physical or mental duties .

for 2014 , the monthly sga thresholds are $1,800 for individuals who are blind and $1,070 for individuals with other disabilities .

sga limits are adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages .

in 2013 , approximately 12.2 million beneficiaries collected monthly ssdi or ssi benefits .

together these two programs represent the largest disability benefit system in the nation , with combined federal expenditures of approximately $146.8 billion in 2013 .

although both ssdi and ssi include a number of work incentives and offer rehabilitation services to individuals with a disability , the number of people who leave the benefit rolls to work ( i.e. , engage in sga ) is very small .

in 2012 , 0.4% of ssdi beneficiaries actually left the disability rolls because of work .

the small incidence of return - to - work has been partially attributed to the built - in disincentives of the ssdi and ssi programs .

because eligibility depends upon proving an inability to work , recipients risk losing both cash benefits and health insurance coverage if they successfully attempt to work .

prior to the passage of ticket to work legislation , policy makers and advocates for individuals with disabilities had long argued that work incentives under the law were complex and difficult to understand .

some contended that several reasons for the high rate of unemployment among beneficiaries included confusing rules , arcane procedures , and disincentives built into the social security disability programs .

advocates noted surveys showed that most working - age people with disabilities want to work and maintained that the numerous federal regulations and program rules have the effect of discouraging otherwise qualified and eager job seekers with disabilities from seeking employment .

return - to - work legislation subsequently became the subject of several legislative proposals , congressional hearings , and a major component of the clinton administration's comprehensive strategy to increase employment among individuals with disabilities .

on march 18 , 1998 , president william j. clinton established the presidential task force on the employment of adults with disabilities ( ptfead ) .

this cabinet - level task force was charged with conducting an extensive public policy review with the goal of increasing the employment of individuals with disabilities and addressing other barriers to work among adults and young people with disabilities .

ptfead produced a series of reports that analyzed existing federal programs and policies to determine and track changes that would be necessary to remove barriers to work , address issues surrounding health insurance coverage , and analyze employment outcomes of programs focused on youths with disabilities .

ultimately , ptfead's recommendations prompted the clinton administration to seek full funding in the fy2000 budget request for ticket to work programs .

along with several initial cosponsors in the 106 th congress , senator james m. jeffords introduced the work incentives improvement act of 1999 ( s. 331 ) on january 18 , 1999 , and on march 18 , 1999 , representative rick lazio introduced the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 ( h.r .

1180 ) .

ticket to work legislation garnered broad bipartisan and bicameral support .

a conference report incorporating both bills into h.r .

1180 was passed by the house on october 19 , 1999 , by a vote of 418 to 2 and by the senate on november 19 , 1999 , on a 99 to 1 vote .

president clinton signed h.r .

1180 into law on december 17 , 1999 , which became p.l .

106-170 .

specifically , the legislation authorized ( 1 ) "tickets" or vouchers to beneficiaries to give them increased choice of rehabilitation providers and access to services needed to obtain and retain employment , ( 2 ) payments to employment service providers based on ticket holder achieving certain employment "milestones" or outcomes , ( 3 ) ssa demonstrations to test different approaches to removing barriers to employment for title ii ( ssdi ) beneficiaries , and ( 4 ) options for states to adopt a medicaid "buy - in" program to allow beneficiaries to maintain health coverage after returning to work and a continuation of medicare coverage to certain beneficiaries who are working .

on december 13 , 1999 , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) produced final scoring on the budgetary effects of h.r .

1180 as passed by the house and senate .

cbo estimated modest gains in social security beneficiaries' future participation in the proposed expanded network of employment support services , beyond the services that were primarily offered by state vr agencies .

overall , by fy2009 , cbo projected that the ticket to work program ( title i of h.r .

1180 ) would reduce direct spending by $53 million and $32 million for the ssdi and ssi programs , respectively , through the combination of payments to ens and the avoidance of payments to beneficiaries whose benefits would be suspended or terminated due to earnings from work .

the ticket to work and self - sufficiency program was designed to address several barriers to work for individuals with disabilities through greater access to healthcare and a broader pool of employment service providers or ens .

under the program , ssa provides eligible ssdi and ssi beneficiaries with a "ticket" that can be used as a voucher to obtain vr , employment and other support services from an approved en or state vr agency .

ens are responsible for assisting ticket recipients with entering or re - entering the workforce .

the program is currently administered by two contracted program managers ( pms ) who report to ssa administrators .

initial regulations for the implementation of the ticket program were published in the federal register on december 28 , 2001 , and the program was phased in nationally over a three - year period beginning in 2002 .

the program was initially available for eligible beneficiaries in 13 states and was extended to all states by september 2004 .

in an effort to provide greater financial incentives to ens and expand ticket eligibility to a greater number of beneficiaries , the ticket program underwent a number of regulatory adjustments in july 2008 .

among other changes , the new rules modified the payment schedule for ens and allowed disability beneficiaries with medical conditions that were expected to improve to also participate in the ticket program .

these beneficiaries had been previously excluded .

table a - 1 in appendix a shows a side - by - side comparison of the key components of the ticket to work program that were subject to the july 2008 regulatory changes and new provisions that were implemented .

p.l .

106-170 contained several other provisions to enhance the work opportunities for individuals with disabilities .

it lessened work disincentives under the social security statute , established ssa demonstrations , and created an advisory panel .

the legislation also established two grant programs for the purpose of disseminating accurate information to beneficiaries with disabilities on work incentive programs .

according to publicly available data on the ssa website , 13.6 million active tickets have been issued to eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 , 2013 ( see table 1 ) .

at the inception of the program , tickets were issued to beneficiaries as the ticket to work program rolled out in phases .

since the initial roll out , a letter and paper ticket explaining the program are automatically mailed to eligible beneficiaries .

of the 13.6 million tickets issued , 319,972 ( approximately 2.4% ) have been activated ( i.e. , the ticket has been assigned to an en or state vr agency ) .

of all tickets that are in use , nearly 9 out of 10 have been assigned to state vr agencies rather than ens .

assignment of tickets does not necessarily mean that the client is actively receiving services from an en or state vr agency , only that the beneficiary has notified the pm that an agency or en has been designated to provide services to them .

in addition , there are currently 666 ens under contract to provide employment support services to ticket recipients as of december 31 , 2013 .

of the ens under contract , 594 ( 89.2% ) have had tickets assigned to them and 181 ( 27.2% ) have received some type of payment from ssa for achieving a designated payment milestone for months that a ticket - holder was working while assigned to the en .

as of december 31 , 2013 , approximately $138.1 million in total payments have been made to ens .

since the inception of the ticket to work program , a number of studies and evaluations have been conducted through the advisory panel , gao , and the academic community .

based on a review of these various reports , the following sections provide a discussion of the key issues facing the ticket program and matters that may be of concern to congress .

the ticket to work program introduced a new dynamic in the way ssa interacts with social security disability beneficiaries .

rather than simply making determinations of disability , ensuring that beneficiaries receive benefits , and recertifying eligibility , ticket to work further tasks ssa with facilitating a voluntary return - to - work program for the very same individuals who have been deemed unable to work .

since inception , ssa has faced several challenges in implementing the ticket to work program , including creating a way to increase participation rates and expand the number and quality of ens that serve individuals with disabilities who are seeking to reenter the workforce .

ssa has sought to address many of these challenges by implementing changes to various program components based on periodic assessments and recommendations .

however , others have asserted that creating a more effective system to address the employment challenges of individuals with disabilities requires greater integration of existing disability systems , tailoring rehabilitation programs to the needs of each individual , and increasing the return - to - work incentives for people who want to rejoin or remain in the workforce , but would find it difficult without ongoing supports .

some research suggests that social security disability programs have been slowly reactive , that is , providing benefits after a disability has become long - term and more difficult to rehabilitate .

some evidence supports the notion that supplying an individual with the necessary medical and rehabilitative support as soon as possible after the onset of a disability may help prevent the condition from worsening over time and enable that individual to return to work sooner or avoid leaving the workforce altogether .

recent attachment to the workforce is a significant factor in a disabled individuals' ability to return to employment following a disabling condition .

in other words , the longer disabled individuals are separated from the workforce , the less likely they will be able to return to gainful employment due to factors that may include outdated skills , inadequate accommodations , or a lack of motivation .

these challenges are exacerbated by a recent economic downturn that has resulted in higher unemployment rates for both the disabled and nondisabled alike .

yet , for individuals with disabilities to receive the health insurance coverage , rehabilitative services and employment supports available through the ticket to work program , they must first go through the often protracted process of applying for benefits and demonstrating to ssa that they are unable to work due to a long - lasting impairment .

additionally , if a claim is denied and an individual files for a reconsideration or appeal , the application process can be further extended by months or years in some cases .

the timeline can be even longer for most ssdi claimants who must sustain a five - month wait from disability - onset before they even become eligible to apply for benefits .

congress may move to consider authorizing ssa to expand non - monetary benefits , including medical and rehabilitative services to ssdi and ssi applicants who have not yet been approved for full benefits .

the lengthy application process for benefit payments may be hindering their ability to take full advantage of the services that will enable them to eventually leave the benefit rolls due to work .

the cumulative passage of time that occurs from disability - onset , the benefits application period and — for ssdi applicants — the additional five - month wait for eligibility , disengages individuals from work , may increase the severity of any untreated medical conditions , and will likely entrench their reliance on cash payments if and when a claim is eventually approved .

an early intervention process that focuses on providing targeted support soon after the onset of a disability for an individual who has recently left the workforce , or is still on the job , may allow that person to continue working or quickly return to work following a brief absence .

a successful early intervention effort could allow a claimant to continue working in at least a part - time capacity and receive reduced benefits or preclude the need for ssa to ever provide full disability benefits .

as mentioned earlier , nearly 9 out of 10 ticket holders assign their tickets to state vr agencies as opposed to ens .

this may be a relic of the pre - ticket to work era when state vr agencies served all ssdi and ssi beneficiaries .

vr agencies are in the advantageous position of being well established in the disability community and being authorized to offer any necessary services to beneficiaries for which the agencies are reimbursed based on appropriated funds .

in addition , vr agencies currently have a performance measurement process in place that identifies the outcomes of their services to clients .

ticket to work legislation also gives vr agencies the added option of "acting as ens" through electing to be paid under a ticket to work payment system .

however , the services offered by ens vary and according to gao , ticket to work pms do not keep an accurate , up - to - date listing of which services are offered by which en .

ens also have the option of selecting which ticket holder they will serve , and are more likely to accept tickets from individuals that are either working or ready to work , as opposed to state vr agencies which are required to prioritize individuals with the most severe disabilities .

this has possibly led to service approaches by ens in which the ticket to work revenue sharing provisions have become out of line with the general goals of the ticket program .

in addition , ssa does not currently have a system in place to measure en performance as required by law .

in line with gao recommendations for the ticket to work program , congress may consider authorizing ssa to develop a system to ensure that ticket holders are provided with accurate information on the services that each en provides so they can make informed choices when seeking services ; determine whether en incentives , especially the ticket program revenue sharing provisions , are consistent with the goals of the ticket to work program ; and develop performance measures to identify employment outcomes of ticket holders served by ens .

consideration may also want to be given for how ssa measures return - to - work rates .

the current "snapshot" measurement of beneficiaries whose benefits are terminated due to work is important to identify due to annual appropriations decisions .

however , this cross - sectional statistic includes a large group of beneficiaries who are added to and remain on the disability rolls every year , but will never work .

supplementing cross - sectional data with a longitudinal measurement of return - to - work rates of annual ssdi and ssi cohorts could help to provide a more accurate picture of how ssa's work incentives are enabling individuals with disabilities to return to the workforce .

appendix a. compilation of key ticket to work july 2008 regulatory changes appendix b .

description of employment network payment systems milestone - outcome en payment system four phase 1 milestones four phase 1 milestones are available to compensate ens for initial efforts that a beneficiary makes toward self - supporting employment .

milestone completion is based on earnings that a beneficiary makes above the twp threshold .

all phase 1 payments to ens are equal to 120% of the national average disability payment under ssdi ( referred to as the "payment calculation base" or pcb ) for ticket holders with earnings from work based on the following schedule: milestone 1 : a beneficiary has worked for one calendar month and has gross earnings from employment for each of those months that are above the twp threshold .

milestone 2 : a beneficiary has worked for three calendar months within a six - month period and has gross earnings from employment for each of those months that are above the twp threshold .

the month used to meet the first milestone can be included in the three months used to meet the second milestone .

milestone 3 : a beneficiary has worked for 6 calendar months within a 12-month period and has gross earnings from employment for each of those months that are above the twp threshold .

any of the months used to meet the first and second milestones can be included in the 6 months used to meet the third milestone .

milestone 4 : a beneficiary has worked for 9 calendar months within an 18-month period and has gross earnings from employment for each of those months that are above the twp threshold .

any of the months used to meet the first 3 milestones can be included in the 12 months used to meet the fourth milestone .

phase 2 milestones following the successful completion of phase 1 milestones and as a ticket holder's earnings progress toward self - sufficiency , ens can become eligible to receive a series of phase 2 milestone payments .

the earnings standard is increased to the sga threshold for phase 2 milestones ( $1,070 / month or $1,800 / month if blind for 2014 ) as opposed to the lower twp threshold ( $770 / month for 2014 ) under phase 1 milestones .

monthly payments to ens are equal to 36% of the respective pcb for ssdi ( $1,130.89 for 2014 ) or ssi ( $650.44 for 2014 ) for each month that a ticket holder's gross earnings from work are above sga based on the following schedule: up to 11 payments for ssdi ticket holders ( $471 for 2014 ) , or up to 18 payments for ssi ticket holders ( $234 for 2014 ) .

outcome phase if a ticket holder's work activity satisfies the requirements for both phase 1 and phase 2 milestones under the milestone - outcome payment system , ens can potentially collect additional monthly payments in an "outcome" phase for ticket holders that have earnings sufficient for a zero cash benefit status .

that is , the ticket holder has sustained earnings long enough at the sga level that they are no longer receiving any cash payments from ssa .

for ticket holders that qualify for the outcome phase , ens can receive additional payments that are also equal to 36% of the respective pcb based on the following schedule: up to 36 payments for ssdi ticket holders ( $407 for 2014 ) , or up to 60 payments for ssi ticket holders ( $234 for 2014 ) .

outcome - only en payment system under the outcome - only payment system , ens can receive payment for ticket holders that have earnings sufficient for a zero cash benefit status .

payments for ssdi ticket holders can be made for up to 36 months and up to 60 months for ssi ticket holders .

payments to ens are equal to 67% of the pcb for ssdi ( $758 for 2014 ) and ssi ( $436 for 2014 ) .
