the national defense authorization act for fy1996 called on the department of defense ( dod ) to embark upon an initiative to develop cruise missile defense ( cmd ) programs emphasizing operational efficiency and affordability .

advanced cruise missiles ( cms ) âthose designed with stealthy capabilities to evade detectionâwere noted as a prominent threat prompting the need for effective cmd .

this cmd initiative was to be coordinated with other air defense efforts ; that is , with "cruise missile defense programs ... and ballistic missile defense programs ... mutually supporting" each other .

three years later , in conjunction with the national defense authorization act for fy1999 , the senate armed services committee noted: "[t]he committee does not believe that the department of defense has adequately integrated its various cruise missile defense programs into a coherent architecture and development plan. .

dod has indicated a commitment to developing cmd capabilitiesâwithin its larger strategy of air defense requirementsâthat demonstrate operational effectiveness .

unlike past approaches to cmd that critics assert were "stovepiped"âindividually driven by the services' respective objectivesâcurrent and future programs are meant to emphasize effectiveness based on inter - service synergy , or jointness .

whether or not the pentagon will be able to integrate cmd plans to a point of effective interoperability is an important question .

many analysts believe that no mission area will rely more on jointness than detection and intercept of advanced cms .

an examination of cmd development , therefore , offers some insight into the progress dod is making in terms of increased joint warfighting capability .

cmd today is primarily an issue of force protection for u.s. troops deployed in a theater of conflict .

the cm threat to the united states appears lower than the theater cm threat , but it also seems likely to grow .

given ongoing proliferation challenges , there is general consensus that cm technology will continue to spread .

many claim that the united states' dominance of manned military aviation will drive many countries to adopt cms as the "poor man's air force. .

by 2015 , the cia estimates that up to two dozen nations will be able to pose a serious cm threatâprimarily in theater but also through forward - deployed weapons platforms .

also , the u.s. failure to detect several iraqi cms launched against american assets during operation iraqi freedom has led some in dod to now deem cmd a "critical mission area. .

cms present many operational challenges .

effective cmd requires rapid and accurate performance of a series of military tasks collectively known as the "kill chain. .

first , surveillance radars must detect manned and unmanned aircraft ; including cms .

the second major step involves continuously tracking the aircraft along its course , a process complicated by what may be an elusive flight path .

next , the aircraft must be identified .

it must be concretely determined whether the airborne object is a cm , or a friendly or neutral aircraft .

this process , called combat identification , is vital to lowering the chances that a friendly or neutral aircraft might be erroneously identified as a threat , and attackedâa scenario that unfortunately played out several times during operation iraqi freedom .

once a cm threat is identified , a decision on how to engage the cm must be made: which defense assetsânaval , ground , or airborne platformsâwill be used to try to intercept the cm ? .

the final step of the kill chain involves actually intercepting or neutralizing the cm with weaponsâmissiles and gunfire being the only two current options .

other technologies , such as directed energy weapons , are being studied .

the u.s. military has historically fielded service - oriented cmd systemsâindependent land - , air - , and sea - based weapons platforms with cmd applications .

although this strategy has yielded fairly effective point defense capabilities against conventional airborne threats , most analysts agree that an advanced cm threat will require more effective defenses .

the north american aerospace defense command ( norad ) , for example , is attempting to augment its sensor coverage capabilities , and link with service weapons systems for target engagement of lowâ flying cms .

efforts are also underway to marry military sensors and radars employed by theâ federal aviation administration ( faa ) to provide comprehensive air surveillance of the united states .

increased effectiveness against advanced cms will require improved joint surveillance , tracking and combat identification capabilities , and increased weapons range .

the pentagon's efforts to improve cmd capabilities are addressed through multiple offices and strategies .

some of the most prominent ones are described below .

generally at issue is whether or not dod has adequately responded to congressional directives on cmd .

this question is best addressed by examining the three main parts of the 1996 congressional cmd initiative: a suitable coordination of cmd with ballistic missile defense ( bmd ) efforts , the development of cmd for near - term as well as advanced cm threats , and affordability and operational effectiveness for all cmd efforts .

congress directed dod to undertake bmd and cmd efforts in a mutually supportive fashion .

some argue that pentagon efforts on cmd have taken a back seat to bmd efforts .

in terms of resource allocation , much more focus has been placed on ballistic missile defense than on cmd .

in its budget request for fy2005 , for example , dod sought $9.2 billion for the missile defense agencyâthe office tasked with bmdâand asked for $239 million toward the development of cmd .

on the one hand , it can be argued that bmd must remain paramount given the known ballistic missile threatânuclear missiles are already targeted at the united states and enemy ballistic missiles have already taken a toll on u.s. troops during wartime .

on the other hand , some contend that the current level of prioritization may be too lopsided .

as noted by the defense science board , the cm threat is highly unpredictable and advanced cms could emerge quickly and unexpectedly .

in relation to the congressional directive to address near - term and future airborne threats , dod has stressed effective theater and air missile defense as a prime objective .

in addition to upgrading many of the services' individual cmd weapons platforms , dod is working toward many of the strategies relevant to future cmdâa single integrated air picture , better combat identification , and integrated fire control among them .

dod anticipates that such building blocks will enable the employment of a joint engagement zone ( jez ) for theater war fighting between 2015 and 2020 .

currently , theater commanders try to reduce the chance of fratricide by separating cmd forces into distinct zones: missile engagement zones and fighter engagement zones .

this separation , however , also reduces effectiveness .

a jez is intended to enable interoperability among the services' sensors and weapons systems for offensive and defensive operations .

will the cmd challenges inherent to creating a jez really be overcome by 2010 ? .

to do so would require adequate investments of time and effort by the pentagon .

however , jtamdo , for example , estimates that as little as 20% of its time and manpower is currently going toward cmd efforts .

at the same time , it estimates that upwards of 40% of its resources are being put toward support of the initial defensive operations of bmd .

moreover , jtamdo resources are being expended toward homeland air security coordination , force protection , and wmd defense requirements .

although some measure of action toward addressing the cm threat is being taken , the level of urgency remains an issueâas dod may now deem other defense activities more pressing .

congress noted that cmd measures should be undertaken with operational effectiveness as a core criterion .

since interoperability of resources remains the paramount feature in the pentagon's activities to develop effective cmd , consequences associated with jointness are a key factor to monitor .

further , several cmd objectives will likely enable other mission areas .

an effective siap , for example , not only will offer cmd applications but also will enable counter - air operations and battlefield interdiction efforts .

increased jointness associated with cmd efforts may also create some level of organizational friction , and congress may come under pressure to provide oversight to resolve service "turf battles. .

as cmd efforts become more integrated , service control over traditionally clear boundaries may get cloudier .

with enhanced ifc , for example , air force or navy assets may be able to direct ground - based weapons that are currently under army control .

it is possible that narrow service interests may hinder the implementation ofâand thus effectiveness ofâfuture joint cmd capabilities .

moreover , will the services' cmd operational overlap lead to a reorganization of which services controlâand are funded by congress forâcertain weapons systems and programs ? .

the congressional directive to develop affordable cmd measures is an important issue in terms of procurement .

current cost - exchange ratios associated with cms favor attackers over defenders ; cruise missiles can be cheap and defenses are costly .

for example , patriot missiles , bought at roughly $2.5 million apiece , can be effective interceptors for incoming cms , but those cms may be simple designs costing only a couple hundred thousand dollars apiece .

moreover , intercept costs are only one of many kill chain expenditures that can make cmd forces much more expensive than the cm threat .

on the whole , the pentagon seems to have promoted the pursuit of advanced cmd programs to combat sophisticated cm attacks .

in terms of simple cm threats , however , more resources may be needed to produce less costly but nonetheless effective defenses .

dod's defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) has a low - cost cruise missile defense program that focuses on countering low - tech cms by reducing the cost of interceptors .

darpa hopes to develop cmd interceptors that would cost as little as $40,000 .

even cheaper intercept technologies may be required for cost - effective cmd , especially if faced with large - scale attacks by cheap cms .

inexpensive but proven "jamming" technology ( eg , high - power microwaves ) that can disrupt cm guidance systems might be a potentially useful approach .

also , point defense weapons , such as radar - guided machine guns with high rates of fire , could be employed against less sophisticated cms .

a final consideration pertains to the deactivation of jciet .

combat identification remains , and is likely to remain one of the most challenging aspects of cmd .

overseers of dod's activities may wish to ask why the department deactivated the only organization dedicated specifically to improving joint cmd combat identification capabilities .

it is not evident that other organizations , such as jtamdo , have increased their work on cmd combat identification issues to make up for jciet's demise .

nor is it clear that improvement in other facets of cmd will make up for ineffective combat identification .

if a friendly or neutral manned aircraft is inadvertently shot down by u.s. cmd platforms in the future , dod's decision to deactivate jciet may come under intense scrutiny .
