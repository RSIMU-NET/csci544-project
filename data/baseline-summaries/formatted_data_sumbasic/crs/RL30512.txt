when the senate took up the bill it approved an overall 3.7 % increase .

a second bill ( h.r .

5666 ) , whichcontained an additional $118 million in regular fy2001 legislative branch appropriations funds , and a 0.22%across - the - broad cut in fy2001 appropriations , was also incorporated by reference into p.l .

they arefunded in other appropriation bills , but are placed in the legislative section by the office of management andbudget for bookkeeping purposes .

 ( back ) fy2000 total legislative branch permanentfederal fund authority was $279 million , comprisedof house and senate member pay ( $95 million ) ; house and senate use of foreign currencies ( $3million ) ; house and senate international conferences and contingencies ( $1 million ) ; and locpayments to copyright owners ( $180 million ) .

sources for permanent federal funds are fy2001 u.s.budget ( for senate items ) and house appropriations committee .

figures in the u.s. budget arerounded to the nearest million .

4 .

 ( back ) fy2000 total legislative branch permanenttrust fund authority was $51 million .

this figurecomprises the library of congress gift and trust fund accounts ( $41 million ) ; the library of congresscooperative acquisitions revolving fund ( $2 million ) ; u.s. capitol preservation commission trustfunds ( $1 million ) ; architect of the capitol for the botanic garden , gifts and donations ( $6 million ) ; and john c. stennis center for public service training and development trust funds ( $1 million ) .

the source for permanent trust funds is the house committee on appropriations .

5 .

 ( back ) the fy2001 u.s. budget includes non - legislative entities under two headings: ( 1 ) "u.s. taxcourt" and ( 2 ) "other legislative branch agencies - legislative branch boards and commissions. .

for a more accurate picture of the legislative branch budget in fy2001,the budget authorityfor non - legislative entities should be subtracted from the total legislative budget authority providedin the u.s. budget .

the fy2001 u.s. budget shows an fy2001 total legislative budget authorityrequest of $3.082 billion , including permanent federal and permanent trust funds , non - legislativeentities , and a deduction of $8 million in off - setting receipts from sales to the public .

afterremoving non - legislative entities ( $38 million ) , the total is $3.036 billion , still including permanentfederal funds and permanent trust funds .

excluding permanent federal funds ( $311 million ) andpermanent trust funds ( $37 million ) , the total is $2.688 billion .

the source for these figures is thefy2001 u.s. budget .

the pending legislative branch budget request before the houseappropriations committee was $2.716 billion , which reflected a revision by the legislative branchof the president's request .

6 .

 ( back ) the source is the fy2001 u.s. budget .

this figure is not exact because the office of managementand budget ( omb ) , which prepares the u.s. budget , rounds to the nearest millions of dollars .

7 .

 ( back ) the source is the house appropriationscommittee .

in december of each year , legislativeagencies submit their budget requests for the upcoming fiscal year to omb .

the agencies' requestsare prepared during the previous months .

subsequently , omb incorporates the agencies' requestswithout change into the president's annual budget submitted to congress early the following year .

legislative agencies may revise their budget requests at any time , and the $2.716 billion was arevision by the legislative branch of the amount included in the president's budget .
