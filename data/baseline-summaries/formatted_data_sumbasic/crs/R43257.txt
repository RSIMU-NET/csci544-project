based on legislation passed in the 111 th congress , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap , formerly the food stamp program ) benefits , which were temporarily increased beginning in april 2009 , are scheduled to be reduced after october 31 , 2013 .

this report explains the increase that has been in place since april 2009 , the scheduled end to the increase , and the impact on snap households .

this report does not describe the rules of snap eligibility and benefit calculation ; see crs report r42505 , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) : a primer on eligibility and benefits , for that background .

as of july 2013 , snap provided food assistance to a monthly average of 47.6 million people in 23.1 million households .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projects that snap spending will peak at $83 billion in fy2013 before falling beginning in fy2014 .

snap participation and costs have increased markedly since fy2007 , mostly as a result of automatic and legislated responses to the 2007-2009 recession .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) provided the legislated response to the recession , which included an across - the - board increase in snap benefits .

once a household applies and is found eligible for the snap program , the household's benefit amount is calculated .

actual benefits vary by the household size , amount and type of household income , certain living expenses ( like high shelter costs ) , and to a smaller extent , geographic location .

the household's benefit amount is the result of certain subtractions from a maximum benefit .

 ( the calculation of snap benefits is discussed in crs report r42505 , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) : a primer on eligibility and benefits . ) .

maximum snap benefits are normally indexed for food - price inflation at the beginning of each fiscal year — every october 1 .

each october's inflation - indexing of snap benefits is based on the cost of the agriculture department's thrifty food plan ( tfp ) in the immediately preceding june .

for example , for fy2008 ( before arra ) , usda's calculation of the thrifty food plan in june 2007 formed the basis for the maximum benefits in place from october 1 , 2007 , through september 30 , 2008 .

arra ( p.l .

111-5 ) effectively overrode the annual snap inflation - indexing rules discussed above .

arra instituted an across - the - board benefit increase , effective april 2009 .

maximum monthly benefits were increased substantially , increasing the june 2008 tfp calculation by 13.6% .

in fy2009 , for a one - person household , the added benefit was $24 a month ; for two persons , $44 a month ; for three persons ( the most typical household ) , $63 a month ; for four persons , $80 a month ; and for larger households , higher amounts .

the average snap benefit for a household increased from $250 for october 2008 through march 2009 to $291 for april 2009 through september 2009 , an increase of 16.4% .

note: this report focuses on the impact of arra's increase to the snap maximum benefit ( and the impact of an end to that increase ) , but arra also increased the snap minimum benefit ( for households of 1-2 ) , as well as the funding levels of block grants received by puerto rico and american samoa in lieu of snap .

beginning november 1 , 2013 , the snap maximum monthly allotments are scheduled to revert back to what they would be without the increase legislated in arra .

usda has already instructed the states through their regional offices to make adjustments to their benefit determination systems on october 1 , 2013 , and again on november 1 , 2013 , in line with the statute .

as noted above , the maximum benefit for a family of four in october 2013 is $668 because of arra's increase .

if not for arra , the fy2014 maximum monthly benefit for a four - person household would be $632 .

because the arra increase sunsets on october 31 , 2013 , as of november 1 , 2013 , and for the remainder of the fiscal year , the maximum monthly benefit will revert to the standard benefit level without the arra increase , or $632 a month for a four - person household .

table 1 shows the maximum monthly snap allotment by household size both before the arra benefit increase sunsets ( through october 31 , 2013 ) and after it sunsets for the remainder of fy2014 as scheduled under current law .

the result of the sunset is a scheduled reduction in maximum snap benefits on november 1 , 2013 , of about 5.5% .

although the actual percentage reduction will vary for each household , it can be said , for most snap households , that if no household circumstances change , the benefit reduction is scheduled to be $11 a month for a one - person household ; $20 a month for a two - person household ( the average sized household ) ; $29 a month for a three - person household ; and $36 a month for a four - person household .

the reductions will be higher as household size increases .

the president's fy2014 budget proposed to delay the sunset of the arra benefit increase to march 31 , 2014 .

this is the date that the arra increase was first scheduled to sunset , before the enactment of the child nutrition reauthorization legislation ( p.l .

111-296 , see below ) .

according to administration cost estimates , extending the arra benefit increase for an additional five months of fy2014 would cost approximately $2.26 billion .

the 113 th congress is developing a reauthorization of snap as part of the next farm bill .

neither the house nor the senate conference farm bill proposals contain any changes to the arra increase and its sunset .

 ( for a discussion of legislative history and the contents of the house and the senate proposals , see crs report r43076 , the 2013 farm bill: a comparison of the senate - passed ( s. 954 ) and house - passed ( h.r .

2642 , h.r .

3102 ) bills with current law . ) .

as previously discussed , the arra benefit increase was originally to continue until food - price inflation caught up with the arra add - on .

that is , there was no sunset of the arra benefit increase .

however , to finance additional spending for other legislative priorities under congressional pay - as - you - go ( paygo ) budget rules , congress twice reduced additional spending attributable to the snap arra benefit increase .

this reduction came through setting a termination date , or a sunset , to the arra snap benefit increase .

this legislative history is also illustrated in archived crs report r41374 , reducing snap ( food stamp ) benefits provided by the arra: p.l .

111-226 and p.l .

111-296 .

the 2010 law that provided funding for medicaid and education jobs ( p.l .

111-226 ; enacted august 10 , 2010 ) included , as an offset for its costs , a significant reduction in future arra - based snap benefits .

at the time p.l .

111-226 was enacted , cbo projected the savings from the snap benefit changes at $11.9 billion from fy2014 to fy2018 .

p.l .

111-226 achieved these savings ( in section 203 ) by terminating the arra increase effective after march 31 , 2014 .

on december 13 , 2010 , the healthy , hunger - free kids act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-296 ) was enacted .

this law , which reauthorizes , revamps , and expands child nutrition programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( the wic program ) , includes as a partial offset for its costs a provision further reducing arra - based snap benefits by some $2.5 billion .

the child nutrition / wic legislation achieved its savings ( in section 442 ) by moving up the date on which the arra - generated snap benefit increase will terminate — to october 31 , 2013 .
