the farm bill is an omnibus , multi - year law that governs an array of agricultural and food programs .

it provides an opportunity for policymakers to periodically address a broad range of agricultural and food issue s. the farm bill has typically undergone reauthorization about every five years .

in the past , farm bills have focused primarily on farm commodity program support for a handful of staple commodities — corn , soybeans , wheat , cotton , rice , dairy , and sugar .

farm bills have become increasingly expansive in their topical scope since 1973 , when a nutrition title was included .

other prominent additions include conservation , horticulture , and bioenergy programs .

recent farm bills have been subject to various developments , such as insufficient votes to pass the house floor , presidential vetoes , or — as in the case of 2008 and 2014 farm bills — short - term extensions .

the 2002 farm bill was the most recent to be enacted before the fiscal year expiration date for some programs .

the current farm bill ( the agricultural act of 2014 , p.l .

113-79 ) has many provisions that expire in 2018 .

the 115 th congress has begun but not finished a new farm bill .

an initial house vote on h.r .

2 failed by vote of 198-213 , but floor procedures allowed that vote to be reconsidered , and it passed by a second vote of 213-211 .

the senate passed its bill as an amendment to h.r .

2 by a vote of 86-11 .

conference proceedings officially began on september 5 , 2018 , but have not reached agreement .

the last year for the 2014 farm bill's commodity programs is the 2018 crop year — that is , crops harvested during 2018 and marketed during the twelve months following harvest .

the dairy margin protection program is the first such program that would expire , on december 31 , 2018 .

the farm commodity income support programs raise farm income by making payments and reducing financial risks from uncertain weather and market conditions .

government - set reference prices offer payments when market prices fall below support levels .

these programs collectively are known as "title i" programs , based on where they have been placed in recent farm bills .

usda administers close to 20 agricultural conservation programs that are directly or indirectly available to assist producers and landowners who wish to practice conservation on agricultural lands .

these programs address natural resource concerns on private agricultural and forested lands through technical and financial assistance .

many conservation programs have different expiration dates for program and funding authority .

therefore , they may be affected differently by expiration or extension of the 2014 farm bill .

table 2 separates the conservation programs by type of funding authority — mandatory and discretionary .

for many conservation programs , program authority is permanent under the food security act of 1985 , as amended , but the authority to receive mandatory funding expires .

an extension of the 2014 farm bill would allow programs with expired mandatory funding authority to continue , if the program has baseline beyond fy2018 .

for example , the conservation reserve program's ( crp's ) funding and program authority expired at the end of fy2018 .

because crp has baseline beyond fy2018 , an extension would allow the program to continue for a period of time at the authorized rate of enrollment — up to 24 million acres at any one time .

without reauthorization or a further extension of mandatory funding and program authority , crp is unable to sign new contracts or enroll additional acres after september 30 , 2018 .

all existing contracts and agreements stay in force for the contract period , and payments continue to be made .

some mandatory conservation programs have no baseline beyond fy2018 and therefore would require offsets from other funding in order to continue ( eg , voluntary public access and habitat incentives program and wetlands mitigation banking ) .

in some cases , provisions within a program do not have baseline , while the parent program does ( eg , transition incentives program within crp ) .

in these cases , the individual provisions would require offset funding in order to continue .

one mandatory conservation program — the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) — was extended in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) to september 30 , 2019 .

while eqip has funding authority through the end of fy2019 , select program provisions expired september 30 , 2018 ( see text box below ) .

several conservation programs also have permanent program authority , but are authorized to receive discretionary appropriations only through fy2018 .

funding for these programs varies and is based on appropriated levels .

similar to other discretionary programs with expired authority , the program can continue as long as it receives appropriated funding .

as discussed earlier , expiration and extension of snap ( and most of the related nutrition programs in the farm bill ) particularly hinge on whether funding is provided in an explicit extension or in an appropriations act , including a continuing appropriations act ( commonly referred to as a continuing resolution or cr ) .

in the case of the 2014 farm bill , certain provisions of law include a september 30 , 2018 , expiration date ; these are primarily authorizations of appropriations but some are program authorizations .

the impact on operations is based on factors related to programs' authorizing statutes , appropriations actions , and the terms of a farm bill extension ( if applicable ) .

the 2014 farm bill reauthorized a number of domestic food assistance programs , including snap ( formerly food stamps ) , the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) , the commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) , the food distribution program on indian reservations ( fdpir ) , the senior farmers' market nutrition program , the bill emerson hunger fellowship program , community food projects , and nutrition assistance block grants for american samoa and puerto rico .

the law also created a new program , the food insecurity nutrition incentive ( fini ) grants .

with regard to expiration or extension , these programs fall into one of three categories: 1 .

programs that are permanently authorized and funded , 2 .

programs that can be continued by the enactment of further funding , or 3 .

programs or authorities which would expire unless extended by statute or explicit appropriations for such purposes .

these categories are elaborated upon below .

the majority of farm bill nutrition programs ( and the majority of nutrition spending ) falls into the second category .

agricultural trade programs with mandatory funding that are affected by fiscal year expiration include export credit guarantees , facilities credit guarantees , export market promotion ( the market access program and the foreign market development program ) , and technical assistance for specialty crops .

without new mandatory program authority , the commodity credit corporation would not be able to undertake new activities in these programs .

several international emergency and nonemergency food assistance programs are authorized in the farm bill to receive annual appropriations and have 2018 fiscal year expiration dates .

the food for peace title ii , farmer - to - farmer , and mcgovern dole international food for education and child nutrition programs rely on discretionary funding .

therefore , these programs can continue to operate after a farm bill expires as long as the programs receive funding in annual appropriations bills .

in contrast , the bill emerson humanitarian trust and the food for progress program rely on mandatory funding ; therefore they cannot be reauthorized and continued through an annual appropriation .

their authorization to operate expires without a new or extended farm bill .

some see the existence of permanent law as an assurance for farm bill supporters that the farm commodity programs will be revisited every time a farm bill expires .

given the problematic consequences of permanent law , congress is not likely to let a farm bill remain expired without taking some action eventually .

permanent law , however badly it may be widely perceived , has remained in statute , and each recent farm bill has suspended it for the duration of the farm bill .

several legislative options relative to permanent law exist as a farm bill approaches expiration: 1 .

retain permanent law , and then do one of the following: do nothing ( revert to permanent law ) pass an extension ( with its suspension of permanent law ) pass a new farm bill ( and reinstate the suspension of permanent law ) suspend permanent law ( without a new farm bill or extension ) 2 .

repeal permanent law , and then do one of the following: do nothing ( no new farm bill ) pass an extension of the current farm bill pass a new farm bill ( with or without a new permanent law provision ) .

the existence of an outdated permanent law likely encourages congress to take action , because , to most people , inaction is perceived to have unacceptable consequences .

if congress cannot reach agreement on a new farm bill , then a path of least resistance may be extending the current farm bill with its suspension of permanent law — but this , too , requires legislative action , which may pose political and budgetary challenges .

for those who oppose the farm commodity programs , repealing permanent law would allow congress to debate farm supports without the looming consequences of reverting to permanent law .

but repealing permanent law also requires legislative action .

some believe that it is easier to negotiate and pass a new farm bill , with compromises and reforms , than to deal with the question of repealing permanent law .

throughout the 1950s and 1960s , farm bills generally used and amended the 1938 and / or 1949 acts .

amendments were sometimes made permanent and sometimes applied only to specific years .

as farm commodity policy continued to evolve , farm bills in the 1970s gradually began to move away from using the permanent law provisions with their parity - based price supports and quotas .

as recently as the 1970 and 1973 farm bills , the farm commodity programs were generally written into the 1938 and / or 1949 farm bills , as a form of suspension , with provisions that were applicable only for the new period of the farm bill .

thus , while those farm bills might not have directly suspended permanent law in the same way as more modern farm bills , they nonetheless supplanted some portion of the permanent law parity - based support system for the life of the farm bill , albeit from within the body of the permanent law itself .

beginning with the 1977 farm bill and continuing through the 2014 farm bill , direct suspension or nonapplicability language began to be used regarding the permanent laws .

the current statute that suspends permanent law is the following: suspension of permanent price support authority ( 7 usc 9092 ; p.l .

113-79 , sec .

1602 ) ( a ) agricultural adjustment act of 1938 .

the following provisions of the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 shall not be applicable to the 2014 through 2018 crops of covered commodities ( as defined in section 1111 ) , cotton , and sugar and shall not be applicable to milk during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this act through december 31 , 2018: ( 1 ) parts ii through v of subtitle b of title iii ( 7 u.s.c .

1326 et seq. ) .

 ( 2 ) in the case of upland cotton , section 377 ( 7 u.s.c .

1377 ) .

3 ) subtitle d of title iii ( 7 u.s.c .

1379a et seq. ) .

 ( 4 ) title iv ( 7 u.s.c .

1401 et seq. ) .

 ( b ) agricultural act of 1949 .

the following provisions of the agricultural act of 1949 shall not be applicable to the 2014 through 2018 crops of covered commodities ( as defined in section 1111 ) , cotton , and sugar and shall not be applicable to milk during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this act and through december 31 , 2018: ( 1 ) section 101 ( 7 u.s.c .

1441 ) ; ( 2 ) section 103 ( a ) ( 7 u.s.c .

1444 ( a ) ) ; ( 3 ) section 105 ( 7 u.s.c .

1444b ) ; ( 4 ) section 107 ( 7 u.s.c .

1445a ) ; ( 5 ) section 110 ( 7 u.s.c .

1445e ) ; ( 6 ) section 112 ( 7 u.s.c .

1445g ) ; ( 7 ) section 115 ( 7 u.s.c .

1445k ) ; ( 8 ) section 201 ( 7 u.s.c .

1446 ) ; ( 9 ) title iii ( 7 u.s.c .

1447 et seq .

 ) ; ( 10 ) title iv ( 7 u.s.c .

1421 et seq .

 ) , other than sections 404 , 412 , and 416 ( 7 u.s.c .

1424 , 1429 , and 1431 ) ; ( 11 ) title v ( 7 u.s.c .

1461 et seq .

 ) ; and ( 12 ) title vi ( 7 u.s.c .

1471 et seq. ) .

 ( c ) suspension of certain quota provisions .

the joint resolution , "a joint resolution relating to corn and wheat marketing quotas under the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 , as amended," approved may 26 , 1941 ( 7 u.s.c .

1330 and 1340 ) , shall not be applicable to the crops of wheat planted for harvest in the calendar years 2014-2018 .

proposals to repeal permanent law have been somewhat rare , though some have advanced as far as passing either chamber .

for example , a proposal to repeal permanent law advanced perhaps the farthest during the development of the 1996 farm bill .

repeal provisions may have had more saliency then because of a perceived intent that the "freedom to farm" plan was to end in 2002 at the end of the farm bill .

the existence of permanent law could have been an obstacle .

whether or not repeal was a condition of the plan during its development , repeal was dropped in favor of continued suspension during conference negotiations in 1996 .

more specifically regarding the 1995-1996 developments , the initial bill considered by the house agriculture committee in 1995 would have continued to suspend permanent law ( h.r .

2195 , title iv ) .

after not passing in committee , the text of that bill , including the suspension provision , was incorporated into a broader house - passed budget reconciliation package ( h.r .

2491 , §1105 ) .

however , the senate - passed version of the 1995 reconciliation package included a provision to repeal permanent law ( s. 1357 , §1101 ) .

the conference agreement for the reconciliation package adopted the senate approach for repeal ( h.r .

2491 , §1109 ) .

the conference agreement passed both the house and senate , but was vetoed , albeit not because of the farm bill provisions .

the next year , a stand - alone 1996 farm bill was introduced and passed in the house with the provision to repeal permanent law ( h.r .

2854 , §109 ) .

the repeal provision was also in the senate - reported bill ( s. 1541 , §19 ) .

however , the senate - passed version ( s. 1541 , §109 ) did not repeal permanent law but continued to suspend permanent law .

the conference agreement for the 1996 farm bill ( h.r .

2854 , §171 ) followed the senate - passed version and continued the suspension of permanent law .

other bills besides the farm bill from 1995 to 2001 proposed repealing permanent law , but were not formally considered .

in 1995 , several bills were introduced to restructure government agencies .

a bill was introduced to abolish usda , eliminate all price support authorities including those of permanent law , and transfer certain powers to the department of commerce ( h.r .

1354 , s. 586 ) .

a broader government - wide restructuring bill would have repealed permanent law ( h.r .

1923 ) .

a separate agricultural reform bill would have phased down agricultural supports and eventually repealed permanent law ( h.r .

2010 ) .

two other bills to repeal permanent law were introduced in 1995 ( h.r .

2523 and h.r .

2787 ) .

in 1997-1998 , h.r .

502 and s. 2573 would have repealed permanent law .

other bills to repeal permanent law were h.r .

328 in 1999 and s. 1571 in 2001 .

none of these bills advanced beyond being introduced and referred to committee .

other bills in various congresses have been introduced with targeted repeal provisions for certain commodities , but not comprehensive repeal .

these bills are not discussed here .

in the 112 th congress during consideration of the 2012 farm bill , a senate amendment was submitted , but not actually introduced on the floor , to replace the suspension of permanent law with the repeal of those provisions ( s.amdt .

2379 to s. 3420 ) .

in 2013 , the house - passed farm bill ( h.r .

2642 ) would have repealed the 1938 and 1949 permanent laws ( §1602 ) .

in their place , the house - proposed farm commodity program would have become the permanent law since it would have applied to "the 2014 crop year and each succeeding crop year" ( §§1107 , 1202 , 1204 , 1205 , 1206 , 1301 ) .

the senate bill ( s. 954 ) continued the long - standing suspension of permanent law , as did the initial house - rejected bill ( h.r .

1947 ) .

the enacted 2014 farm bill continues to suspend permanent law .
