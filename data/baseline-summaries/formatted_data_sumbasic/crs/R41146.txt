the small business administration ( sba ) administers programs to support small businesses , including loan guaranty programs to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses "that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions. .

the sba's 7 ( a ) loan guaranty program is considered the agency's flagship loan program .

its name is derived from section 7 ( a ) of the small business act of 1953 ( p.l .

83-163 , as amended ) , which authorizes the sba to provide and guarantee business loans to american small businesses .

the sba also administers several 7 ( a ) subprograms that offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for particular groups of borrowers , including the sbaexpress , export express , and community advantage pilot programs ( see the appendix for additional details ) .

although these subprograms have their own distinguishing eligibility requirements , terms , and benefits , they operate under the 7 ( a ) program's authorization .

proceeds from 7 ( a ) loans may be used to establish a new business or to assist in the operation , acquisition , or expansion of an existing business .

specific uses include to acquire land ( by purchase or lease ) ; improve a site ( eg , grading , streets , parking lots , and landscaping ) ; purchase , convert , expand , or renovate one or more existing buildings ; construct one or more new buildings ; acquire ( by purchase or lease ) and install fixed assets ; purchase inventory , supplies , and raw materials ; finance working capital ; and refinance certain outstanding debts .

in fy2018 , the sba approved 60,353 7 ( a ) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion .

the average approved 7 ( a ) loan amount was $420,401 .

as will be discussed , the total number and amount of sba 7 ( a ) loans approved ( and actually disbursed ) declined in fy2008 and fy2009 , increased during fy2010 and fy2011 , declined somewhat in fy2012 , and have increased since then .

historically , one of the justifications presented for funding the sba's loan guaranty programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage , compared with other businesses , when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit .

congressional interest in the 7 ( a ) loan program has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to grow and create jobs .

some members of congress have argued that the sba should be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start , continue , or expand operations with the expectation that in so doing small businesses will create jobs .

others worry about the long - term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit .

they advocate business tax reduction , reform of financial credit market regulation , and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to help small businesses further economic growth and job creation .

this report discusses the rationale provided for the 7 ( a ) program ; the program's borrower and lender eligibility standards and program requirements ; and program statistics , including loan volume , loss rates , use of the proceeds , borrower satisfaction , and borrower demographics .

it also examines issues raised concerning the sba's administration of the 7 ( a ) program , including the oversight of 7 ( a ) lenders and the program's lack of outcome - based performance measures .

this report also surveys congressional and presidential actions taken in recent years to help small businesses gain greater access to capital .

for example , during the 111 th congress p.l .

111-5 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ) , provided the sba an additional $730 million , including $375 million to temporarily subsidize the 7 ( a ) and 504 / certified development companies ( 504 / cdc ) loan guaranty programs' fees ( $299 million ) and to temporarily increase the 7 ( a ) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% ( $76 million ) .

p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 , provided $505 million ( plus $5 million for administrative expenses ) to extend the fee subsidies and 90% loan guaranty percentage through december 31 , 2010 ; increased the 7 ( a ) program's gross loan limit from $2 million to $5 million ; and established an alternative size standard for the 7 ( a ) and 504 / cdc loan programs to enable more small businesses to qualify for assistance .

p.l .

111-322 , the continuing appropriations and surface transportation extensions act , 2011 , authorized the sba to continue the fee subsidies and the 7 ( a ) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through march 4 , 2011 , or until available funding was exhausted ( which occurred on january 3 , 2011 ) .

during the 112 th congress , several bills were introduced to expand the 7 ( a ) program: s. 1828 , a bill to increase small business lending ( and for other purposes ) , would have reinstated for one year following the date of its enactment the fee subsidies for the 7 ( a ) and 504 / cdc loan guaranty programs and the 90% loan guaranty percentage for the 7 ( a ) program , which were originally authorized by arra .

h.r .

2936 , the small business administration express loan extension act of 2011 , would have extended a one - year increase in the maximum loan amount for the sbaexpress program from $350,000 to $1 million for an additional year .

that temporary increase was authorized by p.l .

111-240 and expired on september 27 , 2011 .

s. 532 , the patriot express authorization act of 2011 , would have provided statutory authorization for the patriot express pilot program and increased its loan guaranty percentages and its maximum loan amount from $500,000 to $1 million .

the patriot express pilot program was subsequently discontinued by the sba on december 31 , 2013 .

during the 113 th congress , the sba waived the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee and ongoing servicing fee for 7 ( a ) loans of $150,000 or less approved in fy2014 and fy2015 as a means to encourage the demand for smaller 7 ( a ) loans .

h.r .

2462 , the small business opportunity acceleration act of 2013 , would have made the fee waiver for smaller 7 ( a ) loans permanent .

waived the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee for a loan to a veteran or to a veteran's spouse under the sbaexpress program ( up to $350,000 ) from january 1 , 2014 , through the end of fy2015 ( called the sba veterans advantage program ) .

waived 50% of the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee on all non - sbaexpress 7 ( a ) loans to veterans of $150,001 up to and including $5 million in fy2015 .

in addition , p.l .

waived 50% of the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee on all non - sbaexpress 7 ( a ) loans to veterans of $150,001 to $5 million in fy2016 ; and 50% of the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee on all non - sbaexpress 7 ( a ) loans to veterans of $150,001 to $500,000 in fy2017 .

in addition p.l .

114-38 , the veterans entrepreneurship act of 2015 , provided statutory authorization and made permanent the veteran's fee waiver under the sbaexpress program , except during any upcoming fiscal year for which the president's budget , submitted to congress , includes a cost for the 7 ( a ) program , in its entirety , that is above zero .

the sba waived this fee in fy2016 , fy2017 , fy2018 , and is waiving this fee in fy2019 .

the act also increased the 7 ( a ) program's fy2015 authorization limit of $18.75 billion ( on disbursements ) to $23.5 billion .

p.l .

114-113 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $26.5 billion in fy2016 .

p.l .

114-223 , the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , authorized the sba to use funds from its business loan program account "to accommodate increased demand for commitments for [7 ( a ) ] general business loans" for the duration of the continuing resolution ( initially december 9 , 2016 , later extended by p.l .

114-254 , the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 , to april 28 , 2017 ) .

during the 115 th congress , the sba waived the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee for 7 ( a ) loans of $125,000 or less approved in fy2018 as a means to encourage the demand for smaller 7 ( a ) loans .

waived 50% of the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee on all non - sbaexpress 7 ( a ) loans to veterans of $125,001 to $350,000 in fy2018 .

is waiving the annual service fee for 7 ( a ) loans of $150,000 or less made to small businesses located in a rural area or a hubzone and reducing the up - front one - time guaranty fee for these loans from 2.0% to 0.6667% of the guaranteed portion of the loan in fy2019 .

in addition p.l .

115-31 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 , increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $27.5 billion in fy2017 and p.l .

115-141 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 , increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $29.0 billion in fy2018 .

p.l .

115-189 , the small business 7 ( a ) lending oversight reform act of 2018 , among other provisions , codified the sba's office of credit risk management ; required that office to annually undertake and report the findings of a risk analysis of the 7 ( a ) program's loan portfolio ; created a lender oversight committee within the sba ; authorized the director of the office of credit risk management to undertake informal and formal enforcement actions against 7 ( a ) lenders under specified conditions ; redefined the credit elsewhere requirement ; and authorized the sba administrator to increase the amount of 7 ( a ) loans not more than once during any fiscal year to not more than 115% of the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit .

the sba is required to provide at least 30 days' notice of its intent to exceed the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization limit to the house and senate committees on small business and the house and senate committees on appropriations' subcommittees on financial services and general government and may exercise this option only once per fiscal year .

p.l .

115-232 , the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , included provisions originally in h.r .

5236 , the main street employee ownership act of 2018 , to make 7 ( a ) loans more accessible to employee - owned small businesses ( esops ) and cooperatives .

the act clarified that 7 ( a ) loans to esops may be made under the preferred lenders program ; allows the seller to remain involved as an officer , director , or key employee when the esop or cooperative has acquired 100% ownership of the small business ; and authorizes the sba to finance transition costs to employee ownership and waive any mandatory equity injection by the esop or cooperative to help finance the change of ownership .

the act also directs the sba to create outreach programs and an interagency working group to promote lending to esops and cooperatives .

president trump's fy2019 budget request included proposals to offset sba business loan administrative costs by , among other provisions , ( 1 ) allowing the sba to set the 7 ( a ) program's annual servicing fee at rates below zero credit subsidy ; ( 2 ) increasing the 7 ( a ) loan program's fy2019 annual servicing fee's cap from 0.55% to 0.625% ; and ( 3 ) increasing the fy2019 upfront loan guarantee fee on 7 ( a ) loans over $1 million by 0.25% .

the trump administration estimated that these changes would raise $93 million in additional revenue .

the trump administration also requested that the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization limit be increased to $30.0 million in fy2019 ; that the sba be allowed to further increase the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization amount in fy2019 by 15% under specified circumstances "to better equip the sba to meet peaks in demand while continuing to operate at zero subsidies" ; and that the sbaexpress program's loan limit be increased from $350,000 to $1 million .

during the 116 th congress p.l .

116-6 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 , increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $30.0 billion in fy2019 .

this report's appendix provides a brief description of the 7 ( a ) program's sbaexpress , export express , and community advantage programs .

congress authorized several changes to the 7 ( a ) program during the 111 th congress in an effort to increase the number and amount of 7 ( a ) loans .

congress did not approve any changes to the 7 ( a ) program during the 112 th congress .

however , several bills were introduced during the 112 th congress that would have changed the program .

s. 1828 , a bill to increase small business lending , and for other purposes , was introduced on november 8 , 2011 , and referred to the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship .

the bill would have reinstated for a year following the date of its enactment the temporary fee subsidies for the 7 ( a ) and 504 / cdc loan guaranty programs and the 90% loan guaranty for standard 7 ( a ) loans , which were originally authorized by arra and later extended by several laws , including the small business jobs act of 2010 .

h.r .

2936 , the small business administration express loan extension act of 2011 , introduced on september 15 , 2011 , and referred to the house committee on small business , would have extended a one - year increase in the maximum loan amount for the sbaexpress program from $350,000 to $1 million for an additional year .

the temporary increase in that program's maximum loan amount was authorized by p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 , and expired on september 27 , 2011 ( see appendix ) .

s. 532 , the patriot express authorization act of 2011 , introduced on march 9 , 2011 , and referred to the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship , would have provided statutory authorization for the patriot express pilot program .

this program was subsequently discontinued by the sba on december 31 , 2013 .

the bill would have increased the program's maximum loan amount from $500,000 to $1 million , and it would have increased the guaranty percentages from up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% of loans exceeding $150,000 to up to 85% of loans of $500,000 or less and up to 80% of loans exceeding $500,000 .

h.r .

2451 , the strengthening entrepreneurs' economic development act of 2013 , was introduced on june 20 , 2013 , and referred to the house committee on small business .

it would have authorized the sba to make direct loans of up to $150,000 to businesses with fewer than 20 employees .

it would have also required the sba to assess , collect , and retain a fee with respect to the outstanding balance of the deferred participation share of each 7 ( a ) loan in excess of $2 million that is no more than is necessary to reduce to zero the sba's cost of making the loan .

h.r .

2461 , the sba loan paperwork reduction act of 2013 , was introduced on june 20 , 2013 , and referred to the house committee on small business .

it would have provided statutory authorization for the small loan advantage ( sla ) pilot program .

the sba started that program on february 15 , 2011 .

it provided a streamlined application process for 7 ( a ) loans of up to $350,000 if the loan received an acceptable credit score from the sba prior to the loan being submitted for processing .

the sba adopted the sla application process as the model for processing all non - express 7 ( a ) loans of $350,000 or less , effective january 1 , 2014 .

as mentioned previously , the obama administration waived the up - front , one time loan guaranty fee and ongoing servicing fee for 7 ( a ) loans of $150,000 or less approved in fy2014 ( and later extended the fee waiver in fy2015 and fy2016 ) .

h.r .

2462 , the small business opportunity acceleration act of 2013 , introduced on june 20 , 2013 , and referred to the house committee on small business , would have made the fee waiver permanent .

also , the obama administration waived the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee for veteran loans under the sbaexpress program ( up to $350,000 ) from january 1 , 2014 , through the end of fy2015 ( called the veterans advantage program ) .

s. 2143 , the veterans entrepreneurship act , would have authorized this fee waiver and made it permanent .

also , p.l .

113-235 provided statutory authorization to waive the 7 ( a ) sbaexpress program's guarantee fee for veterans ( and their spouse ) in fy2015 .

p.l .

114-38 , the veterans entrepreneurship act of 2015 , authorized and made permanent the waiver of the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee for veterans ( and their spouse ) in the sbaexpress program beginning on or after october 1 , 2015 , except during any upcoming fiscal year for which the president's budget , submitted to congress , includes a cost for the 7 ( a ) program , in its entirety , that is above zero .

the act also increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit from $18.75 billion in fy2015 to $23.5 billion .

on june 25 , 2015 , the sba informed congress that the 7 ( a ) program "is on track to hit its authorization ceiling of $18.75 billion well before the end of fy2015. .

the sba indicated that "our activity and trend analysis reveal a strong uptick that , if sustained , would exceed our lending authority ceiling by late august. .

if that were to occur , and in the absence of statutory authority to do otherwise , the sba reported that it would have to suspend 7 ( a ) loan making for the remainder of the fiscal year .

the sba requested an increase in the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization limit to $22.5 billion in fy2015 .

on july 23 , 2015 , citing "unprecedented demand," the sba suspended 7 ( a ) program lending .

the sba indicated that it would continue to process loan applications "up to the point of approval" and then place approved loans "into a queue awaiting the availability of program authority. .

loans would be released "once program authority became available due to congressional action or as a result of cancellations of loans previously approved this fiscal year. .

applications would then "be funded in the order they were approved by sba , with the exception that requests for increases to previously approved loans will be funded before applications for new loans. .

the sba resumed 7 ( a ) lending on july 28 , 2015 , following p.l .

114-38 's enactment .

in addition to increasing the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit for fy2015 , the act added requirements designed to ensure that sba loans do not displace private sector loans ( eg , the sba administrator may not guarantee a 7 ( a ) loan if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the lender depends upon the guarantied portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market , or if the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee is to allow the lender to exceed the lender's legal lending limit ) , and requires the sba to report , on a quarterly basis , specified 7 ( a ) program statistics to the house and senate committees on appropriations and small business .

these required statistics are designed to inform the committees of the sba's pace of 7 ( a ) lending , provide estimates concerning the date on which the program's authorization limit may be reached , and present information concerning early defaults and actions taken by the sba to combat early defaults .

as mentioned previously , p.l .

114-113 increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit from $23.5 billion in fy2015 to $26.5 billion for fy2016 .

in addition , p.l .

114-223 , the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , authorized the sba to use funds from its business loan program account "to accommodate increased demand for commitments for [7 ( a ) ] general business loans" for the duration of the continuing resolution ( initially december 9 , 2016 , later extended by p.l .

114-254 , the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 , to april 28 , 2017 ) .

in a related development , s. 2496 , the help small businesses access affordable credit act , introduced on february 2 , 2016 , would have authorized the sba administrator , with prior approval of the house and senate committees on appropriations , to make loans in an amount equal to not more than 110% of the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit if the demand for 7 ( a ) loans should exceed that limit .

the obama administration also requested authorization to allow the sba administrator to continue to issue loans should the demand for 7 ( a ) loans exceed the program's authorization limit .

also .

s. 2992 , the small business lending oversight act of 2016 , would have required the director of the sba's office of credit risk management ( ocrm ) to impose penalties on 7 ( a ) lenders who "knowingly and repeatedly" undertake specified activities ; required the sba to annually undertake and report the findings of a risk analysis of the 7 ( a ) program's loan portfolio ; redefined the credit elsewhere requirement ; authorized fees to be used to support ocrm operations ; required the sba to identify potential loan risks by lenders participating in the preferred lenders program by requiring the sba , at the end of each year , to "calculate the percentage of loans in a lender's portfolio made without a contribution of borrower equity when the loan's purpose was to establish a new small business concern , to effectuate a change of small business ownership , or to purchase real estate" ; and , among other provisions , prohibited the sba from approving any loan if its financing is more than 100% of project costs .

legislation was also introduced ( s. 2125 , the small business lending and economic inequality reduction act of 2015 ) to provide permanent , statutory authorization for the community advantage pilot program ( see appendix ) .

the sba announced on december 28 , 2015 , that it was extending the community advantage pilot program through march 31 , 2020 .

it had been set to expire on march 15 , 2017 .

recognizing that 7 ( a ) loan approvals during the first half of fy2017 were about 9% higher than during the first half of fy2016 , congress included a provision in p.l .

115-31 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 , that increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $27.5 billion in fy2017 from $26.5 billion in fy2016 .

congress also approved legislation ( p.l .

115-141 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ) that increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $29.0 billion in fy2018 .

in addition , as mentioned earlier , p.l .

115-189 , the small business 7 ( a ) lending oversight reform act of 2018 , among other provisions , codified the sba's office of credit risk management ; required that office to annually undertake and report the findings of a risk analysis of the 7 ( a ) program's loan portfolio ; created a lender oversight committee within the sba ; authorized the director of the office of credit risk management to undertake informal and formal enforcement actions against 7 ( a ) lenders under specified conditions ; redefined the credit elsewhere requirement ; and authorized the sba administrator to increase the amount of 7 ( a ) loans not more than once during any fiscal year to not more than 115% of the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit .

the sba is required to provide at least 30 days' notice of its intent to exceed the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization limit to the house and senate committees on small business and the house and senate committees on appropriations' subcommittees on financial services and general government and may exercise this option only once per fiscal year .

also , p.l .

115-232 , the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , included provisions to make 7 ( a ) loans more accessible to employee - owned small businesses ( esops ) and cooperatives .

the act authorizes the sba to make "back - to - back" loans to esops to better align with industry practices ( the loan proceeds must only be used to make a loan to a qualified employee trust ) ; clarifies that 7 ( a ) loans to esops may be made under the preferred lenders program ; allows the seller to remain involved as an officer , director , or key employee when the esop or cooperative has acquired 100% ownership of the small business ; and authorizes the sba to finance transition costs to employee ownership and waive any mandatory equity injection by the esop or cooperative to help finance the change of ownership .

the act also directs the sba to create outreach programs with small business investment companies and microloan intermediaries to make their lending programs more accessible to all eligible esops and cooperatives , an interagency working group to promote lending to esops and cooperatives , and a small business employee ownership and cooperatives promotion program , administered by small business development centers , to offer technical assistance and training to small businesses on the transition to employee ownership through cooperatives and esops .

congress did not focus much attention on the trump administration's proposal in its fy2019 budget request to "introduce counter - cyclical policies in sba's business guaranty loan programs and update certain fees structures to offset $155 million in business loan administration. .

as mentioned earlier , the proposal included raising $93 million in additional revenue by allowing the sba to set the 7 ( a ) program's annual servicing fee at rates below zero credit subsidy ; increasing the 7 ( a ) loan program's fy2019 annual servicing fee's cap from 0.55% to 0.625% ; and increasing the fy2019 upfront loan guarantee fee on 7 ( a ) loans over $1 million by 0.25% .

the administration also requested that the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization limit be increased to $30.0 million in fy2019 ; that the sba be allowed to further increase the 7 ( a ) loan program's authorization amount in fy2019 by 15% under specified circumstances "to better equip the sba to meet peaks in demand while continuing to operate at zero subsidies ; " that the sba be allowed to impose an annual fee , not to exceed 0.05% per year , of the outstanding balance on 7 ( a ) secondary market trust certificates to help offset administrative costs ; and that the sbaexpress program's loan limit be increased from $350,000 to $1 million .

p.l .

116-6 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 , increased the 7 ( a ) program's authorization limit to $30.0 billion in fy2019 .

the congressional debate concerning the sba's 7 ( a ) program during the 111 th congress was not whether the federal government should act , but which federal policies would most likely enhance small businesses' access to capital and result in job retention and creation .

as a general proposition , some members of congress argued that the sba should be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start , continue , or expand operations with the expectation that in so doing small businesses will create jobs .

others worried about the long - term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit .

they advocated business tax reduction , reform of financial credit market regulation , and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to help small businesses further economic growth and job creation .

in terms of specific program changes , increasing the 7 ( a ) program's loan limit , extending the 7 ( a ) program's temporary fee subsidies and 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage , and establishing an alternative size standard for the 7 ( a ) program were all designed to achieve the same goal: to enhance job creation by increasing the ability of 7 ( a ) borrowers to access credit at affordable rates .

however , determining how specific changes in federal policy are most likely to enhance job creation is a challenging task .

for example , a 2008 urban institute study concluded that differences in the term , interest rate , and amount of sba financing were "not significantly associated with increasing sales or employment among firms receiving sba financing. .

the study also reported that the analysis accounted for less than 10% of the variation in firm performance .

the urban institute suggested that local economic conditions , local zoning regulations , state and local tax rates , state and local business assistance programs , and the business owner's charisma or business acumen also "may play a role in determining how well a business performs after receipt of sba financing. .

as the urban institute study suggests , because many factors influence business success , measuring the 7 ( a ) program's effect on job retention and creation is complicated .

that task is made even more challenging by the absence of performance - oriented measures that could serve as a guide .

both gao and the sba's oig have recommended that the sba adopt outcome performance - oriented measures for its loan guaranty programs , such as tracking the number of borrowers who remain in business after receiving a loan to measure the extent to which the program contributed to their ability to stay in business .

other performance - oriented measures that congress might also consider include requiring the sba to survey 7 ( a ) borrowers to measure the difficulty they experienced in obtaining a loan from the private sector and the extent to which the 7 ( a ) loan or technical assistance received contributed to their ability to create jobs or expand their scope of operations .

the 7 ( a ) program has several specialized programs that offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for particular groups of borrowers , including the sbaexpress , export express , and community advantage programs .

lenders must be approved by the sba for participation in these programs .

sbaexpress program the sbaexpress program was established as a pilot program by the sba on february 27 , 1995 , and made permanent through legislation , subject to reauthorization , in 2004 ( p.l .

108-447 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ) .

the program is designed to increase the availability of credit to small businesses by permitting lenders to use their existing documentation and procedures in return for receiving a reduced sba guaranty on loans .

it provides a 50% loan guaranty on loan amounts up to $350,000 .

as shown in table a - 1 , the sba approved 27,794 sbaexpress loans ( 46.1% of total 7 ( a ) program loan approvals ) , totaling $1.98 billion ( 7.8% of total 7 ( a ) program amount approvals ) in fy2018 .

the program's higher loan amount in fy2011 was due , at least in part , to a provision in p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 , which temporarily increased the sbaexpress program's loan limit to $1 million for one year following enactment ( through september 27 , 2011 ) .

during the 112 th congress , h.r .

2936 , the small business administration express loan extension act of 2011 , would have extended the sbaexpress program's higher loan limit for an additional year ( through september 27 , 2012 ) .

sbaexpress loan proceeds can be used for the same purposes as those of the 7 ( a ) program ( expansion , renovation , new construction , the purchase of land or buildings , the purchase of equipment , fixtures , and lease - hold improvements , working capital , to refinance debt for compelling reasons , seasonal line of credit , and inventory ) ; except that participant debt restructure cannot exceed 50% of the project and may be used for revolving credit .

the program's loan terms are the same as those of the 7 ( a ) program ( the loan maturity for working capital , machinery , and equipment ( not to exceed the life of the equipment ) is typically 5 years to 10 years ; and the loan maturity for real estate is up to 25 years , except that the term for a revolving line of credit cannot exceed 7 years .

the sbaexpress loan's interest rates and fees are the same as those used for the 7 ( a ) program .

to account for the program's lower guaranty rate of 50% , lenders are allowed to perform their own loan analysis and procedures and receive sba approval with a targeted 36-hour maximum turnaround time .

also , collateral is not required for loans of $25,000 or less .

lenders are allowed to use their own established collateral policy for loans over $25,000 .

as mentioned earlier , the sba waived the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee for 7 ( a ) loans of $125,000 or less approved in fy2018 .

the sba also waived 50% of the up - front , one - time loan guaranty fee on all non - sbaexpress 7 ( a ) loans to veterans of $125,001 to $350,000 in fy2018 .

in addition , p.l .

114-38 , the veterans entrepreneurship act of 2015 , provided statutory authorization and made permanent the veteran's fee waiver in the sbaexpress program , except during any upcoming fiscal year for which the president's budget , submitted to congress , includes a cost for the 7 ( a ) program , in its entirety , that is above zero .

the sba waived this fee in fy2016 , fy2017 , and fy2018 and is waiving it in fy2019 .

the sba indicated that its fee waivers for veterans are part "of sba's broader efforts to make sure that veterans have the tools they need to start and grow a business. .

in a related development , the sba discontinued the patriot express pilot program on december 31 , 2013 .

it provided loans of up to $500,000 ( with a guaranty of up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% of loans exceeding $150,000 ) to veterans and their spouses .

it had been in operation since 2007 , and , like the sbaexpress program , featured streamlined documentation requirements and expedited loan processing .

over its history , the patriot express pilot program disbursed 9,414 loans amounting to more than $791 million .

export express the export express program was established as a subprogram of the sbaexpress program in 1998 , and made a separate pilot program in 2000 .

it was made permanent through legislation , subject to reauthorization , in 2010 ( p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 ) .

the export express program is designed to increase the availability of credit to current and prospective small business exporters that have been in business , though not necessarily in exporting , for at least 12 full months , particularly those small businesses needing revolving lines of credit .

export express loans may not be used to finance overseas operations , except for the marketing or distribution of products or services exported from the united states .

the program is generally subject to the same loan processing , making , closing , servicing , and liquidation requirements as well as the same maturity terms , interest rates , and applicable fees as the sbaexpress program .

two key differences between the two programs is that the export express program's maximum loan amount is up to $500,000 , and its guaranty rate is 90% for loans of $350,000 or less , and 75% for loans exceeding $350,000 .

there were 215 lenders with approved sba export express loan guaranties at the end of fy2017 .

these lenders are located in 46 states , guam , and puerto rico .

as shown in table a - 2 , the sba approved 59 export express loans totaling $15.45 million in fy2018 .

community advantage 7 ( a ) loan initiative the sba's community advantage ( ca ) 7 ( a ) loan initiative became operational on february 15 , 2011 .

originally announced as a three - year pilot program ( through march 15 , 2014 ) , it subsequently was extended through march 15 , 2017 ; march 31 , 2020 ; and september 30 , 2022 .

as of september 12 , 2018 , there were 113 approved ca lenders , 99 of which were actively making and servicing ca loans .

the ca loan initiative is designed to increase lending to underserved low - and moderate - income communities .

it , along with the now - discontinued small loan advantage program , replaced the community express pilot program , which also was designed to increase lending to underserved communities .

the ca loan initiative provides the same loan terms , guaranty fees , and guaranty as that of the 7 ( a ) program on loan amounts up to $250,000 ( 85% for loans up to $150,000 and 75% for those greater than $150,000 ) .

loan proceeds can be used for the same purposes as those of the 7 ( a ) program .

the loan's maximum interest rate is prime , plus 6% .

the program has an expedited approval process , which includes a two - page application for borrowers and a goal of completing the approval process within 5 to 10 days .

the ca loan initiative is designed to increase "the number of sba 7 ( a ) lenders who reach underserved communities , targeting community - based , mission - focused financial institutions which were previously not able to offer sba loans. .

these mission - focused financial institutions include the following: nonfederally regulated community development financial institutions certified by the u.s. department of the treasury , sba's certified development companies , sba's nonprofit microlending intermediaries , and , added in december 2015 , sba's intermediary lending pilot program intermediaries .

they are expected to maintain at least 60% of their sba loan portfolio in underserved markets , including loans to small businesses in , or that have more than 50% of their full - time workforce residing in , low - to - moderate income ( lmi ) communities ; empowerment zones and enterprise communities ; hubzones ; start - ups ( firms in business less than two years ) ; businesses eligible for the sba's veterans advantage program ; promise zones ( added in december 2015 ) ; and opportunity zones and rural areas ( added in october 2018 ) .

the sba placed a moratorium , effective october 1 , 2018 , on accepting new ca lender applications , primarily as a means to mitigate the risk of future loan defaults .

the sba also increased the minimum acceptable credit score for ca loans "that satisfies the need to consider several required underwriting criteria" from 120 to 140 ; increased the wait time for ca lenders ineligible for delegated lender status at the time of approval as a ca lender from 6 months to 12 months and increased the number of ca loans that must be initially dispersed before a ca lender may process applications under delegated authority from five to seven loans ; increased the loan loss reserve requirement for ca loans sold in the secondary market from 3% to 5% of the outstanding amount of the guaranteed portion of each loan ; modified requirements related to the refinancing of debts with a ca loan ; limited fees that can be charged by a ca lender for assistance in obtaining a ca loan to no more than $2,500 , with the exception of necessary out - of - pocket costs such as filing or recording fees ; and as mentioned previously , added opportunity zones and rural areas to the list of economically distressed communities that are eligible for a ca loan .

as shown in table a - 3 , the sba approved 1,118 ca loans amounting to $157.5 million in fy2018 and 4,906 ca loans amounting to $643.72 million from the time the program became operational to the end of fy2018 .

as mentioned previously , legislation was introduced during the 114 th congress ( s. 2125 , the small business lending and economic inequality reduction act of 2015 ) to provide the community advantage pilot program permanent , statutory authorization .
