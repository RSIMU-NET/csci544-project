president obama's fy2012 budget request for energy and water development was released in february 2011 , but congress was concerned for the first months of the year with completing the appropriations cycle for fy2011 .

a continuing resolution for the rest of the fiscal year , p.l .

112-10 , was signed by the president april 15 , 2011 .

on june 2 , 2011 , the house appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development approved a bill that would have appropriated $30.634 billion for these programs , compared to the $36.505 billion in the president's request .

the full house appropriations committee voted the bill out june 15 ( h.r .

2354 ) .

after considering numerous amendments and adopting 32 , the house passed the bill july 15 by a vote of 219-196 .

on september 7 the senate appropriations committee reported out its version of h.r .

2354 ( s.rept .

112-75 ) , funding the programs at $31.626 billion .

on october 4 the house agreed to a senate - passed version of h.r .

2608 , the continuing appropriations act , 2012 , funding government programs at the fy2011 level through november 18 .

the bill earlier had emergency funding for the corps and the federal energy management administration ( fema ) , but that was deleted when agreement could not be reached over whether funding should be offset .

the issue of offsets emerged again in consideration of h.r .

2354 , in which the house bill offset emergency corps funding and the senate bill did not .

after several more short - term continuing resolutions , the house on december 16 and senate on december 17 passed the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( h.r .

2055 , p.l .

112-74 ) , including $32.010 billion for energy and water development programs in division b .

emergency funding of $1.724 billion for the corps was included , without offsets , in a stand - alone bill ( h.r .

3672 , p.l .

112-77 ) that passed on the same days .

 table 1 indicates the status of the fy2012 funding legislation .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2005 to fy2012 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the bill's four titles .

it also lists the total of several scorekeeping adjustments tables 4 through 15 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2011-fy2012 .

accompanying these tables is a discussion of the key issues involved in the major programs in the four titles .

for the department of energy , p.l .

112-10 did not spell out detailed funding for many subprograms for fy2011 .

however , the house report for the fy2012 bill , h.r .

2354 , did give funding levels for fy2011 , and that report is the source for the detailed discussion of programs in title iii .

the energy and water development bill provides funding for the civil program of the u.s. army corps of engineers , an agency in the department of defense with both military and civilian responsibilities .

under its civil works program , the corps plans , builds , operates , and maintains a wide range of water resources facilities .

the corps attracts congressional attention because its projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects , in addition to their water resource development purposes .

a number of recent changes have affected corps appropriations , including earmark moratoriums in both houses in the 112 th congress , reductions in funding from previous years , and the drawdown of the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) and other supplemental funding .

additionally , flooding events in the spring and summer of 2011 on the mississippi and missouri rivers and in other areas may strain the financial resources of the corps .

in most years , the president's budget request for the army corps of engineers is below the agency's final appropriation .

enacted appropriations for fy2011 continued this trend .

in contrast to the reductions enacted for most other agencies , the corps received an increase in total funding compared to the president's request .

before accounting for rescissions of prior year funds , the fy2011 appropriation for the corps was $5.055 billion , or $174 million more than the president's request .

the fy2012 president's request again proposed reductions from the amount enacted by congress in the previous fiscal year .

the president's budget requested $4.573 billion for the corps , a significant decrease from the fy2011 enacted level .

the house - passed bill included $4.763 billion for the corps , an increase of $189 million from the president's budget .

the house also recommended an additional $1.029 billion in emergency supplemental funding for emergency flood - fighting activities .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $4.864 billion for the corps , and an additional $1.044 billion in emergency supplemental funding .

the final enacted bill provided $5.002 billion , and a separate bill ( p.l .

112-77 ) provided an additional $1.724 billion in supplemental funding .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs , as well as programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics .

the fy2011 appropriations act , p.l .

112-10 , funded doe programs at $25.6 billion .

for fy2012 , the obama administration requested $30.7 billion for doe programs .

the house bill , h.r .

2354 , would have funded doe at $24.7 billion .

the senate version of h.r .

2354 would have provided $25.5 billion for doe programs .

the final bill , p.l .

112-74 , appropriated $25.7 billion .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) requested $1.038 billion for fy2012 ( including $10.9 million for the inspector general's office ) , nearly the same as the fy2011 funding level .

the house fy2012 energy and water bill would have provided an additional $10 million , while the senate appropriations committee approved the full request .

the final bill also provided the full request of $1.038 billion , without the extra $10 million approved by the house .

major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users .

the nrc budget request included $279.5 million for new reactor activities , a $12.5 million increase from fy2010 , largely to handle new nuclear power plant license applications .

until 2007 , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s .

however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities and other generating companies to apply for licenses for 30 new reactors , although several license applicants have suspended work on their projects .

nrc's proposed fy2012 budget included no funds for licensing doe's previously planned yucca mountain nuclear waste repository .

because the obama administration wants to cancel the yucca mountain project and filed a motion to withdraw the license application on march 3 , 2010 , the nrc's fy2011 appropriation was used to close out its licensing activities .

the fy2012 house bill included $20 million ( including $10 million added in a floor amendment ) for nrc "to continue the yucca mountain license application" and would have prohibited nrc funds from being used to halt the licensing process unless nrc approved doe's license withdrawal motion .

no funding for yucca mountain licensing was included in the senate appropriations committee bill or in the final bill .

in response to controversy over actions by nrc chairman gregory jaczko to halt the yucca mountain licensing process , the final bill included a provision ( ยง401 ) that prohibits the nrc chairman from terminating "any program , project , or activity" without a majority vote by the nrc commission .

a majority commission vote would also be required to reprogram funds that were specifically included in the bill .

for regulation of operating reactors , nrc's fy2012 budget request included $521.3 million , $20.5 million below the fy2010 level .

those activities include reactor safety inspections , license renewals and modifications , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises .

the fukushima accident , which occurred about a month after the fy2012 budget request was submitted , increased congressional and public concern about the safety of u.s. nuclear power plants .

nrc established a task force 10 days after the accident to conduct short - and long - term reviews of nrc's regulatory system and report to the commission every 30 days for three months with recommendations for improvement .

the senate appropriations committee directed nrc to contract with the national academy of sciences ( nas ) to conduct a study of lessons learned from the fukushima accident , including the safety and security of spent fuel storage .

the conferees directed nrc to transfer $2 million to nas for the fukushima study .

the senate committee had also urged nrc to determine whether stronger preparations are needed for severe accidents , "especially with regard to seismic and flooding events. .

the final bill included a provision ( ยง402 ) requiring nrc to order nuclear power plants to re - evaluate seismic , flooding , and other external hazards at each site to determine whether the plants could adequately handle such events .

the conferees also directed that post - fukushima safety recommendations by the nrc task force be implemented "consistent with , or more expeditiously than , the 'schedules and milestones' proposed by nrc staff on october 3 , 2011. .

the final bill included $15 million for university education programs related to nrc's mission , including $5 million for general support of nuclear science and engineering research .

the energy policy act of 2005 permanently extended a requirement that 90% of nrc's budget be offset by fees on licensees .

not subject to the offset are expenditures from the nuclear waste fund to pay for waste repository licensing , spending on general homeland security , and doe defense waste oversight .

the offsets in the fy2012 request would result in a net appropriation of $128.6 million , an $8.4 million decrease from fy2011 .

offsets in the house bill would have resulted in a net appropriation of $147.6 million .

the final bill approved the net appropriation in the administration's budget request .
