with 33 countriesâranging from the caribbean nation of st. kitts and nevis , one of the world's smallest states , to the south american giant of brazil , the world's fifth - largest countryâthe latin american and caribbean region has made significant advances over the past four decades in terms of both political and economic development .

 ( see figure 1 and table 2 for a map and basic facts on the region's countries. ) .

significant challenges remain , however , and some countries have experienced setbacks , most prominently venezuela ( which has descended into dictatorship ) .

in the early 1980s , authoritarian regimes governed 16 latin american and caribbean countries , both on the left and the right .

today , three countries in the regionâcuba , nicaragua , and venezuelaâare ruled by authoritarian governments .

most governments in the region today are elected democracies .

although free and fair elections have become the norm , recent elections in several countries have been controversial and contested .

in 2019 , argentina , dominica , el salvador , panama , and uruguay held successful free and fair elections .

guatemala held two presidential election rounds in june and august 2019 that international observers judged to be successful , but the elections suffered because several popular candidates were disqualified from the race on dubious grounds .

in bolivia , severe irregularities in the conduct of the country's october 2019 presidential elections ignited protests and violence that led to the resignation of incumbent president evo morales , who was seeking a fourth term ; new elections under an interim president are now scheduled for may 2020 .

most recently , guyana held elections on march 2 , 2020 , which were marred by allegations of fraud ; final results are on hold pending court action regarding the final verification of some votes .

six other caribbean countries are scheduled to hold elections in 2020 ( see text box " 2020 elections " ) .

despite significant improvements in political rights and civil liberties since the 1980s , many countries in the region still face considerable challenges .

in a number of countries , weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services , ensure accountability and transparency , advance the rule of law , and ensure citizen safety and security .

there are numerous examples of elected presidents who have left office early amid severe social turmoil and economic crises , the presidents' own autocratic actions contributing to their ouster , or high - profile corruption .

in addition to morales's resignation in 2019 , corruption scandals either caused or contributed to several presidents' resignations or removals of several presidentâguatemala in 2015 , brazil in 2016 , and peru in 2018 .

although the threat of direct military rule has dissipated , civilian governments in several countries have turned to their militaries or retired officers for support or during crises , raising concerns among some observers .

most recently , in el salvador on february 9 , 2020 , president nayib bukele used the military in an effort to intimidate the country's legislature into approving an anti - crime bill ; the action elicited strong criticism in el salvador and abroad , with concerns centered on the politicization of the military and the separation of powers .

the quality of democracy has eroded in several countries over the past several years .

the economist intelligence unit's ( eiu's ) 2019 democracy index shows a steady regional decline in democratic practices in latin america since 2017 .

several years ago only cuba was viewed as an authoritarian regime , but venezuela joined its ranks in 2017 as president nicolã¡s maduro's government violently repressed the political opposition .

nicaragua turned to authoritarian practices in 2018 under long - time president daniel ortega , as the government violently repressed protests .

the continued regional downward trend in 2019 stemmed from bolivia's post - election crisis and to a lesser extent by setbacks in the following other countries: guatemala , where the government ousted the anti - corruption body known as the international commission against impunity in guatemala ; haiti , which experienced widespread anti - government protests against corruption and deteriorating economic conditions ; and guyana , with the delay of elections following a no - confidence vote by the legislature .

public satisfaction with how democracy is operating has declined along with the quality of democracy in the region .

according to the 2018 / 2019 americasbarometer public opinion survey , the percentage of individuals satisfied with how democracy was working in their countries averaged 39.6% among 18 countries in the region , the lowest level of satisfaction since the poll began in 2004 .

given these trends , the eruption of social protests in many countries around the region in 2019 is unsurprising , but in each country a unique set of circumstances has sparked the protests .

in addition to the protests in bolivia and haiti cited above , protests broke out in ecuador over fuel price increases , in chile over pent - up frustration over social inequities , and in colombia over opposition to a range of government policies and proposals , from tax reform to education to peace accord implementation .

although each country is unique , several broad political and economic factors appear to be driving the decline in satisfaction with democracy in the region .

political factors include an increase in authoritarian practices , weak democratic institutions and politicized judicial systems , corruption , high levels of crime and violence , and organized crime that can infiltrate or influence state institutions .

economic factors include declining or stagnant regional economic growth rates over the past several years , high levels of income inequality in many latin american countries , increased poverty , and the inadequacy of social safety net programs or advancement opportunities , along with increased pressure on the region's previously expanding middle class .

beginning around 2015 , the global decline in commodity prices significantly affected the region , as did china's economic slowdown and its reduced appetite for imports from the region in 2015 and 2016 ( see table 1 ) .

according to the international monetary fund ( imf ) , the region experienced an economic contraction of 0.6% in 2016 , dragged down by recessions in argentina and brazil , as well as by venezuela's severe economic deterioration as oil prices fell .

since then , the region has registered only marginal growth rates , including an estimated growth rate of 0.2% in 2019 .

regional growth in 2019 was suppressed by the collapse of much of the venezuelan economy , which contracted 35% , and by continued recession in argentina , which suffered an economic contraction of 3.1% .

the current imf 2020 outlook is for regional growth to reach 1.6% , led by recovery in brazil and spurred by growth forecasts of 3% or higher for chile , colombia , and peru .

the economic fallout from the current coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) outbreak , which already is having repercussions around the world , could jeopardize this forecast .

even before the onset of the coronavirus , recession was forecasted to continue in several countries , including argentina and venezuela , with contractions of 1.3% and 10% respectively .

the risk of social unrest similar to that experienced in 2019 could also constrain growth in some countries .

despite some easing of income inequality in the region from 2002 to 2014 , reductions in income inequality have slowed since 2015 ; latin america remains the most unequal region in the world in terms of income inequality , according to the united nations ( u.n. ) economic commission for latin america and the caribbean .

the level of poverty in the region also has increased over the past five years .

in 2014 , 27.8% of the region's population lived in poverty ; that figure increased to 30.8% by 2019 .

u.s. interests in latin america and the caribbean are diverse and include economic , political , security , and humanitarian concerns .

geographic proximity has ensured strong economic linkages between the united states and the region , with the united states being a major trading partner and source of foreign investment for many latin american and caribbean countries .

free - trade agreements ( ftas ) have augmented u.s. economic relations with 11 countries in the region .

the western hemisphere is a large source of u.s. immigration , both legal and illegal ; geographic proximity and economic and security conditions are major factors driving migration trends .

curbing the flow of illicit drugs from latin america and the caribbean has been a key component of u.s. relations with the region and a major interest of congress for more than four decades .

the flow of illicit drugs , including heroin , methamphetamine , and fentanyl from mexico and cocaine from colombia , poses risks to u.s. public health and safety ; and the trafficking of such drugs has contributed to violent crime and gang activities in the united states .

since 2000 , colombia has received u.s. counternarcotics support through plan colombia and its successor programs .

in addition , for over a decade , the united states sought to forge close partnerships with other countries to combat drug trafficking and related violence and advance citizen security .

these efforts include the mã©rida initiative begun in 2007 to support mexico , the central america regional security initiative ( carsi ) begun in 2008 , and the caribbean basin security initiative ( cbsi ) begun in 2009 .

another long - standing component of u.s. policy has been support for strengthened democratic governance and the rule of law .

as described in the previous section , although many countries in the region have made enormous strides in terms of democratic political development , several face considerable challenges .

u.s. policy efforts have long supported democracy promotion efforts , including support for strengthening civil society and promoting the rule of law and human rights .

congress has begun to consider the trump administration's fy2021 $1.4 billion foreign aid budget request for the region .

the 18% cut in overall funding compared to fy2019 foreign aid levels masks large cuts , ranging from 30-60% , for some countries and programs .

in particular , the trump administration's linkage of aid to central america to reductions in unauthorized migration from the region could be an area of contention with congress as could the administration's large increase in assistance to support a democratic transition in venezuela that has yet to happen .

on trade issues , the 116 th congress may consider whether to extend a tariff preference program for certain caribbean countries , the cbtpaâwhich expires in september 2020âand the broader gsp for developing countries worldwide , which expires in december 2020 .

looking ahead through 2020 , the latin america and caribbean region faces significant challengesâmost prominently , venezuela's ongoing political impasse and economic and humanitarian crisis , which has resulted in some 4 million venezuelan refugees and migrants in the region .

upcoming elections in bolivia in may 2020 are expected to be an important test of the country's political system in the aftermath of president morales's resignation following protests ignited by widespread electoral fraud in october 2019 .

social protests racked many latin american countries in late 2019 , and such unrest could continue in 2020 given that many of the underlying conditions still exist .

these challenges and the appropriate u.s. policy responses may remain oversight issues for congress .

other areas of congressional oversight and interest may include the ongoing difficult political situations in haiti and nicaragua , efforts to stem drug trafficking from south america , appropriate strategies to curb the flow of migrants from central america , and u.s. policy toward cuba .
