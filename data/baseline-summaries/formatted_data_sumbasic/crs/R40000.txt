an fy2009 omnibus appropriations act , p.l .

111-8 , was enacted on march 11 , 2009 , more than five months after the beginning of the fiscal year .

a continuing resolution had funded operations from october 1 , 2008 , until the omnibus was enacted .

in addition , two supplemental appropriations bills for fy2009 have been enacted during the 111 th congress: p.l .

111-5 in february 2009 ( the american recovery and reinvestment act , arra ) and p.l .

111-32 in june 2009 ( the supplemental appropriations act ) .

the regular agriculture and related agencies appropriation in the fy2009 omnibus totals $108.3 billion , up 19% from fy2008 .

this total is composed of $87.8 billion in mandatory appropriations ( up 21% , mostly because of rising food stamp demand ) , and $20.4 billion of discretionary appropriations ( up 14% from fy2008 ) .

the arra supplemental provided $26.5 billion ( about 25% of the amount in a regular appropriation although outlays may occur over a multi - year period ) , mostly for domestic food assistance .

the second supplemental provided $771 million for international food aid and domestic farm loans .

the agriculture appropriations bill — formally known as the agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act — covers funding for the following agencies and departments: all of the u.s. department of agriculture ( except the forest service , which is funded by the interior appropriations bill ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services , and in the house , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) ; in the senate , cftc appropriations are handled by the financial services appropriations subcommittee .

jurisdiction for the appropriations bill rests with the house and senate committees on appropriations , particularly in each committee's subcommittee on agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies .

these committees are separate from the agricultural authorizing committees — the house committee on agriculture and the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry .

the fy2009 agriculture appropriations bill was marked up in the house subcommittee in june 2008 and reported by the senate full committee in july 2008 ( table 2 ) .

it did not reach the floor as a stand - alone bill in either chamber during the 110 th congress .

agencies affected by the bill were funded by continuing resolutions until march 11 , 2009 .

an omnibus appropriations bill , p.l .

111-8 , was enacted on march 11 , 2009 , near the beginning of the 111 th congress .

the agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill covers all of usda except for the forest service .

this amounts to about 94% of usda's total appropriation .

the forest service is funded through the interior appropriations bill .

the order of the following sections reflects the order that the agencies are listed in the agriculture appropriations bill .

see table 4 for more details on the amounts for specific agencies .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) regulates the safety of foods and cosmetics , and the safety and effectiveness of drugs , biologics ( eg , vaccines ) , and medical devices .

now a part of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , fda was originally housed in the department of agriculture .

the agriculture appropriations subcommittees retain jurisdiction over the fda budget .

fda's program level , the total amount that fda can spend , is composed of direct appropriations ( also referred to as budget authority ) and user fees .

the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ) , enacted five months into fy2009 , provided fda a total program level of $2.66 billion for fy2009 .

the total is within 1% of the administration's request ( $12 million less ) and 10% more than the total fy2008 program level .

 ( note: fda received no funding in the economic stimulus package , p.l .

111-5 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009. ) .

the fy2008 enacted appropriation in p.l .

110-161 plus the $150 million supplement to fda in p.l .

110-252 provided the agency with a total direct appropriation of $2.42 billion .

the president's request for fy2009 , as amended , was for $2.046 billion in direct appropriations ( 19% more than fy2008 ) .

the enacted fy2009 omnibus provided $2.051 billion in direct appropriations , including salaries & expenses ( $2.038 billion ) and building & facilities ( $12 million ) .

the senate - reported bill also would have provided $2.051 billion in direct appropriations .

for user fees , the enacted fy2009 omnibus included $613 million , including prescription drug ( pdufa ) , medical device ( mdufa ) , and animal drug ( adufa ) user fees ; export and color certification fees ; mammography quality standards act ( mqsa ) fees ; and newly authorized animal generic drug user fees ( agdufa ) .

the total fy2008 appropriation set fda's fy2008 user fee appropriation level at $549 million .

the fy2009 request included three categories of fees: continuing fee programs ; newly authorized fee programs ; and proposed fee programs .

for continuing programs , the request was $595 million ( $565 million for prescription drug , medical device , and animal drug fees ; and $30 million for mammography , and export and color certification fees ) , a 3% increase over fy2008 .

the fy2009 request included $14 million for the advisory review of direct - to - consumer ( dtc ) television advertisements for prescription drugs , a new fee program authorized by the fda amendments act of 2007 ( fdaaa , p.l .

110-85 ) .

this amount brought the total request for authorized fees to $609 million , which would have been 11% higher than the total fy2008 appropriation .

the budget justification documents included two sets of proposed fees , which would require authorization in law before appropriations could be made .

one set of proposed fees ( $21 million ) would provide revenue for fda to enhance the review of generic human and animal drugs ( the latter of which was subsequently authorized and included in fy2009 appropriations ) .

the administration categorized these as proposed definite appropriations and included the revenue in its fee total , which it presented as $630 million , 15% more than the total fy2008 appropriation .

the second set of proposed fees ( $27 million ) , labeled in the request as "mandatory fees — non - add" and not included in the request's user fee total , covered reinspection , and food and animal feed export certification .

the senate committee report did not include either set of proposed fees or the newly authorized fee program for dtc advertisement review .

the senate bill , therefore , included $595 million in total fees .

consistent with the administration and congressional committee formats , each program area budget amount in table 8 includes funding designated for the responsible fda center ( eg , center for drug evaluation and research or the center for food safety and applied nutrition ) and the portion of effort budgeted for the agency - wide office of regulatory affairs to commit to that program area .

table 8 also apportions user fee revenue across program areas as indicated in the administration's request ( eg , 89% of the animal drug user fee revenue is designated for the animal drugs and feeds program , with the rest going to headquarters and office of the commissioner , gsa rent , and other rent categories ) .

the enacted omnibus contained $343 million in specific budget authority increases , which are listed by program area , below .

the cftc is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets .

the cftc's functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges , registration and supervision of futures industry personnel , prevention of fraud and price manipulation , and investor protection .

although most futures trading is now related to financial variables ( interest rates , currency prices , and stock indexes ) , congressional oversight remains vested in the agriculture committees because of the market's historical origins as an adjunct to agricultural trade .

jurisdiction for cftc appropriations is split between different subcommittees in the house and senate , and placement in the enacted appropriation alternates between the chambers .

in the house , jurisdiction is with the agriculture appropriations subcommittee ; in the senate , it rests with the financial services and general government appropriations subcommittee .

cftc's fy2008 appropriation was enacted in the agriculture appropriations bill .

in fy2009 , its appropriation was enacted in the financial services appropriations bill .

for fy2009 , enacted funding was included in the financial services section of the omnibus appropriations act ( p.l .

111-8 ) .

the act provides $146.0 million for the cftc , an increase of 31% over fy2008 .

the administration had requested $130.0 million and the senate appropriations committee $157.0 million .

the house did not act separately on cftc funding since the agriculture appropriations bill was not reported out of committee .

the fy2009 increase was related to concerns over cftc's ability to monitor futures markets , particularly those in energy commodities .

of the amount for fy2009 , $34.7 million is to be available only after the agency has submitted an expenditure plan for fy2009 to the agriculture committees of the house and senate .
