beginning with adoption of the improving america's schools act ( iasa ) in 1994 ( p.l .

103-382 ) , and continuing through enactment of the education flexibility partnership act of 1999 ( p.l .

106-25 ) and the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb , p.l .

107-110 ) , the authorization of special forms of flexibility for grantees has been a major focus of most federal k - 12 education assistance legislation .

in particular , the nclb extended some flexibility authorities that had been established earlier , and initiated new ones .

this report provides an overview of these authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal k - 12 education programs .

it will be updated infrequently to incorporate major new developments in the implementation of these authorities or new information on their use and impact .

"flexibility" is defined for purposes of this report as authority under which federal program requirements , particularly restrictions on the use of federal aid , may be waived by , or on behalf of , state or local aid recipients meeting certain eligibility criteria .

in some cases , this flexibility is granted in return for meeting specified accountability requirements related to program outcomes .

such flexibility includes provisions for consolidation of multiple programs , or for transfer of funds among programs , so that federal assistance may be used for a broader range of activities or purposes than ordinarily would be allowed , as well as the authority to waive specified types of program requirements .

in general , these flexibility authorities apply to federal aid programs authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , the largest source of federal aid to k - 12 education .

in contrast , almost none of these authorities involve the second largest source of federal aid , the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) .

for this reason , as well as the existence of a number of issues regarding requirements and flexibility that are specific to that program , the idea will not be discussed further in this report , and discussions of federal involvement in k - 12 education in this report should be understood to apply to the esea and to exclude the idea .

esea programs are authorized through fy2008 , and the 110 th congress is considering whether to amend and extend the esea .

this report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments and available information .

this report begins with a review of the general nature of federal k - 12 education program requirements , including their sources , purposes , and the concerns expressed by some grantees about them .

this is followed by a description of the current special flexibility authorities under which many of these requirements may be waived or otherwise made inapplicable , along with an analysis of issues specific to individual authorities .

this section is divided between authorities initially adopted before the nclb and authorities initiated in that legislation .

the report concludes with an analysis of selected cross - cutting issues regarding these special flexibility authorities overall .

we begin this report with a brief review of the general types of program requirements applicable to esea and related federal k - 12 programs .

many of these requirements may be waived , in part or in whole , for some or all states and leas under the special flexibility authorities discussed later .

we refer to these as "accountability requirements" because they are intended to provide accountability by assuring that federal funds are used in ways that are consistent with the purposes of the federal statutes authorizing the programs .

typically , federal programs of aid to elementary and secondary education exhibit a mix of relatively specific and explicit requirements in such areas as eligibility of pupils to be served , allocation of funds , or ( increasingly ) outcomes , along with substantial flexibility in many other important respects , such as instructional methods or grade levels to be served .

federal k - 12 education programs generally focus upon one or more of the following: ( a ) student populations with special educational needs , such as disadvantaged or limited english proficient ( lep ) pupils ; ( b ) a specific aspect of instructional services , such as educational technology or recruitment and professional development of teachers ; ( c ) development , demonstration , and dissemination of innovative instructional approaches , such as charter schools or demonstrations of comprehensive school reform ; or ( d ) a specific subject area , such as instruction in math or science .

most of the larger federal programs , such as esea title i - a , fall into category ( a ) , while several programs of small to moderate size are in categories ( b ) - ( d ) .

almost all federal k - 12 education programs , in all of categories ( a ) - ( d ) , are sometimes referred to as "categorical" programs , because their focus is targeted or limited in one or more important respects .

in contrast , one esea program — the innovative programs authority of esea title v - a — provides support for such a broad range of activities that it is generally considered to be a "block grant" at the other end of the intergovernmental assistance spectrum .

prior to enactment of the nclb , several authorities were adopted that allow the waiver of many types of federal k - 12 program requirements by , or on behalf of , seas and leas .

each of them is limited with respect to either the types of requirements that can be waived , the specific esea and other programs affected , or the number of states or leas that are currently eligible .

some require waivers to be requested on a case - by - case basis , while others offer "blanket" waiver authority .

further , some of these authorities require some form of additional accountability in terms of pupil outcomes , while others do not .

in addition to two general types of waiver authorities , ed - flex and secretarial case - by - case waivers , a high degree of school - level flexibility in the use of funds under several federal programs is provided under the schoolwide program authority under esea title i - a , an exceptional range of flexibility in the use of funds is provided under the innovative programs block grant , and an authority for flexibility in small , rural leas was initially adopted as part of fy2001 appropriations legislation for ed .

these five types of special flexibility , which were initiated before adoption of the nclb of 2001 , are described below .

the succeeding section of this report discusses forms of flexibility initiated in the nclb .

note that in cases where a previously initiated special flexibility authority was significantly amended by the nclb , the current ( amended ) version is described below .

the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb ) , signed into law on january 8 , 2002 ( p.l .

107-110 ) , initiated a number of flexibility authorities for esea programs , which are described below .

the nclb also expanded and / or extended certain forms of flexibility which had been initiated earlier , such as lowering the eligibility threshold of esea title i - a schoolwide programs ; these nclb amendments were discussed above .

this report concludes with an analysis of selected cross - cutting issues that have arisen with respect to the special forms of flexibility described above .

we introduce this topic with a brief review of the common themes of both the new forms of flexibility included in the nclb , and the special flexibility authorities enacted previously .

in general , these flexibility authorities exhibit the following characteristics .

they increase the ability of states and / or leas to use federal aid funds more thoroughly in accordance with their own priorities ( which may or may not be consistent with federal priorities ) than would otherwise be possible .

each of the special flexibility authorities is significantly limited in terms of the number of states and leas that may participate , the number and size of the esea and related programs affected , and / or the range of program requirements that may be waived .

with the major exceptions of the transferability authority , the innovative programs block grant , and title i - a schoolwide programs , states and / or leas are allowed to waive a variety of federal program requirements in return for some degree of accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes .

however , the outcome accountability requirements are essentially just increased attention to , and / or consequences related to , outcome accountability requirements that are applicable to all states and leas participating in title i - a and other esea programs .

these special flexibility authorities , particularly those enacted as part of the nclb , have been adopted in a policy context of substantially increased accountability requirements and authorized degrees of flexibility in general for the esea and related federal programs .

at least one of the flexibility authorities adopted under the nclb has been utilized by an estimated 12-16% of all leas ( transferability ) , while interest in others has been very limited ( state - flex , local - flex ) .

however , reap flex is the most widely used flexibility authority among eligible small , rural leas .

the flexibility authorities often include a variety of requirements for regular reporting on ways in which the authorities have been used , and the impact of increased flexibility on pupil achievement .

however , there is very limited information regarding the specific impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement .

selected cross - cutting issues associated with these and other common characteristics of special flexibility authorities are discussed below .

the current flexibility authorities are restricted in many important respects , and it may be questioned whether they address the primary concerns of states and leas about restrictions on the use of federal funds or administrative burdens accompanying participation in federal programs .

while broad in terms of the potential uses of funds and federal programs covered , the esea title i - a schoolwide program authority is limited to the school level , and only schools with low - income pupil rates somewhat above average may generally qualify .

further , as noted earlier , the significance of this authority with respect to programs other than title i - a is quite limited .

the secretarial case - by - case waiver authorities are limited by the necessity of submitting individual requests to the u.s. secretary of education .

in most cases , leas must similarly apply to their seas for waivers under the ed - flex authority .

while almost all states and most leas may exercise the fund transferability authority , none may transfer more than 50% of the funds received under any program , and therefore all of the requirements associated with participating in any of the affected programs must still be met .

the rural lea flexibility authority is available to only a select group of exceptionally low - enrollment leas .

in addition , the amount of funds subject to state - flex authority is limited , and only seven states may participate .

local - flex authority affects only a limited range of programs and is available in a maximum of only 80 leas plus 28-70 leas in state - flex states .

the limited increase in flexibility provided by these authorities is a probable reason for the very low rate of participation in these authorities thus far .

importantly , there are several types of requirements that cannot be waived under any of these authorities , including those involving fiscal accountability , participation by private school pupils and staff , or the increasingly important esea title i - a requirements regarding standards , assessments , and school / lea accountability for pupil achievement .

it is noteworthy that many of the flexibility authorities do not include the largest esea program , title i - a , and none of them would allow states to reallocate funds among leas .

further , the authors of a 1999 government accountability office ( gao ) report ( elementary and secondary education: ed - flex states vary in implementation of waiver process .

hehs - 99-17 ) found that the flexibility authorities enacted as of that time do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and leas , which are associated with requirements under the idea , the americans with disabilities act , child nutrition program administration , and environmental requirements ( eg , underground storage tanks and asbestos removal ) .

according to this gao report , sea staff in some states think ed - flex is of limited value because of the relatively few programs and requirements that may be waived .

in contrast , sea staff in other states think its usefulness extends beyond specific use of the authority , through creating a "climate that encourages innovation and flexibility. .

these remarks would apply also to the new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 .

finally , it is significant that these authorities have been adopted during a period when "regular" federal program requirements have become more flexible in some important respects .

for programs such as esea title i - a , the increased emphasis on outcome accountability beginning in 1994 and continuing under the nclb has been accompanied by generally increased flexibility for all leas and schools in determining how funds may be used , especially in the schoolwide programs which have become the dominant service mode for this program .

the nclb consolidated major groups of programs related to teachers and educational technology , giving states and leas substantially greater flexibility in deciding how to use these funds .

in this context , the additional flexibility provided by the special authorities described above seems relatively marginal in many respects .

proponents of increased flexibility in federal education programs often argue that waivers can remove federal regulatory barriers to local educational reform and initiative .

very limited information is available on the use of the new forms of flexibility authorized under the nclb , partly because of low participation in some of them .

available information on waivers granted under pre - nclb authorities indicates that they have been used for relatively few purposes , at least some of which were not clearly related to innovation or reform .

in addition , several of the requirements which were frequently waived in the past were subsequently eliminated or made less restrictive for all states and leas by the nclb .

at the same time , the esea title ix - d authority has been used to allow a limited number of states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) under the esea title i - a accountability provisions , a widely supported modification of that program .

as was discussed above , a recent study prepared for ed found that under the two recently - adopted forms of flexibility authority that are widely used — reap flex and transferability — this authority was most often used to move funds out of esea title ii - a ( teacher and principal training and recruiting fund ) and , to a lesser extent , title iv - a ( safe and drug - free schools and communities ) , and most frequently into titles i - a ( education for the disadvantaged ) and v - a ( innovative programs block grant ) .

many leas reported using these authorities to partially compensate for reductions in formula grants under esea title i - a and v - a , to better target resources on schools failing to meet adequate yearly progress standards under title i - a , or to be able to use funds with the high degree of flexibility allowed under title v - a .

in the pre - nclb era , secretarial waivers , ed - flex and other pre - nclb flexibility authorities during the mid - to late - 1990s were most often used to waive the following requirements: ( 1 ) the minimum low - income pupil percentage threshold for esea title i - a schoolwide program eligibility ( before this was reduced under the nclb ) ; ( 2 ) within - lea targeting of title i - a funds on schools with the highest number or percentage of pupils from low - income families ; ( 3 ) deadlines for adoption and implementation of standards and assessments under esea title i - a ; and ( 4 ) a series of limitations on the use of funds under two pre - nclb programs related to teacher recruitment and training: the class size reduction ( csr ) and eisenhower professional development programs .

each of these categories is briefly discussed below .

although schoolwide programs offer a great deal of flexibility to use funds under not only title i - a but also most other federal programs in ways that might not ordinarily be allowed , it has been questioned whether schools with relatively low percentages of their pupils from low - income families should be granted this authority .

if schools with relatively low poverty rates receive permission to operate schoolwide programs , the scope of these programs might be limited ( since the size of a school's title i - a grant is based on its number of children from low - income families ) , and it would be difficult for such a modest program to have a significant schoolwide impact .

further , no systematic evidence is available that schoolwide programs are more effective than more traditional "targeted assistance" title i - a programs in improving the education of disadvantaged pupils .

the use of waivers to maintain or expand the number of schools participating in title i - a would tend to disperse title i - a funds among an increased number of relatively low - poverty schools , reducing the concentration of funds on high - poverty schools .

as noted above , ed - flex places restrictions on , but does not prohibit , waivers regarding esea title i - a school selection .

the use of waivers to delay meeting deadlines for implementing esea title i - a standard and assessment requirements arguably undercut the most substantial pre - nclb outcome accountability requirement .

this increasingly important aspect of federal requirements is discussed further below .

with respect to the former csr and eisenhower programs , leas and states frequently requested the waiver of requirements intended to: focus teacher hiring on the early elementary grades ; require small leas to form consortia if their csr grants were too small to pay the salary of a new teacher ; ensure that minimum shares of teacher training funds would be used to support instruction in the subject areas of mathematics and science ; or to limit the share of csr funds used for professional development ( as opposed to hiring new teachers ) .

such waivers appear generally to have been requested to accommodate relatively strict and specific limitations on the use of funds to varying local conditions .

following enactment of the nclb , some of these formerly common uses of ed - flex and other pre - nclb flexibility authorities are no longer as relevant as in the past .

as noted earlier , the nclb lowered the schoolwide program eligibility threshold to 40% of pupils from low - income families nationwide ( although some may still seek ed - flex or secretarial waivers for schools below 40% to conduct schoolwide programs ) .

the csr and eisenhower programs were consolidated into a broader and more flexible esea title ii program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training .

as noted earlier , relatively few substantive waivers have been grated under the esea title ix - d during the post - nclb era .

regarding the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement or other outcomes , only limited information has been available .

although states that received ed - flex authority have been required to submit annual reports to ed on waivers granted and their impact , the information reported by the original 12 ed - flex states ( under the pre - p.l .

106-25 authority ) was of limited value , and no reports have yet been published on the actual purposes of waivers or their effects in states under the ed - flex authority enacted in 1999 .

anecdotal information on the achievement effects of a number of ed - flex and secretarial waivers in a limited number of leas was included in a 1999 ed report ( waivers: flexibility to achieve high standards ) .

the information in this report was primarily limited to whether affected leas or schools met state ayp standards in effect at the time .

at the same time , supporters of special flexibility authorities often point to broader forms of evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems .

these arguments are reflected in a 1998 ed report on ed - flex , the authors of which concluded that ed - flex authority has supported standards - based reform in the affected states in three major ways: ed - flex "facilitates the coordination of programs and strengthens the planning process," by encouraging leas and schools to develop instructional programs without regard to the perceived constraints of many standard federal or state program requirements .

ed - flex "provides the opportunity for states to streamline the administration of programs" by reducing paperwork deemed unessential to meeting basic purposes of federal programs .

ed - flex "supports the use of resources in a way that can , together with the implementation of standards - based approaches , lead to increased student achievement and reduction in the gap in achievement between different populations" by shifting oversight focus away from inputs or procedures and toward outcomes .

given the limited amount of data showing improved pupil achievement outcomes in states , leas , or schools to which special forms of flexibility have been granted , the conclusions by ed ( immediately above ) should presumably be considered to be debatable .

this is related to a final aspect of this set of issues: will sufficient information be available on the use of special flexibility authorities , and their effects on pupil achievement , to make it possible to analyze or judge their benefits and impact ? .

as mentioned earlier , while the statutes authorizing several forms of flexibility include significant requirements for reporting to and by ed on the use of waivers and other special authorities , and the pupil achievement and other effects of these activities , little relevant information has been disseminated by ed .

efforts by ed to compile and publish information on the use of waiver or other special flexibility authorities seem to have been a priority only infrequently .

this makes it very difficult to evaluate the significance , advantages , and disadvantages of these flexibility authorities .

a basic question regarding all special forms of flexibility is whether the increased emphasis on outcomes that is typically associated with them — whether or not such additional outcome requirements are substantial — is an adequate substitute for other forms of accountability requirements , such as required targeting of services on priority activities or high need pupil groups , which may be diminished through the grant of flexibility .

in general , the outcome accountability requirements associated with either obtaining or maintaining the special flexibility authorities in this report are a combination of ( a ) goals established by the states and leas themselves , either in the implementation of programs such as ed - flex or in competing for ( and ultimately implementing ) state - flex or local - flex authority ; and ( b ) meeting the state - established adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) requirements under esea title i - a .

in some cases , such as the innovative programs block grant or title i - a schoolwide programs , there is no direct linkage between the flexibility authority and any form of outcome accountability .

regarding ( a ) above , the most substantial evidence is contained in a gao study , which found that states granted ed - flex authority under the original ( pre - p.l .

106-25 ) legislation differed substantially in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals related to the granting of waivers .

five of the original 12 ed - flex states had set no specific objectives at all for leas or schools being granted waivers , and only one of the states had established outcome objectives that were specifically linked to the leas , schools , and pupils affected by the waivers .

the gao study further concluded that ed oversight of ed - flex implementation by the states was limited , involving mostly the collection of annual reports from the states with highly varying degrees of detail in the information they provided .

if such practices continue , then the most significant ( and the only concrete ) outcome accountability requirement associated with any of the special flexibility authorities is ( b ) above , meeting ayp requirements .

thus , the current flexibility authorities do not actually require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating leas and states — that is , accountability for pupil outcomes beyond that which is applicable to all other states and leas participating in title i - a and other esea programs .

instead , they place increased emphasis on , attention to , and consequences for failing to meet , generally applicable outcome accountability requirements .

although this outcome requirement is not an additional one , in comparison to states and leas which do not receive special flexibility authority , it may nevertheless be substantial , as states continue to implement the ayp and related requirements under the nclb .

while all schools , leas , and states are required to meet these requirements , and are to face a variety of consequences if they fail to do so , those with special flexibility authority would have an additional incentive to meet the requirements ( i.e. , to maintain their eligibility to exercise the flexibility authority ) , and an additional negative consequence of failing to do so .

while limited , such an enhancement of outcome accountability requirements may be consistent with the nature of the special flexibility authorities described in this report .

in many respects , both the additional flexibility and the increased outcome accountability are quite limited .

at the same time , these provisions take effect in the context of recent legislation , particularly the nclb , which substantially expands both outcome accountability requirements and , at least in some major respects , flexibility in the use of federal aid funds for all states , leas , and schools , whether or not they have been granted one of the special flexibility authorities described in this report .

finally , some proponents of high degrees of state and local flexibility in the use of federal k - 12 education aid funds often argue that no increase in outcome or other accountability requirements is necessary to justify the granting of special forms of flexibility .

to such proponents , increasing the ability of states and leas to use federal funds for purposes which they deem to be most appropriate and effective is sufficient justification for such policies , and is most likely to lead to improved pupil outcomes .

at the same time , critics of these authorities might argue that there is no justification for granting special forms of flexibility in return for little or nothing more than the same outcome accountability requirements which are applicable to states , leas , and schools which have not been granted such authority .

such critics often defend the full range of generally applicable accountability requirements as embodying important national priorities , and are concerned that special flexibility authorities not only have insufficient accountability provisions , but have been used thus far largely for purposes that have not been proven to increase program effectiveness .
