long considered one of the key u.s. partners in southeast asia , thailand has made international headlines for ongoing demonstrations and precipitous changes in government over the past three years .

democracy advocates argue that the revolving door of leadership in bangkok does not indicate legitimate transfers of power , and question whether thailand is sliding backward into a pattern of short - lived , weak leaders often deposed by a military coup .

u.s. officials have taken a cautious approach to the situation , imposing sanctions as triggered by u.s. law but also maintaining that the formal military alliance remains important to washington .

what is the outlook for stability in thailand and at what point does the uncertainty erode the partnership with the united states ? .

bangkok has been rocked by political turmoil since 2005 , and particularly since a military coup deposed popularly - elected prime minister thaksin shinawatra in september 2006 .

an interim military government struggled to rule until it staged elections in december 2007 .

although thaksin's successor party won the most seats , two successive prime ministers were forced to resign because of controversial rulings by thailand's high court .

both decisions raised concerns that thailand's judicial system was being used for political purposes .

as protesters filled the streets and eventually took over bangkok's international airport for several days , lawmakers realigned into a new ruling coalition and abhisit vejjajiva of the democrat party assumed the premier post .

since then , protests have continued to disrupt the country , including the embarrassing cancelation of an east asian leaders' summit in april 2009 .

despite armed clashes ( not to mention considerable economic impacts because of property damages and the loss of tourism revenue ) , only a few people have died , but over one hundred have been injured .

the protestors are divided between two main groups: the people's alliance for democracy ( pad ) , known as the "yellow shirts" and the united front for democracy against dictatorship ( udd ) , known as the "red shirts. .

the pad , initially formed under the leadership of media baron sondhi limthongkul in early 2006 , led large - scale protests accusing thaksin of corruption and subversion of democratic practices , which some observers claim lay the groundwork for the military coup .

the pad are ideologically in sync with the elite establishment of bangkok: a mix of the military , royalists , the bureaucracy , and largely urban and middle class citizens .

the combination of thaksin's broad popularity and clampdown on opposition opinions in the media threatened many of those in the "old guard. .

the "red shirts" are thaksin loyalists who insist that the current government is illegitimate .

thaksin's traditional power base is the rural , poorer population of thailand ; his attention to this constituency helped unleash a new populist movement that led to two overwhelming electoral victories and unprecedented consolidation of power from 2000 until his removal in 2006 .

the pattern of protests and counter - protests indicates the weakness of thailand's political institutions , as the disaffected take to the streets .

the pad and their allies felt that thaksin's rule was marred by his alleged dismantling of traditional watchdog groups and institutions that could constitute a check on his executive power .

their frustration was compounded when thaksin's successor party was returned to office in the december 2007 elections , led by what they deemed to be puppet leaders operating at thaksin's command .

the udd have the traditional validation of popular elections on their side , and are infuriated that the judicial system has overturned democratic results at the polls .

with distrust in traditional mechanisms high among those not in power , both movements have turned to the passion of their supporters to create enough havoc to have their demands heard .

the cycle shows few signs of slowing , and democracy advocates worry openly that thailand , once among the best examples of democratic governance in the region , may be drifting away from popular representation .

thailand has been a significant partner for the united states and an important element of the u.s. strategic presence in the asia - pacific .

at the same time , thailand enjoys a strong economic and political relationship with china , making it a potential battleground for influence in the region .

the political turmoil and ongoing separatist violence in the southern provinces have raised concern that thailand could become increasingly unstable .

mindful of geopolitics , the united states is attempting to balance its strategic needs with its imperative to remain a champion of democracy in the region .

following the 2006 coup , the united states imposed a number of penalties as stipulated in u.s. law , which it then lifted in early 2008 , following the 2007 polls .

overall , the u.s. response was seen as relatively mild .

many military and diplomatic officials , wary of some aspects of thaksin's leadership style and more familiar with the old establishment in bangkok , appeared to want to maintain strong relations with the elite despite the interruption of democratic practices .

however , hopes for a smooth transition back to representative government were dashed as the turmoil has continued to churn in thailand since the initial coup .

to many observers , thailand has slipped in its status as an asean leader and lost ground as an example of democratic rule and free markets .

at the same time , the u.s. - thai alliance has been characterized as rudderless , lacking strategic direction and relying on a legacy of past cooperation .

as the obama administration looks toward cooperative relations with indonesia , some regional analysts wonder if thailand may be fading as the favored u.s. partner in southeast asia .

decades of shared strategic interests and institutionalized defense cooperation have fortified the bilateral alliance .

the 1954 manila pact of the former southeast asia treaty organization ( seato ) , together with the 1962 thanat - rusk communiqu√© , forms the basis of the u.s. - thai security relationship , reinforced by joint efforts in the korean war and the vietnam war .

throughout the cold war , thailand served as a solid anti - communist ally in the region ; more recently , thai ports and airfields played a crucial role in maintaining the flow of troops , equipment , and supplies to the theater in both the 1991 persian gulf war and current conflicts in the middle east .

as a "major non - nato ally," thailand has enhanced access to u.s. foreign aid and military assistance , including credit guarantees for major weapons purchases .

thailand served as the logistics hub for much of the u.s. and international relief effort after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami .

thailand also hosts cobra gold , the largest annual multilateral exercises in the region , in addition to providing other valuable training opportunities for u.s. forces .

u.s. military officials are keen to maintain the strong links with the thai military establishment , particularly given the strategic value of thai facilities in possible regional contingencies .

some regional analysts insist that thailand , while imperfect , is an important democratic ally and crucial to indicate u.s. commitment to the region .

however , criticism has emerged that u.s. efforts to instill core concepts like civilian control of the military appear to have had little effect given the experience of the past few years .

although use of thai airfields has been crucial in u.s military operations and relief efforts , some observers doubt that thailand would allow the united states to use the facilities in some potential conflicts .

others have pointed out thailand's reluctance to extradite two international suspects , including the renowned russian arms dealer viktor bout , to the united states despite american requests to do so .

joint intelligence operations , reportedly cozy as the u.s. - led global war on terror accelerated under the bush administration , may be on the wane given changes to approach in washington .

all these issues have raised the question among many of how dependable thailand is as a u.s. ally .

one of the primary motivations for maintaining strong relations with bangkok is the ongoing competition with beijing for influence in southeast asia .

thailand , long known for its ability to keep good relations with all parties , enjoys strong economic , political , and cultural ties with both china and the united states .

following the 2006 coup , many u.s. government officials cited fears that china would take advantage of any withdrawal of u.s. military assistance to establish stronger defense relations between bangkok and beijing .

it is difficult to assess if the chinese have moved more assertively in recent years , but existing arms sales and military exercises have continued and , in some cases , expanded .

at the same time , the u.s. military has made overtures to engage china's military , including welcoming their participation as an observer for the first time in the cobra gold exercises in may 2008 .

for those within the u.s. defense establishment who view china as a strategic threat , however , any loss of ground to beijing in the military sphere is considered dangerous .

the turmoil in thailand has already significantly disrupted asean's activities and threatens to further constrain the organization's ability to function effectively in international diplomacy .

thailand currently holds the chair for asean , and former thai foreign minister surin pitsuwan is serving as the group's secretary general .

most visibly , udd demonstrations forced the abrupt cancellation of the april 2009 asean summit , including the helicopter evacuation of several heads of state , while others en route to the meeting were turned around mid - flight .

the summit had already been rescheduled twice due to disruptions in thailand ; the failure of the pattaya summit is seen as a major embarrassment for bangkok .

as a regional organization made up of 10 nations that operates on the premise of non - interference and consensus , asean already struggles to be a relevant diplomatic force .

in addition , asean operates as a facilitator for two other major asia - wide multilateral formats: asean plus three ( with china , japan , and korea ) and the east asia summit ( all of the above plus australia , india , and new zealand ) .

with asean weakened by successive failures to meet , the health of broader cooperation mechanisms may also be threatened .

the current global economic downturn has damaged many of southeast asia's export - dependent economies , and thailand has been especially hard - hit in the midst of the political instability .

there is concern among thai - watchers that thailand will be unable to re - assume its position of strength after the economy recovers , with new investment opportunities available in countries like vietnam and malaysia .

in addition , thailand's leadership of the region is challenged by the emergence of indonesia as a compelling example of democratic success , particularly as the united states looks to capitalize on obama's personal connection to the largest muslim nation in the world .

thailand also plays a significant role in burma's economy ; any adjustment to u.s. policy toward burma may require assistance from bangkok , just as its clout in the region has declined .
