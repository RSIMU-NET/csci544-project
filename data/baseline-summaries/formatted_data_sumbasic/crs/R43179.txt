the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules ; these benefits include medical care , disability compensation and pensions , education , vocational rehabilitation and employment services , assistance to homeless veterans , home loan guarantees , administration of life insurance as well as traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers , and death benefits that cover burial expenses .

the va carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals ( bva ) .

the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) is responsible for , among other things , providing compensation , pensions , and education assistance .

the national cemetery administration ( nca ) is responsible for maintaining national veterans' cemeteries ; providing grants to states for establishing , expanding , or improving state veterans' cemeteries ; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons , among other things .

the veterans health administration ( vha ) is responsible for health care services and medical and prosthetic research programs .

the vha is primarily a direct service provider of primary care , specialized care , and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system .

inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the civilian health and medical program of the department of veterans affairs ( champva ) .

the vha is also a provider of health care education and training for physician residents and other health care trainees .

the other statutory missions of vha are to serve as a contingency backup to the department of defense ( dod ) medical system during a national security emergency , and to provide support to the national disaster medical system and the department of health and human services as necessary .

in general , eligibility for va health care is based on previous military service , presence of service - connected disabilities , and / or other factors .

veterans generally must enroll in the va health care system to receive medical care .

once enrolled , veterans are assigned to one of eight categories ( see appendix ) .

it should be noted that in any given year , not all enrolled veterans obtain their health care services from the va .

while some veterans may rely solely on the va for their care , others may receive the majority of their health care services from other sources , such as medicare , medicaid , private health insurance , and the military health system ( tricare ) .

va - enrolled veterans do not pay premiums or enrollment fees to receive care from the va ; however , they may incur out - of - pocket costs for va care related to conditions that are not service - connected .

in fy2013 , approximately 8.9 million of the 22.2 million living veterans in the nation were estimated to be enrolled in the va health care system ( see table 1 ) .

from fy2010 through fy2013 the total number of enrollees has increased by 6.6% .

of the total number of enrolled veterans in fy2013 , va anticipated treating approximately 5.75 million unique veteran patients ( see table 2 ) .

for fy2014 , vha estimates that it will treat about 5.8 million unique veteran patients , and of these , va anticipates treating more than 674,000 operation enduring freedom ( oef ) , operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , and operation new dawn ( ond ) veterans .

in fy2014 , oef , oif , and ond patients would represent approximately10.4% of the overall patients served by the va. vha also provides medical care to certain non - veterans ; in fy2014 this population is expected to increase by almost 18,000 patients over the fy2013 level .

in total , including non - veterans , it is estimated the vha will treat nearly 6.5 million patients in 2014 , a slight increase of 1.3% over the number of patients treated in fy2013 ( see table 2 ) .

between fy2010 and fy2013 , the number of patients treated by va has grown by 7.1% .

the total number of outpatient visits , including visits to vet centers , reached 88.7 million during fy2012 and is projected to increase to approximately 92.2 million in fy2013 and 95.5 million in fy2014 .

the rest of this report focuses on appropriations for vha .

it begins with a brief overview of va's budget as a whole for fy2013 and the president's request for fy2014 .

it then presents a brief overview of vha's budget formulation , a description of the accounts that fund the vha , and a summary of the fy2013 vha budget .

the report ends with a section discussing recent legislative developments pertaining to the fy2014 vha budget .

the va budget includes both mandatory and discretionary funding .

mandatory accounts fund disability compensation , pensions , vocational rehabilitation and employment , education , life insurance , housing , and burial benefits ( such as graveliners , outer burial receptacles , and headstones ) , among other benefits and services .

discretionary accounts fund medical care , medical research , construction programs , information technology , and general operating expenses , among other things .

figure 1 provides a breakdown of fy2013 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary programs ( see also table 5 ) .

in fy2013 , the total va budget authority was approximately $134.1 billion ; discretionary budget authority accounted for about 46% ( $61.2 billion ) of the total , with about 87% ( $53.3 billion ) of this discretionary funding going toward supporting va health care programs , including medical and prosthetic research .

the va's mandatory budget authority accounted for about 54% ( $72.9 billion ) of the total va budget authority , with about 83% ( $60.63 billion ) of this mandatory funding going toward disability compensation and pension programs .

figure 2 provides a breakdown of the fy2014 president's budget request for both mandatory and discretionary programs ( also see table 7 ) .

for fy2014 , the administration requested approximately $147.9 billion .

this includes approximately $63.5 billion in discretionary funding and $84.5 billion in mandatory funding .

similar to most federal agencies , the va begins formulating its budget request approximately 10 months before the president submits the budget to congress , generally in early february .

vha's budget request to congress begins with the formulations of the budget based on the enrollee health care projection model ( ehcpm ) .

the model estimates the amount of budgetary resources vha will need to meet the expected demand for most of the health care services it provides .

the ehcpm's estimates are based on three basic components: the projected number of veterans who will be enrolled in va health care , the projected utilization of va's health care services — that is , the quantity of health care services enrollees are expected to use — and the projected unit cost of providing these services .

each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of va health care and the veterans who access va's health care services .

the ehcpm makes projections three or four years into the future .

each year , vha updates the ehcpm estimates to "incorporate the most recent data on health care utilization rates , actual program experience , and other factors , such as economic trends in unemployment and inflation. .

for instance , in 2012 , vha used data from fy2011 to develop its health care budget estimate for the fy2014 request , including the advance appropriations request for fy2015 .

table 3 provides a detailed timeline for formulating the fy2014 budget request and the fy2015 advance appropriations request .

the president submitted his fy2014 budget request to congress on april 10 , 2013 .

the fy2014 president's budget is requesting $147.9 billion for the va as a whole ( see table 7 ) .

for va medical services , the administration's budget is requesting $157.5 million in additional funding above the fy2014 advance appropriations of $43.6 billion provided in fy2013 .

according to the va , the increased funding levels requested for fy2014 reflect the increased costs of medical care requirements resulting from the implementation of the caregivers and veterans omnibus health services act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-163 ) and the honoring america's veterans and caring for camp lejeune families act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-154 ) .

in total , the president is requesting $55.2 billion for vha for fy2014 .

this includes $43.7 billion for the medical services account , $6.0 billion for the medical support and compliance account , $4.9 billion for the medical facilities account , and nearly $586 million for the medical and prosthetic research account ( see table 8 ) .

as required by the veterans health care budget reform and transparency act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-81 ) , the president's budget is requesting $55.6 billion in advance appropriations for the three medical care appropriations ( medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) for fy2015 ( see table 8 ) .

on march 13 , 2013 , the house budget committee reported a budget resolution ( h.con.res .

25 h.con.res .

25 , 113 th congress ) , and the budget resolution was agreed to by the house on march 21 , 2013 .

according to the committee report that accompanied h.con.res .

25 ( h.rept .

113-17 ) : the resolution calls for $145.7 billion in budget authority and $145.4 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2014 [for veterans benefits and services] .

discretionary spending is $63.3 billion in budget authority and $63.1 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2014 .

this in an increase of 3.1 percent from last year's discretionary level .

mandatory spending in 2014 is $82.4 billion in budget authority and $82.3 billion in outlays .

the ten - year totals for budget authority and outlays are $1.7 trillion and $1.7 trillion , respectively .

this resolution also authorizes up to $55.483 billion for fiscal year 2015 in advance appropriations for medical care , consistent with the veterans health care budget and reform transparency act of 2009 .

since the president has yet to submit a budget request this year , the va's request for veterans - medical - care advance appropriations for fiscal year 2015 is unavailable as of the writing of this concurrent resolution .

the amount authorized in this resolution reflects the amount requested in the administration's fiscal year 2013 request for fiscal year 2015 and is the most up - to - date estimate on veterans' health - care needs requested by the department of veterans affairs .

on march 14 , 2013 , the senate budget committee reported a budget resolution ( s.con.res .

8 , 113 th congress ) , and the budget resolution was agreed to by the senate on march 23 , 2013 .

according to the committee print that accompanied s.con.res .

8 ( s.rept .

113-12 ) : the budget resolution sets fiscal year 2014 levels at $145.5 billion for budget authority [ba] and $145.3 billion for outlays for [veterans benefits and services] .

over the fy 2014-2018 period , ba totals $779.5 billion , with $776.4 billion in outlays .

from fy 2014-2023 , the [veterans benefits and services] function totals $1.688 trillion in ba and $1.68 trillion in outlays .

for discretionary spending , the resolution calls for fy 2014 levels of $63.1 billion in ba and $62.9 billion in outlays .

ba totals $336.3 billion and outlays equal $333.6 billion over five years .

from fy 2014-2023 , the discretionary total for [veterans benefits and services] is $730.9 billion in ba and $723.8 billion in outlays .

on may 15 , 2013 , the house military construction and veterans affairs subcommittee approved its version of a military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations bill for fy2014 ( milcon - va appropriations bill ) .

the full house appropriations committee voted to report the measure on may 21 , 2013 , and the house passed h.r .

2216 on june 4 , 2013 .

the milcon - va appropriations bill for fy2014 ( h.r .

2216 ; h.rept .

113-90 ) proposes a total of $147.6 billion for the va ( see table 7 ) .

the total includes $84.5 billion for mandatory programs , and $63.1 billion for discretionary programs ( see table 7 ) .

h.r .

2216 ( h.rept .

113-90 ) ( see table 7 ) as passed by the house proposes $54.9 billion for vha for fy2014 , which comprises four accounts: medical services , medical support and compliance , medical facilities , and medical and prosthetic research .

the house - passed measure does not include the additional funding amount of $157.5 million ( above the fy2014 advance appropriations ) for the medical services account that was requested by the president for fy2014 , and proposes to rescind $156.0 million from the fy2014 vha amount that was provided as an advance appropriation in fy2013 , giving the secretary the discretion to allocate these reductions across vha accounts .

h.r .

2216 proposes $55.6 billion in advance fy2015 funding for the medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities accounts — the same level included in the house - passed budget resolution , and the president's request ( see table 8 ) .

on june 18 , 2013 , the senate military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies subcommittee approved its version of the milcon - va appropriations bill .

the full senate appropriations committee marked up the bill and voted to report the measure on june 20 , 2013 .

the milcon - va appropriations bill for fy2014 ( h.r .

2216 ; s.rept .

113-48 ) proposes a total of $147.9 billion for the va for fy2014 .

the total includes $84.5 billion for mandatory programs , $63.5 billion for discretionary programs .

the senate appropriations committee approved measure does not include the full additional funding amount of $157.5 million ( above the fy2014 advance appropriations ) for the medical services account that was requested by the president for fy2014 , and instead proposes a $25 million increase for the medical services account ( see table 8 ) .

the committee notes that the justification accompanying the budget request provides few details regarding the data and assumptions that were modified in the updated actuarial model projection .

absent this data , the committee cannot accurately assess the merits of an additional request .

the committee also notes that the department routinely carries forward significant funds from one fiscal year to the next and directs that any of funding carried forward from fiscal year [fy] 2013 be applied to unanticipated needs .

furthermore , the senate appropriations committee approved measure ( h.r .

2216 ; s.rept .

113-48 ) proposes an additional $100 million for the medical facilities account for fy2014 for nonrecurring maintenance projects ( see table 8 ) .

congress was unable to complete action on any of the fy2014 appropriation acts prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year .

lawmakers also failed to agree on language in a fy2014 continuing resolution ( cr ) .

with no agreement in place on october 1 , 2013 , the resulting lapse in funding led to a partial shutdown of government operations .

congress finally reached agreement on a temporary cr on october 16 , 2013 , and the president signed the continuing appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-46 ) , the following day to reopen the government .

that cr ( p.l .

113-46 ) funded most of the va ( excluding the three medical care accounts: medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) through january 15 , 2014 .

p.l .

113-73 extended the cr through january 18 , allowing extra time for legislative consideration of an omnibus appropriation bill .

on january 17 , 2014 , the president signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-76 ) .

division j of this act included the military construction and veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2014 ( milcon - va appropriations act , 2014 ) .

in total the milcon - va appropriations act , 2014 provides a total of $147.9 billion in budget authority for va programs in fy2014 .

of this amount , $55.1 billion is provided for vha , which comprises four accounts: medical services , medical support and compliance , medical facilities , and medical and prosthetic research accounts .

113-6 .

this additional funding will be used to address the backlog of non - recurring maintenance needs at existing va hospitals and clinics .

as required by the veterans health care budget reform and transparency act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-81 ) , the milcon - va appropriations act , 2014 , provides advance appropriations of $55.6 billion for fy2015 for three vha accounts ( medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) .
