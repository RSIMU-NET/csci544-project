as shown by table 1 , the number of circuit and district court nominees confirmed during presidential election years varied during the 1980 to 2008 period , ranging from 2 to 11 and 18 to 55 , respectively .

during these eight election years , the most circuit court nominees were confirmed in 1992 ( 11 ) , 1980 ( 10 ) , and 1984 ( 10 ) .

the years with the fewest confirmed circuit court nominees were 1996 ( 2 ) and 2008 ( 4 ) .

on average , roughly 7 circuit court nominees were confirmed per presidential election year from 1980 to 2008 ; the median number of circuit court nominees confirmed was 7.5 .

as for circuit court nominees in 2012 , 5 of 12 pending election - year nominees , or 41.7% , have been confirmed as of june 30 .

table 1 also shows that the percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed was lower in each of the four most recent presidential years than it was in any of the four preceding ones .

of the total nominees during presidential election years , the percentage confirmed during the 1996 to 2008 period ranged from a low of 22.2% in 1996 to a high of 30.8% in 2000 .

by comparison , the lowest percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed in the presidential election years 1980 to 1992 was 43.8% in 1988 ( with the highest percentage of nominees confirmed , 71.4% , occurring in both 1980 and 1984 ) .

a similar disparity is found between the overall percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed during the four most recent presidential election years ( 1996-2008 ) versus the four earlier years ( 1980-1992 ) .

from 1996 to 2008 , the senate confirmed 19 of 72 pending circuit court nominees , or 26.4% , compared with 38 of 65 nominees confirmed , or 58.5% , in the four preceding presidential election years .

as for district court nominees , the presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 with the greatest numbers of confirmed nominees were 1992 ( 55 ) and 1980 ( 53 ) .

as with circuit court nominees , the years with the fewest confirmed district court nominees were also 1996 ( 18 ) and 2008 ( 24 ) .

from 1980 to 2008 , an average of 35 district court nominees were confirmed per presidential election year ; the median number of district court nominees confirmed was 32.5 .

in 2012 , as of june 30 , 24 of 52 pending election - year district court nominees , or 46.2% , have been confirmed .

table 1 reveals that across the four most recent presidential election years , 1996 to 2008 , the senate confirmed fewer district court nominees overall ( 105 ) than across the four preceding presidential election years , 1980 to 1992 ( 175 ) .

this disparity can be seen , in part , as a function of the senate having received fewer district court nominations during the last four election years ( 173 ) than in the four preceding ones ( 259 ) .

finally , in every presidential election year from 1980 to 2008 , table 1 shows , the senate confirmed a higher percentage of district court nominees pending during the year than it did circuit court nominees .

these differences , while only slightly higher in three of the first four presidential election years , were greater in the four most recent presidential election years .

thus , the table shows , in 1996 the senate confirmed 46.2% of district court nominees , compared with 22.2% of court of appeals nominees confirmed ; in 2000 , 55.4% , compared with 30.8% ; in 2004 , 78.0% , compared with 25.0% ; and in 2008 , 64.9% , compared with 23.5% .

 figure 1 provides a measure of how senate processing of judicial nominations during the presidential election years of 1980 to 2008 varied from month to month .

the figure does so by showing the percentage of confirmed circuit and district court nominees approved by the senate during each month across the eight election years .

figure 1 shows similar trend lines in the percentage of circuit and district nominees confirmed in particular months .

after starting with low percentages ( i.e. , below 5% ) of confirmations in january , the trend lines for both circuit and district court nominees rose together in certain months , peaking three times ( in february , june , and october ) , while falling , again in tandem , in other months ( march , july , and november ) .

specifically , of the 57 circuit court nominees confirmed during presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 , most were confirmed in february ( 14.0% ) , may ( 15.8% ) , june ( 21.1% ) , and october ( 14.0% ) .

of the 280 district court nominees confirmed during the same eight presidential election years , most were confirmed in february ( 11.8% ) , may ( 15.7% ) , june ( 20.0% ) , september ( 11.4% ) , and october ( 10.0% ) .

in a few cases , however , the percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed in a particular month differed notably from the percentage of district court nominees confirmed .

the largest such difference occurred during july , a month that accounted for 10.0% of all confirmed district court nominees from 1980 to 2008 , in contrast to 1.8% of all confirmed circuit court nominees during the same period .

 ( the drop - off , from june to july , in the percentage of nominees confirmed was much greater for circuit court nominees — 21.1% in june , down to 1.8% in july — than for district court nominees — 20.0% in june , down to 10.0% in july. ) .

the second - largest difference occurred in september .

during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , september accounted for 11.4% of all confirmed district court nominees , compared with 5.3% of all confirmed circuit court nominees .

the current election year of 2012 is not represented in figure 1 .

in 2012 , two circuit court nominees have been confirmed in may and one circuit court nominee confirmed each in february , april , and june .

the greatest numbers of district court nominees in 2012 , as of june 30 , have been confirmed in march ( nine nominees ) and may ( four ) .

unlike any of the previous election years dating back to 1980 , 2012 has had at least one district court nominee confirmed each month from january through june .

a question of recurring interest to congress is whether , or to what extent , senate confirmations of judicial nominations tend to drop off in the second half of presidential election years .

crs research has found that , during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , the senate usually , but not always , confirmed fewer circuit and district court nominees in the second half of the year than in the first half .

overall , during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , 70.2% of confirmed circuit court nominees and 60.7% of confirmed district court nominees were approved during the first six months of the year .

however , within the 1980 to 2008 time frame , crs also found notable differences , between the first four election years ( 1980 to 1992 ) and the last four election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) , in the extent to which confirmations dropped off after june .

these differences can be seen in figure 2 , below .

specifically , figure 2 shows , first for the 1980 to 1992 presidential election years , and then again for the 1996 to 2008 election years , the percentages of confirmed circuit and district court nominees who were approved by the senate from january to june versus from july to december .

the figure reveals that senate confirmation of circuit court nominees all but stopped after june 30 during the more recent presidential election years of 1996 to 2008 .

of the 38 circuit court nominees confirmed in the 1980 to 1992 election years , 57.9% were approved by the senate between january and june , while 42.1% were approved between july and december .

in contrast , from 1996 to 2008 , nearly all confirmed circuit court nominees ( 18 of 19 , or 94.7% ) were approved during the first six months of the year .

this distinction did not hold for district court nominees .

during the more recent presidential election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) , a greater percentage of district court nominees were confirmed in the second half of the year ( 45.7% ) than were approved post - june during the 1980 to 1992 presidential election years ( 35.4% ) .

figure 2 thus shows that during recent presidential election years , senate confirmation of district court nominees has been less "front - loaded" ( i.e. , tending less to occur between january and june ) than was the case in the 1980 to 1992 election years .

instead , the percentage of post - june confirmations for the 1996 to 2008 election years as a whole , while still less than 50% , was higher than the confirmation percentage for district court nominations approved during the second half of the year during the 1980 to 1996 election years .

as part of this trend , some months in the second half of the year during the more recent presidential election years witnessed a notable number of district court confirmations .

in july 1996 , for instance , the senate confirmed 16 district court nominees ; it confirmed 10 district court nominees in september 2008 ( after confirming 4 the previous july ) ; and it confirmed 4 district nominees in july 2000 and in october 2000 .

also , the senate confirmed five district court nominees in november 2004 ( although this was the sole instance , during any of the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , of district court nominees being confirmed in a "lame - duck" congressional session ) .

at the current point in 2012 , it remains to be seen whether , or to what extent , senate confirmations of lower court nominations will drop off in the second half of the year .

these questions , of course , are for the senate to decide how to resolve .

it might be noted , however , that efforts to block further confirmations of circuit court nominations , if successful , would result in 2012 closely following the pattern of the 1996 to 2008 presidential election years .

 ( as discussed above , the senate during the second halves of those years confirmed a total of one nomination. ) .

on the other hand , continued confirmations of district court nominations during the remainder of 2012 also would follow the general pattern of the 1996 to 2008 presidential election years .

 ( as discussed above , 45.7% of nominees with nominations pending during those years were confirmed after june. ) .

by contrast , if 2012 followed the confirmation patterns of the earlier presidential years of 1980 to 1992 , the senate would continue to confirm circuit as well as district court nominees during the second half of the year .

the dates on which the senate judiciary committee and the full senate last considered circuit court and district court nominees have varied widely in recent presidential election years .

table 2 presents , for each of the eight presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 , the last dates on which the senate received a circuit court nomination , the judiciary committee held a hearing or reported such a nomination , and the senate voted on confirmation of such a nomination .

table 3 provides similar last - date information for district court nominations during the eight presidential election years .

table 2 reveals that , in six of the eight presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 , at least one circuit court nomination was submitted by the president to the senate during the second half of the year , after june 30 .

in the two other years , 1996 and 2004 , the president's final circuit court nomination was submitted to the senate during the first half of the year ( on april 18 and may 10 , respectively ) .

as the table also shows , it has not been uncommon for the senate judiciary committee to continue its consideration of a president's circuit court nominees during the second half of the year .

specifically , in seven of the eight election years from 1980 to 2008 , the senate judiciary committee held hearings for at least one circuit court nominee after june 30 or reported at least one nominee after that date .

in 2008 , however , the judiciary committee did not act on circuit court nominees , either by holding a hearing or reporting a nomination to the full senate , after june 30 ; the last hearing date for a circuit court nominee was on may 7 , and the last report of a circuit court nomination was on june 12 .

the full senate has confirmed its final circuit court nominee earlier in the year during the four most recent completed presidential election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) than during the four previous ones ( 1980 to 1992 ) .

in 1980 , stephen g. breyer was confirmed to the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit on december 9 .

in 1984 , 1988 , and 1992 , the senate confirmed circuit court nominees in october of each year ( in each case within several days of the senate's adjournment sine die ) .

in the four most recent completed presidential election years , however , the senate has not confirmed circuit court nominees after july .

the senate confirmed no circuit court nominees in 1996 during the second session of the 104 th congress ; its last confirmations were on january 2 , 1996 , a day before the end of the first session .

in 2000 , the last confirmation of a circuit court nominee occurred on july 21 .

in both 2004 and 2008 , the final confirmation of a circuit court nominee occurred on the same date , june 24 .

 ( in late july 2004 , however , the senate did consider , without voting on , the nominations of four circuit court nominees , while rejecting attempts to invoke cloture on the nominations. ) .

table 3 presents the dates on which the senate judiciary committee and the full senate last considered district court nominations in the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years .

the table shows , for each of the election years during this period , the last dates on which the senate received a district court nomination , the judiciary committee held a hearing or reported such a nomination , and the senate voted on confirmation of such a nomination .

district court nominations , table 3 shows , were submitted by the president to the senate during the second half of the year ( i.e. , after june 30 ) in each of the eight presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 .

the table also shows that the senate judiciary committee continued its consideration of district court nominations beyond june 30 , by holding a hearing on a nomination or reporting a nomination , in each of the eight years .

additionally , in most years , committee action on district court nominations occurred well after the traditional august recess .

in seven of the eight years , the senate judiciary committee held a committee hearing on a district court nomination or reported such a nomination after august 31 .

table 3 further reveals that , in the presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 , the last confirmations of district court nominees occurred typically well into the fall .

in seven of the eight election years , the last district court nominee was confirmed in september or later ( with the senate in one year , 2004 , confirming a district court nominee in november , after a presidential election ) .

the one election year in which the senate did not confirm a district court nominee in september or later was 1996 , when the last confirmation occurred on august 2 .

during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , the last confirmation dates of district court nominees — occurring in september or later in seven of the eight years — are in contrast to the last dates of circuit court confirmations during the four most recent election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) .

during these years , as previously discussed , no circuit court nominees were confirmed after july .

at any given time during a presidential election year , senators might wish to compare the number of judicial nominations confirmed thus far in the year with the number of nominations confirmed at the same point in past election years .

they also might wish to know how any increases in the number of judicial confirmations during the rest of the year would compare with total nominations confirmed at corresponding points in past election years .

such comparisons would be one way to measure to what extent the senate was "keeping pace" with its processing of judicial nominations in past election years , as well as to project how many more confirmations , if any , would be needed by the end of the year to match total confirmation numbers in past years .

figure 3 shows , across the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , the average number of circuit and district court nominees confirmed by the senate as of the end of each of nine months , february through october .

in the figure , for example , the data points for march reflect the average number of confirmations that occurred from january to the end of march in the 1980 to 2008 presidential election year period .

the figure shows comparable , although only partial , monthly interval data for 2012 ; specifically , the cumulative number of circuit and district court nominees confirmed as of the end of each month , from february through june .

the figure , thus , allows for the nominee confirmation totals as of any of five monthly points in time in 2012 to be compared with the average number of total nominees confirmed as of the same points over the previous eight presidential election years .

for circuit court nominees , figure 3 shows that , during the 1980 to 2008 election years , an average of 1.2 nominees were confirmed by the end of february .

at the end of each succeeding month , the average number of circuit court nominees confirmed by that point in the year increased — for instance , from an average of 1.9 nominees confirmed by the end of march to 2.4 nominees confirmed by the end of april , or from an average of 3.5 nominees confirmed by the end of may to 5 nominees confirmed by the end of june .

by the end of september , figure 3 indicates , the average number of circuit nominees confirmed had increased to six , and by the end of october , to seven .

the figure also shows the average number of district court nominees confirmed by the senate as of the end of nine successive months across the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years .

it shows , for instance , that , during these election years , an average of 4.4 nominees were confirmed by the end of february .

at the end of each succeeding month , the average number of district court nominees confirmed at that point in the year increased .

by the end of september , figure 3 indicates , the average number of district court nominees had increased to 30.9 , and by the end of october , to 34.4 .

additionally , the figure indicates that , for both circuit and district court nominees , the biggest monthly increase in average number of nominees confirmed occurred in june .

from the end of may to the end of june , during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years , the average number of circuit court nominees confirmed increased by 1.5 , from of 3.5 to 5 .

during the same monthly interval , the average number of district court nominees increased by 7.0 , from 14.2 to 21.2 .

figure 3 , it should be emphasized , shows the average month - to - month cumulative growth in the number of judicial confirmations across eight presidential election years .

while the eight - year averages show , for both circuit and district court nominees , a successive , unbroken increase , month by month , in total confirmation numbers , this is not always the case for particular election years , where a succession of months did not always entail a steady increase in the number of nominations confirmed .

rather , in a number of instances during presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 , the senate declined to confirm a circuit court nomination over a succession of several months prior to november .

further , during all four of the most recent completed presidential election years ( 1996 to 2008 ) , no confirmations of circuit court nominations occurred during the three successive months of august to october .

hence , a figure tracking the average number of confirmed circuit court nominations over successive months in the 1996 to 2008 presidential election years would not reveal ( as does the 1980 to 2008 monthly cumulative average ) a steady increase until the end of october in the average number of circuit court nominees confirmed annually .

rather , the average cumulative growth in number of circuit court nominations confirmed across the four presidential election years would be shown to have stopped as of the end of july .

additionally , figure 3 may be used to compare the number of judicial nominations confirmed in 2012 , as of june 30 , with the average number confirmed at the same point in past presidential election years .

the figure shows , for example , that the average number of circuit court nominees confirmed by the end of june during the presidential election years of 1980 to 2008 was five , the same number of circuit nominees that the senate in 2012 confirmed by the end of june .

during the 1980 to 2008 election years , the average number of district court nominees confirmed by the end of june was 21 , compared with 24 that the senate in 2012 confirmed by the end of june .

hence , through june 2012 , the senate has kept pace with the average number of circuit nominees confirmed through june over the past eight presidential election years , while it is slightly ahead of the average pace with which the senate , through june during the same election years , confirmed district court nominees .

as figure 3 shows , the senate , through october 2012 , would need to confirm two more circuit court nominations ( for an annual total of seven confirmations ) , to match the average number of circuit court nominations confirmed in the presidential election years from 1980 to 2008 .

in addition to the 24 district court nominations confirmed as of june 30 , 2012 , the senate through october 2012 would need to confirm 10 more ( for a total of 34 ) to match the average number of district court nominations confirmed through october in the previous eight election years .

finally , figure 3 does not mean that president obama has been more successful than his recent predecessors in having his circuit and district court nominees approved by the senate .

rather , from presidents reagan to obama , president obama , as of july 10 , 2012 , is tied with president clinton in having the fewest circuit court nominees approved during a first term ( 30 ) , and he also has the second - lowest percentage of circuit court nominees approved ( 71.4% ) .

as for district court nominees , president obama thus far has had , among the five most recent presidents ( reagan to obama ) , during a first term , the fewest nominees confirmed ( 122 ) and the second - lowest percentage confirmed ( 78.7% ) .

concerns periodically are raised in the senate when vacancy rates in the u.s. circuit and district courts reach relatively high levels .

discussions in the senate raising such concerns often seek to gauge the extent to which the pace of senate processing of judicial nominations may be among the factors causing increases or decreases in judicial vacancy rates .

in presidential election years , a slow - down in the pace at which the senate processes judicial nominations especially can have repercussions for judicial vacancy rates if the number of confirmations during the year fails to keep up with the occurrence of new judicial vacancies .

to provide historical context for the senate as it processes judicial nominations during the rest of 2012 , this report has analyzed the number and timing of u.s. circuit court and district court nominations confirmed by the senate in presidential election years dating back to 1980 .

the report , however , has not addressed , or suggested ways to resolve , a sensitive policy question — namely , to what extent should past practice or "custom" from previous presidential election years guide the senate's processing of judicial nominations during the current election year ? .

if the senate determines that the processing of judicial nominations in past election years is an important point of reference for influencing its actions in 2012 , that determination might raise its own specific set of issues .

these might include , which previous election years or periods of time are most relevant for the senate to consider in acting on judicial nominations ? .

does it matter whether , during these earlier years , the majority party in the senate was the same as that of the president — with the past practices in processing judicial nominations more or less important depending on whether the senate and the president were of the same political party ? .

do previous election years support treating circuit court nominees differently from district court nominees , in terms of how late the senate acts on such nominations ? .

of course , the senate might determine that other considerations are also relevant in deciding how many circuit or district court nominees to confirm in any given presidential election year , or how late in the year to confirm them .

such considerations might include the number of judgeships that are currently vacant , whether that number is relatively high or low compared with judicial vacancy numbers in previous election years , and how many of those vacancies have been classified by the federal judiciary as "judicial emergencies. .

another relevant consideration might be the number and percentage of an incumbent president's judicial nominations that have been confirmed thus far in his presidency , and how those figures compare with those of his recent predecessors at a similar point in their presidencies .

a third consideration might be whether a nominee has bipartisan home state senator support , with at least one of the home state senators returning a positive blue slip for a nominee being of the opposite party from the president's .

the weight accorded these considerations , as well as others , might affect whether the senate adheres to , modifies , or departs from the customs and patterns established in prior presidential election years .
