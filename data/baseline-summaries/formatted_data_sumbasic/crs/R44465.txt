the energy and water development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

fy2017 funding for energy and water development programs was provided by division d of the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , an omnibus funding measure passed by congress may 4 , 2017 , and signed into law the following day .

 ( this followed a series of continuing resolutions. ) .

total funding for division d was $38.89 billion , offset by $436 million in rescissions .

that total was $1.27 billion above the obama administration request and $1.54 billion over the fy2016 level , excluding rescissions .

the obama administration also had proposed $2.26 billion in new mandatory funding for doe , which was not approved .

proposed reductions for the corps , reclamation , and cup were also rejected .

the senate appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2017 energy and water development appropriations bill on april 14 , 2016 ( s. 2804 , s.rept .

114-236 ) .

for floor consideration , the senate called up the house - passed fy2016 energy and water development bill ( h.r .

2028 ) and substituted the language of s. 2804 as passed by the senate appropriations committee .

the senate approved the measure may 12 , 2016 , by a vote of 90-8 .

total appropriations in the bill were $261 million ( 0.7% ) above the request , including budget scorekeeping offsets .

the house appropriations committee completed action on april 19 , 2016 ( h.r .

5055 , h.rept .

114-532 ) .

as passed by committee , the house bill would have provided an increase of $4 million over the request .

however , the house rejected the bill may 26 , 2016 , by a vote of 112-305 .

the bill's defeat in the house was widely ascribed to the adoption of several controversial amendments from both sides of the aisle , such as language on sexual orientation and gender identity and a provision to block heavy water imports from iran .

similarly to fy2017 , funding for fy2016 energy and water development programs was included in an omnibus funding measure for the entire federal government passed on december 18 , 2015 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) .

the omnibus measure provided a total of $37.3 billion for energy and water programs for fy2016 , an increase of 5.8% over fy2015 .

funding in the omnibus measure included $29.7 billion for doe ( up 5.7% ) , $6.0 billion for the corps ( up 9.8% ) , $1.3 billion for reclamation ( up 11.8% ) , and $342 million for independent agencies ( up 27.0% ) .
