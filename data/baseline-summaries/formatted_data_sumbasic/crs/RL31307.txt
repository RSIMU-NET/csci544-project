108-7 .

the omnibus appropriations bill includes an extension of the price - andersonact nuclear incident liability system through december 31 , 2003 .

the senate hadproposed attaching a 15-year extension that was identical to price - andersonprovisions agreed to by house - senate conferees on an omnibus energy bill ( h.r .

4 ) in the 107th congress .

the energy conference agreement wasnot completed by the end of the session , however , so the proposed price - andersonextension was not enacted .

the short extension in the omnibus appropriations billdoes not change any other provisions in the price - anderson act .

under the price - anderson act ( primarily section 170 of the atomic energy act of 1954 , 42 u.s.c .

2210 ) , the owners of commercial reactors must assume allliability for reactor - related radiological damages awarded to the public by the courtsystem , but their total liability is limited to the amount provided by private insuranceand a mandatory industry self - insurance system .

the price - anderson act alsoauthorizes doe to indemnify contractors who operate hazardous doe nuclearfacilities .

the limit on doe contractor liability is the same as for commercialreactors , except when the limit for commercial reactors drops because of a declinein the number of covered reactors .

without an extension of the law , any commercial nuclear reactor licensed after august 1 , 2002 , could not have been covered by the price - anderson system , althoughcoverage continued for existing reactors .

because no new u.s. reactors are currentlyplanned , missing the deadline for extension had little short - term effect on the nuclearpower industry .

however , any new doe contracts signed during a price - andersonlapse would have to use alternate indemnification authority .

to prevent thatproblem , the national defense authorization act for fy2003 ( p.l .

107-314 ) , signeddecember 2 , 2002 , extended price - anderson coverage for doe contractors throughdecember 31 , 2004 .
