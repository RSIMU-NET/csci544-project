i n january 2017 , the house and senate adopted a budget resolution for fy2017 ( s.con.res .

3 ) , which reflects an agreement between the chambers on the fy2017 budget and sets forth budgetary levels for fy2018-fy2026 .

s.con.res .

3 also includes reconciliation instructions directing specific committees to develop and report legislation that would change laws within their respective jurisdictions to reduce the deficit .

these instructions trigger the budget reconciliation process , which allows certain legislation to be considered under expedited procedures .

the reconciliation instructions included in s.con.res .

3 direct two committees in each chamber to report legislation within their jurisdictions that would reduce the deficit by $1Â billion over the period fy2017-fy2026 .

in the house , the committee on ways and means and the energy and commerce committee are directed to report .

in the senate , the committee on finance and the committee on health , education , labor , and pensions are directed to report .

on march 6 , 2017 , the house committee on ways and means and the house energy and commerce committee independently held markups .

each committee voted to transmit its budget reconciliation legislative recommendations to the house committee on the budget .

on march 16 , 2017 , the house committee on the budget held a markup and voted to report a reconciliation bill , h.r .

1628 , the american health care act ( ahca ) of 2017 .

the house subsequently passed the ahca with amendments on may 4 , 2017 , by a vote of 217 to 213 .

the house bill was received in the senate on june 7 , 2017 , and the next day the senate majority leader had it placed on the calendar , making it available for floor consideration .

the senate budget committee published on its website a "discussion draft" titled , "the better care reconciliation act of 2017" ( bcra ) on june 22 , 2017 , and updated the discussion draft on june 26 and july 13 .

on july 19 , 2017 , the senate budget committee posted the "obamacare repeal reconciliation act of 2017" ( orra ) on its website as another draft reconciliation bill .

the bcra discussion draft was again amended on july 20 .

each of these draft bills is written in the form of an amendment in the nature of a substitute , meaning that it is intended to be considered by the senate as an amendment to h.r .

1628 , as passed by the house , and that all of the house - passed language would be stricken and the language of the draft would be inserted in its place .

orra is largely based off the restoring americans' healthcare freedom reconciliation act of 2015 ( h.r .

3762 ) , which was vetoed by president obama on january 8 , 2016 , and returned to the house .

orra would repeal several provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) , and it could restrict federal funding for the planned parenthood federation of america ( ppfa ) and its affiliates and clinics for a period of one year .

the bill also would appropriate ( 1 ) an additional $422 million for fy2017 to the community health center fund and ( 2 ) $750 million for each of fy2018 and fy2019 to award grants to states to address the substance abuse public health crisis or respond to urgent mental health needs .

a number of the provisions in orra are also in the ahca and / or bcra .

however , orra does not include the ahca or bcra provisions that would substitute the aca's premium tax credit for premium tax credits with different eligibility rules and calculation requirements .

orra also does not include the ahca or bcra provisions that would establish new programs and requirements that are not related to the aca , for example , a new fund to provide funding to states for specified activities intended to improve access to health insurance and health care or provisions to convert medicaid financing to a per capita cap model ( i.e. , per enrollee limits on federal payments to states ) with a block grant option ( i.e. , a predetermined fixed amount of federal funding ) for certain populations .

this report provides summaries of each orra provision .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) and the staff of the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) issued a cost estimate for orra on july 19 , 2017 .

cbo and jct estimate that orra would reduce federal deficits by $473 billion from fy2017 through fy2026 , which is $354 billion more than the ahca and $53 billion more than the july 20 , 2017 , version of the bcra .

the projections for the number of uninsured individuals under orra as compared to current law are higher than the projections under the ahca and the bcra .

in cy2018 , cbo and jct estimate that 17 million more people would be uninsured under orra than under current law , and cbo and jct estimate that that figure would grow to 32 million in cy2026 .

in comparison , cbo and jct project that , in cy2026 , 23 million and 22 million more people would be uninsured under the ahca and the july 20 , 2017 , version of the bcra ( respectively ) than under current law .

aca section 4002 established the prevention and public health fund ( pphf ) , to be administered by the hhs secretary , and provided it with a permanent annual appropriation .

the pphf is intended to support an "expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs. .

in general , pphf funds have been distributed to hhs agencies in the public health service , in particular the centers for disease control and prevention .

amounts for each fiscal year are available to the hhs secretary beginning october 1 , the start of the respective fiscal year .

congress may explicitly direct the distribution of pphf funds and did so for fy2014 through fy2017 .

under the aca , the pphf's annual appropriation would increase from $500 million for fy2010 to $2 billion for fy2015 and each subsequent fiscal year .

congress has amended the provision two times , using a portion of pphf funds as an offset for the costs of other activities .

annual appropriations to the pphf in current law are as follows: 1 .

$500 million for fy2010 ; 2 .

$1.0 billion for each of fy2012 through fy2017 ; 3 .

$900 million for each of fy2018 and fy2019 ; 4 .

$1.0 billion for each of fy2020 and fy2021 ; 5 .

$1.5 billion for fy2022 ; 6 .

$1.0 billion for fy2023 ; 7 .

$1.7 billion for fy2024 ; and 8 .

$2.0 billion for fy2025 and each fiscal year thereafter .

section 201 would amend aca section 4002 ( b ) by repealing all pphf appropriations for fy2019 and subsequent fiscal years .

the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) supports community - based substance abuse and mental health treatment and prevention services through formula grants to the states and u.s. territories and through competitive grant programs to states , territories , tribal organizations , local communities , and private entities .

samhsa and most of its programs and activities are authorized under public health service act ( phsa ) title v ; samhsa's two largest grant programs , the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant and the community mental health services block grant , are authorized under phsa title xix .

phsa section 399o required the hhs secretary to award formula grants to states to support state prescription drug monitoring programs , but this grant program has not received funding since fy2010 .

other agencies within hhs also support substance abuse or mental health prevention and treatment under more general authorities .

section 202 would authorize to be appropriated and would appropriate , out of monies in the treasury not otherwise obligated , $750 million for each of fy2018 and fy2019 to the hhs secretary to award grants to states to address the substance abuse public health crisis or respond to urgent mental health needs by ( 1 ) improving state prescription drug monitoring programs , ( 2 ) implementing and evaluating substance abuse prevention activities , ( 3 ) training health care practitioners in topics related to substance abuse , ( 4 ) supporting access to substance abuse or mental health services , and / or ( 5 ) other public health - related activities related to substance abuse or mental health .

funds appropriated pursuant to this authority would remain available until expended .

aca section 10503 created the community health center fund , which provided mandatory appropriations to the health center program from fy2011 through fy2015 .

the health center program provides grants to outpatient primary care facilities that provide health services to underserved populations in health professional shortage areas .

these appropriations were subsequently extended through fy2017 by section 221 ( a ) of the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-10 ) , which provided $3.6 billion for each of fy2016-fy2017 .

prior to the aca , the health center program had received only discretionary appropriations , which made up the entirety of the program's appropriated funds .

since the community health center fund's creation , the fund has made up an increasing percentage of the health center program's appropriation , ranging from 39% for fy2011 to 70% for fy2017 .

under current law , for fy2018 , the community health center fund will not receive a mandatory appropriation .

section 203 would provide $422 million to the community health center fund for fy2017 in addition to the $3.6 billion appropriated under current law .

aca section 1402 authorized subsidies to eligible individuals to reduce the cost - sharing expenses for health insurance plans offered in the individual market through health insurance exchanges .

cost - sharing assistance is provided in two forms .

the first form of assistance reduces the out - of - pocket limit applicable for a given exchange plan ; the second reduces actual cost - sharing requirements ( eg , lowers the deductible or reduces a co - payment ) applicable to a given exchange plan .

both types of assistance provide greater subsidy amounts to individuals with lower household incomes .

individuals who meet applicable eligibility requirements may receive both types of cost - sharing subsidies .

the aca directed the hhs and the treasury secretaries to make payments to reimburse insurers for the required reductions but did not expressly address the source of funds to be used for these payments .

the obama administration made cost - sharing reduction payments to insurers using an appropriation that covered premium subsidies .

the house of representatives filed suit , claiming that the payments violated the appropriations clause of the u.s. constitution .

after holding that the house has standing to sue the obama administration , the u.s. district court for the district of columbia concluded that the secretaries' payment of the cost - sharing reimbursements was unconstitutional for lack of a valid appropriation enacted by congress .

the court barred the obama administration from making the cost - sharing payments but stayed its decision pending appeal of the case .

should the appeal of the case not go forward , the district court's decision apparently could take effect , likely preventing the federal government from reimbursing insurers for these required cost - sharing reductions absent a subsequent appropriation of funds or other action by congress .

section 204 would appropriate to the hhs secretary such sums as may be necessary for cost - sharing subsidies ( including adjustments to prior obligations for such payments ) for the period beginning the date of enactment through december 31 , 2019 .

payments incurred and other actions for adjustments to obligations for plan years 2018 and 2019 could be available through december 31 , 2020 .

section 205 would repeal aca section 1402 , terminating the cost - sharing subsidies ( and payments to issuers for such reductions ) , effective for plan years beginning in 2020 .
