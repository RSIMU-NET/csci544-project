construction of facilities in a fast - changing theater of war has presented dod with an extraordinarily complicated problem .

in the normal appropriations and authorization process , plans for construction projects are drafted a year or more in advance of the date construction is to begin .

experience on the ground in both iraq and afghanistan has shown that even the best of plans is likely to become outdated by the time the necessary legislation is passed and enacted .

since fy2004 , in order to provide timely assistance to commanders in the field , congress has used the annual national defense authorization act to grant dod a temporary authorization , "contingency construction authority" ( cca ) , to permit the use of a limited amount of already appropriated operations and maintenance ( o&m ) funds from the defense appropriation for construction .

reviewed and reauthorized every year since , the geographic areas where the cca may be employed , the purposes to which the funds may be put , and the ceiling imposed on the amount available have varied .

under its current authority , dod may use up to $200 million of o&m appropriations in u.s. central command ( uscentcom ) , including those portions of u.s. africa command ( usafricom ) once part of uscentcom , for construction .

if the secretary of defense certifies the need , he may use up to an additional $300 million for construction within afghanistan .

the secretary of defense has long held authority to initiate military construction projects without waiting for specific authorization and appropriation .

10 u.s.c .

§2804 permits the secretary to begin construction using already appropriated funds if he "determines that deferral of the project for inclusion in the next military construction authorization act would be inconsistent with national security or national interest" and notifies congress of his action within a specified period .

this section of title 10 is titled "contingency construction," but is permanent and distinct from the temporary authority mentioned above and should not be confused with it .

10 u.s.c .

§2805 ( "unspecified minor construction" ) permits the secretary to make very limited use of o&m funds for small construction projects .

10 u.s.c .

§2808 allows the secretary to initiate construction projects not otherwise authorized , using funds appropriated for military construction , after a declaration of war or of national emergency requiring the employment of armed forces .

in h.rept .

111-559 , the house committee noted that the use of the temporary cca has given commanders in the field added flexibility to address urgent construction requirements and that almost $1.4 billion in o&m funding has been obligated under it to date .

the committee also noted the o&m appropriations account is part of the defense appropriation , not the military construction appropriation , and its oversight lies with a subcommittee not responsible for defense construction .

the committee also pointed out that o&m funds are appropriated for other uses , such as meeting operational requirements of armed forces in the field and , to the extent they are expended on construction , they are unavailable for those ends to which they were intended .

before fy2010 , construction projects in an active military area of operations would have been requested in one or more requests for emergency supplemental appropriations .

fy2010 marked the first year that all such construction was included in the regular annual appropriation request as the obama administration migrated planned war - related construction costs away from emergency supplemental appropriations into the regular appropriations process .

fy2011 marks the first year that a "title iv: overseas contingency operations" has been included in this appropriations bill and appears to be a vehicle through which congress may address concerns for both flexibility and oversight .

the house committee recommended that all military construction funding for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) be considered emergency appropriations .

the senate committee amended the list of projects for which it recommended funding to reflect changes requested by dod since its original fy2011 request and increased the amount dedicated to unspecified minor construction in order to enhance commanders' ability to meet emerging needs .

the committee also moved all construction requested for afghanistan , whether included in regular military construction or in oco submissions , into title iv .

funding levels for the various appropriations accounts in title iv are presented in table a - 2 in appendix a .
