federal lawmakers view many financial businesses as having an important role in the u.s. economy , and therefore warrant providing these businesses protection for their individual account holders against loss , should the firms fail .

such protections exist both to protect the individuals from risks they probably could not discern for themselves and to protect the economy against the effects of financial panics when failures occur .

panics , the attendant collapses of wealth , and severe consequences for the economy occurred before congress created federal deposit insurance in 1934 .

prior to the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( eesa ; p.l .

110-343 ) , government policy protected customers of depository institutions — banks , thrift institutions , and credit unions — in full for accounts up to $100,000 and up to $250,000 for retirement accounts .

although the enactment of eesa on september 23 , 2008 , immediately raised the maximum deposit insurance to $250,000 , retirement accounts remain at $250,000 until december 31 , 2009 .

since then , congress and the president enacted the helping families save their homes act of 2009 ( hfstha ; p.l .

111-22 ) , extending both the eesa increases and the federal deposit insurance corporation's ( fdic's ) $30 billion borrowing authority from the u.s. treasury to as much as $500 billion until 2013 .

because of the wording of p.l .

111-22 , after 2013 , it is possible that deposit insurance protection could revert back to the $100,000 and $250,000 for retirement accounts .

other institutions such as insurance companies , securities broker / dealers , and many pension funds receive government or government - sponsored guarantees on specified accounts .

on october 23 , 2008 , in the midst of the current financial crisis , the fdic announced its temporary liquidity guarantee program to help unfreeze the u.s. short - term credit markets .

at the time , financial institutions were not lending to each other , especially in the commercial paper market , which was almost completely frozen .

the two - part program temporarily guarantees all new senior unsecured debt and fully guarantees funds in certain non - interest bearing accounts at fdic - insured institutions issued between october 14 , 2008 , and june 30 , 2009 , with guarantees expiring no later than june 30 , 2012 .

the fdic expects these guarantees would restore the necessary confidence for investors to begin investing in obligations of depository institutions .

evidence suggests that these short - term markets returned to normal after the tlg program was implemented .

the second part of the fdic's tlg program is to guarantee 100% of non - interest - bearing transaction accounts held in insured depository institutions until december 31 , 2009 .

this addresses the concern that many small business accounts , such as payroll accounts , frequently exceed the current maximum deposit insurance limit of $250,000 .

the tlg program is being paid for by additional fees placed on depository institutions that use these guarantees , not taxpayers .
