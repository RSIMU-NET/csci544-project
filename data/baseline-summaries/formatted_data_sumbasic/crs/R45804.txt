in recent years , the trump administration and congress have grappled with how to address the substantial number of migrants from the northern triangle countries of el salvador , guatemala , and honduras arriving to the u.s. southwest border .

many observers have criticized what they label as "catch and release," a colloquial phrase used to describe the process by which apprehended asylum seekers who lack valid documentation are subsequently released into the u.s. interior while they await their immigration hearings .

this occurs because of growing backlogs in the immigration court system leading to wait times for immigration hearings now often lasting two years or more , and a lack of appropriate detention space for families due to the limitations imposed by the flores settlement agreement , which restricts the government's ability to detain alien minors .

such observers argue that many apprehended aliens who are released into the united states do not appear for their immigration hearings and become part of the unlawfully present alien population .

in light of these circumstances , department of homeland security ( dhs ) alternatives to detention ( atd ) programs are generating increased congressional interest as a way to monitor and supervise foreign nationals who are released while awaiting their immigration hearings .

proponents of atd programs cite their substantially lower daily costs compared with detention , the high compliance rates of atd participants with immigration court proceedings , and what they characterize as a more humane approach of not detaining low - flight - risk foreign nationals , many of whom are asylum applicants ( particularly family units ) .

critics contend that atd programs provide opportunities for participants to abscond ( eg , evade removal proceedings and / or orders ) and create incentives for migration by allowing people to live in the united states for extended periods while awaiting the resolution of their case .

they also question the effectiveness of these types of monitoring programs as a removal tool ( i.e. , as a means to remove participants ordered removed from the united states ) .

dhs , for its part , states that nothing compares to detention for ensuring compliance .

however , existing capacity to hold aliens is limited .

immigration statistics indicate that while the total number of individuals apprehended at the southwest border has generally declined over the past two decades , the demographic profile of those apprehended has shifted toward a population more likely to be subject to detention .

historically , most unauthorized aliens apprehended at the southwest border have been adult mexican males who are considered to be "economic" migrants because they are primarily motivated by the opportunity to work in the united states , and who can be more easily repatriated without requiring detention .

however , over the past five years , apprehensions of aliens from the northern triangle countriesâmany of whom are reportedly fleeing violence and seeking asylum in the united statesâhave exceeded those from mexico .

since 2017 , u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) has reported a sharp increase in the number of apprehensions at the southwest border , especially among members of family units and unaccompanied alien children ( uac ) .

together , persons in family units and uac currently make up more than two - thirds of apprehensions .

in may 2018 , the number of apprehensions by the u.s. border patrol plus the number of aliens determined inadmissible by cbp's office of field operations ( ofo ) totaled 22,000 ; in april 2019 , that number was 100,569 , a 357% increase .

in contrast , the number of single adults who were apprehended or found inadmissible rose from 24,493 to 43,637 , a 46% increase , during the same time period .

foreign nationals from the northern triangle are requesting asylum at high rates that are dhs officials say are overwhelming the ability of federal agencies to process their detention , adjudication , and removal .

the u.s. border patrol is responsible for immigration enforcement at u.s. borders between ports of entry ( poes ) .

cbp's office of field operations ( ofo ) handles the same responsibilities at the poes .

foreign nationals seeking to enter the united states may request admission legally at a poe .

in some cases , aliens attempt to enter the united states illegally , typically between poes on the southern border .

if apprehended , they are processed and detained briefly by border patrol ; placed into removal proceedings ; and , depending on the availability of detention space , either transferred to the custody of immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) or released into the united states .

removal proceedings take one of two forms ( streamlined or standard ) depending on how the alien attempted to enter the united states , his / her country of origin , whether he / she is an unaccompanied child or part of an arriving family unit , and whether he / she requests asylum .

if the alien is determined by an immigration officer to be inadmissible to the united states because he / she lacks proper documentation or has committed fraud or willful misrepresentation in order to gain admission , the alien may be subject to a streamlined process known as expedited removal .

expedited removal allows for the alien to be ordered removed from the united states without any further hearings or review .

uac , however , are not subject to expedited removal .

instead , if they are subject to removal , they are placed in standard removal proceedings and transferred to the department of health and human services' ( hhs' ) office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) pending those proceedings .

although most aliens arriving in the united states without valid documentation are subject to expedited removal , they may request asylum , a form of relief granted to foreign nationals physically present within the united states or arriving at the u.s. border who meet the definition of a refugee .

during cbp's initial screening process , if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution in his / her home country , the alien is interviewed by an asylum officer from dhs's u.s .

citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) to determine whether she / he has a "credible fear of persecution. .

if the alien establishes a credible fear , she / he is placed into standard removal proceedings under immigration and nationality act ( ina ) â§240 and may pursue an asylum application at a hearing before an immigration judge .

those who receive a negative credible fear determination may request that an immigration judge review that finding .

if the immigration judge overturns the negative credible fear finding , the alien is placed in standard removal proceedings ; otherwise , the alien remains subject to expedited removal and is usually deported .

aliens may be detained or granted parole while in standard removal proceedings .

during these proceedings , immigration judges within the department of justice's ( doj's ) executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) conduct hearings to determine whether a foreign national is subject to removal or eligible for any relief or protection from removal .

while immigration judges have the authority to make custody decisions , ice makes the initial decision whether to detain or release the alien into the united states pending removal proceedings .

most asylum seekers who are members of family units are currently being released into u.s. communities to await their immigration hearings .

the ina authorizes dhs to arrest , detain , remove , or release foreign nationals subject to removal .

enforcement and removal operations ( ero ) is the office within ice that is charged with detention and removal of aliens from the united states .

generally , aliens may be detained pending removal proceedings , but detention is discretionary if the alien is not subject to mandatory detention .

detention is mandatory for certain classes of aliens ( eg , those convicted of specified crimes ) with no possibility of release except in limited circumstances .

during the intake process , an ero officer uses the ice risk classification assessment ( rca ) , a software tool that attempts to standardize custody decisions across all ero offices , to evaluate whether a foreign national should be detained or released on a case - by - case basis .

the factors used to make the detention decision include , but are not limited to , criminal history , alleged gang affiliation , previous compliance history , age ( must be at least 18 ) , community or family ties , status as a primary caregiver or provider to family members , medical conditions , or other humanitarian conditions .

typically , an alien may be released from ice custody on an order of recognizance , bond , or parole on humanitarian grounds .

for example , aliens initially screened for expedited removal who request asylum are generally subject to mandatory detention pending their credible fear determinations , and , if found to have a credible fear , pending their standard removal proceedings ; however , dhs has the discretion to parole the alien into the united states pending those proceedings .

pursuant to a court settlement agreement , alien minors may be detained by ice for only a limited period , and must be released to an adult sponsor or a non - secure , state licensed child welfare facility pending their removal proceedings .

due to these legal restrictions and a lack of appropriate facilities for family units , dhs typically releases family units with accompanying minors , if they are subject to removal , pending their removal proceedings because there are not enough licensed shelters available to detain the number of family units arriving at the southwest border .

thus , if family units entering the united states request asylum and receive a positive credible fear determination , they typically will not be detained throughout their removal proceedings .

in addition , as noted previously , uac are generally transferred to the custody of orr pending the outcome of their removal proceedings .

thus , like family units , uac typically are released from dhs custody and placed in the non - detained docket during those proceedings .

all aliens released from ice custody into the u.s. interior are assigned to the non - detained docket and must report to ice at least once a year .

ice's non - detained docket currently has approximately 3 million cases .

some portion of those in the non - detained docket are enrolled in an atd monitoring program , but all aliens in the non - detained docket are awaiting a decision on whether they should be removed from the united states .

the number of initial "book - ins" to an ice detention facility ( by ice and cbp combined ) has exceeded 300,000 annually in recent years , peaking in 2014 at 425,728 , and reaching nearly 400,000 in fy2018 .

even though there were nearly 400,000 admissions to detention in fy2018 , the number of book - ins does not describe the population of aliens who are in a detention facility on any given day .

instead , the number of aliens in detention on a given day is determined by the number of book - ins , the length of stay in detention , and the number of beds authorized by congress .

in fy2019 , the number of detention beds authorized by congress was set at 45,274 , up nearly 5,000 from the previous year , and more than 10,000 greater than fy2016 .

ice reported that 54,082 aliens were currently detained on june 22 , 2019 .

 figure 1 shows the ice caseload , which consists of all detained and non - detained aliens that ice must supervise as part of its docket management responsibilities .

as mentioned above , non - detained aliens include those released from ice custody on various types of orders , including orders of recognizance , parole , and bond , and those who were never detained .

the ice non - detained docket also includes aliens in state or federal law enforcement custody and at - large aliens with final orders of removal ( eg , fugitives ) .

those released from ice custody are required to report to ero at least once annually , but the frequency is at the discretion of ero .

the non - detained docket caseload is monitored as aliens move through immigration court proceedings until their cases close .

aliens in atd have secured a legal means of release ( i.e. , bond or parole ) ; participating in atd is a condition of their release .

as noted , ice's full non - detained caseload was approximately 3 million foreign nationals on june 22 , 2019 .

on that same date , ice reported that there were 54,082 detained aliens , less than 2% of the entire ice caseload .

included in the ice non - detained caseload are 101,568 aliens , approximately 3% of all cases ( see figure 1 ) , enrolled in isapiii .

the goal of the ice atd program is to monitor and supervise certain aliens in removal proceedings more frequently relative to those released with annual supervision .

those in atd are required to report to ero annually as well , but they are also subject to varying degrees of supervision and monitoring at more frequent intervals on a case - by - case basis ( see description of " alternatives to detention ( atd ) programs " ) .

more broadly , dhs maintains that atd programs should not be considered removal programs or a substitute for detention .

instead , according to dhs , these programs have enhanced ice's ability to monitor more intensively a subset of foreign nationals released into communities .

supporters of atd programs cite several reasons for their use .

first , the number of foreign nationals currently being taken into custody far exceeds the capacity of existing detention facilities .

as noted above , in fy2018 the number of book - ins to ice facilities was nearly 400,000 .

as of july 12 , 2018 , ice's detention capacity was approximately 45,700 beds ; of these , approximately 2,500 were for family units housed in family residential centers .

second , many foreign nationals who are in removal proceedings are not considered security or public safety threats , nor are they an enforcement priority as outlined in guidance to dhs personnel regarding immigration enforcement .

third , some foreign nationals who are found deportable or inadmissible may not be removed because their countries of citizenship refuse to confirm an individual's identity and nationality , issue travel documents , or otherwise accept their physical return .

a u.s. supreme court ruling from 2001 , zadvydas v. davis , limits the federal government's authority to indefinitely detain aliens who have been ordered removed and who have no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future .

those who promote using atd programs also cite the relatively low cost compared with detention .

ice spent an average of $137 per adult per day in detention nationwide in fy2018 .

the cost of enrolling foreign nationals in the isap iii program depends on the method of management , but the average daily cost per participant in fy2018 ( through july 2018 ) was $4.16 .

gao utilized two methods of determining the cost of atd ( isap ii ) relative to detention in fy2013 ( at that time , the average daily cost of isap ii was $10.55 , while daily detention was an average of $158 ) .

first , given the average daily costs of atd and detention , and the average length of time an alien spent in detention awaiting an immigration judge's final decision , gao found that the cost of maintaining an enrollee in isap ii would surpass the costs of detention only if the enrollee were in the program for 1,229 days , which would be 846 days longer than the average number of days a participant typically spent in it .

second , given the average cost of atd and detention , and the average length of time an alien spent in detention regardless of whether a final decision on her / his case was rendered , gao determined an individual would have to spend , on average , 435 days in isap ii before they exceeded the cost of the average length of detention ( 29 days in fy2013 ) .

there are also arguments against using atd programs .

of primary concern is that the programs , in comparison to detention , create opportunities for aliens in removal proceedings to abscond and become part of the unauthorized population who are not allowed to lawfully live or work in the united states .

because immigration judges must prioritize detained cases , atd enrollees must often wait several years before their cases are heard , during which time they may abscond .

they may also fall out of contact with ero for other reasons .

for example , an alien may move within the united states and fail to provide updated contact information to ero .

if they do not receive communication from ice or the immigration court system , they could miss court dates that have changed in the interim .

if they fail to show up for a removal hearing , for example , they can be ordered removed in absentia , which would render them inadmissible for a certain period ( at least 5 years if they are an arriving alien , and at least 10 years for all other aliens ) and ineligible for certain forms of relief from removal for 10 years .

another concern is that asylum - seeking families are often placed into atd , and this creates incentives for others to travel to the united states with children , request asylum , and receive similar conditions of release into the united states .

dhs has expressed concern over adults using children as a "human shields" to avoid detention after illegally entering the united states .

those without bona fide family relationships may travel with children and file fraudulent claims or do harm to children .

recent reports of children being "recycled"âcrossing into the united states with an adult or a family , only to be returned across the border to travel with another migrantâhas prompted dhs to take biometric data , such as fingerprints , from children .

additional arguments against using atd programs include that reliable measures of their effectiveness are limited , as discussed above in " evaluating atd " and "evaluating fcmp," and for the fcmp pilot , that the feasibility of scaling up a small pilot program to accommodate the large number of families requesting asylum remains an open question .
