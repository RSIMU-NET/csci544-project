on december 26 , 2007 , the president signed the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( h.r .

2764 ) into law ( p.l .

110-161 ) as shown in table 1 .

this act includes the fy2008 commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ( cjs ) appropriations bill , as well as 10 other appropriations bills , in addition to emergency military funding for iraq and afghanistan .

congressional leaders opted to use the department of state , foreign operations , and related appropriations bill , 2008 ( h.r .

2764 ) as the legislative vehicle for the fy2008 omnibus spending measure .

in an exchange of amendments between the senate and house , congress completed action on h.r .

2764 during december 17-19 , 2007 .

in p.l .

110-161 , congress has appropriated $54.637 billion for the federal departments , bureaus , agencies , administrations , offices and activities funded under the cjs appropriations bill .

congress had previously passed continuing resolutions to fund those departments and agencies in the absence of the regular fy2008 cjs appropriation .

regarding the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , representative david obey , chair of the house appropriations committee , had an explanatory statement on the fy2008 omnibus spending measure inserted into the december 17 th congressional record that included detailed funding tables and additional information .

in january 2008 , the house appropriations committee issued a committee print on the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , that includes legislative text and the explanatory statement ( with some modifications ) that was previously inserted into the congressional record .

 table 2 shows funding levels for the departments and related agencies currently under the jurisdictions of the house and senate cjs appropriations subcommittees for fy2007 enacted , fy2008 requested , fy2008 house - reported and - passed , fy2008 senate - reported and - passed , and fy2008 enacted .

not shown in table 2 are enacted and proposed rescissions of "unobligated balances" and "prior year appropriations. .

those rescissions , however , are given below in summary table 11 at report's end .

the origin of the department of commerce dates back to 1903 with the establishment of the department of commerce and labor ( 32 stat .

825 ) .

the separate department of commerce was established on march 4 , 1913 ( 37 stat .

7365 ; 15 u.s.c .

1501 ) .

the department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied , but its activities center on five basic missions: ( 1 ) promoting the development of u.s. business and increasing foreign trade ; ( 2 ) improving the nation's technological competitiveness ; ( 3 ) encouraging economic development ; ( 4 ) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment ; and ( 5 ) compiling , analyzing , and disseminating statistical information on the u.s. economy and population .

the following agencies within the commerce department carry out these missions: international trade administration ( ita ) seeks to develop the export potential of u.s. firms and to improve the trade performance of u.s. industry ; bureau of industry and security ( formerly the bureau of export administration ) enforces u.s. export laws consistent with national security , foreign policy , and short - supply objectives ; economic development administration ( eda ) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions ; minority business development agency ( mbda ) seeks to promote private and public sector investment in minority businesses ; economic and statistical analysis programs provide: ( 1 ) timely information on the state of the economy through preparation , development , and interpretation of economic data ; and ( 2 ) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities .

much of this analysis is conducted by the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) ; bureau of the census collects , compiles , and publishes a broad range of economic , demographic , and social data ; national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) advises the president on domestic and international communications policy , manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum , and performs research in telecommunications sciences ; patent and trademark office ( pto ) examines and approves applications for patents for claimed inventions and registration of trademarks ; technology administration , through the office of technology policy , advocates integrated policies that seek to maximize the impact of technology on economic growth , conducts technology development and deployment programs , and disseminates technological information ; national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality , modernize manufacturing processes , ensure product reliability , and facilitate rapid commercialization of products based on new scientific discoveries ; and national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) provides scientific , technical , and management expertise to ( 1 ) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation ; ( 2 ) assess the health of coastal and marine resources ; ( 3 ) monitor and predict the coastal , ocean , and global environments ( including weather forecasting ) ; and ( 4 ) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources .

as table 4 shows , the fy2008 enacted appropriation ( p.l .

110-161 ) included $6.856 billion for the department of commerce , which was $231 million more than the fy2007 appropriation of $6.625 billion , a 3.5% increase .

fy2008 enacted amount was 3.9% more than the president's request of $6.596 .

the president's request had represented a decrease of $29.0 million , or 0.4% , from the fy2007 appropriation for the department .

by comparison , the senate had passed ( s. 1745 ) a total of $7.289 billion for fy2008 , or $664.5 million more than the fy2007 enacted level and $693.4 million more than the president's fy2008 request .

the house had passed ( h.r .

3093 ) a total of $7.018 billion for fy2008 , or $393.7 million more than the fy2007 enacted level , $422.6 million above the president's fy2008 request , although $270.8 million less than the senate .

science agencies include the white house's office of science and technology policy , national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and national science foundation .

for these science agencies , as table 7 shows , congress has appropriated $23.38 billion for fy2008 , or $1.173 billion more than the fy2007 appropriation of $22.207 billion ( a 5.3% increase ) , but $364 million less than the administration's budget request of $23.744 billion .

nasa accounts for 74% of the total amount enacted for fy2008 for science agencies .

the fy2008 request for science agencies was $23.744 billion , or $1.537 billion more than the fy2007 enacted amount for those agencies ( a proposed 6.9% increase ) .

the house - passed bill would have provided $24.127 billion , or $1.920 billion more than that fy2007 amount ( an 8.6% increase ) .

the senate - passed bill would have provided $25.019 billion , or $2.812 billion more than the fy2007 amount ( a 12.7% increase ) .

the senate - passed amount for nasa included $1 billion in emergency funding .

the fy2008 appropriations for related agencies is $809 million as table 10 shows .

this amount is $46.3 million more than the administration's request and $8 million more than the fy2007 appropriations for those agencies .

fy2008 funding was appropriated for all related agencies except for the antitrust modernization commission , for which the authorization has expired ( as discussed below ) .

the fy2008 budget request included nearly $763 million for these agencies , $38.2 million less than the amount appropriated by congress for these agencies for fy2007 .

however , the request included no additional funding for the antitrust modernization commission , the national veterans business development corporation , or the state justice institute .

the senate - passed bill included funding for the state justice institute , but would not have funded the other two agencies .

nevertheless , the senate - passed bill would have provided nearly $99.0 million over the fy2007 enacted level for title iv agencies for fy2008 , with the largest increases going to the equal employment opportunity commission and the legal services corporation .

by comparison , the house - passed bill would have provided $45 more than the fy2007 enacted level for fy2008 .

the antitrust modernization commission act ( p.l .

107-273 , enacted 11 / 2 / 02 ) created a 12-person commission to evaluate u.s. antitrust laws .

the commission issued its final report on april 3 , 2007 .

the commission expired at the end of may , 2007 .

the president's fy2008 request does not include any continued funding for the antitrust modernization commission .

this follows $1.2 million enacted in fy2006 and $0.5 million in fy2007 .

neither the house - nor the senate - passed bills include any funding in fy2008 .

the final product was the antitrust modernization commission: report and recommendations .

in preparation for this report , the commission held 18 hearings and interviewed 117 witnesses .

the topics included merger enforcement , exclusionary conduct , international antitrust , and criminal remedies , among others .

the final report included recommendations organized under ( 1 ) substantive law , ( 2 ) enforcement institutions , ( 3 ) civil and criminal penalties , and ( 4 ) government exceptions to free - market competition .

the report also included separate statements submitted by the individual commissioners .

congress appropriated no additional funding for this commission for fy2008 .

the u.s. commission on civil rights ( commission ) , established by the civil rights act of 1957 , investigates allegations of citizens , who may have been denied the right to vote based on color , race , religion , or national origin ; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws ; assesses federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights ; and submits reports on its findings to the president and congress when the commission or the president deems it appropriate .

for fy2008 , the bush administration requested $8.8 million for the u.s. commission on civil rights , or $172 thousand less than the fy2007 enacted level of nearly $9 million for the commission .

both the house - and senate - passed bills would have provided $9 million for the commission .

the commission's enacted fy2008 budget is $8.5 million .

in report language , the house appropriations committee expressed concern that 36 of the 51 state advisory committees are inoperative because their authorizing charters have expired .

the house committee directed the commission to give priority to reconstituting the state advisory committees and to make appointments that reflect a balance of viewpoints and a diversity in membership , especially in terms of gender , disability , party affiliation , and civil rights experience with affected communities .

further , the committee stated that no one should be denied an opportunity to serve on a state advisory committee because of race , age , sex , sexual orientation , religion , national origin , disability , or political persuasion .

the eeoc enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability .

in recent years , appropriators have been particularly concerned about the agency's implementation of a restructuring plan .

the plan includes the national contact center ( ncc ) pilot project that began in march 2005 ; the january 2006 commencement of field structure and staff realignment that the commission approved in mid - 2005 ; and the examination of headquarters' structure and operations to streamline functions and clarify roles and responsibilities .

for fy2008 , p.l .

110-161 provides $329.3 million for the eeoc , which is an increase of $6.5 million from the fy2007 enacted level and $1.6 million from the president's request .

this amount also includes $29.1 million for payments to state and local entities that work with the agency .

the act requires that the eeoc must notify the house and senate appropriations committees of any proposal for workforce repositioning , restructuring , or reorganization .

further , the joint explanatory statement directs the eeoc: to provide a spending plan within 60 days after enactment highlighting the changes the commission plans to make to reduce backlog and handle calls after the termination of the ncc , to use a portion of the funds to upgrade the eeoc's telephone technology and to hire staff in field offices to handle calls , and to notify and consult congress if the ncc extends beyond february 1 , 2008 .

the president's fy2008 budget request for the eeoc was $327.7 million , which was $1 million below the fy2007 enacted level of $322.8 million .

the budget included $28 million for payments to state and local entities with which the agency has work - sharing agreements to address workplace discrimination within their jurisdictions ( i.e. , fair employment practices agencies , fepas , and tribal employment rights organizations , teros ) ; this was the same amount requested last year and less than the $33 million to which the congress typically has raised the allocation .

the request also included $1 million to relocate the eeoc's headquarters in washington , d.c .

in addition , the administration proposed reconfiguring or relocating field offices to comply with reduced space requirements .

the house appropriations committee directed the eeoc to use the increase to reduce its backlog of discrimination complaints and to report to the committee on steps that will be taken to cut the backlog .

reflecting previously expressed concerns about the ncc pilot , the committee eliminated the $2.5 million that had been requested for it .

it recommended that those funds instead be used to update current telephone technology and hire additional field staff to handle phone calls or locate an in - house call center in surplus space at eeoc offices .

in report language , the senate appropriations committee also expressed concern about the large backlog of employment discrimination charges and pointed to findings in the inspector general's report on the ncc to support prohibiting the use of funds in s. 1745 to operate it .

the committee also called upon the inspector general ( ig ) to evaluate the effect of the commission's repositioning plan on the delivery of core services and any cost savings associated with it ; the ig is directed to submit a report within 90 days of the act's enactment .

in addition , the senate appropriations committee included an amendment to h.r .

3093 by senator alexander previously approved by the committee barring the eeoc from using its appropriation to initiate or participate in a civil action against an employer who requires an employee to speak english while at work .

representative frelinghuysen offered a motion to instruct house conferees to agree to the amendment that senator alexander originally had proposed ; the motion was approved .

some members of the congressional hispanic caucus protested in response .

however , p.l .

110-161 did not include the english at work provision .

the itc is an independent , quasi - judicial agency that advises the president and congress on the impact of u.s. foreign economic policies on u.s. industries and , along with the import administration unit of ita , is charged with administering various u.s. trade remedy laws .

its six commissioners are appointed by the president for nine - year terms .

as a matter of policy , its budget request is submitted to congress by the president without revision .

for fy2008 , p.l .

110-161 provides itc with $68.4 million , or $6.4 million over the fy2007 enacted budget level and the same amount requested by the administration .

the lsc is a private , non - profit , federally funded corporation that provides grants to local offices that , in turn , provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( non - criminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annual appropriations bills , congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases .

current lsc funding remains below the lsc's highest funding level of $400 million in fy1994 and fy1995 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) includes $350.5 million for the lsc for fy2008 .

this amount is $1.9 million above the fy2007 appropriation ( $348.6 million ) for the lsc and $39.6 million above the administration's fy2008 budget request for the lsc .

the fy2008 appropriation for the lsc includes $332.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $12.5 million for management and administration ; $2.1 million for client self - help and information technology ; $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $0.5 million for loan repayment assistance .

for fy2008 , the bush administration requested $310.9 million for the lsc .

the administration's budget request included $289 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; almost $13 million for management and administration ; $5 million for client self - help and information technology ; and $3 million for the office of the inspector general .

for fy2008 , the senate appropriations committee recommended $390 million for the lsc , a $41.4 million increase above the fy2007 lsc appropriation , and $79.1 million above the administration's fy2008 budget request for the lsc .

during the senate debate on the bill , an amendment by senator jeff bingaman was passed that would have permitted lsc - funded legal services programs to provide legal assistance to "h2b" workers — temporary foreign workers employed in the forestry industry — in matters directly related to their employment .

lsc - funded programs are currently prohibited from serving h2b workers .

the senate - passed bill would have provided $390 million for the lsc for fy2008 .

the house - passed bill , by comparison , would have provided $377 million for the lsc , a $28.4 million increase above the fy2007 appropriation , $66.1 million above the administration's fy2008 budget request , and $13 million below the senate - passed bill .

the mmc is an independent agency of the executive branch , established under title ii of the marine mammal protection act ( mmpa ; p.l .

92-522 ) .

the mmc reviews and makes recommendations on domestic and international actions and policies of all federal agencies with respect to marine mammal protection and conservation and with carrying out a related research program .

as funding permits , the mmc supports research to further the purposes of the mmpa .

in 2005 , the mmc awarded seven competitive grants totaling approximately $252 thousand plus an additional three non - competitive grants totaling approximately $40 thousand .

the fy2007 revised continuing appropriations resolution ( p.l .

110-10 ) provided the mmc with nearly $2.9 million for fy2007 .

in its report on fy2007 appropriations for the mmc ( h.rept .

109-520 ) , the house appropriations committee urged the mmc to continue prioritizing activities related to minimizing the direct and indirect effects of chemical contaminants , marine debris , noise , and other forms of ocean pollution on marine mammals and other marine organisms .

the president's fy2008 budget request for the mmc was $2.3 million .

the senate - passed bill included $3 million for the mmc .

the senate committee stated that the proposed increase would ... cover the costs of inflation , and for necessary expenses including the hiring of one full - time equivalent [fte] to help ensure the commission meets its responsibilities .

this increase will allow the commission to address a variety of challenges including climate change and the continued study of endangered species .

the senate committee also stated that the mmc would ... also pursue a number of projects including , but not limited to , completing a report on federal spending for marine mammal research over the past three decades , reviewing cumulative effects of risk factors on marine mammals , and the continuance of work with national marine fisheries service , and the fish and wildlife service to assess issues related to marine mammal and fishery interactions .

the house - passed bill would have provided $3 million for the mmc to increase funding to monitor marine mammal adaptation to climate change .

the house committee expressed its expectations that the mmc ... continue its efforts to minimize the direct and indirect effects of fisheries , noise , disease , chemical contaminants , harmful algal blooms , climate change , habitat alteration , boating and commercial shipping , marine debris , and other factors that may pose a risk of sublethal and lethal effects on marine mammals or that may affect the health and stability of the marine ecosystem .

the enacted fy2008 mmc appropriation is $2.8 million .

the vbc was established under the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 ( p.l .

106-50 ) .

the corporation's mission is to foster entrepreneurship and business opportunities for veterans , including service - disabled veterans .

the vbc provides veterans with access to capital and business services , entrepreneurial education , surety bonding , insurance and prescription coverage , as well as a veterans business directory .

congress provided the corporation with $1.5 million in funding for each year , fy2006 and fy2007 .

for fy2008 , the administration requested no funding for the vbc , however .

nor did the senate - passed bill include any funding for the vbc .

the house - passed bill would have provided $2.5 million for the vbc .

house report language also directs the corporation to submit a spending plan to the committee within in 30 days of enactment that breaks out funding for overhead costs , salary , benefits and places of operation for all of its community based organizations .

the enacted fy2008 vbc appropriation is $1.4 million .

ustr , located in the executive office of the president ( eop ) , is responsible for developing and coordinating u.s. international trade and direct investment policies .

the ustr is responsible for advancing u.s. interests at the wto and negotiating bilateral and regional free trade agreements ( ftas ) .

in 2006 and 2007 , the administration concluded ftas with peru , colombia , oman , panama , and south korea .

the administration has ongoing negotiations with thailand , malaysia , and the united arab emirates .

in 2006 , ustr obtained congressional approval of ftas with bahrain , the dominican republic , and central american countries .

the office had 229 full - time employees in fy2007 .

for fy2008 , congress has appropriated $44.1 million for ustr , or $100 thousand less than the fy2007 enacted level of $44.2 million and $300 thousand less than the administration's request .

by comparison , the house - passed bill included $48.4 million for the ustr , and the senate - passed bill included $47.8 million .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sji is authorized to present its budget request directly to congress , apart from the president's budget .

the fy2008 sji appropriation is $3.76 million , an 8.7% increase over the $3.46 million appropriated for both fy2007 and fy2006 .

the bush administration , as in its budgets for the previous five years , did not request any appropriated funds for the institute in fy2008 .

the house - passed bill included $4.64 million for sji in fy2008 , while the senate - passed bill included $3.5 million for sji .
