the 116 th congress began with 57 african american members , the highest number ever at the beginning of a congress .

after the death of an african american house member in october 2019 , the current 56 african american members represent the following proportions of the entire congress , and of the house and senate separately: 10.1% of voting members in the congress ( 54 of 535 , does not include the delegates and resident commissioner ) ; 10.4% of total members in the congress ( 56 of 541 , includes the delegates and resident commissioner ) ; 11.7% of voting members in the house ( 51 of 435 , does not include the delegates and resident commissioner ) ; 12.0% of total members in the house ( 53 of 441 , includes the delegates and resident commissioner ) ; and 3.0% of total members in the senate ( 3 of 100 ) .

table 1 provides more detail on these african american members across the 116 th congress .

in addition to data for the 116 th congress , this report provides historical information .

the report also includes an appendix with an alphabetical listing of african american members , selected biographical information , and committee assignments during their tenure in congress .

numerous studies of congress have examined the role and impact of african americans in congress .

many of these studies relate to larger questions about the nature of representation or about congress as an institution .

central to these studies have been questions about the following: descriptive representation ( i.e. , representation by those who share demographic characteristics with their constituents ) and substantive representation ( i.e. , representation of policy preferences and a linkage to policy outcomes ) in the representation of minority electoral and policy interests , as well as any linkage or trade - offs between the two .

while the former concentrates on election outcomes ( eg , percentages of congressional seats ) , the latter focuses on behaviors and actions once an elected official is in office .

the voting rights act of 1965 , impact of majority - minority districts in representing minority interests in a district , and influence of majority - minority districts on electoral and policy preferences in surrounding districts .

these studies have also examined recent court rulings .

the relationship of minority members of congress with their constituents , including any impact on turnout , electoral competitiveness or strategies , hiring of minority staff , communication styles , constituency services , and voter satisfaction and engagement .

legislative activities and influence , including work in committees , floor speeches , bill introduction and passage , cosponsorship , coalition formation , career progression and seniority , and relations with congressional leadership .

roll - call voting behavior , including voting cohesion compared to party or state delegations .

positions on various domestic or international issues .

the first african american to serve in the senate , hiram revels of mississippi , was sworn in on february 23 , 1870 .

the first african american to serve in the house , joseph rainey of south carolina , was sworn in on december 12 , 1870 .

both chambers subsequently had periods without any african american members .

the longest period for the house stretched from the 57 th congress ( 1901-1903 ) until the beginning of the 71 st congress ( 1929-1931 ) , or 28 years .

the longest period for the senate stretched from the beginning of the 47 th congress ( 1881-1883 ) until the beginning of the 90 th congress ( 1967-1968 ) , or 86 years .

african american membership in the house first reached 10 members during the 91 st congress ( 1969-1970 ) , and voting membership first exceeded 5% during the 100 th congress ( 1987-1988 ) .

another large increase occurred during the 103 rd congress ( 1993-1994 ) , which was the first congress after the redistricting that followed the 1990 u.s. census .

the 116 th congress began with the highest number of african american members ever for the start of a congress: 57 ( 52 representatives , 2 delegates , and 3 senators ) .

table 2 provides a summary of the 162 african americans who have served in the house , senate , and both chambers .

of these 162 members , 22 began their service after the civil war but prior to the start of the 20 th century ( 2 in the senate , 20 in the house ) .

article i , section 2 of the u.s. constitution requires that all members of the house of representatives must be "chosen every second year by the people of the several states. .

therefore , all 153 of the african americans who have served in the house entered office through election , even those who entered after a seat became open during a congress .

by contrast , the seventeenth amendment to the constitution , which was ratified in 1913 , gives state legislatures the option to empower governors to fill congressional senate vacancies by temporary appointment .

the seventeenth amendment also provides for direct elections of senators by the "people" of a state .

previously , senators were elected by legislative selection rather than through the direct elections by which representatives to congress were elected .

of the 10 african americans who have served in the senate , two were elected prior to the ratification of the seventeenth amendment to the constitution ; four initially entered senate service by winning a regular election ; one initially entered senate service by winning a special election and was subsequently reelected ; and three were appointed .

of these three , one was a candidate for reelection and served in more than one congress .

in 1971 , the 13 african americans then serving in the house established the congressional black caucus .

in the 116 th congress , the cbc is one of more than 270 registered congressional member organizations ( cmos ) in the house .

house cmos are required to register with the committee on house administration .

cmos do not receive separate funding , and they have not since a change in the rules of the house adopted for the 104 th congress .

members may use their members' representational allowance ( mra ) to support staff , including shared staff , assigned to cmo duties .

members , rather than the cmo , remain the employing authority , and the cmo is not an independent entity .

the committee's members' congressional handbook lists a number of additional regulations related to the staffing and funding of cmos .

cmos are not required to register in the senate .

as in the house , informal congressional groups or organizations do not receive separate funding .

the cbc cmo is distinct from the congressional black caucus foundation , which was established in 1976 and is a â§501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization .

a number of african americans in congress , listed in table 5 , have held positions in their party's leadership .

all of these party leadership positions have been in the house .

the first african american member to be elected to any party leadership position was shirley chisholm ( d - ny ) , who served as house democratic caucus secretary in the 95 th and 96 th congresses ( 1977-1980 ) .

as chair of the senate select committee on the levees of the mississippi river ( 45 th congress ) , blanche k. bruce was the first african american to chair any congressional committee .

as chair of the house committee on expenditures in the executive departments ( 81 st congress ) , william l. dawson was the first african american to chair a house committee .

in total , 23 african americans have chaired a house committee ; 1 african american has chaired a senate committee ; and 2 african american representatives have chaired a joint committee .

these chairmanships include standing , special , and select committees .

some african americans have chaired multiple committees in the house .

in the 116 th congress , four african american representatives currently chair four different house standing committees .

a total of 47 african american women have served in congress .

of these , 25 serve in the 116 th congress ( including 2 delegates ) , a record number .

the previous record was 22 ( including 2 delegates ) , which was reached at the end of the 115 th congress .

the african american women members of the 116 th congress are listed in table 7 .

african american women comprise 25 of the 131 women currently serving in the 116 th congress ( 19.1% ) and 25 of the 57 african americans currently serving in the 116 th congress ( 43.9% ) .
