the federal government is the largest energy consumer in the united states .

within the federal government , the u.s. department of defense ( dod ) consumes more energy than any other agency .

in fy2017 , dod consumed 707.9 trillion british thermal units ( btu ) of energyâroughly 16 times that of the second largest consumer in the federal government , the u.s .

postal service ( figure 1 ) .

in fy2017 , dod spent approximately $11.9 billion on energy , roughly 76% of the entire federal government's energy expenditures , and roughly 2% of dod's fy2017 budget .

energy efficiencyâproviding the same or an improved level of service with less energyâover time can lead to a reduction in agency expenses .

dod uses energy for a variety of purposes across the various services of the military .

for example , dod's efficient management of energy can also lead to less refueling and fewer fuel convoys .

reducing the frequency and duration of fueling in combat zones could reduce exposure and risk which could save lives .

this report provides an introduction to federal energy management rules applicable to dod .

the report includes an overview of federal statutes and executive orders that govern dod energy management , and presents data on the status and trends for dod energy use .

further , the scope of this report excludes nuclear energy for the propulsion of aircraft carriers , submarines , and energy used for military space operations .

the report also references agency level guiding documents that provide the basis for how dod implements these policies .

finally , this report identifies selected considerations for congress .

federal energy management requirements include reductions in fossil fuel consumption , increases in renewable energy use , and energy efficiency targets for government fleets and buildings .

in addition to the energy management requirements that apply to federal agencies , dod's energy policy is designed to ensure the readiness of u.s. armed forces through energy security and resilience .

dod , through statute ( eg , 10 u.s.c .

â§2922e ) , has authority to suspend certain requirements to meet established operational military demands .

dod categorizes energy as either "installation" or "operational. .

installation energy refers to "energy needed to power fixed installations and enduring locations as well as non - tactical vehicles ( ntvs ) . .

installation energy historically represents roughly 30% of dod total energy and is subject to federal energy efficiency and conservation requirements , as reported to congress in the aemrr .

in fy2017 , dod spent $3.48 billion on installation energy and ntv fuels .

operational energy ( eg , jet fuel ) is "the energy required for training , moving , and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations and trainingâincluding energy used by tactical power systems and generators at non - enduring locations. .

federal energy management requirements outlined in appendix a and appendix b do not apply to operational energy .

however , under 10 u.s.c .

2926 , dod does have an operational energy policy to promote readiness of military missions .

from fy2003 to fy2017 the federal government reduced total site - delivered energy use by 19.2% compared to the fy2003 baseline in all sectors .

during the same time period , dod reduced site - delivered energy use by 20.9% .

while overall , dod has reduced energy use , its energy use has not necessarily been consistent from one year to the next .

for example , during the war in iraq ( fy2003 to fy2004 ) , energy use increased from 895 trillion btu to 960 trillion btu , as shown in figure 2 .

some questions congress may be interested in considering include: what kind of federal energy efficiency requirements should dod have for operational energy , if any ? .

to what extent do federal energy management targets need to be updated ? .

what role is there for congress to clarify or provide oversight on implementing federal energy management goals ? .

how are alternative financing mechanisms supporting dod's attainment of federal energy management goals ? .

to what extent should congress support these mechanisms ? .

as noted , existing statutory energy management goals do not apply to operational energy , but dod's operational energy policy is mandated by 10 u.s.c .

2926 .

as part of the operational energy policy , dod establishes a strategy including plans and performance metrics .

further , dod is mandated to submit to congress both a report on the strategy ( operational energy strategy ) and a report certifying that the proposed presidential budget supports the implementation of the strategy ( operational energy budget certification report ) .

operational energy comprises 70% of energy use within dod , much of which consists of petroleum - based fuels .

federal energy management goals do not apply to most of dod's energy use .

congress may consider setting mission priorities for dod .

congress could also consider mandating whether or not dod should prioritize energy access over energy conservation , or vice versa .

while making operational equipment more fuel efficient could increase range and decrease refueling convoys , the challenge is how to prioritize maintaining combat readiness and mission operations .

congress may consider legislation addressing operational energy , such as setting a standard fuel efficiency target or a requirement for alternative fuel use .

congress may also consider continuing to leave operational energy efficiency goals to be determined by dod or each military branch .

while this option could provide more flexibility , it could also lead to some challenges .

for instance , in 2009 , navy secretary ray mabus announced plans for the navy to consume half of all fuel from alternative sources by 2020 ( see textbox on secretary of the navy energy goals ) .

the announcement also included a 2016 goal to deploy a carrier strike group using alternative fuels ( eg , nuclear power , biofuels ) and energy conservation measures , an initiative known as the great green fleet .

the great green fleet deployed in 2016 and conducted operations using alternative fuels and energy - efficient technologies and operating procedures .

some critics of the navy energy goals noted that the navy implemented these energy targets based on limited analysis .

for instance , a house armed services committee hearing in march 2012 inquired how the navy determined the 50% goal for biofuel use , how it was determined that 50% was the amount the navy should have , whether it could be attained by 2020 , and what metrics were used to make this determination .

a 2011 study by logistics management institute ( lmi ) was referenced as a source that outlined the attainability of the goal ; however , it had been released two years after the announcement of the energy plan .

supporters of the navy's energy goals noted the benefits of a more diverse fuel supply and utilizing domestically produced biofuels .

dod is subject to oil price volatility , as such a more diverse fuel supply could potentially reduce dependence on the volatile market ( see textbox on department of defense fuel procurement ) .

according to assistant secretary of the navy , energy , installations , and environment jackalyne pfannenstiel's 2012 testimony , "without more domestically produced fuels , the [navy] will continue to be subjected to fuel price volatility and be compelled to trade training , facility sustainment , and needed programs to pay for unplanned bills. .

if congress were to set a target , reporting data and status updates could also be included in legislation to provide increased accountability of these programs .

according to a 2016 naval announcement , the alternative fuel used for the great green fleet was cost competitive and was made from 10% beef tallow and 90% marine diesel .

in many cases , federal energy management goals in statute or executive order established targets for fy2015 ( eg , eisa petroleum and alternative fuel consumption targets were due no later than october 1 , 2015 ) .

several agencies , including dod , did not reach the targeted goals .

congress may consider establishing new targets .

alternatively , congress may instead remove statutory targets altogether , instead directing heads of federal agencies to establish protocols that foster efficiency and cost reductions that serve the mission of the agency .

if given the flexibility , agencies may opt to set more easily attainable targets based on budget and mission needs , which may not have as much of an impact on total federal energy use .

in march 2015 , then - secretary of energy ernest moniz convened a task force of members from the private sector , universities , and nonprofit organizations to review various components of e.o .

13693 , including target setting .

the task force argued that setting energy goals across all agencies "may drive some agencies to over - invest in the targeted area of energy - performance improvement to the detriment of other operational priorities .

conversely , uniform energy goals may understate the potential for cost - effective investments in energy efficiency for other agencies. .

primary agency concerns may include their potential cost and mission impact .

congress and agencies may have different perspectives regarding these concerns .

successful attainment of established targets have varied from agency to agency .

some agencies may inherently be more energy intensive than others and as such may face challenges financing projects to reach certain targets .

leaving targets to agencies may provide some flexibility , as not all agencies have the same energy needs .

agencies might choose to set ambitious targets that some may consider too costly and may not be based on consistent data .

in some cases , meeting targets could come at a high cost , particularly in the early stages of development .

some may argue that the high cost for early research and development ( r&d ) may be acceptable , especially if in the long term it drives costs down .

if congress were to direct dod to set a standard , dod may set a goal that could require additional r&d to develop equipment that meets the standard , but also does not diminish combat readiness .

for instance , a test of the great green fleet in the summer of 2012 reportedly cost the navy nearly $27 a gallon for 450,000 gallons of biofuel .

by 2016 , the navy achieved competitive prices with conventional fuels with a 90% diesel blend with 10% biofuel .

the navy reportedly contracted with a california firm to purchase 77 million gallons of biofuel from beef fat at $2.05 , including a 15 cent per gallon subsidy .

the 2016 doe task force report also noted the historical role of the federal government as an adopter of new technologies , providing a faster pathway toward commercial viability .

while this may not always be the most economic approach , it could provide a greater benefit to a technology's deployment into the commercial market .

further , congress may consider readjusting the baselines , as some argue that the baselines may not have been properly informed using consistent data .

for instance , according to a 2014 doe report , "goals must be based on well - informed estimates of savings potential. .

the 2014 doe report recommended that several criteria should be taken into consideration when establishing a baseline , such as weather , data quality and availability , consistency of agency mission operations , and varying degrees of savings .

the report also noted that perhaps a three - year average should be taken to set a baseline , as this helps reduce abnormal factors experienced in any particular year .

if congress establishes a new baseline , agency reporting data and perceived progress could be affected .

for example , the doe report explains , "using a more recent baseline yearâand setting a lower percent reduction goalâmay give the impression that the federal government is not doing enough to reduce energy use , when in fact significant reductions have already been made. .

in regards to eisa section 433 , federal agencies are mandated to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 80% by fy2020 , with an ultimate goal of 100% by fy2030 .

as noted , the rulemaking for this legislation has not been finalized .

without a finalized rule it is difficult to track and evaluate the progress toward this goal .

dod has not included this metric in annual reports .

congress may consider in its oversight role directing doe to finalize this rule .

alternatively , congress may consider updating the legislation , perhaps by either adjusting the targets , or removing the requirement entirely .

while tracking energy management compliance may come at a cost ( eg , labor , data collecting , etc .

 ) , the data can be used to indicate progress toward greater efficiency and could demonstrate whether or not a program has proven effective and provided cost savings .

the 2016 doe task force report notes that one of the major challenges in evaluating the energy efficiency of projects in the federal government is the lack of data concerning , "building profiles , energy usage , and energy spending over time. .

additionally , congress may consider clarifying rec ownership in legislation , instead of directing doe to issue guidance on qualifications to meet federal targets .

for instance , doe's implementation guidance for epact05 requires dod and all federal agencies to retain ownership of recs to count toward the 7.5% renewable electricity consumption goal .

however , 10 u.s.c .

â§2911 ( g ) , a 25% renewable energy production goal for dod , does not make purchasing recs mandatory .

further , according to a 2016 government accountability office ( gao ) report , dod project documentation of renewable energy goals was not always clear , especially when determining whether or not a project contributed toward a particular goal .

if congress opts to require dod to maintain ownership of recs to meet all relevant energy goals , proper data and measurement collection may be a factor to consider .

additionally , if congress were to require agency ownership of recs , dod's progress toward 10 u.s.c .

â§2911 ( g ) may decline .

for instance , the 2016 gao report reviewed documentation of 17 dod renewable energy projects .

all 17 projects contributed to 10 u.s.c .

â§2911 ( g ) , but 8 of those projects did not contribute to epact05 .

in practice , military services may not necessarily retain ownership of recs associated with all projects .

some dod services may find that relinquishing rec ownership is within the best interest of the service and the particular contract , despite not qualifying for the epact05 requirement .

the navy , for instance , has had difficulty meeting renewable energy consumption targets under epact05 , noting in the fy2017 aemrr : "the navy's performance regarding the renewable electricity goal is a function of the strategic decision to allow other parties to monetize the value of recs associated with its financed energy projects. .

in certain projects , military services might decide to relinquish rec ownership .

in some instances of espc / uesc contracts , recs can be leveraged to finance additional project improvements .

dod has steadily decreased its buildings' energy intensity in response to mandated energy reduction goals through investment in energy conservation projects .

one of the challenges dod faces in meeting these targets is implementing appropriate financing mechanisms .

espcs have become a preferred means of making energy efficiency improvements because , in part , funds do not have to be directly appropriated ( or programmed ) .

however , as energy savings contractors ( escos ) assume a certain risk in guaranteeing savings through espcs , the risk is factored into their cost .

dod has been increasing reliance on uescs and espcs .

with $2.9 billion awarded in fy2017 , these contracts can assist with increasing efficiency and meeting renewable energy management goals without up - front appropriated funds for the investment .

congress may consider options to increase the effectiveness of these mechanisms in attaining federal energy management goals .

one option may be to increase training and awareness of uescs and espcs .

a senate committee on armed services report ( s.rept .

115-125 ) accompanying ndaa fy2018 ( s. 1519 ) directed the secretary of defense to assess espcs and the potential savings through increased training .

dod disagreed with the need for more training , noting in the aemrr fy2017 , "the financial risk is too high to implement these training improvements based on assumptions about future savings and therefore [dod] will not commit limited resources to an assessment that would draw from efforts focused on energy resilience and mission assurance. .

further , dod has stated that training improvements do not necessarily guarantee behavioral changes that would contribute to energy and costs savings .

it is difficult to determine project savings if data is not being collected appropriately and consistently .

eight reports since 2013 by gao , dod inspector general ( dod ig ) , and u.s. army audit agency evaluated challenges with dod utilizing espcs .

the recommendations highlighted a lack of developed guidance for espc training , data management , and contract administration .

according to a summary dod ig report in february 2019 , the assistant secretary of defense for energy , installation , and environment , as well as navy , air force , and dla espc program managers , did not collect espc project data due to decentralization and not requesting performance and savings data , despite dod instruction .

five reports noted that base contracting officials were not complying with the measurement and verification requirements under section 432 of eisa for a number of reasons , including a lack of awareness of the requirements .

training and guidance for utilizing espcs and uescs is provided to all federal agencies through femp .

however , challenges remain .

during a december 2018 house committee on energy and commerce , subcommittee on energy hearing , leslie nicholls , strategic director for femp , noted that measurement and verification is "not necessarily consistently applied and utilized throughout the federal government. .

she further noted that femp would like to continue training both at the technical level and for contracting officers .

as noted in the february 2019 dod ig report , dod branches were implementing the ig recommendations regarding espc guidance .

congress may consider the value of training and guidance for proper measurement and data verification , and whether better data would demonstrate accurate cost savings of espcs and usecs relative to the cost of training .
