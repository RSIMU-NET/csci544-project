human - driven climate change , once considered a topic only for scientific research , has evolved into a policy debate .

congressional proposals have identified numerous actions aimed at closer observation and analysis , mandatory pollution control , financial assistance for technological change , adaptation to cope with changes , and a host of additional policy options .

despite calls to expand federal funding to address climate change , federal budgeting overall faces increasingly stark choices among competing fiscal demands .

federal funding for climate change activities was enacted at $6.37 billion for fy2008 ; adding in the effects of tax incentives , the budgetary impact of climate change - related activities totaled $7.73 billion for fy2008 .

for fy2009 , funding continues at or below those levels through march 6 , 2009 under a continuing resolution ( p.l .

110 - 329 ) .

in some cases , the continuing resolution may have sustained funding to many climate change programs at a higher level than president bush's fy2009 request , since many had been proposed to bear cuts .

tax incentives for renewable energy and other similar incentives were passed late in 2008 and the uncertainty may have affected the budgetary impacts of those incentives in fy2009 .

as the 111 th congress evaluates the value of past funding and future priorities to address climate change , this report provides an overview of federal funding and tax incentives in the context of presidential goals from 2001 through 2008 , as well as legislative requirements for these programs .

with a new administration , the context for climate change funding will change: president barack obama has outlined a new set of policies , including a goal to return u.s. greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2020 , to reduce ghg emissions by 80% below 1990 by 2050 , and to achieve these goals through a system of emission caps and trading .

as president - elect , obama stated , on december 15 , 2008 , that "the effort before us will demand coordination across the government , and my personal engagement as president. .

to assist with these , he has designated former epa administrator carol browner to be assistant to the president for energy and climate change .

it remains to be seen how his goals and new leadership in the white house will translate into funding proposals and program alignment .

budget authority in fy2008 for activities related to climate change totaled $5.44 billion , according to the office of management and budget ( omb ) .

president bush's budget request for fy2009 would have increased this funding by 12.3% , to $7.15 billion .

a continuing resolution ( cr ) ( p.l .

110 - 329 ) extended the fy2008 enacted levels through march 6 , 2009 for almost all climate - related programs .

the cr continues funding in some cases at levels higher than requested , and in some cases , lower that the request .

information has not been reported yet on any changes to climate change funding for fy2009 .

in addition , extension of tax incentives that may help to stimulate greenhouse gas reductions ( i.e. , for renewable energy investments ) were passed late in 2008 ; the uncertainty through 2008 may have altered the estimated impacts of these tax incentives for fy2009 .

by the 1990s , on - going federal research on various energy technologies and on carbon storage in soils and vegetation were recognized as potentially contributing to the technological change that would be required for a major reduction of ghg in the atmosphere .

president clinton packaged some research into the climate change technology initiative in 1998 .

president bush in 2002 repackaged many of the same activities into the u.s .

climate change technology program ( cctp ) .

the composition of the broad climate technology programs have changed over time .

the cctp was authorized by the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ) ( p.l .

109 - 58 ) .

epact directed the president to establish a committee on climate change technology to "integrate current federal climate reports" and carry out climate change technology activities and programs to implement a required strategy ( ยง1610 ( b ) ( 1 ) ) .

the secretary of energy was designated to chair this committee .

the committee was required to produce a strategy within 18 months from enactment ( which was august 8 , 2005 ) to "promote the deployment and commercialization of greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies and practices developed through research and development programs conducted by the national laboratories , other federal research facilities , institutions of higher education , and the private sector" ( ยง1610 ( c ) ( 1 ) ) .

a cctp strategic plan was published in september 2006 , envisioning a $3 billion program .

 ( by comparison , the fy2008 enacted level was $3.49 billion ; the fy2009 request was for $4.41 billion ; and , a continuing resolution continues funding at the fy2008 enacted level through march 6 , 2009. ) .

epact requires the strategy to be updated every five years or more frequently .

epact 2005 also established the climate change technology program "within the department of energy" ( ยง1610 ( d ) ) , to "carry out the programs authorized under this section. .

besides preparation of the national strategy , the programs authorized under ยง1610 are: to prepare inventories and evaluation of ghg intensity - reducing technologies , including a report to congress ; to identify the need for technology demonstration projects , including a report to congress on barriers to , and commercial risks of , technologies and a plan for demonstrations ; to develop standards and best practices for calculating , monitoring and analyzing ghg intensity ; to support demonstration projects ; and to enter into cooperative research and development agreements .

these activities are arguably much narrower than the scope of activities identified under president bush's cctp , as described in the fy2009 budget request ( and others ) .

the cctp , as defined by president bush , is composed of programs administered by 11 agencies , plus the executive office of the president .

it is coordinated by the department of energy and overseen by the interagency committee on climate change science and technology integration ( see appendix b ) .

the cctp objective is to accelerate the technological advances needed to facilitate the reduction and avoidance , as well as capture and storage , of man - made emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghg ) .

while the 2006 strategic plan sets many milestones for demonstrations of specific technologies , there are no specific targets or measures for greenhouse gas emissions or capture in the cctp strategic plan .

the six strategic goals outlined by the cctp are to advance development of technologies that: reduce emissions from energy end - use and infrastructure , reduce emissions from energy supply , capture and sequester carbon dioxide , reduce emissions of non - co 2 greenhouse gases , improve capabilities to measure and monitor ghg emissions , and bolster basic scientific contributions to technology development .

as reported by omb , federal funding for climate change technology has increased from $845 million in fy1993 to $4.53 billion enacted for fy2008 , a $3.70 billion ( 536% ) increase .

president bush's fy2009 budget requested $4.41 billion for fy2009 , a $114 million increase ( 3% ) above fy2008 .

as requested , the cctp would constitute 62% of federal funding on climate change ( as reported by omb ) .

however , the actual increase in funding for these efforts may be lower than the reported dollar amounts suggest , as the agencies and omb have redefined the initiatives included within the cctp over time .

for example , an increasing number of existing nuclear energy programs , as well as some clean coal programs , have been added to the count in later years though they existed but were not included in omb's earlier reporting of climate change technology funding .

such changes make it difficult to track the content and evolution of specific climate change technology efforts , and funding for them , across the years .

gao has made similar observations , and has identified several ways that technology funding presented in omb's more recent reports may not be comparable to previously reported technology funding , introducing uncertainty in the funding trend .

as quantified results expected from programs are set and monitored ( as required under the government performance and results act of 1993 ) , redefinitions of program areas also may complicate performance tracking and accountability , in addition to making funding comparisons difficult from year to year .

the third major program in president bush's climate change strategy was international climate change assistance , to encourage other countries to slow and then reduce their emissions of greenhouse gas emissions .

a major policy challenge is negotiating international commitments to address climate change after 2012 , and especially gaining global engagement in ghg mitigation .

developing countries have stated that their degree of participation will depend on the degree to which the industrialized countries have fulfilled their commitments under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) .

these commitments include financial and technological assistance to the lower income countries and to countries that may be harmed by policies to abate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions .

the united states , as one of the wealthiest nations and the leading emitter historically of ghg , is considered worldwide to have extraordinary responsibility to address climate change .

most people consider that , while addressing climate change must be a common , global effort , the united states must play a leading role among nations .

president bush's request would have more than tripled federal funding of climate change - related international programs , from $202 million enacted for fy2008 to $657 million for fy2009 .

the principal increase would provide a proposed $400 million "first installment" to a new clean technology fund ( ctf ) established in 2008 and managed by the world bank .

the fourth major type of financial support to climate change activities reported by the administration is tax provisions or "tax expenditures. .

tax provisions , often not for the explicit purpose of addressing climate change , may contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by establishing incentives for incremental investments in technologies ( eg , wind energy ) that emit less than the technologies they are thought to replace ( eg , fossil fuel combustion ) .

in its federal expenditures reports , omb enumerates certain tax expenditures , which are the estimated loss of federal revenues that result from taxpayers taking advantage of these preferential tax treatments .

omb's estimates of tax expenditures rose sharply overall from $580 million in fy2003 to $1.52 billion in fy2007 ( table 1 ) .

the rise in the estimates from fy2006 to fy2007 was primarily due to expected loss of revenues resulting from tax incentives included in the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .

109 - 58 ) .

these provisions were due to expire at the end of 2008 .

omb projected the estimated tax expenditures to remain at $1.52 billion for fy2008 and then fall to $1.4 billion in fy2009 , and continue to decline through 2013 .

these projections are likely altered by the extension in late 2008 of various incentives for renewable energy included in the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l .

110 - 343 ) .

one policy issue related to the tax provisions is their continuity over periods of time that are consistent with planning and construction of large capital projects , including commercial wind and other renewable energy installations .

because these take a number of years to execute , tax provisions may not predictably be available for a sufficiently long period for investors to take advantage of them for entirely new facilities ( as opposed to facilities that may already have been planned ) .

this could reduce the effectiveness of tax incentives to help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

on the other hand , the tax incentives are intended to stimulate deployment of new technologies , rather than to support a market that may not become commercially viable .

the full effects of tax incentives could be understood only in the context of other tax provisions that support activities that may aggravate climate change , such as support for fossil fuel production and use ; data on these are not provided by omb .

existence of tax incentives for both low - ghg - emitting technologies and high - ghg - emitting technologies likely counteract each other , and together would mask the full cost of energy to consumers .

while tax provisions support a variety of policy objectives , such as energy security and employment , overall efficiencies may be gained by revising the counter - acting provisions in the context of meeting several objectives together ( and supporting "win - win"measures ) .

such analysis , however , is beyond the scope of this report .

over the past two decades , federal funding related to climate change has expanded from scientific research , almost exclusively , to a wide variety of programs to: develop and disseminate technologies ; build a foundation for future policy actions ; plan for adaptation ; assist lower income countries ; and address additional needs .

as the debate continues over appropriate strategies to address climate change , the needs and priorities for funding are likely to evolve further .

appendix a. statutory language requiring reports to congress on federal climate change expenditures unlike in previous years , the congress did not include statutory language in the fy2008 appropriations law or in the fy2009 continuing resolution requiring the administration to reports to congress on federal expenditures for climate change activities .

in previous years , for about a decade , congress had included specific language in the annual appropriations bill for foreign operations , requiring the president to report to congress on all federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs and activities .

language was not included in the revised continuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 ( p.l .

110 - 5 ) , which funded foreign operations and many other federal agencies and activities .

however , that law did require agencies to adhere to the same authorities and conditions that were enacted for fy2006 , in effect continuing the requirement for the president to report on climate change obligations and expenditures in fy2007 .

congress most recently included a reporting requirement in the foreign operations , export financing , and related programs appropriations act for fy2006 ( section 585 ( b ) of p.l .

109 - 102 ) .

previous requirements were stated in: section 555 ( b ) , division e of p.l .

108-7 , the consolidated appropriations resolution , fy2003 ; division d , title v , section 555 ( b ) of p.l .

108-199 , the consolidated appropriations act , fy2004 ; division d , title v , section 576 ( b ) of p.l .

108-447 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ; title v , section 585 ( b ) of p.l .

109-102 , the foreign operations , export financing , and related programs appropriations act , 2006 , as carried forward under p.l .

110-5 , requires the president to transmit a report to congress on climate change expenditures within 60 days after transmittal of the president's budget .

the statutory language from section 585 ( b ) of p.l .

109 - 102 is provided below: climate change report - not later than 60 days after the date on which the president's fiscal year 2007 budget request is submitted to congress , the president shall submit a report to the committees on appropriations describing in detail the following โ ( 1 ) all federal agency obligations and expenditures , domestic and international , for climate change programs and activities in fiscal year 2006 , including an accounting of expenditures by agency with each agency identifying climate change activities and associated costs by line item as presented in the president's budget appendix ; and ( 2 ) all fiscal year 2005 obligations and estimated expenditures , fiscal year 2006 estimated expenditures and estimated obligations , and fiscal year 2007 requested funds by the united states agency for international development , by country and central program , for each of the following: ( i ) to promote the transfer and deployment of a wide range of united states clean energy and energy efficiency technologies ; ( ii ) to assist in the measurement , monitoring , reporting , verification , and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ; ( iii ) to promote carbon capture and sequestration measures ; ( iv ) to help meet such countries' responsibilities under the framework convention on climate change ; and ( v ) to develop assessments of the vulnerability to impacts of climate change and mitigation and adaptation response strategies .

appendix b. interagency coordination of climate change under president george w. bush in 2002 , president george w. bush announced a goal to cut the u.s. greenhouse gas intensity โ the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of economic activity ( gdp ) โ by 18% through 2012 .

in parallel , u.s. programs to address climate change have aimed at: reducing scientific uncertainties ; advancing development and introduction of energy efficient , renewable , and other low - or non - emitting technologies ; and improving standards for measuring and registering emissions reductions .

specific outcome - oriented performance targets were set for selected programs , such as for greenhouse gas reductions achieved by epa's appliance efficiency energy star program , and several other voluntary partnerships .

quantitative greenhouse gas , science , or technology performance targets have not been identified for most of the climate - related funding requests .

on april 16 , 2008 , president george w. bush announced a new national goal for climate policy โ to halt increases in u.s. emissions of ghg by 2025 .

emissions would begin to decline thereafter "so long as technology continues to advance. .

according to president bush , the united states would achieve this goal by regulatory measures and market incentives to encourage use of clean technologies .

president bush said that the united states would be willing to include this plan in a future international agreement as long as all other major emitting economies also include their plans in the agreement .

some stakeholders have criticized the new bush policy for proposing any cap on future emissions , while others have criticized it as too little , too late .

president bush's 2002 strategy established a new cabinet - level committee on climate change science and technology integration ( figure b - 1 ) to oversee the implementation of the science and technology research programs across agencies .

this committee meets approximately quarterly , typically at the deputies level .

the principal program design and management occurs within each agency .

according to the bush administration , the strategy , thus , puts accountability and leadership for the science and technology programs in each of the relevant agencies .

others argue that this leads to less effective collaboration and accountability for the cross - cutting climate change goals than if there were greater central authority for the programs .

communication and coordination are facilitated through a series of inter - agency working groups that meet with varying frequencies .

budget levels are established primarily through dialogue between each agency and omb .

this contrasts with the practice in the early 1990s of reaching agreement among the science agencies about any increments to the global change research budgets .

under the climate change science program ( ccsp ) announced in 2002 , president bush set up a climate change research initiative ( ccri ) that supplements the u.s .

global change research program ( us gcrp ) , established by congress in 1990 , which emphasizes long - term scientific research .

the 2002 strategy also established a climate change technology program ( cctp ) , parallel to the science research program .

it includes a national climate change technology initiative ( nccti ) in addition to pre - existing clean energy research .

the department of state takes the lead on most aspects of international cooperation .

appendix c. historical funding of the ccsp appendix d. ccsp - identified programs by agency this appendix describes the identified climate change science activities of the agencies with almost all of the climate change science program ( ccsp ) funding .

it provides the fy2008 enacted funding by agency , which has been extended into fy2009 by a continuing resolution ( p.l .

110 - 329 ) .

this section also provides president bush's requests for fy2009 and discussion of the proposed changes , some of which address issues which are likely to be raised again in the 111 th congress .

additional information summarizes the roles and activities of the covered agencies within the ccsp .

national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) funding for nasa's contributions to the ccsp were enacted for fy2008 at $1.20 billion โ a 12% increase over fy2007 levels .

amid vociferous appeals to increase nasa's budget to boost satellite operations and other efforts , president bush's fy2009 proposal would have increased nasa's ccsp funding by $125.6 million โ 12% more than the enacted fy2008 levels .

under the continuing resolution for fy2009 , nasa's share of all ccsp funding remains approximately 58% .

space - based observations .

of nasa's fy2008 funding , $666 million ( 62% ) was for acquiring observations by satellites .

of the total $125.6 million increase proposed by president bush over fy2008 , $102.3 million would have boosted satellite - based observations , based on recommendations from the nrc decadal survey and in light of the decline of funding for these observations in recent years .

if enacted president bush's proposal for fy2009 would have increased the satellite share to $769 million ( 64% of nasa's total ) .

in order to ensure continuity of key climate - related data , the total solar irradiance sensor ( tsis ) would be restored to the first satellite scheduled to fly in the national polar - orbiting operational environmental satellite system ( npoess ) .

in addition , the clouds and earth radiant energy system ( ceres ) would be placed on the npoess preparatory project , the precursor mission for npoess .

the data acquired by these two sensors would help to determine how much solar variability may be contributing to observed climate variability , and how clouds and other atmospheric changes may influence the earth's energy balance and the climate .

these and other technologies had been cut from nasa's budget in 2006 in response to cost - overruns and other problems .

simultaneously , earth sciences have been low among nasa's priorities .

funds were shifted from fy2005 from programs that support climate change to other priorities , such as the vision for space exploration .

an nrc report in 2006 , charged with examining the balance concluded: the program proposed for space and earth science is not robust ; it is not properly balanced to support a healthy mix of small , medium , and large missions and an underlying foundation of scientific research and advanced technology projects ; and it is neither sustainable nor capable of making adequate progress toward the goals that were recommended in the national research council's decadal surveys .

under the fy2009 proposal , the earth system science pathfinder , which includes the orbiting carbon observatory ( oco ) and aquarius , would have seen its funding decrease 22% .

nasa's fy2009 five - year budget projection would provide $910 million to develop two priorities: the smap mission for soil moisture mapping ; and a second generation icesat mission , the latter intended to accurately measure ice topography and allow estimation of ice sheet volume changes and sea ice thickness .

formulation and early development work is proposed to proceed also for at least two additional missions by 2013 , in response to the nrc decadal survey released in 2007 .

an nrc report published in 2008 provides a set of priorities for future observation systems .

nasa has changed some of its accounting methods since 2005 , and has revised the set of programs and projects it counts within the ccsp .

these revisions make comparison of budget authority difficult to track across multiple years .

elements of several satellite systems , including the landsat data continuity mission , the gravity recovery and climate experiment ( grace ) and portions of the high - end computing and scientific computing projects were newly included in the fy2006 request and 2007 white house report .

nasa is one of several agencies that support satellite - based climate - related observations , but is the only one that presents this funding distinctly in its ccsp budget submissions .

for example , most of the proposed increase for noaa for fy2009 is also to support the same satellite - sensor systems .

the department of defense also contributes through its defense meteorological satellite program .

usgs has additional efforts .

data management , analysis and applied sciences .

within nasa's earth science account , applied sciences and education and outreach are supposed to provide a bridge between nasa's missions and potential users โ particularly in the federal agencies โ in order to ensure that societal benefits accrue from nasa investments .

nasa reports that its fy2009 budget would support evaluation and assessment of potential policy - , market - , and technology - based approaches to adapting to or mitigating the impacts of climate change , as well as the impact of climate change on infectious diseases .

while funds for the satellite - based observations have declined in recent years , the funding for other observations , and for research and analysis have declined faster .

the nrc study that assessed balance among nasa science programs recommended , in particular , that "nasa should move immediately to correct the problems caused by reductions in the base of research and analysis programs.... " despite that 2006 recommendation , the nrc decadal survey that recommended enhanced space missions also noted that cutting research and analysis of observations from missions already launched reduces the "return on investment" from the high front - end expenditures to acquire satellite - based data .

a recent nrc study also commented that users of nasa require better access to the data , rather than new modeling or data analysis tools .

in the fy2009 budget justifications , however , it is neither clear whether the level of effort is proposed to change , nor how such applied research in nasa would be coordinated with program agencies' needs for their missions related to adapting to or mitigating climate change .

national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) noaa funding constitutes about 14% of total ccsp funding .

noaa is the second largest of agencies participating in the ccsp .

noaa's assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere directs the interagency climate change science program .

noaa has the lead among agencies on the court - ordered capstone synthesis and assessment product of the ccsp , due in 2009 .

the fy2009 proposal would have increased noaa's budget for climate change science by $20 million ( 8.3% ) over the fy2008 enacted level of $240 million , and $76 million ( 41.3% ) over the fy2007 budget authority of $184 million .

although the analytical perspectives for the fy2009 request states that the fy2009 proposal for the ccsp overall adds emphasis to impacts of climate change and the science of adaptation , such added emphasis is not apparent in the fy2009 proposal for noaa .

almost all the increases proposed are for observational capacities , not applied research , assessment or planning .

the proposal would have redistributed funding within noaa: several decreases would have partially offset an increase of $74 million to develop key satellite climate sensors .

the continuing resolution until march 6 , 2009 , puts such redistributions on hold .

the fy2009 request for an increase of $74 million would have supported the clouds and the earth's radiant energy system ( ceres ) sensor , intended to measure the earth's incoming and outgoing radiation , as well as the total solar irradiance sensor ( tsis ) sensor , to help determine solar variations as one driver of climate variability and change .

the two sensors could help distinguish the solar influence from other factors ( such as greenhouse gases ) driving climate variability and change .

these climate sensors had been de - manifested in 2006 from the national polar - orbiting operational environmental satellite system ( npoess ) under the nunn - mccurdy certification process ( but had not been included in ccsp accounting previously ) .

reinstatement of the sensors is seen as key to assuring overlapping data series for calibration of measurements .

the requested increase responds to the decadal survey recommendations of the nrc in january 2007 and relates to increases also in the fy2009 request for the nasa .

this is the first budget request for the ccsp in which the administration is counting funding for these items , "to provide the most accurate picture of its climate funding to date. .

adding this item to what is identified as ccsp would raise noaa's ccsp fy2007 actual budget authority and fy2008 enacted authority by $7 million each , and the fy2009 request by $81 million , compared to previous administration accounting of the ccsp .

offsetting the satellite increase , one proposed reduction would have cut congressionally directed funding of $5.4 million , eliminating the regional climate centers .

a second proposed reduction would have cut $19.1 million from the enacted fy2008 level for "archive , access , and assessment. .

noaa's fy2009 budget justification stated the following objectives: development of an integrated earth system analysis capability ; creating a high quality record of the state of the atmosphere and ocean since 1979 ( +$74 million to develop the ceres and tsis radiation sensors ) ; development of an end - to - end hydrologic projection and application capability ; enhanced carbon cycle research on high latitude systems ; quantification of climate forcing and feedbacks by aerosols , non - carbon dioxide greenhouse gases , water vapor , and clouds ; assessment of abrupt change in a warming climate ( +$1.0 million , for a total of $5 million , for research on "atlantic meridional overturning circulation" a - moc , and - $0.4 million for other abrupt climate change research ) ; examination of the feasibility of development an abrupt change early warning system ; and ecological forecasting ( +$0.6 million to$2.1 million in the fy2009 request ) .

associating most of these objectives with specific funding proposals was not possible with the information available .

the fy2009 proposal would increase funding in the climate data and information line item by $8.3 million , restoring the request for fy2008 that was not enacted .

it would also provide an increase of $2 million for the national integrated drought information system ( nidis ) , to develop and bring into operation the next - generation climate forecast system .

the fy2009 proposal would increase funding for water vapor process research by $880 thousand , to improve currently weak but critical understanding of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and its distribution .

of this , about two - thirds would be used to initiate work on lidar , sondes , satellite and other sensors .

the remainder would use the observations to improve computer models by 2013 for analyses of greenhouse gas , aerosol and cloud effects on climate .

in addition , creation of a national climate service within noaa , parallel to but distinguished from the national weather service , has been advocated by some people for a number of years .

 ( currently , there exists a climate services division within the national weather service. ) .

the proposed climate information services would aim at improving provision of routine seasonal to multi - annual forecasts and data products , as well as expanded drought information .

the proponents would expect benefits for prediction of and responses to drought , hurricanes , fires , floods , and weather extremes .

the definition of "climate" in the context of the proposed national climate service seems to be seasonal to multi - annual , encompassing such phenomena as el nino ; it does not appear to aim at the multi - annual to inter - decadal or longer horizon generally embodied in the debate over human - induced climate change .

 ( "climate" is often defined by long - term averages , such as the "normals" that constitute 30-year averages ; the proposed national climate service seems aimed at variability on much shorter time frames. ) .

national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) the fy2009 proposal for the department of commerce's contribution to the ccsp included nist activities for the first time as a distinct line item .

the request would have increased the nist contribution to the ccsp from $0.2 million enacted in fy2007 and fy2008 by $5.0 million to $5.2 million in fy2009 .

according to our changing planet , these funds would be used for: resolving discrepancies in satellite measurements of radiation , including solar irradiance , reflected solar radiation , outgoing longwave radiation , and surface radiation ; and providing critical information about aerosols and atmospheric components believed to play a major role in global climate change .

national science foundation ( nsf ) with enacted budget authority for fy2008 of just over $205 million , national science foundation funding constitutes about 11% of the u.s .

climate change science program ( ccsp ) , and the third largest of agencies participating in the ccsp .

still , nsf funding was only 3% of total federal funding for climate change in fy2008 .

president bush's budget proposed to increase nsf's funding by $16 million to $220.6 million ( 8% ) in fy2009 .

while funding for most components of nsf's climate change program was proposed for fy2009 to remain flat or decline slightly , two components had been slated for significant increases: geosciences : proposed increase of $7.0 million ( 4.4% โ or a little more than inflation ) ; and office of polar programs : proposed increase of $7.8 million ( 74.3% ) .

nsf's climate change science programs invest in "fundamental discovery," research infrastructure , and educational activities .

high priorities are stated as including data acquisition , information management , model enhancement , development of new earth observing instruments and platforms , and new research methods .

nsf also has a program for research on "the general processes used by organizations to identify and evaluate policies for mitigation , adaptation , and other responses to varying environmental conditions," according to its fy2009 budget justification .

in addition , nsf proposed to initiate a program related to climate change impacts on water , "dynamics of water processes in the environment. .

department of energy ( doe ) doe's funding for the ccsp was enacted at $128.3 million for fy2008 , and was proposed to increase by $17.6 million in fy2009 to $145.9 million .

the largest component of doe's contribution to the ccsp supports research on "climate forcing," which was proposed in fy2009 to increase by $3.2 million to $81.2 million .

of this , $52.6 ( same as fy2008 ) would support continued atmospheric radiation measurement ( arm ) , to reduce the largest scientific uncertainty in climate change prediction โ the roles of clouds and aerosols and their interactions with solar radiation .

some $14.8 would have funded research while another $37.8 million would have supported the arm infrastructure โ the climate research facility ( acrf ) : three stationary facilities , a mobile facility and aerial vehicles .

the proposed $2.6 million increase over fy2008 levels would have supported an additional mobile facility for deployment in 2010 .

$13.0 million ( +0.4 million ) in fy2009 would have funded research on atmospheric aerosols and their effects on the earth's energy balance .

another $13.6 million would have continued support for ameriflux , to measure exchanges of carbon dioxide , energy and water between the atmosphere and major terrestrial ecosystems in north america .

ameriflux is funded also by nasa , noaa , usgs , the forest service and the agricultural research service .

about $1.9 million supports the carbon dioxide information and analysis center ( cdiac ) , one of several repositories of data on greenhouse gas emissions , atmospheric concentrations , and related data .

in doe's office of science , $45.4 million was proposed for climate change modeling in fy2009 , an increase of $14.1 million of fy2008 enacted levels , and $20.0 million over fy2007 levels .

about $7.8 million would have supported work towards a first - generation earth system model ( to include natural , but not human , components ) .

some $2.6 million would have explored past and potential future abrupt climate change .

the climate change response program would have received $19.4 million under president bush's request , with $13.2 million for experimental studies of the possible effects of warming , precipitation changes and co 2 increases on terrestrial ecosystems .

in fy2009 , research on carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) was proposed to increase to a total in the office of biological research of $17.4 million , up $0.5 million from the fy2008 enacted level .

of the total , $12.3 million ( 73% ) would have supported biological sequestration ( eg , absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by trees and other vegetation ) , while the remaining $4.7 million would have supported soil sequestration of carbon associated with switchgrass systems , for ethanol production from cellulose .

united states geological survey ( usgs ) the usgs restructured its climate change science research in 2007 , and the fy2009 budget was the first under the new organization .

the fy2009 request would have provided $31.4 million for ccsp - related work in fy2009 , with $26.6 million consolidated across disciplines into one global change activity account .

additionally , in the geographic and biologic divisions , $3.7 million would have supported the national satellite land remote sensing data archive ( nslrsda ) , and $1.1 million in the biological research and monitoring activity , would also have contributed to the ccsp .

usgs is embarking on a new climate change science strategy , the national climate effects research and monitoring network .

the network would include long - term monitoring in "focus areas" of key processes controlling resource or ecosystem responses to climate change ; a network of field study sites to assess the sensitivity to climate change of specific resources and ecosystems ; regional and national surveys to link the "focus areas" to the broader landscapes ; and expanded use of space - based remote sensing to track environmental changes .

eventually , and pending future appropriations , information in an envisioned global change information management system would be accessible to users through the internet .

usgs also proposed to expand initial adaptation - oriented projects to develop decision tools to help resource managers and policy makers to cope with future climate change .

the fy2009 request would have eliminated $2.5 million of congressionally directed funding to develop methods to assess capacities for geologic carbon sequestration , as well as to research hazards , carbon management and water availability .

bureau of reclamation although the bureau of reclamation is not listed explicitly in the ccsp , it reports climate change - related activities .

however , other budget information suggests that its funding level ( for impact assessment and adaptation ) would be greater than many other agencies' identified in the ccsp .

in fy2009 , the bureau's budget justification said , "[a]s a part of the water for america initiative , reclamation is examining how climate change information can be considered in our water and power operations and planning through several project - specific studies .

additionally , through collaborative research with other federal agencies and non - federal entities that have complementary expertise and a common stake in western water , reclamation is well positioned to obtain the most relevant climate information and manage our water resources under changing conditions. .

according to the bureau's budget justification , the funding requested for its climate change activities was $31.9 million , of which $19.0 million appeared in the water for america initiative line item .

another $12.9 million would fund specific projects for endangered species recovery activities ( $8.9 million ) and investigation programs ( $4.0 million ) .

reclamation's efforts focus on two of the initiative's three strategies: plan for our nation's water future ; and expand , protect , and conserve our nation's water resources .

the third strategy , to enhance our nation's water knowledge , will be undertaken by usgs .

as part of the plan for our nation's water future component of the initiative , reclamation will merge the existing investigation programs with a new basin - wide studies program , thus initiating comprehensive water supply and demand studies to assess the impact of increased water demands on finite water sources .

u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) all of the $46.8 million enacted for hhs for climate change science is associated with health effects of ultra - violet radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion .

this is not , strictly speaking , climate change , although the two environmental issues are related .

although no climate - related budget is identified for the centers for disease control ( cdc ) , the cdc is engaged in work on climate change impacts on emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases , allergens , and preparedness .

with the fy2008 appropriations , h.rept .

110-231 contained the following language pertaining to climate change: additional scientific research is needed to further understand the potential health effects of global climate change and to identify tools to educate health professionals about adaptation strategies .

the committee encourages cdc to begin to develop public health research , technical assistance , and surveillance programs to understand the impacts of climate change on health .

 ( p. 116 ) in responding to this language , the cdc identified 11 priority health actions and developed a policy statement .

the agency reports that five workshops were planned to explore these issues further .

in october 2008 , the world health organization ( who ) released an agenda of research priorities to address the health effects of climate change globally .

the main research priorities were: interactions with other health determinants and trends , such as economic development , globalization , urbanization , and inequities both in exposure to health risks and access to care .

better characterization of long - term climate change effects through drought , freshwater resources , and population displacement , including risks to mental health , with a focus on children and other vulnerable groups .

comparing effectiveness of short - term interventions dealing with such health threats as heatwaves and floods .

assessing health impact of policies of non - health sectors including effects of biofuels incentives on food security and malnutrition .

strengthening public health systems to address health effects of climate change .

environmental protection agency ( epa ) epa's contribution to the ccsp is research on air and water quality effects of climate change , and related risks to human health and ecosystems .

the fy2009 proposal would have reduced funding for this research by $2.8 million from the fy2008 appropriations of $19.6 million .

the fy2008 level was below the fy2007 funding of $17.0 million .

the agency's science advisory board , in a may 12 , 2008 memorandum to administrator johnson , reported that the epa's research on impacts of climate change "performs well considering its declining funding and relatively small , though focused and important role , in the overall federal program. .

it also described the "dramatic reductions" since fy2004 of epa's budget for research on climate change impacts as "eating the seed corn": as a consequence we run a considerable risk that we will not be able to address these problems adequately in the future .

we also run the risk of incurring much larger future costs because we do not understand the subtle intricacies of these risks and hence could blunder into difficulties , such as inappropriate regulatory responses , from which it may be much more expensive to recover than if we understood what we were facing ahead of time .

although the epa does not currently conduct research under the ccsp on ghg mitigation ( though the office of air and radiation conducts policy analysis with funds reported under the cctp ) , the sab recommended that epa adopt some long - term ghg reduction objectives "to inform and to better define their research portfolio" ( p. 8 ) .

the recommendation reflects the tension in and among many agencies regarding what climate - related research and analysis should be conducted , and by whom ( i.e. , the research office versus the program office ) .

u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) for fy2008 , funding was enacted at a level of $64.4 million for climate change science .

the fy2009 request forusda would have reduced this amount to $60.3 million โ a decrease of $4.1 million .

of that overall decrease from fy2008 enacted to fy2009 , most โ $3.7 million โ would have come from the across - the - board cuts to various climate change programs in the agricultural research service ( ars ) , resulting in a fy2009 request of $35.7 million .

most ars research is conducted intramurally .

ars carbon cycle activities ( $3.1 million requested for fy2009 ) include the greenhouse gas reduction through agricultural carbon enhancement network ( gracenet ) and agriflux network to understand soil carbon sequestration , minimize greenhouse gas emissions , on range , pasture and crop land sites .

almost $18 million of the ars funding request under the ccsp concerns emissions , particularly of methyl bromide , which is a substance that depletes stratospheric ozone but is not a greenhouse gas .

another $10.7 million of the fy2009 request would study the impacts of climate change on rangelands and other agricultural ecosystems through drought , warming , snowpack disappearance , and altered fire regimes .

the forest services research related to climate change would be reduced by $2.2 million to $18.9 million in fy2009 .

the economic research service's climate change - related research would remain the same , at $50 thousand .

in contrast , funding for the cooperative state research , education , and extension service ( csrees ) would have increased by $1.7 million to $5.7 million in fy2009 .

csrees provided grants for research on land use , land cover , and managed ecosystems in terms of responses , feedbacks , and drivers of carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes .

its stated long - term goal was to better understand land change through predictive modeling .

the research to understand how ultraviolet radiation affects plant and animal physiology and ecosystems would have increased by $0.8 million and on carbon cycle would have increased by $1.1 million .

the fy2009 request proposed $0.5 million for the national research initiative ( nri ) , though the program was not reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill ( the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , p.l .

110 - 246 ) .

appendix e. cctp - identified programs by agency this appendix provides additional information about the climate change technology programs in several of the most important participating agencies .

fy2008 funding levels are reported , and are extended through march 6 , 2009 for fy2009 levels by a continuing resolution ( p.l .

110-329 ) .

this appendix also provides president bush's fy2009 request for the climate change technology program ( cctp ) , as the fy2009 budget justifications provided the most recent descriptions of on - going programs and priorities , approved by omb .

it remains to be seen how president obama may re - propose similar modifications .

department of energy ( doe ) the doe is , by far , the largest component of president bush's cctp , at 85% of the fy2008 enacted total .

the fy2009 request included numerous changes to funding that congress enacted for fy2008 to support doe's climate change technology programs .

some of these proposed changes include: a $155 million ( 11% ) reduction for energy efficiency and renewable energy , largely because of proposed elimination of low - income weatherization grants , small business innovation research support , and state energy activities , as well as reductions for hydrogen fuel cell research ; increases are proposed for geothermal systems , biofuels , and vehicle , building and industrial technologies ; a $5 million ( 5% ) reduction for energy supply and conservation for electricity transmission and distribution ; a $251 million ( 51% ) increase for fossil energy research and development / efficiency and sequestration , including a 52% increase carbon sequestration ( +$52 million ) and almost a tripling of the funding for futuregen ( to $156 million ) ; a $365 million ( 71% ) increase for nuclear energy supply and conservation to support the global nuclear energy partnership ; and a $208 million ( 42% ) increase for nuclear fusion research , sequestration and hydrogen research , including support to the international iter nuclear fusion partnership and three bioenergy research centers .

both the house and senate passed bills in 2008 covering most of the cctp appropriations , and agreed on a conference bill .

the amounts in these bills , which never were enacted into law , frequently deviated substantially from the fy2008 levels and the fy2009 request .

in particular , both chambers rejected elimination of the doe weatherization grants .

the continuing resolution that holds funding for almost all other programs to the fy2008 levels includes special provisions to add $250 million for weatherization ( division a of p.l .

110 - 329 ) .

from fy2003 to fy2004 , the total budget authority for doe for the cctp rose , largely due to inclusion of a greater share of funding for doe's clean coal power initiative than in prior years .

while the clean coal program previously had focused on reduction of major pollutants , its focus was reported by omb to have shifted to improving efficiency , which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced .

funding for nuclear energy has increased by hundreds of millions of dollars in several different programs , and it has become a large share of cctp funding .

however , less was enacted for nuclear than requested for fy2008 ; the fy2009 request would increase that funding almost to the level requested for fy2008 , and would make nuclear energy more than half of the nccti funding , if enacted .

according to doe's fy2009 budget justification , the nuclear energy r&d program is intended "to develop new nuclear energy generation technologies to meet energy and climate goals. .

however , opponents have criticized doe's nuclear research program as providing wasteful subsidies to an industry that they believe should be phased out as unacceptably hazardous and economically uncompetitive .

the bush administration's global nuclear energy partnership ( gnep ) has been intended to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel without creating pure plutonium that could be readily used for nuclear weapons .

according to doe's budget justification , such technologies could allow greater expansion of nuclear power throughout the world "with reduced risk of nuclear weapons proliferation .

"but nuclear opponents have disputed doe's contention that nuclear recycling technology can be made sufficiently proliferation - resistant for widespread use .

in 2008 , the house appropriations committee sharply criticized gnep as "rushed , poorly - defined , expansive , and expensive," and eliminated all funding for the program .

on the other hand , the house panel would have dramatically boosted funding for advanced nuclear reactors .

however , fy2008 funding levels continue under the continuing resolution until march 6 , 2009 .

president obama has indicated that he would support "safely harness nuclear energy" as a component of a strategy to address climate change .

it is likely that further scrutiny and modifications of nuclear energy initiatives will continue in the 111 th congress and under the obama administration .

us department of agriculture ( usda ) usda's contributions to the cctp are a mix of both mandatory and discretionary funding , with shares of 74% and 26% , respectively , estimated for fy2008 prior to passage of the 2008 farm bill .

the enacted fy2008 funding levels were estimated at about $205 million , up from $48 million in fy2007 .

the mandatory share was estimated to rise from $14 million in fy2007 to $151 million in fy2008 under president bush's proposals for the fy2008 farm bill .

although discretionary funding would extend into early fy2009 at fy2008 levels under the continuing resolution , the mandatory levels will have been altered by the new farm bill .

president bush's fy2009 budget foresaw a $22 million decrease in cctp funding of the usda , primarily from the renewable energy program under the cooperative state research , education and extension service ( csrees ) .

however , compared to the 424% increase from fy2007 to fy2008 for usda's cctp programs , from $48.4 million to $20.4 million , the proposed decrease would have been small .

the increases from fy2007 to fy2008 were primarily due to increases in mandatory funding of farm programs of: $50.0 million for bioenergy and biobased products research ; $15.0 million for forest wood to energy ; $50.0 million for renewable energy system and energy efficiency grants ; and $21.0 million for renewable energy system and energy efficiency loans .

these grants and loans had been included in the administration's formal recommendations for the 2007-2008 farm bill debate .

another one - third would be for increases in discretionary spending on formula funds for bioenergy research ( +$5.0 million ) , renewable energy ( +$13.0 million ) , and value - added producer grants ( +$2.0 million ) .

the 2008 farm bill ( the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , p.l .

110 - 246 ) reauthorized , modified and / or expanded several existing programs , and created several new programs , in the enacted bill's conservation , energy , and rural development titles .

while few of these programs directly are geared toward climate change mitigation , these usda programs likely will indirectly affect various u.s. climate change initiatives .

whether and the extent to which these programs will affect overall funding levels for programs related to climate change is uncertain ; also , no accounting of these cctp changes is yet available for fy2008 or fy2009 .

department of defense ( dod ) funding for dod reported for the cctp rose from $100.9 million in fy2007 to $109.6 million enacted for fy2008 .

president bush's budget proposal would have increased that funding by an additional $21.4 million in fy2008 , to $131.0 million , though with increases and decreases across the different services .

dod appropriations for fy2009 were passed into law and signed on september 30 , 2008 ( p.l .

110 - 329 ) .

because the climate change - related activities are below the appropriations account detail , it is unclear at this time what changes may have been made to the fy2008 enacted or fy2009 requested levels .

the administration requested to raise air force funding for the cctp by $81.7 million from fy2008 to a total of $103 million fy2009 .

it would decrease cctp - related funding to the army by $41.9 million from the fy2008 enacted level to $16.4 million in fy2009 , and to the navy by $16.2 million to $11.1 million in fy2009 .

no further information was obtainable regarding the uses of these proposed funds .

however , the dod would have many incentives and opportunities to engage in advanced , low - greenhouse gas technologies: in 2005 , the dod accounted for 97% of all u.s. government fuel consumption , at a federal expense of more than $8 billion ( at 2005 energy prices ) .

more than half of this consumption was by the air force .

more broadly , the defense science board ( dsb ) issued a report in february 2008 that concluded that the dod's current energy consumption patterns put military operations at risk both in the battlefield , due to high and expensive fuel demand , and at installations , due to dependence on an increasingly fragile electricity grid .

it noted that , even in battlespace , one half or more of demand may come from equipment such as air conditioners and field kitchens , not combat equipment .

it also noted that dod had not implemented two key recommendations from a 2001 task force on energy .

institutionally: the task force concluded that solving dod's energy problem would take more than producing documents establishing the new policies , procedures and analytical products recommended by this report .

it depends on leadership's willingness to provide the oversight to ensure they are effective .

currently , decisions that affect dod's energy demand are scattered throughout the organization with little accountability or oversight .

while there is a senior official with responsibility for energy use at installations , this function oversees only about a quarter of dod's energy usage .

the task force recommends senior leadership establish oversight and accountability for implementing the recommendations in this report , and ongoing measurement of their progress across the whole of dod .

this 2008 report recommended , among other measures , that dod "establish a department - wide strategic plan that establishes measurable goals , achieves the business process changes recommended by the 2001 dsb report and establishes clear responsibility and accountability" ( executive summary , p. 6 ) .

decisions and technologies to enhance dod's energy security could have profound implications for its related greenhouse gas decisions .

one vision , of relying on alternative fuels produced from oil shale and other unconventional fossil fuels has been controversial , however , because of its potential for dramatically increasing net greenhouse gas emissions associated with aviation fuels .

this dispute culminated in a constraint in the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( p.l .

110 - 140 ) barring all agencies from procuring alternative fuels that resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil fuels โ most critical for the dod , which accounts for almost all federal oil consumption .

similar language was debated in the fy2009 appropriations for dod but was not enacted .

the dsb , after considering the climate change implications for dod , concluded: the global movement toward constraints on future carbon emissions is gaining support .

dod cannot be oblivious to this trend .

thus , the task force recommends that if dod decides to provide financial backing to synthetic fuel production plants , it should avoid investing in processes that exceed the carbon footprint of petroleum .

the task force recommends dod continue to invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies that address unique , pressing dod needs .

for example , equipment capable of producing fuel at forward deployed locations using locally available renewable or waste feedstock reduces gallon for gallon the amount needed to be moved and protected in theater .

dod should continue to invest in research into alternative , non - petroleum , renewable and low - carbon footprint fuels for the long term .

 ( p. 22 ) the dod's defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) has been acclaimed by some experts for its contributions to technological advance broadly .

some technology experts have advocated for an expansion of this program to take on a mission of advancing energy technologies to enable deep cuts from current greenhouse gas emission levels , like a new "apollo" project .

the congress appropriated funds of $6.3 million to initiate such an expansion , darpa - e , in fy2007 .

the administration proposed to eliminate this funding in dod for fy2009 , saying that such research could be accomplished through similar programs in doe .

in 2008 , the 110 th congress amended section 118 of title 10 , united states code , the department of defense ( dod ) authorization to require dod to consider the effects of climate change on department facilities , capabilities , and missions ( p.l .

110 - 181 ) .

the law requires that the next national security strategy and national defense strategy include guidance for military planners to assess the risks of climate change to current and future defense missions ; to update defense plans accordingly , and to engage with allies and partners on climate mitigation strategies , capacity building , and relevant research and development ; and to develop the capabilities to reduce future impacts .

the new authorization also requires that the next quadrennial defense review assess dod's capacities to respond to the consequences of climate change , including extreme weather events , both domestically and abroad .

it directs such assessment to use mid - range scenarios of future climate change ( which may have roughly a 50-50 likelihood of occurring ) .

the subsequent section of the law requires the secretary of defense to submit a plan to congress to improve dod's participation in interagency coordination on a national security strategy .

presumably , such interagency coordination would extend also to the work on responding to , and mitigating , future impacts of climate change .

environmental protection agency ( epa ) epa's share of the cctp funding was proposed to continue to decline from 3.0% in fy2007 , 2.5% in fy2008 to 2.2% in fy2009 .

the fy2007 new budget authority was $105 million , rising by $3 million in the fy2008 enacted level of $108 million , then requested to drop to $98 million in fy2009 .

under the continuing resolution , funding will continue at fy2008 levels through march 6 , 2009 .

epa's role has been primarily in inventorying and evaluating greenhouse gas emissions from alternative sectors and technologies , and operating voluntary programs that provide information , technical assistance and marketing incentives to private and public entities to quantify and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .

epa also provides key scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions and analyses of the economic impacts of mitigation strategies โ including proposed legislation โ that are widely used by congress and the public .

president bush's proposal would have reduced epa's funding for the energy star building - related programs by $4.0 million from the fy2008 omnibus appropriations ; energy star is one of the principal voluntary ghg reduction initiatives and garners a large portion of the ghg reductions expected by president bush's climate change strategy .

the budget would cut $1.3 million by eliminating the congressionally - directed industrial carbon outreach program .

the agency evaluates options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles , including effects of biofuel mandates that have been legislated or proposed .

the fy2009 request would have reduced these transportation activities by $6.9 million to $11.9 million .

president bush's proposal would also have eliminated congressionally - directed funding for a greenhouse gas reporting registry , enacted at $3.4 million in the fy2008 omnibus appropriations .

the joint explanatory statement for the fy2008 omnibus appropriations directed epa to use $3.5 million ( before an across - the - board 1.6% recision ) appropriated within the federal support air quality management program "to develop and publish a rule requiring mandatory reporting of emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy. .

the draft and final rules are due no later than nine and 18 months , respectively , after enactment .

president bush's fy2009 proposal would not have continued the $3.4 million appropriated for fy2008 to develop this national greenhouse gas registry , causing angry responses from some senators .

consistent ghg reporting is essential to the efficient and equitable functioning of any program to limit emissions , and provisions for early reporting may facilitate rewarding those sources that show leadership in ghg reductions ahead of possible mandatory controls .

a number of initiatives are underway besides the current epa effort that would develop guidance for how sources would report their greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions in the event of mandatory reporting requirements .

no initiative prior to epa's effort , including doe's "402 ( a ) " program has gained widespread agreement as sufficient for a mandatory requirement .

epa's fy2009 budget justification likely refers to the existence of these other initiatives when it states that "epa is reviewing available data to maximize efficiency and reduce potential overlaps while exploring options for integration. .

the fy2009 request proposed to add $5.0 million to support the asia - pacific partnership ( see section on international assistance ) โ a request that has been repeatedly denied in previous years' appropriations .

without fy2008 enacted funding , none is available under the continue resolution through march 9 , 2009 .

as in other agencies , the appropriations line items for the epa no longer reflect current organization and activity levels of the climate - technology related initiatives .

while this may occur to assist continuity of reporting , the next administration's proposals may include significant changes in activity levels and descriptions .

national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) nasa's share of cctp funding was proposed to decline from 3.2% to 2.6% , or from $139.0 million as enacted for fy2008 to the proposed $116.1 million for fy2009 .

the largest portion of nasa's cctp funding is for the fundamental aeronautics program , aimed at developing high performance aircraft and rotorcraft that would significantly reduce emissions of ghg , water vapor , volatile organic compounds , unburned hydrocarbons , and particulate matter .

the fy2009 request would have eliminated a congressionally directed increase in fy2008 , reducing the level by $19.5 million to $100.5 million .

the 2009 defense reauthorization law ( p.l .

110 - 422 ) was enacted with a provision , sec .

302 , requiring nasa to support research and development of environmentally friendly aircraft .

this provision is intended to "enable" , specifically , "[s]ignificant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to aircraft in commercial services as of the date of enactment. .

president bush's request would have reduced exploration technology development program projects to advance lithium - ion batteries , regenerative fuel cells , and nuclear fission from the fy2008 enacted level of $17.4 to $14.0 in fy2009 .

proposed to remain constant would be $1.6 million for measuring surface radiation to support solar heating , as well as other assessment of renewable energy production and efficiency .

appendix f. climate change technology priorities , as identified by the bush administration early in president george w. bush administration , a set of general technologies were designated as "high priority" within the cctp .

these have continued to be tracked as such by the cctp , and the evolution of funding in recent years for these is provided in the table below .

it is unclear what status these have in funding or other decisions .
