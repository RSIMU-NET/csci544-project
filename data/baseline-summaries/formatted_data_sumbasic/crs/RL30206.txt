a ï¿½1000 ( a ) ( 3 ) of h.r .

3194 required that h.r .

3423 be enacted bycross - reference .

on february 1 , 1999 , the president submitted his fy2000 budget to congress .

the fy2000 request for interior and related agencies totaled $15.27 billion compared to the $14.30 billion enacted bycongress for fy1999 ( p.l .

105-277 ) , an increase of almost $1 billion .

significant increases above the fy1999 enacted level included: the national park service ( + $294.7 million ) , the indian health service ( + $170.1 million ) , the bureau of indian affairs ( + $155.6million ) , the forest service ( + $155.2 million ) , the united states fish and wildlife service ( + $110.2million ) , the bureau of land management ( + $78 million ) , the national endowment for the arts ( +$52 million ) , the united states geological survey ( + $39.6 million ) , the national endowment forthe humanities ( + $39.3 million ) , and the smithsonian institution ( + $35.1 million ) .

the onlysignificant decreases include: the department of energy ( - $146.7 million ) and the mineralsmanagement service ( - $7.8 million ) .

the clinton administration proposed a $1 billion lands legacy initiative in the fy2000 budget .

department of the interior agencies would have received more than half the total under thisrequest , $579 million , and all but $14 million of the total would have come through the land andwater conservation fund ( lwcf ) .

most of these funds , $413 million , would have been spent onland acquisition .

the u.s. forest service received $198 million , including $118 million for landacquisition .

on february 8 , 1999 , representative ralph regula , chairman of the interiorappropriations subcommittee , expressed concern about the president's lands legacy initiative .

henoted that it conflicted with the subcommittee's number one priority of addressing the criticalbacklog of maintenance problems and operational shortfalls in national parks , wildlife refuges,national forests , and other public lands totaling more than $12 billion .

the senate appropriations committee reported the fy2000 interior appropriations bill ( s. 1292 , s.rept .

106-99 ) on june 28 , 1999 , and the house appropriations committeereported its version of the bill ( h.r .

2466 , h.rept .

106-222 ) on july 2 , 1999 .

thecommittee - approved funding levels were $14.058 billion in the senate and $14.105 billion in thehouse , a difference of $46.7 million .

both bills provided funding levels below the fy1999 enactedlevel .

significant senate increases above the house bill are included in parenthesis: bureau of indian affairs $1.811 billion ( + $23 million ) , forest service $2.672 billion ( + $68.3 million ) , and fossilenergy , research , and development $367.0 million ( +$31.7 million ) .

nominal senate increasesincluded the national endowment for the arts ( $99 million ) and the national endowment for thehumanities ( $111.7 million ) , a $1 million increase for both agencies above the house level .

significant house increases above the senate bill are included in parenthesis: u.s .

fish and wildlife service $840.2 million ( + $11.3 million ) , the office of surface mining $292.4 million ( +$10.6 million ) , departmental offices at the interior department $313.0 million ( + 16 million ) ,energy conservation $693.8 million ( + $36 million ) , and indian health service $2.398 billion ( +$73.1 million ) .

in a july 1 , 1999 , memorandum to the chairman of the house appropriations committee , the office of management and budget raised concerns about certain aspects of the interiorappropriations bill as reported by the interior subcommittee .

included in the concerns were the needfor increased funding for the president's lands legacy initiative , language in the bill concerningeverglades restoration , funding above the president's request for timber sales management , lack offunding for the millennium initiative to save america's treasures , funding levels for the nationalendowment for the arts and national endowment for the humanities , failure to fund the bureau ofindian affairs school construction bonding initiative , and cuts to the department of energy'sweatherization program .

on july 15 , 1999 , the house passed h.r .

2466 by a vote of 377-47 , providing $13.93 billion in fy2000 funding including $57.4 million of mandatory funding .

more than 30amendments were proposed during floor debate on july 13 and 14 .

of the amendments adopted,several had significant funding impacts .

for example , a manager's amendment by houseappropriations committee chairman bill young reduced the bill funding by $140 million byimposing an across - the - board cut of 0.48% ( $69 million ) , increasing the clean coal technologydeferral by $66 million , and reducing bureau of land management land acquisition by $5 million .

weatherization assistance was also increased by $13 million and the strategic petroleum reservedecreased by $13 million .

in addition , payments in lieu of taxes was increased by $20 million andfossil energy research and development was reduced by $79 million .

on september 23 , 1999 , the senate passed its version of the interior appropriations bill by a vote of 89-10 , providing $14.06 billion in fy2000 funding , including $57.4 million in mandatoryfunding .

the senate bill also included an across the board cut of $48 million .

on september 30 , 1999 , president clinton signed h.j.res .

68 , making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2000 through october 21 , 1999 , for those appropriations measureswhich had not been enacted into law .

this was the first of seven continuing funding resolutionswhich sequentially funded outstanding fy2000 regular appropriations bills from the start of thefiscal year , october 1 , 1999 , through december 2 , 1999 .

a house - senate conference met on the interior bill on october 13 and 14 , 1999 .

the conference report on h.r .

2466 ( h.rept .

106-406 ) was agreed to by both the house and senate onoctober 21 , 1999 .

it provided a total of $14.534 billion for fy2000 , compared to the fy1999enacted level of $14.298 billion , an increase of $236 million .

however , after scorekeepingadjustments , the conference report provided a total of $14.565 billion ( including $57.4 million inmandatory funding. ) .

the report included increases for a number of agencies which were aboveeither the house or senate approved levels .

also , the fy2000 totals included $68 million ofemergency funding for the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund .

however , the legislation was not transmitted to the president .

president clinton had been expected to veto the bill due to differences involving riders on oil royalty valuations , mining , andgrazing as well as the funding levels for the lands legacy initiative and the national endowmentfor the arts .

instead , controversial issues were renegotiated , and the final negotiated agreement forthe interior bill was incorporated with others into the "consolidated appropriations act for fy2000" ( h.r .

3194 , h.rept .

106-479 ) .

originally this measure provided appropriations onlyfor the district of columbia .

this omnibus measure passed the house on november 18 , 1999 andthe senate on november 19 , 1999 , and was sent to the president on november 22 , 1999 .

theinterior appropriations portion of the consolidated measure also was introduced as a separate bill ( h.r .

3423 ) , which the consolidated measure would enact by cross - reference .

on november 29 , 1999 , the president signed into law the consolidated appropriations measure ( p.l .

106-113 ) .

the free - standing interior funding bill ( h.r .

3423 ) was enactedsimultaneously by cross - reference .

the law contained a total interior appropriation of $14.928billion ; after scorekeeping adjustments , the total was $14.959 .

it included additional funding for thelands legacy initiative , and modifications to environmental riders included in the earlier conferencereport .

the law provided for government - wide cuts equal to 0.38% of the discretionary budgetauthority for fy2000 .

in carrying out the rescissions , some programs may be reduced by more orless than the 0.38% .

however , no program or activity may be reduced by more than 15% , noreduction shall be made to any military personnel account , and reductions made to the departmentof defense and department of energy defense activities shall be applied proportionally .

finally,the office of management and budget is required , in the president's fy2001 budget submission tothe congress , to provide a report specifying such reductions .

therefore , it should be noted that the0.38% rescinded amount for fy2000 discretionary budget authority is not reflected in the amountsincluded in this report .
