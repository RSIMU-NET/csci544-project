t his report describes actions taken by the administration and congress to provide fy2019 appropriations for commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ( cjs ) accounts .

it also provides an overview of enacted fy2018 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as part of annual cjs appropriations .

the second part of this report provides an overview of historical funding trends for cjs .

the dollar amounts in this report reflect only new funding made available at the start of the fiscal year .

therefore , the amounts do not include any rescissions of unobligated or deobligated balances that may be counted as offsets to newly enacted appropriations , nor do they include any scorekeeping adjustments ( eg , the budgetary effects of provisions limiting the availability of the balance in the crime victims fund ) .

in the text of the report , appropriations are rounded to the nearest million .

however , percentage changes are calculated using whole , not rounded , numbers , meaning that in some instances there may be small differences between the actual percentage change and the percentage change that would be calculated by using the rounded amounts presented in the report .

the annual cjs appropriations act provides funding for the departments of commerce and justice , select science agencies , and several related agencies .

appropriations for the department of commerce include funding for agencies such as the census bureau ; the u.s. patent and trademark office ; the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ; and the national institute of standards and technology .

appropriations for the department of justice ( doj ) provide funding for agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation ; the bureau of prisons ; the u.s .

marshals service ; the drug enforcement administration ; and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives , along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state , local , and tribal governments .

the vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .

the annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the legal services corporation and the equal employment opportunity commission .

for fy2018 , congress and the president provided a total of $72.119 billion for cjs .

this included $70.921 billion in regular funding provided pursuant to the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-141 , see table 1 ) and $1.198 billion in emergency - designated funding provided pursuant to the further additional supplemental appropriations for disaster relief requirements act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 , see table 2 ) .

for fy2018 , the department of commerce received $12.137 billion ( $11.137 billion in regular funding and $1.000 billion in supplemental funding ) , the department of justice received $30.384 billion ( $30.299 billion in regular funding and $85 million in supplemental funding ) , the science agencies received $28.609 billion ( $28.511 billion in regular funding and $98 million in supplemental funding ) , and the related agencies received $989 million ( $974 million in regular funding and $15 million in supplemental funding ) .

comparisons in this report between fy2018 enacted funding and the administration's fy2019 request , the house and senate committee - reported fy2019 amounts , and fy2019 enacted funding are based on fy2018 regular funding ( i.e. , fy2018 enacted funding excluding supplemental appropriations ) .

the administration requested $66.555 billion for cjs for fy2019 , which was 6.2% less than fy2018 regular funding .

when comparing the administration's fy2019 request to the fy2018 funding , it should be considered that the administration formulated its fy2019 budget request before full - year appropriations for fy2018 were enacted .

fy2018 funding levels , for the purposes of the administration's request , were calculated based on fy2017 funding minus a reduction ( 0.6791% ) as extended under a series of continuing resolutions .

the administration requested the following: $9.797 billion for the department of commerce , which was 12.0% less than fy2018 regular funding ; $28.835 billion for the department of justice , which was 4.8% less than fy2018 regular funding ; $27.372 billion for the science agencies , which was 4.0% less than fy2018 regular funding ; and $551 million for the related agencies , which was 43.4% less than fy2018 regular funding .

the administration's fy2019 budget for cjs proposed eliminating several agencies and programs: eda , nist's manufacturing extension partnership , the community relations service ( its functions would have been moved to doj's civil rights division ) , cops office ( grants managed by the cops office would have been moved to ojp ) , nasa's education program , and the legal services corporation .

the administration requested some funding for the eda and legal services corporation for what would have been an orderly closeout of these agencies had congress adopted the administration's proposal .

the administration's budget also proposed to move funding for the high intensity drug trafficking areas ( hidta ) program to the dea .

currently , hidta funding is administered by the office of national drug control policy .

the administration's requested funding for many cjs accounts was below fy2018 levels ; however , there were a handful of exceptions: the census bureau's periodic census and programs account ( +$1.007 billion , +39.6% ) , doj's executive office of immigration review ( +$59 million , +11.8% ) , atf ( +$23 million , +1.8% ) , bis ( +$7 million , +6.3% ) , nsf's agency operations and award management account ( +$5 million , +1.6% ) , esa ( +$2 million , +2.0% ) , and the state justice institute ( +$2 million , +35.1% ) .

the administration also proposed a new account structure for nasa , with three new accounts: exploration research and technology , deep space exploration systems , and low earth orbit ( leo ) and spaceflight operations .

the proposed exploration research and technology account would have combined the space technology account with some elements of the exploration account and the proposed deep space exploration systems account would have been the exploration account minus the elements moved to the exploration research and technology account .

leo and spaceflight operations would essentially have been a renaming of the space operations account .

the house committee - reported bill ( h.r .

5952 ) would have provided a total of $73.923 billion for cjs for fy2019 , an amount that was 4.2% greater than regular fy2018 funding and 11.1% greater than the administration's request .

the house committee on appropriations recommended the following: $12.106 billion for the department of commerce , which was 8.7% greater than regular fy2018 funding and 23.6% greater than the administration's request ; $31.113 billion for the department of justice , which was 2.7% greater than regular fy2018 funding and 7.9% greater than the administration's request ; $29.728 billion for the science agencies , which was 4.3% greater than regular fy2018 funding and 8.6% greater than the administration's request ; and $976 million for the related agencies , which was 0.2% greater than regular fy2018 funding and 77.1% greater than the administration's request .

the committee - reported bill would have increased funding for most cjs accounts compared to regular fy2018 funding .

some of the exceptions included the following: ita ( - $2 million , - 0.4% ) ; nist's scientific and technical research and services account ( - $5 million , - 0.6% ) ; nist's industrial technology services account ( - $10 million , - 6.5% ) ; nist's construction of research facilities account ( - $199 million , - 62.4% ) ; noaa's operations , research , and facilities account ( - $63 million , - 1.8% ) ; noaa's procurement , acquisition , and construction account ( - $683 million , - 29.8% ) ; u.s .

marshals' construction account ( - $28 million , - 53.2% ) ; fbi's construction account ( - $305 million , - 82.4% ) ; bop's buildings and facilities account ( - $12 million , - 7.2% ) ; juvenile justice programs ( - $71 million , - 25.0% ) ; and nasa's education account ( - $10 million , - 10.0% ) .

in general , the committee - reported bill would have funded cjs accounts at or above the administration's request , but there were a few exceptions: bis ( - $7 million , - 5.9% ) ; noaa's procurement , acquisition , and construction account ( - $15 million , - 0.9% ) ; doj's general administration salaries and expenses ( - $12 million , - 10.3% ) ; juvenile justice programs ( - $18 million , - 7.6% ) ; nasa's operations research and technology account ( - $103 million , - 10.2% ) ; and the state justice institute ( - $1 million , - 15.9% ) .

the house committee on appropriations did not adopt most of the administration's proposals .

the committee did not eliminate funding for eda , nist's manufacturing extension partnership , the community relations service , nasa's education program , and the legal services corporation .

with the exception of nasa's education program , the committee - reported bill would have funded these agencies and programs at a level equal to fy2018 regular funding .

additionally , the committee - reported bill did not provide funding for the hidta program under the dea .

however , the committee adopted two of the administration's proposals .

funding for the cops program would have been moved to ojp under h.r .

5952 .

also , the committee - reported bill included the administration's proposed account structure for nasa .

the senate committee - reported bill ( s. 3072 ) would have provided a total of $72.648 billion for cjs for fy2019 , an amount that was 2.4% more than regular fy2018 funding and 9.2% more than the administration's request .

the senate committee - reported bill would have provided the following: $11.572 billion for the department of commerce , which was 3.9% more than regular fy2018 funding and 18.1% more than the administration's request ; $30.699 billion for the department of justice , which was 1.3% more than regular fy2018 funding and 6.5% more than the administration's request ; $29.400 billion for the science agencies , which was 3.1% more than regular fy2018 funding and 7.4% more than the administration's request ; and $977 million for the related agencies , which was 0.4% more than regular fy2018 funding and 77.3% more than the administration's request .

in general , the senate committee on appropriations recommended funding many cjs accounts at or above the regular fy2018 funding amount .

a few notable exceptions included the following: nist's construction of research facilities account ( - $161 million , - 50.5% ) ; noaa's procurement , acquisition , and construction account ( - $484 million , - 21.1% ) ; u.s .

marshals' construction account ( - $18 million , - 34.5% ) ; doj's interagency law enforcement account ( - $21 million , - 3.9% ) ; nasa's space operations account ( - $112 million , - 2.4% ) ; nasa's safety , security , and mission services account ( - $77 million , - 2.7% ) ; and nasa's construction and environmental compliance and restoration account ( - $174 million , - 31.0% ) .

the senate committee - reported bill would have funded nearly every cjs account at or above the level requested by the administration .

the senate committee on appropriations also declined to adopt many of the proposals the administration put forth in its fy2019 budget .

unlike the house committee - reported bill , s. 3072 would have funded the cops program through its own account and the committee did not include the administration's new account structure for nasa .

the committee did propose changing the name of nasa's education account to "science , technology , engineering , and mathematics opportunities. .

the senate bill would have also funded the office on violence against women via a transfer from the crime victims fund .

on february 15 , 2019 , president trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l .

116-6 ) , which includes $72.908 billion for cjs .

the fy2019 enacted amount is 2.8% more than regular fy2018 funding and 9.5% more than the administration's request .

the act includes the following: $11.414 billion for the department of commerce , which is 2.5% more than regular fy2018 funding and 16.5% more than the administration's request ; $30.934 billion for the department of justice , which is 2.1% more than regular fy2018 funding and 7.3% more than the administration's request ; $29.583 billion for the science agencies , which is 3.8% more than regular fy2018 funding and 8.1% more than the administration's request ; and $977 million for the related agencies , which is 0.3% more than regular fy2018 funding and 77.3% more than the administration's request .

fy2019 enacted funding is generally in - line with regular fy2018 funding and higher than the administration's request .

some notable increases in fy2019 enacted funding compared to regular fy2018 funding include the following: census bureau's periodic censuses and programs account ( +$1.007 billion , +39.6% ) , executive office of immigration review ( +$59 million , +11.8% ) , u.s .

attorneys ( +$75 million , +3.5% ) , u.s .

marshals' salaries and expenses account ( +$47 million , +3.5% ) , fbi's salaries and expenses account ( +$162 million , +1.8% ) , dea's salaries and expenses account ( +$77 million , +3.5% ) , bop's salaries and expenses account ( +$136 million , +1.9% ) , bop's buildings and facilities account ( +$102 million , 63.4% ) , nasa's science account ( +$684 million , +11.0% ) , nasa's space technology account ( +$167 million , +22.0% ) , nasa's exploration account ( +$261 million , +5.4% ) , nsf's research and related activities account ( +$186 million , +2.9% ) , and nsf's major research equipment and facilities construction account ( +$113 million , +61.8% ) .

there were also a few notable decreases in fy2019 enacted funding compared to regular fy2018 funding: nist's construction of research facilities account ( - $213 million , - 66.8% ) ; noaa's procurement , acquisition , and construction account ( - $535 million , - 23.4% ) ; u.s .

marshals' construction account ( - $38 million , - 71.9% ) ; nasa's space operations account ( - $112 million , - 2.4% ) ; and nasa's construction and environmental compliance and restoration account ( - $214 million , - 38.1% ) .

congress largely declined to adopt the administration's proposals for cjs .

congress did not adopt the administration's proposed account structure for nasa ( though congress changed the name of nasa's education account to the "science , technology , engineering , and mathematics engagement" account ) , it did not move funding for the hidta program to the dea , and it did not move cops funding to ojp .

congress also provided funding for the eda , nist's manufacturing extension partnership , doj's community relations service , and the legal services corporation , all of which the administration proposed eliminating .

table 1 outlines the fy2018 funding , the administration's fy2019 request , the house and the senate committee - reported amounts , and fy2019 funding for the department of commerce , the department of justice , the science agencies , and the related agencies .

table 2 provides information on fy2018 supplemental funding for cjs .

 figure 1 shows the total cjs funding for fy2009-fy2018 , in both nominal and inflation - adjusted dollars ( more - detailed historical appropriations data can be found in table 3 ) .

the data show that nominal funding for cjs reached a new 10-year high in fy2018 , if emergency supplemental funding from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .

111-5 ) is not counted .

otherwise , peak funding for cjs over the past 10 fiscal years was in fy2009 when arra provided a substantial increase in funding .

the $15.992 billion in funding for cjs under arra added approximately 25% to the amount congress and the president provided for cjs through the regular appropriation process that year .

while regular nominal funding over the past 10 fiscal years was at its highest in fy2018 , in inflation - adjusted terms , funding for fy2018 was lower than it was in fy2010 .

increased funding for cjs coincides with the increase to the discretionary budget caps under the budget control act of 2011 ( bca , p.l .

112-25 ) .

the bca put into effect statutory limits on discretionary spending for fy2012-fy2021 .

under the act , discretionary spending limits were scheduled to be adjusted downward each fiscal year until fy2021 .

however , legislation was enacted that increased discretionary spending caps for fy2014 to fy2018 .

a sequestration of discretionary funding , ordered pursuant to the bca , cut nearly $4 billion out of the total amount congress and the president provided for cjs for fy2013 .

since then , funding for cjs has increased as more discretionary funding has been allowed under the bca .

figure 2 shows total cjs funding for fy2009-fy2018 by major component ( i.e. , the departments of commerce and justice , nasa , and the nsf ) .

increases in cjs funding in fy2009 ( not including arra funding ) and fy2010 largely resulted from more funding for the department of commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census , though there were small increases during that same time in funding for doj , nasa , and nsf .

although decreased appropriations for the department of commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in cjs appropriations from fy2010 to fy2013 ( a 47.4% reduction ) , cuts in funding for doj ( - 8.7% ) and nasa ( - 9.8% ) also contributed .

funding for nsf held relatively steady from fy2010 to fy2013 .

overall cjs funding has increased since fy2014 , and this is partially explained by more funding for the department of commerce to help the census bureau prepare for the 2020 decennial census .

however , over this time period there have also been steady increases in funding for doj ( +9.5% ) , nasa ( +18.0% ) , and nsf ( +8.5% ) , as higher discretionary spending caps have been used to provide additional funding to these agencies .

also , the increase in funding for the department of commerce is not solely due to more funding for the census bureau .

funding has increased for other agencies within the department , such as noaa ( +18.7% ) and nist ( +$41.0% ) .
