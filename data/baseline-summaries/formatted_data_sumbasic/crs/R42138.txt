the country's immigration and naturalization laws have been subjects of episodic controversy since america's founding , but unauthorized migration only became an issue in the early 20 th century , when congress passed the first strict restrictions on legal admissions .

unauthorized migration declined during the great depression and during and after world war ii , when most labor migration occurred through the u.s. - mexico bracero program .

immigration control re - emerged as a national concern during the 1970s , when the end of the bracero program , new restrictions on western hemisphere migration , and growing u.s. demand for foreign - born workers combined to cause a sharp increase in unauthorized migration flows .

congress responded in 1986 by passing the immigration reform and control act ( irca , p.l .

99-603 ) , which authorized a 50% increase in border patrol staffing , among other provisions .

border security has remained a persistent topic of congressional interest since then , and enforcement programs and appropriations have grown accordingly , as described in this report .

despite a growing enforcement response , however , unauthorized migration continued to increase over most of the next three decades .

after 2005 , unauthorized migrant apprehensions began to decline , suggesting a decrease in unauthorized migration .

apprehensions of unauthorized migrants at the u.s. - mexico border fell from about 1.2 million in fy2005 to a 41-year low of 378,577 in 2011 .

apprehensions then climbed to 479,371 in fy2014 , before falling to 331,333 in fy2015 .

additionally , it is estimated that after 2007 the number of unauthorized migrants living in the united states also declined .

in 2014 , the obama administration announced executive actions to "fix" the immigration system .

these actions address several issues , including a security plan at the southern border .

some members of congress and state officials , however , disagree with the president's plan and have called on the administration to do more to secure the border .

border security has been a recurrent theme in congress's debate about immigration reform since 2005 , and some members of congress have argued that congress should not consider additional immigration reforms until the border is more secure .

this report reviews efforts to combat unauthorized migration across the southwest border in the nearly three decades since irca initiated the modern era in migration control .

in reviewing such efforts , the report takes stock of the current state of border security and considers lessons that may be learned about enhanced enforcement at u.s. borders .

the report begins by reviewing the history of border control and the development of a national border control strategy beginning in the 1990s .

the following sections summarize appropriations and resources dedicated to border enforcement , indicators of enforcement outcomes , metrics for border security , and possible secondary and unintended consequences of border enforcement .

the report concludes by reviewing the overall costs and benefits of the current approach to migration control and raising additional questions that may help guide the discussion of these issues in the future .

congress created the u.s. border patrol ( usbp ) within the departments of commerce and labor by an appropriations act in 1924 , two days after passing the first permanent numeric immigration restrictions .

numerical limits only applied to the eastern hemisphere , barring most asian immigration ; and the border patrol's initial focus was on preventing the entry of chinese migrants , as well as combating gun trafficking and alcohol imports during prohibition .

the majority of agents were stationed on the northern border .

the border patrol became part of the new immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) in 1933 , and the ins moved from the department of labor to the department of justice in 1940 .

the border patrol's focus shifted to the southwest border during world war ii , but preventing unauthorized migration across the southwest border remained a low priority during most of the 20 th century .

unauthorized migration from mexico increased after 1965 as legislative changes restricted legal mexican immigration at the same time that social and economic changes caused stronger migration "pushes" in mexico ( eg , inadequate employment opportunities ) and stronger "pulls" in the united states ( eg , employment opportunities , links to migrant communities in mexico ) .

congress held hearings on unauthorized migration beginning in 1971 , and after more than a decade of debate passed the immigration reform and control act of 1986 ( irca , p.l .

99-603 ) , which described border enforcement as an "essential element" of immigration control and authorized a 50% increase in funding for the border patrol , among other provisions .

congress passed at least 11 additional laws addressing unauthorized migration over the next two decades , 7 of which included provisions related to the border .

statutory and strategic changes since 1986 are reflected in border enforcement appropriations and in cbp's assets at the border , including personnel , infrastructure , and surveillance technology .

this section reviews trends in each of these areas .

for 90 years , the border patrol has recorded the number of deportable migrants apprehended in the united states ; and migrant apprehensions remain the agency's primary indicator of immigration enforcement .

the agency also collects several additional measures of immigration enforcement , including unique apprehensions , migrant recidivism , and estimated turn backs and got aways .

these enforcement outcomes provide insight into the state of the border , as discussed in this section , but they confront certain limitations when it comes to estimating unauthorized border inflows ( see " metrics of border security " ) .

while the border patrol has data on various enforcement outcomes , these enforcement data were not designed to measure overall border security or unauthorized inflows .

furthermore , enforcement data depends on enforcement resources .

in general , usbp enforcement outcomes ( eg , apprehensions , estimated got aways ) are a function of ( 1 ) the underlying unauthorized flows and ( 2 ) the agency's ability to detect such flows .

enforcement data alone cannot disentangle these two factors .

as a result , enforcement data may tend to overestimate unauthorized flows where resources are robust , and to under - estimate such flows where resources are scarce .

thus , dhs officials have testified that current enforcement data do not offer a suitable metric to describe border security .

given the limits of existing border enforcement data , over time , dhs and usbp have developed different metrics for estimating unauthorized border flows and describing border security .

border security metrics are used at both the strategic and operational levels .

at the strategic level , dhs uses metrics to understand its ability to meet border security objectives .

the department is currently working to develop a new metric of border security , the unauthorized flow of migrants into the united states .

the estimate will be generated through the use of the repeated trials method , also known as the capture - recapture method .

additionally , dhs also reports two other metrics of border security on its annual performance reports .

first , the percentage of people apprehended multiple times along the southwest border , or the recidivism rate , is used to capture usbp's ability to deter migrants from re - entering the united states .

second , the rate of interdiction effectiveness along the southwest border between ports of entry , or the effectiveness rate , measures usbp's ability to apprehend unauthorized migrants .

at the operational level , usbp conducts risk assessments that use a range of metrics .

its methodology , "state of the border risk methodology," estimates the magnitude of risk through the use of intelligence information , a detailed awareness of threats at the border , and a standardized measure of risk .

though these assessments are not used as metrics themselves , usbp's methodology monitors certain metrics at the sector level that may be able to speak to usbp's performance ( such as the recidivism rate and effectiveness rate ) .

usbp conducts these risk assessments at the sector level and employs them to make day - to - day decisions with regard to how it uses its resources .

while no single metric accurately and reliably describes border security , most analysts agree , based on available data , that the number of unauthorized border crossers fell sharply between about 2005 and 2011 , with some rise in unauthorized flows from 2012 to 2014 , and a decrease in 2015 .

this conclusion is supported by key border patrol enforcement data described above , including the drop in total apprehensions and the drop in estimated got aways and total estimated known entries across eight out of nine border patrol sectors .

survey data confirm an apparent drop in unauthorized inflows , and measure such effects away from the border .

for example , according to data collected by the princeton mexican migration project , an average of about 2% of all mexican men initiated a first unauthorized trip to the united states each year between 1973 and 2002 ; but that percentage has fallen sharply since 2002 , to below 0.4% in 2008-2011 .

another study found that the annual probability of a mexican individual taking an initial unauthorized trip to the united states averaged .009 ( ranging from .003 to .014 ) from 1970 to 2007 .

estimates of the unauthorized population in the united states report drops of about 1 million unauthorized migrants , from approximately 12.2 million in 2007 to 11.3 million in 2014 .

furthermore , the pew hispanic center estimates that net ( i.e. , northbound minus southbound ) migration between mexico and the united states has resulted in a net loss of 140,000 from 2009 to 2014 , meaning more mexicans have returned to mexico than have migrated to the united states .

according to gao's analysis of border patrol metrics , eight out of nine border patrol sectors ( all except the big bend sector ) showed improved effectiveness rates between fy2006 and fy2011 .

in the tucson sector , the main focus of gao's analysis , the effectiveness rate improved from 67% to 87% during this period .

the san diego , el centro , yuma , and el paso sectors all had effectiveness rates in fy2011 of about 90% ; the del rio and laredo sectors ( along with tucson ) had rates above 80% ; and the big bend and rio grande valley sectors had rates between 60% and 70% .

border enforcement is only one of several factors that affect unauthorized migration .

thus , if unauthorized entries indeed fell after 2006 , to what degree is this change attributable to enforcement versus other developments , such as the u.s. economic downturn since 2007 , and / or economic and demographic changes in mexico and other countries of origin ? .

disentangling the effects of enforcement from other factors influencing migration flows is particularly difficult in the current case because many of the most significant new enforcement efforts — including a sizeable share of new border enforcement personnel , most border fencing , new enforcement practices at the border , and many of the new migration enforcement measures within the united states — all have occurred at the same time as the most severe recession since the 1930s .

nonetheless , the drop in recidivism rates suggests that an increasing proportion of migrants are being deterred by cbp's enforcement efforts .

for example , one study found that border enforcement did not affect the likelihood of mexican migrants making their first unauthorized trip to the united states but that it does have a pronounced effect on their likelihood of making additional trips .

surveys of unauthorized migrants repatriated to mexico in 2005 and 2010 also suggest that enforcement is increasingly likely to deter future immigration .

furthermore , academic research from 2012 provides evidence that border enforcement has contributed to a reduction in unauthorized flows .

these findings are noteworthy , in part , because they contradict earlier academic research , much of which found that border enforcement had a limited impact or even was counter - productive when it came to migration control efforts ( also see " migration flows: "caging" effects and alternative modes of entry " ) .

this research suggests that the recent build - up in immigration enforcement at the border and within the united states may have had a greater deterrent effect on unauthorized migration than earlier efforts .

nonetheless , some uncertainty will remain about the true level of border security as long as u.s. employment demand remains below historic levels .

the preceding discussion includes estimates of what may be described as the primary costs and benefits of border enforcement , defined in terms of congressional appropriations and deployment of enforcement resources on one hand , and migrant apprehensions and other indicators of successful enforcement on the other .

a comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits of border enforcement policies may also consider possible unintended and secondary consequences .

such consequences may produce both costs and benefits — many of which are difficult to measure — in at least five areas: border - area crime and migrant deaths , migrant flows , environmental impacts , effects on border communities , and u.s. foreign relations .

the united states has focused substantial resources along its land borders to prevent and control unauthorized migration since the 1980s , with investments in personnel , fencing , and surveillance assets all up significantly in the post 9 / 11 period , in particular .

since 2005 , cbp also has transformed its approach to managing enforcement outcomes , through its consequence delivery system .

measuring the effects of border enforcement is difficult .

on one hand , after reaching a high point in 2000 , border patrol apprehensions fell sharply in 2007-2011 , reaching a 42-year low in fy2011 .

apprehensions then increased from 2012 to 2014 , before falling in 2015 .

the border patrol's ident database also indicates a declining proportion of migrants are apprehended more than once ( i.e. , recidivism is down ) .

estimates based on enforcement and survey data and accounting for estimated apprehension and deterrence rates suggest that total unauthorized inflows in 2009-2011 were well below levels observed in the two decades after irca's passage , but that unauthorized inflows increased somewhat in 2012 .

on the other hand , there is also some evidence that migrants have adapted to more difficult conditions at the border by using other means to enter the united states and by remaining longer .

a comprehensive accounting also may consider various potential unintended consequences of border enforcement on the civil rights of legal residents and u.s. citizens in the border region , on migrants' human rights , on the quality of life in border communities , on the environment and wildlife , and on u.s. - regional relations .

what do these findings mean for members of congress who oversee border security and immigration policy ? .

especially in light of current fiscal constraints , some members of congress may evaluate future border enforcement in terms of expected returns on america's investments , and they may consider the possibility that certain additional investments at the border may be met with diminishing returns .

border infrastructure may offer an example: with 651 miles of fencing and barriers already in place along the southwest border , each additional mile would be in ever more remote locations , and therefore more expensive to install and maintain and likely to deter fewer unauthorized migrants .

similarly , some members of congress may question the concrete benefits of deploying more sophisticated surveillance systems across the entire northern and southern borders , including vast regions in which too few personnel are deployed to respond to the occasional unauthorized entry that may be detected .

deciding how to allocate border resources therefore requires a clear definition of the goals of border security .

zero admissions of unauthorized migrants may not be a realistic goal when it comes to migration control , as noted above , and is a higher standard than is expected of most law enforcement agencies .

while this report focuses on migration control at u.s. borders , border security also encompasses the detection and interdiction of weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) , narcotics , and other illicit goods ; policies to combat human trafficking ; and other security goals .

these diverse goals are often conflated in an undifferentiated debate about "border security" ; but each of these goals may suggest a different mix of border investments , as well as different metrics and different standards for successful enforcement outcomes .

should policies to prevent unauthorized migration be held to the same standards as policies to prevent the entry of wmds , for example ? .

regardless of how these questions are answered in principle , debates about immigration control and border security may benefit from better metrics of border security and unauthorized migration , and from a more analytical approach to program design .

the border patrol has taken a step in this direction by analyzing recidivism data as a function of different enforcement outcomes through its consequence delivery system .

this report also identifies several metrics for measuring border security , all of which have advantages and disadvantages .

in the context of immigration policy and a possible immigration reform bill , members of congress may choose to focus on the total number of unauthorized migrants in the united states , in addition to border flows , since border enforcement is just one of many factors ( along with interior enforcement , visa policies , etc. ) .

influencing the size of the unauthorized population , and because more is known about the population number than about border flows .
