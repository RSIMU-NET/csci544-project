 ( see " restrictions on travel and remittances ," below. ) .

political and economic developments in cuba and u.s. policy toward the island nation , located just 90 miles from the united states , have been significant congressional concerns for many years .

especially since the end of the cold war , congress has played an active role in shaping u.s. policy toward cuba , first with the enactment of the cuban democracy act ( cda ) of 1992 ( p.l .

102-484 , title xvii ) and then with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity ( libertad ) act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) .

both measures strengthened u.s. economic sanctions on cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s but also provided roadmaps for a normalization of relations dependent upon significant political and economic changes in cuba .

a decade ago , congress partially modified its sanctions - based policy toward cuba when it enacted the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 or tsra ( p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) allowing for u.s. agricultural exports to cuba .

over the past decade , much of the debate in congress over u.s. policy has focused on u.s. sanctions , especially over u.s. restrictions on travel to cuba .

in 2009 , congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure ( p.l .

111-8 ) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports , marking the first congressional action easing cuba sanctions in almost a decade .

the obama administration took further action in april 2009 by lifting all restrictions on family travel and on cash remittances by family members to their relatives in cuba .

in january 2011 , the administration announced the further easing of restrictions on educational and religious travel to cuba and on non - family remittances .

in december 2014 , just after the adjournment of the 113 th congress , president obama announced a major shift in u.s. policy toward cuba , moving away from a sanctions - based policy aimed at isolating cuba to a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations .

this report is divided into three major sections analyzing cuba's political and economic environment , u.s. policy , and selected issues in u.s. - cuban relations .

legislative initiatives in the 114 th congress are noted throughout the report , and four appendixes provide a listing of enacted measures and approved resolutions ( appendix a ) , bills receiving some action in 2015 and 2016 ( appendix b ) , and additional bills and resolution introduced in the 114 th congress ( appendix c ) .

for many years , congress has played an active role in u.s. policy toward cuba through the enactment of legislative initiatives and oversight on the numerous issues that comprise policy toward cuba .

these include u.s. economic sanctions on cuba , such as restrictions on travel , remittances , and agricultural and medical exports ; terrorism issues , including cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism ; human rights issues , including funding and oversight of u.s. - government sponsored democracy and human rights projects ; funding and oversight for u.s. - government sponsored broadcasting to cuba ( radio and tv martí ) ; migration issues ; bilateral antidrug cooperation ; and u.s. claims for property confiscated by the cuban government .

although any change to the government's one - party communist political system appears unlikely , cuba is moving toward a post - castro era .

raúl castro has said that he would step down from power once his term of office is over in february 2018 .

moreover , generational change in cuba's governmental institutions has already begun .

under raúl and beyond , the cuban government is likely to continue its gradual economic policy changes , moving toward a more mixed economy with a stronger private sector , although it is uncertain whether the pace of reform will produce major improvements to the cuban economy .

the cuban communist party's seventh congress , held in april 2016 , confirmed that cuba will continue its gradual pace toward economic reform .

the obama administration's shift in u.s. policy toward cuba opened up engagement with the cuban government in a variety of areas .

economic linkages with cuba will likely increase because of the policy changes , although to what extent is uncertain given that the overall embargo and numerous other sanctions against cuba remain in place .

moreover , the direction of u.s. policy toward cuba under the incoming trump administration is uncertain , with some statements by president - elect trump suggesting that he might reverse some of the obama administration's policy changes .

the human rights situation in cuba is likely to remain a key congressional concern .

just as there were diverse opinions in the 114 th congress over u.s. policy toward cuba , debate over cuba policy will likely continue in the 115 th congress , especially with regard to u.s. economic sanctions .

naval station at guantánamo , bay , cuba , or the implementation of a modification to a 1934 treaty that would constructively close the naval station .

section 414 would have prevented funds in the bill from being used by the federal maritime administration or the administrator of the maritime administration to issue a license or certificate for a commercial vessel that docked or anchored within the previous 180 days within 7 miles of a port or property that was confiscated by the cuban government .

before consideration of the bill by the full house appropriations committee , the administration wrote a letter to the chair and ranking member of the committee on june 10 , expressing serious concerns about the legislation .

among its concerns , the administration maintained that the bill "includes provisions that would restrict administration activities relating to cuba , including the establishment or operation of a u.s. diplomatic presence in cuba beyond what was in existence on december 17 , 2014 , interfering with the executive branch's ability to make the best decisions consistent with our national security. .

among the cuba provisions in the house and senate versions: section 7007 of both the house and senate versions would continue to prohibit direct funding for the government of cuba .

section 7015 ( f ) of both the house and senate versions would continue to require that foreign aid for cuba not be obligated or expended except as provided through the regular notification procedures of the committees on appropriations .

section 7031 ( c ) of the house bill would not have allowed for a waiver for restrictions against eligibility for entrance into the united states with respect to officials of the cuban government and their immediate family members from cuba ( including members of the cuban military and high - level officials of the cuban communist party ) whom the secretary of state has credible information have been involved in significant corruption , including corruption related to the extraction of natural resources or a gross violation of human rights .

the report to the house bill would have directed the secretary of state , for the purposes of implementing section 7031 ( c ) and applying presidential proclamation 7750 , to consider the confiscation of properties belonging to american companies by corrupt cuban officials as having serious adverse effects on international activity of u.s. businesses and on the national interests of the united states .

the senate bill did not have a similar provision .

section 7045 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the house bill would have provided $30 million to promote democracy and civil society in cuba , $10 million above the administration's request , and would have provided that no funds could be obligated for business promotion , economic reform , entrepreneurship , or any other assistance that is not democracy - building as expressly authorized in the libertad act .

the report to the house bill would have provided that not less than $8 million of the $30 million shall be for the national endowment for democracy ; that remaining funds should be administrated by the state department's bureau of democracy , human rights and labor ( drl ) , bureau of western hemisphere affairs ( wha ) , and usaid ; and that grants exceeding $1 million shall be awarded only to organizations with experience promoting democracy inside cuba .

section 7045 ( c ) of the senate bill would have provided $15 million in esf for cuba democracy programs , and $5 million in esf ( notwithstanding any other provision of law ) for programs to support private cuban entrepreneurs , except that no such assistance may be provided for the cuban government .

in addition , the report to the senate bill stated that the committee expected a portion of the $50.5 million to promote internet freedom in section 7078 of the bill to be used to support internet freedom in cuba .

section 7045 ( c ) ( 2 ) of the house bill would prohibit funding to establish an independent grantee organization to carry out any and all broadcasting and related programs to the latin america and caribbean region , including cuba , or substantively alter the structure of the office of cuba broadcasting .

the report to the house bill recommended not less than $28.130 million for the office of cuba broadcasting , almost $2.2 million less than the administration's $30.3 million request and $1 million more than that provided in fy2015 .

during house appropriations committee consideration , an amendment offered by representative serrano to shift $5 million from cuba broadcasting to efforts to counter russian media was rejected by a vote of 18-33 .

the report to the senate bill , s. 1725 ( s.rept .

114-79 ) , recommended $27.130 million for ocb , and also did not support or include authority for the merger of ocb and voa's latin american division .

section 7045 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the house version would have prohibited funds for the establishment or operation of a u.s. diplomatic presence , including an embassy , consulate , or liaison office in cuba beyond that which was in existence prior to december 17 , 2014 , until the president determined and reported to congress that the requirements and factors specified in section 205 of the libertad act ( related to cuba having a transition government ) have been met .

the administration requested just over $6 million for the conversion of the current u.s .

interests section in havana to an embassy , pending the reestablishment of diplomatic relations .

the senate version did not have such a provision .

the house bill had three cuba provisions that would have blocked part of the administration's policy shift on cuba related to travel and the importation of goods from cuba , and would have introduced an additional sanction on financial transactions with cuba .

in contrast , the senate bill had three provisions that would have lifted u.s. sanctions on cuba related to travel , financing for u.s. agricultural exports , and shipping .

as introduced , h.r .

2995 had three cuba provisions that would have blocked some of the administration's policy changes toward cuba .

the house appropriations committee approved a draft bill ( 30-20 ) on june 17 , 2015 .

before its approval , a lowey amendment offered to remove various riders , including the cuba provisions , was rejected by a vote of 19-31 .

before consideration of the bill by the full house appropriations committee , the administration wrote a letter to the chair and ranking member of the committee on june 16 , maintaining that the administration "strongly opposes language in the bill affecting foreign relations with cuba , including funding prohibitions on nonacademic educational exchanges. .

according to the letter , "this language would result in a reduction of people - to - people interactions and as such is counter to the administration's policy to increase overall travel and the flow of information and resources to private cubans .

this provision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to cuba. .

the three cuba provisions in h.r .

2995 included the following: section 130 would have prohibited funding to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow people - to - people educational travel to cuba .

section 131 would have prohibited funding to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow the use , purchase , trafficking , or import of property confiscated by the cuban government .

the provision appeared aimed at prohibiting the importation of alcohol and tobacco products by authorized u.s. travelers as accompanied baggage .

in january 2015 , the obama administration amended the embargo regulations to authorize the importation of no more than $100 of tobacco and alcohol products combined as part of an overall limit of up to $400 worth of goods from cuba as accompanied baggage for personal use .

these value restrictions were lifted by treasury department in october 2016 , so that only normal limits on duty and tax exemptions apply for merchandise imported as accompanied baggage for personal use .

section 132 would have prohibited funding to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow financial transactions with cuba's ministry of the revolutionary armed forces ( minfar ) , the ministry of the interior ( minint ) , their subsidiaries , and any officers of these ministries or their immediate family members .

the restrictions would not have applied to financial transactions with respect to exports permitted under tsra .

this provision would have introduced a new economic sanction that potentially could significantly have impeded u.s. financial transactions with cuba given that the cuban military , since the 1990s , has become increasingly involved in cuba's economy and running numerous companies .

in contrast , s. 1910 had three cuba provisions that would have lifted several u.s. sanctions on financing for u.s. agricultural exports , travel , and shipping .

the provisions were approved as amendments during the senate appropriations committee's july 23 , 2015 , markup of the bill .

section 638 of the bill would have repealed the prohibition on financing agricultural sales to cuba in tsra , including the requirement that payment for such products shall be only be payment of cash in advance or financing by third country financial institutions .

the provision was added by a boozman amendment approved by the full committee by voice vote .

section 641 of the bill would have lifted restrictions on travel to cuba .

it would have prevented any funding "to implement any law , regulation , or policy that prohibits or otherwise restricts travel , or any transaction incident to travel , to or from cuba by any citizen or legal resident of the united states. .

the provision further stated that any such law , regulations , or policy would cease to have any force or effect on and after the date of the enactment of the act , but would not limit the authority of the president to restrict travel or any transaction incident to such travel , if the restriction was important to u.s. national security or to protect human health or welfare .

the provision was added to the bill by a moran amendment approved by a vote of 18-12 .

section 642 of the bill would have repealed a provision in the cuban democracy act that prohibits a vessel that enters a cuban port to engage in trade from loading or unloading any freight in the united states within 180 days after departing cuba , except pursuant to a treasury department license .

the provision was added to the bill by a tester amendment approved by voice .

the provision appeared in part aimed at prohibiting the importation of alcohol and tobacco products by authorized u.s. travelers as accompanied baggage .

before consideration of the bill by the full house appropriations committee , the administration wrote a letter to the committee expressing concern about "highly problematic ideological riders," including "a provision that prohibits funds to be used allow property confiscated by the cuban government to enter the united states. .

the house bill had two cuba provisions .

section 537 would have prohibited funds in the act from being used to facilitate , permit , license , or promote exports to the cuban military or intelligence service or to any officer of the cuban military or intelligence service , or an immediate family member thereof .

it would not have affected the export of goods permitted under the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 .

similar to a provision in the house - passed fy2016 commerce appropriations measure , h.r .

2578 , this provision would have introduced a new sanction that would restrict additional categories of exports to cuba authorized as part of the administration's policy changes on cuba .

the provision could have significantly affected the expansion of u.s. exports to cuba given that the cuban military , since the 1990s , has become increasingly involved in cuba's economy and running numerous companies .

the administration's statement of policy on h.r .

2578 said that the bill included highly objectionable provisions , including non - germane foreign policy restrictions to cuba .

section 538 would have prohibited funds in the act from being used to approve the registration or renewal of , or maintenance of , a mark , trade name , or commercial name , used in commerce that is the same or substantially similar to a mark , trade name , or commercial name used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated unless the original owner has expressly consented .

the provision would have introduced a new sanction prohibiting the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) from approving , maintaining , or renewing such a trademark .

with regard to the havana club case , however , the uspto renewed the trademark registration in february 2016 until 2026 .

5485 introduced and reported ( h.rept .

114-624 ) by the house committee on appropriations june 15 , 2016 .

house approved ( 239-185 ) on july 7 , 2016 , with four cuba - related provisions .

the administration's statement of policy on the bill stated that the administration "strongly objects" to the four provisions , maintaining that they "would severely undermine the president's policy on cuba that aims to improve the lives of the cuban people and advance u.s. interests through expanded travel , commerce , and the free flow of information. .

section 132 would have prohibited funds in the bill to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow , whether by general or specific license , people - to - people educational travel to cuba described in 31 c.f.r .

565 ( b ) ( 2 ) .

in its statement of policy , the administration said that the provision "would result in a reduction of people - to - people interactions on purposeful travel to cuba and as such is counter to the administration's policy to increased overall travel and the flow of information and resources to private cubans. .

the administration stated that "the provision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to cuba by u.s .

citizens. .

section 133 would have prohibited funding to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow the use , purchase , trafficking , or import of property confiscated by the cuban government .

in its statement of policy , the administration maintained that the provision "could severely chill authorized u.s. - cuba commerce designed to support the cuban people. .

section 134 would have prohibited funding to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow any financial transaction with an entity owned or controlled , in whole or in part , by the cuban military or intelligence service or with any officer of the cuban military or intelligence service , or an immediate family member thereof , but the restrictions would not apply to financial transactions with respect to exports permitted under the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 .

in its statement of policy , the administration maintained that the provision "is overly broad and , as written , could significantly undermine the ability for u.s. persons to engage in otherwise authorized business in order to more effectively support the cuban people. .

section 135 would have prohibited funds to be used to authorize a general license or approve a specific license under 31 c.f.r .

801 or 31 c.f.r.527 with respect to a mark , trade name , or commercial name that is the same as or substantially similar to a mark , trade name , or commercial name that was used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated unless the original owner has expressly consented .

the provision would have introduced a new sanction prohibiting the treasury department's office of foreign assets control from issuing a general or specific license to allow for the payment of trademark registration fees .

an existing trademark sanction in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations measure ( §211 of division a , title ii , p.l .

105-277 ) prevents the united states from accepting payment for trademark registrations and renewals from cuban nationals that were used in connection with a business or assets in cuba that were confiscated , unless the original owner of the trademark has consented .

u.s. officials maintain that sanction prohibits a general license for transactions or payments for such trademarks .

in january 2016 , however , ofac issued a specific license for payments related to the renewal of the havana club trademark , and the uspto subsequently renewed the havana club trademark for the 2006-2016 period and then for 10 additional years until 2026 .

before house floor consideration , the house rules committee approved a structured rule ( h.rept .

114-639 , would have prohibited funds in the act from being used to administer or enforce 31 c.f.r .

the amendment was offered on july 7 , 2016 , as h.amdt .

1264 but subsequently was withdrawn .

s. 3067 introduced and reported ( s.rept .

114-280 ) by the senate appropriations committee june 16 , 2016 , with four cuba - related provisions .

section 634 would have amended the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 to allow for the financing of agricultural exports to cuba .

it would also eliminate a provision in the cuban democracy act of 1992 prohibiting a seaborne vessel entry into the united states if it has been involved in trade with cuba within the previous 180 days , except pursuant to a treasury department license .

section 635 would have prohibited funding in the act or any other act used to implement any law , regulation , or policy that prohibits or otherwise restricts travel , or any transaction incident to travel , to or from cuba by any citizen or legal resident of the united states .

section 636 would have prohibited funds in the act from restricting the export of consumer communication devices and other telecommunications equipment to cuba , the provision of telecommunications services to cuba , or the establishment of facilities to provide telecommunications connecting cuba with another country ; financing any such activity ; or entering into , performing , or making or receiving payments under a contract with any individual or entity in cuba with respect to the provision of telecommunications services involving cuba or persons in cuba .

section 540 of the house bill would have prohibited funds in the bill from being used to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow the trafficking or import or property confiscated by the cuban government .

when a similar provision was included the fy2016 homeland security appropriations bill , h.r .

3128 , the administration wrote a letter to the committee expressing concern about "highly problematic ideological riders," including "a provision that prohibits funds to be used allow property confiscated by the cuban government to enter the united states. .

the senate version of the fy2017 bill , s. 3001 , did not include such a provision .

h.r .

5728 ( katko ) / s. 3289 ( rubio ) .

cub an airport security act of 2016 .

similar but not identical bills .

both bills would have prohibited scheduled passenger air transportation between the united states and cuba until a study was completed regarding security measures and equipment at cuba's airports , the government accountability office conducted an audit of that report , and the secretary of homeland security established agreements with cuba allowing the federal air marshal service to conduct missions on regularly scheduled flights between the united states and cuba and allowing transportation security administration inspectors to access all areas of last point of departure airports in cuba for the purposes of security assessments .

the bills also would have amended section 44907 of title 49 of the u.s. code to clarify the role of the secretary of homeland security regarding security standards at foreign airports .
