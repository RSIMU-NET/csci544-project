economic growth in asia has contributed to relatively consistent long - term growth in u.s. agricultural exports to the region .

despite some year - to - year variation , the eu , the united states' fifth - largest agricultural export market , has been a relatively stable market for u.s. agricultural exports , with little growth since 1992 .

agricultural exports to countries in the former soviet union have declined in value since the 1992 break - up of the ussr .

agricultural exports to latin america , including mexico , and to canada have grown rapidly since the early 1990s , due in part to geographic proximity and nafta , among other factors .

like the eu , japan also has been a relatively stable and slow - growing market for u.s. agricultural exports .

u.s. agricultural exports to china , fueled by rates of gdp growth in excess of 9% , have grown rapidly since the early 1990s ( 16.4% ) .

fy2012 u.s. agricultural exports to china are forecast to be more than 10 times their value in fy2001 , when china became a member of the world trade organization .

rapid income growth in southeast asia also has stimulated demand for u.s. agricultural exports since 1992 .

the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-246 , 2008 farm bill ) was enacted into law in june 2008 and will govern most federal farm and food policies through 2012 .

the 2008 farm bill provides price and income support to u.s. agricultural producers through 2012 .

in addition , the farm bill authorizes programs for conservation , rural development , nutrition ( domestic food assistance ) , trade , and food aid .

budgetary outlays for all u.s. agricultural programs were $139.3 billion in fy2011 .

by one widely used measure , the producer support estimate ( pse ) calculated by the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , the united states provided an estimated $25.6 billion in agricultural support to producers in 2010 ( provisional estimate ) .

pses measure assistance to producers in terms of the value of monetary transfers generated by agricultural policy .

transfers are paid by consumers or by taxpayers in the form of market price support , direct payments , or other support .

they are a broader measure of support than direct government spending alone .

the percentage pse measures support in relation to gross farm receipts .

as a percent of gross farm receipts , the pse for the united states is 7% in 2010 , the third - lowest among oecd countries ( figure 24 , table 24 ) .

oecd attributes a decrease of 3% ( over 2009 ) in the pse expected for the united states for 2010 to a decrease in market price support for dairy .

over a longer period , the trend in producer support in the united states has been downward , dropping from a pse of 22% in 1986-1988 to 7% in 2010 .

among u.s. commodities , sugar is the most highly subsidized product in the united states , with a provisional single commodity transfer estimated at 28.3% of the gross value of sugar production in 2010 ( figure 25 , table 25 ) .

with agricultural exports totaling $137 billion in fy2011 , the united states is the world's largest exporter of agricultural products .

the united states applies tariffs and tariff quotas to products entering the united states from abroad .

according to the world trade organization ( wto ) , the united states' average applied tariff for agricultural products is 8.9% , which is above the average applied u.s. tariff for non - agricultural products ( 4% ) , but relatively low compared to other wto member countries .

about 170 tariff lines ( a tariff line is a product as described in a schedule or list of tariffs ) are subject to tariff quotas , including beef , dairy products , and sugar .

the average in - quota tariff was 9.1% in 2007 , while the out - of - quota was 42% .

under the wto agreement on agriculture , the united states made export subsidy reduction commitments for 13 commodities .

the 2008 farm bill repealed authority for the export enhancement program ( eep ) , which was used to fund subsidies for those products , with the exception of dairy products .

export subsidies , in the form of cash bonuses , can be provided to exporters of dairy products under the dairy export incentive program ( deip ) , which was reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill through 2012 .

prior to its repeal , no expenditures were made for eep from fy2002 .

spurred by declining prices for dairy products in 2008-2009 , usda announced in may 2009 deip allocations for nonfat dry milk , butter fat , and cheeses .

deip bonuses of $19 million were awarded in fy2009 .

in fy2010 , deip bonuses of $2 million were awarded .

no bonuses were awarded in fy2011 .

a federally chartered public corporation operated by usda , the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) , makes credit guarantees available to private financial institutions who finance the purchase of u.s. agricultural exports .

under the gsm - 102 , the ccc guarantees repayment of credit made available to finance u.s. agricultural exports on credit terms of up to three years .

exporters tallied $4.1 billion of agricultural exports under the gsm - 102 program in fy2011 .

usda announced $5.4 billion in ccc guarantees for agricultural exports under the gsm - 102 program for fy2012 .

the ccc also operates the facilities guarantee program ( fgp ) , which guarantees credit to u.s. banks that finance export sales of u.s. goods and services that are used to improve agricultural export - related facilities in emerging markets ( storage , processing , and handling facilities ) .

two export market development programs , the market access program ( map ) and the foreign market development program ( fmdp ) , assist producer groups , associations , and firms with promotional and other activities .

the united states is the world's leading supplier of food aid .

it provides more than half of the global total .

the united states provides food aid mainly through p.l .

480 , also known as the food for peace program .

wheat and wheat flour are the main commodities provided as food aid , but rice and vegetable oils are also important in p.l .

480 programs .

higher - value products are made available in special feeding programs .

responsibility for implementing food aid programs is shared by usda and the u.s. agency for international development ( aid ) .

p.l .

480 food aid is provided on a grant basis through title ii of the food for peace act of 2008 , the successor legislation of the agricultural trade and development assistance act of 1954 ( p.l .

480 ) .

two other food aid programs are conducted under section 416 ( b ) of the agricultural act of 1949 and the food for progress act of 1985 .

the former provides surplus ccc inventories , if available , as donations ; the latter provides concessional credit terms or commodity donations to support emerging democracies or countries making free market economic reforms .

a recently enacted food aid program , the mcgovern - dole school food for education program , finances school feeding and child nutrition projects in poor countries .
