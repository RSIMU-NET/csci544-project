it also provides an appendix of current vcf program statistics .

on september 22 , 2001 , the air transportation safety and system stabilization act ( atssa ; p.l .

107-42 ) was enacted into law .

quickly passed by congress in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , this legislation provided various forms of relief to the american airline industry and affirmed congress's commitment to improving airline safety .

title iv of the atssa also established the vcf to compensate persons injured or the representatives of persons killed in the attacks or their immediate aftermath .

the vcf originally closed in 2003 but was reopened and expanded in 2011 to provide compensation to the 2001 terrorist attacks' responders and others , such as certain new york city residents , who may have suffered health effects in the aftermath of the attacks .

the vcf was reauthorized in december 2015 and july 2019 and is currently authorized through the end of fy2092 with an october 1 , 2090 deadline for vcf claims .

the 2019 vcf reauthorization appropriates "such sums as may be necessary" for fy2019 and each fiscal year through fy2092 for the payment of vcf awards , with all funds to remain available until expended .

thus , funding for the vcf will not require annual appropriations or be subject to the annual appropriations process .
