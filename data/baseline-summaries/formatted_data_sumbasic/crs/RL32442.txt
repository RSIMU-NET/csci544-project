over the 13-year period 1991 through 2003 , u.s. farm cotton revenues annuallyaveraged $0.78 / lb .

 ( $0.57 from the marketplace plus farm subsidy payments of$0.21 ) .

in comparison , annual variable cash costs of production averaged $0.50 / lb.,and total economic costs averaged $0.78 / lb .

 ( see figure 11 . ) .

the substantialcontribution cotton subsidies play in helping cover production costs explains theirimportance to farmers .

in the absence of support programs , the data suggest asizeable proportion of cotton would not be profitable .

the 1994 wto agriculture agreement developed in the uruguay roundbrought all agricultural products listed in the agreement under more effectivemultilateral rules and commitments , including "tariff bindings. .

it prohibitssubsidies that exceed negotiated limits for specific products , and it specifiesgraduated reductions in domestic support .

however , this agreement was seen onlyas a beginning for reductions in protection and trade - distorting support .

article 20of the agriculture agreement committed members to start negotiations on continuingthe reform effort .

this commitment was fulfilled when the united states and other wto members began a new round of multilateral trade negotiations , called the doha developmentagenda ( dda .

 ) , in november 2001 .

the objectives for agricultural tradeliberalization are to substantially improve market access for agricultural products,reduce and phase out export subsidies , and substantially reduce trade - distorting ( production inducing ) domestic support .

one step in the negotiations was to agreeon a "framework" for the agriculture negotiations at a ministerial meeting in cancunin september 2003 .

just prior to the cancun meeting the united states and the eu reached agreement on a proposed framework for the agriculture negotiations .

this provokeda group of 21 developing countries ( that included , among others , argentina , brazil,china , and india ) to make a counterproposal ( called the g - 21 framework ) that calledfor deeper cuts in developed country domestic support , the elimination of exportsubsidies , and preservation of special and differential treatment for their ownsubsidies and tariffs .

this standoff reflected the continuing differences betweendeveloped and developing countries , and u.s. support for cotton was viewed assymbolic of the differences between the two groups .

developed ( u.s. and eu ) anddeveloping ( g - 21 ) nations' differences over cotton contributed to the failure to reachagreement on a framework for the agriculture negotiations .

four african cotton - exporting countries - - benin , burkina faso , chad , and mali - - proposed an end to global trade - distorting subsidies for cotton within threeyears with transitional compensation to be paid to producers .

the united states , inresponse , proposed a global sectoral initiative for cotton and textiles that would haveaddressed subsidies for cotton and textiles , tariffs on fibers , textiles and clothing,nontariff and other barriers in the fiber sector .

a compromise on cotton the cottonissue could not be reached at the september 2003 cancun ministerial conference andnegotiations broke down .

 ( see crs report rs21715 , the african cotton initiativeand wto agricultural negotiations . ) .

earlier , in december 2002 , brazil initiated a dispute settlement case ( ds267 ) at the wto against the u.s. cotton program .

brazil charges that u.s. cotton subsidyoutlays have exceeded u.s. commitments to the wto , which causes overproductionand higher exports that cause serious injury to the brazilian cotton sector .

u.s. tradeofficials argue that the subsidies provided to u.s. cotton growers have been withinthe allowable wto limits and are consistent with u.s. wto obligations .

consultations between the two countries failed to resolve the dispute and a disputesettlement panel was formed on march 18 , 2003 , to review the charges .

 ( see crs report rs21715 , u.s. - brazil wto cotton subsidy dispute . ) .

brazil also argues that the "step 2" provisions of the u.s. cotton program , as well as the favorable terms provided under u.s. export credit programs and themarket access program ( map ) , function as export subsidies and are inconsistentwith u.s. - wto obligations regarding export subsidies .

the united states considersstep 2 payments as part of its domestic support program since they are targeted todomestic cotton users as well as exporters and reports the payments as "amber" box ( trade - distorting ) domestic support payments .

u.s. trade officials also contend thatboth the u.s. export credit ( gsm ) programs and map are consistent with wtoobligations .

key to brazil's case is the argument that the united states is no longer exempt from wto dispute proceedings under the so - called "peace clause" ( article 13 ) of thewto's agreement on agriculture .

article 13 exempts domestic support measuresfrom being challenged as illegal subsidies as long as the level of support remains ator below the benchmark 1992 marketing year ( my ) levels .

brazil argues that u.s.cotton subsidies were about $2 billion in my1992 compared with over $4 billion inmy2001 .

therefore , brazil argues that the united states is no longer in compliancewith the requisite conditions and can no longer seek protection under the wto'speace clause rule .

the dispute settlement panel released its confidential interim report to brazil and the united states on april 26 , 2004 .

news reports suggest at least a partialfinding against the united states .

the panel's final report was released confidentiallyto the disputing parties on june 18 , 2004 , but the ruling is not expected to be madepublic until late august .

if the ruling is unfavorable , as expected , the united stateslikely will appeal , which would extend the process until mid - to late november 2004 .

resolution of the wto case in brazil's favor could result in a wto decisionconcerning implementation of u.s. cotton program provisions .

noncompliance withsuch a decision on the part of the united states could result in compensation tobrazil , or possible limited trade sanctions against u.s. cotton or other exports .

u.s. agricultural subsidies and import barriers in general and for cotton in particular have become a complicating factor in negotiating a free trade area of theamericas that would encompass 34 countries .

brazil and the united states co - chairthe trade negotiating committee , which is responsible for directing nine negotiatinggroups , one of which is agriculture .

differences between brazil and the unitedstates typify an underlying challenge .

the united states has a relatively low averagetariff compared to brazil and so is pushing for broad tariff reduction .

brazil andother latin american countries are pressing the case that the united states shouldrelax use of its trade remedy laws , curtail domestic subsidies for farmers , and lowerpeak tariffs related to quotas .

for many latin american countries , agricultural tradeis at the forefront of concerns , given the importance that it plays in their economies .

however , the united states does not want to address its agriculture policies in aregional ftaa , preferring that this be part of the global doha round negotiations .

 ( see crs report rl30935 , agricultural trade in the free trade area of theamericas . ) .

in each of the challenges described here , cotton is the focus for policies that apply to grains and oilseeds as well .

thus , if the united states is forced to makechanges to cotton programs , such changes can be expected to support programs thataffect much of u.s. crop production .

to stabilize and support farm incomes , in the face of highly variable prices caused by fluctuating world supply and demand conditions , major crops produced inthe united states , including cotton , have been subsidized since the 1930s .

mostrecently , the 2002 farm bill ( p.l .

107-171 ) authorized a price support framework thatprovides three unique subsidy mechanisms for upland cotton and other coveredcommodities ( including wheat , corn , sorghum , barley , oats , rice , soybeans and otheroilseeds , and peanuts ) .

by design , none of the three support mechanisms raises themarket price of cotton .

however , they do raise the effective price received byfarmers and so are called "price support" programs .

the three support mechanismsavailable to producers include ( 1 ) marketing assistance loans , ( 2 ) direct payments,and ( 3 ) counter - cyclical payments .

marketing assistance loan program .

upland cotton producers are eligible for the minimumnational average price of $0.52 / lb .

under the market assistance loan program on allthey produce .

els cotton producers are eligible for the minimum national averageprice of $0.7977 / lb .

under the marketing assistance loan program , but are not eligiblefor other support payments .

farmers with harvested cotton can use the stored commodity as collateral for a nonrecourse marketing assistance loan from the u.s. department of agriculture'scommodity credit corporation ( ccc ) .

the farmer has the choice of repaying theloan in full ( plus interest ) in order to recover clear title , which is commonly donewhen market prices are higher than the loan rate .

alternatively , when market pricesare lower than the loan rate , the farmer can repay the loan at the adjusted world price ( awp ) ( 12 ) , retain ownership of the cotton and sellit in the marketplace ( mostadvantageously when prices rise above the loan rate ) .

the difference between the loan rate and the awp is known as a marketing loan gain .

this gain is considered a direct payment from the ccc and is reportable assuch for income tax purposes .

this marketing loan gain is limited to $75,000 perperson per year ( but the rules allow a doubling of the limit for a spouse or formultiple farms ) .

by design , repayment of loans at the awp is intended to avoidacquisition of cotton by the ccc due to forfeiture of collateral in settlement of thenonrecourse loans .

forfeiture of cotton to ccc is another alternative available to thefarmer borrower .

still another way farmers can repay nonrecourse marketing assistance loans is to purchase cotton commodity certificates from the ccc at the adjusted world priceand use the certificates to repay the loans , the only use that is allowed for thecertificates .

gains achieved in this way ( though identical to gains achieved byrepaying loans at the awp ) are not subject to the per person annual payment limit .

farmers otherwise eligible to put cotton under loan can agree to forgo the loan option and instead receive loan deficiency payments ( ldps ) when market prices fallbelow the loan rate .

the ldp payment rate is the difference between the awp andthe loan rate ( financially equivalent to the marketing loan gain ) .

the loan deficiencypayment option has several administrative and financial advantages for farmers overactual nonrecourse loans , which encourages its use .

however , ldps are treated justlike marketing loan gains in terms of contributing toward the per person annualpayment limits .

marketing assistance loans reduce revenue risk associated with price variability and are considered production distorting in a wto - sense because benefits are linkeddirectly to production .

direct payments program .

the direct payments program pays upland cotton farmers $0.0667 / lb .

on 85% ofhistorical cotton production ( els cotton is not eligible ) .

these direct payments arenot linked to either current production or prices .

in fact , farms may but need notproduce cotton to receive the direct payments .

they are allowed to grow cotton orany other major grain or oilseed ( but not fruits and vegetables ) .

the united statesconsiders direct payments to be non trade - distorting under wto rules , althoughsome dispute this classification .

this decoupling of the support payments from production requirements and market prices was first adopted in the 1996 farm bill .

the payments were calledproduction flexibility contract ( pfc ) payments , or simply "contract payments. .

renamed "direct payments" in the 2002 farm bill , they were extended another sixyears through crop year 2007 .

direct payments are subject to an annual per personlimit of $40,000 , which can be doubled under the spouse or three - entity rules .

while direct payments are decoupled from both production and market prices , they are tied to acreage and so are capitalized into land values .

this wealth effectmay have some effects on production and investment decisions .

counter - cyclical program .

the counter - cyclical program was adopted in the 2002 farm bill and makes paymentsbased on 85% of historical production ( to the same farmers receiving directpayments ) .

the payment rate is counter - cyclical to the market price .

it goes up asthe season average market price for upland cotton declines below the target price of$0.7240 / lb .

the difference ( with adjustment ) between the lower season averagemarket price and the higher target price is the counter - cyclical payment rate .

thispayment rate is constrained on the lower end by the loan rate ( $0.52 ) plus the directpayment rate ( $0.0667 ) , and so cannot exceed $0.1373 / lb .

alternatively , if theseason average price is above $0.6573 , no counter - cyclical payments are made .

again , farmers need not produce cotton to receive the counter - cyclical payments .

while benefits are not linked to farmers' production decisions , they arelinked to market prices .

the linkage to market prices may be seen by some farmersas reducing market revenue risks , and so may influence some production decisions .

together , direct payments and counter - cyclical payments are called the direct andcounter - cyclical payments program ( dcp ) .

counter - cyclical payments are similar , but not identical to target price deficiency payments that were made from 1973 through 1995 .

the difference is that target pricedeficiency payments were made on each farmer's actual production of cotton eachyear whereas farmers now need not produce cotton to receive cotton counter - cyclicalpayments .

counter - cyclical payments are subject to an annual per person paymentlimit of $65,000 , which can be doubled under the spouse or three - entity rules .

market loss payments .

on an ad hoc basis , congress directed that market loss payments be made to commodityprogram participants for the 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , and 2001 crops .

these paymentswere a reaction to sharply lower market prices that , in the absence of target pricepayments , meant substantially lower farm revenue .

this experience played a criticalrole in the decision to create the counter - cyclical payments program in the 2002 farmbill .

most observers would say that the inclusion of counter - cyclical payments in the2002 farm bill institutionalized market loss payments .

with counter - cyclicalpayments in place , it is not expected that market loss payments will be applied tocotton or the other "covered commodities" through crop year 2007 , the life of thecurrent farm bill .

ccc expenditures for price support .

generally , a pound of cotton produced on program baseacreage is eligible for the loan program price of $0.52 , plus a fixed direct paymentof $0.05667 ( 85% of $0.0667 ) , plus a counter - cyclical payment of $0.1167 ( 85% of$0.1373 ( $0.724- ( $0.52+$0.667 ) ) .

this totals $0.6934 / lb .

 ( about 89% of the totaleconomic costs of production ) .

how much these three support mechanisms cost thegovernment depends upon how low market prices go .

however , no matter how highprices go , the government is obligated each year to make the fixed direct payments .

cotton produced outside of the program base is guaranteed only the market assistanceloan rate of $0.52 / lb .

 ( 13 ) the history of cotton price support payments is shown in figure 12 .

for crop years 1991 through 2003 , price support program payments averaged $1.441 billionannually .

when total price support payments are divided by production , the subsidies average $0.17 / lb .

from crop years 1991 through 2003 , ranging from a low of zero in1995 to a high of $0.38 in 2001 ( see figure 13 ) .

this $0.17 / lb .

average annualsubsidy amounts to 34% of the $0.50 / lb .

average variable cash costs of productionover that time period .

alternatively , this $0.17 / lb .

subsidy level was enough to covernearly 60% of the $0.29 / lb .

fixed and non - cash costs of production , including theaverage $0.08 / lb .

land cost .

one reason for supply instability is low crop yield caused by natural disaster conditions ( such as drought , flood , pests , and disease ) .

cotton producers can obtainsubsidized crop insurance to protect against these losses .

in addition , congress hasauthorized crop disaster payments nearly every year since 1982 to provide extraassistance for growers suffering substantial crop losses .

disaster payments wereavailable to qualifying growers who participated in the federally supported cropinsurance program as well as growers who chose to forego insurance .

crop insurance .

multi - peril crop insurance is available to cotton producers ( as well as most other crop producers ) toprotect against losses of crop yield from natural hazards .

nearly every cause of yieldloss is covered ( i.e. , weather , pests , fire , but not producer negligence ) , hence thedesignation multi - peril .

while the insurance is sold to farmers largely throughprivate agencies , the usda's risk management agency ( rma ) pays in excess of50% of the premiums .

additionally , the rma pays the private agencies nearly 24%of total premiums toward their administrative costs , plus rma's own administrativecosts , which have averaged 4% of total premiums .

by design , the crop insurance program is supposed to be actuarially sound .

in other words , over time total premiums ( producer plus government premiumcontributions ) are supposed to cover total indemnities .

in practice , however , the ratioof cotton losses to premiums from 1991 through 2003 has averaged 1.3 to 1 , and onlyin two years did premiums exceed indemnities .

the net losses ( indemnities overpremiums ) fall upon the federal government because it reinsures the privatelymarketed policies .

critics of the crop insurance program argue that the highpremium subsidy and the lack of actuarial soundness imply that the program ismerely another tool for transferring government funds to cotton farmers .

substantial revisions were made to the crop insurance program by congress in 1994 ( p.l .

103-354 , title i , federal crop insurance reform act of 1994 ) thateffectively mandated the participation of farm subsidy program recipients in cropyear 1995 .

while the mandatory provisions were eliminated the subsequent year,increased federal insurance subsidies enacted in 2000 ( p.l .

106-224 , agriculturalrisk protection act of 2000 ) encouraged participation to rise above 90% of plantedcotton acres .

from 1991 through 2003 , the federal cost of crop insurance annually has covered an average 10.9 million planted cotton acres .

the net federal cost ofpremium subsidies and the excess of indemnities over premiums averaged $219million per year ( see figure 14 ) .

these expenditures can be considered subsidies indirect support of farm income .

indirectly benefitting farmers were the reimbursementof private insurance agency administrative costs and federal administrative costs thattogether averaged an estimated $74 million per year .

counting only the $219 million annual average premium and indemnity subsidies , the average subsidy rate per pound of actual cotton production was $0.026over the 1991 through 2003 time period .

when the 1995 through 2003 post - reformperiod is examined alone , the subsidy rate is higher , at $0.032 / lb .

crop disaster payments .

congress , on an ad hoc basis , has mandated disaster payments above and beyondinsurance indemnities and also to producers who chose to not buy insurance .

overthe nine years from 1995 through 2003 , when an average of 90% of planted cottonacreage was insured , annual disaster payments ranged from zero ( in 6 of the years ) to $444 million .

the average was $100 million per year ( see figure 14 ) , equaling$0.01 / lb .

of production over that time period .

the farm income support programs are supplemented with additional tools to maintain sales of u.s. upland cotton when domestic prices are not low enough to becompetitive in international markets .

three competitiveness programs unofficiallyare called step 1 , step 2 , and step 3 .

step 1 allows for additional reductionsin themarketing assistance loan repayment rate when world market prices are higher thanthe loan rate .

step 2 pays domestic mills and exporters that purchase u.s. cottonwhen domestic prices are higher than world cotton prices .

and step 3 permitsspecial ( increased ) import quotas when domestic prices are higher than world cottonprices so that domestic mills have adequate supplies .

also , a separate limited globalimport quota for upland cotton ( which was adopted prior to the step 1 , step 2 , andstep 3 provisions ) remains in effect .

step 1 loan repayment rate reduction .

the step 1 adjustment provision was initially adoptedby the usda under its administrative authority on october 3 , 1989 .

congress putthe step 1 provision into statute in the 1990 farm bill ( p.l .

101-624 , sec .

501 ) .

boththe 1996 and 2002 farm bills retained the step 1 authority , but with technicalchanges .

however , the usda has not taken action under step 1 since 1992 .

marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price ( awp ) .

only when theawp is below the loan rate do farmers receive a subsidy payment .

a provision ofthe law allows the usda to lower the awp when the price of u.s. upland cottonsold in northern europe ( usne ) is higher than the price of competing cotton .

thisauthority to reduce the awp is unique to cotton and creates the opportunity forincreased marketing loan program subsidies , even when the price of upland cottonis higher than the loan rate .

a step 1 downward adjustment to the adjusted world price ( awp ) may be made when the five - day average of the u.s. northern european price ( usne ) exceeds the northern european price ( ne ) , and the awp is less than 115% of theloan level .

in this circumstance , the usda may lower the awp up to the differencebetween the usne price and the ne price .

in other words , when the awp is lessthan $0.598 ( 115% of $0.52 ) , it can be adjusted downward by the difference betweenthe higher usne price and the lower ne price .

the practical result of a step 1adjustment is to enable loan deficiency payments when us prices are higher than theloan price of $0.52 , and to increase the loan deficiency payment rate by increasingthe spread between the awp and the loan price .

step 2 payments to domestic mill users and exporters .

step 2 , first enacted in the 1990 farm bill and officiallyknown as upland cotton user marketing certificates , provides subsidy payments todomestic users and exporters of u.s. - produced cotton when its price is higher thanforeign - produced competing cotton .

by offsetting the price difference with directpayments , step 2 encourages u.s. yarn and fabric mills and exporters to purchaseu.s .

cotton .

in other words , the subsidy payment to buyers makes higher - priced u.s.cotton competitive in the marketplace with lower - priced foreign cotton .

currently,step 2 requires that through july 31 , 2008 , payments in either cash or marketingcertificates be made to domestic users and exporters for documented purchases ofu.s. - upland cotton when the usne price of upland cotton exceeds the ne price fora consecutive four - week period .

step 2 payments are not made if the awp exceeds134% of the loan rate , or $0.697 / lb .

similar user payments were adopted for elscotton in 1999 and are authorized through july 31 , 2008 .

figure 15 shows yearly ( august 1-july 31 ) payments ( but the expenditures are for all cotton , not necessarilycotton produced in that crop year ) .

from august 1 , 1991 through may 31 , 2004 , step2 payments have averaged $0.026 / lb .

of cotton produced in the united states .

step 3 special import quotas .

the united states maintains a tariff rate quota on imported upland cotton of 173.09million pounds ( equivalently , 360.6 thousand bales or 86.545 thousand metric tons ) .

the duty is nominal below the quota quantity , ranging from zero to $0.05 / lb .

abovethe quota quantity trigger , the duty increases to a prohibitively high $0.1424 / lb. ( $0.314 / kg ) .

in periods of short domestic supply ( due possibly to weather - relatedproduction shortages ) and strong world demand , u.s. mills might have insufficientsupplies .

so - called step 3 special import quotas allow for increased imports exemptfrom the high duty .

step 3 requires that a "special import quota" be opened if , for a consecutive four - week period , the usne price , adjusted for step 2 payments in effect theprevious week , exceeds the ne price .

another trigger for opening a step 3 quota isa decline in the u.s. stocks - to - use ratio to below 16% .

the size of the quota is equalto one week's domestic mill consumption .

importers have 90 days to make thepurchases and 180 days to bring the cotton into the country .

quota periods canoverlap .

total step 3 imports in any crop year are limited to five weeks of domesticmill use .

in practice , annual u.s. imports of cotton are much less than the 173 million pound tariff - rate quota .

the usda estimates that cotton imports will total about 19million pounds ( 40 thousand bales ) in the 2003 / 04 marketing year .

limited global import quota .

a "limited global import quota" for upland cotton equal to 21 days of domestic millconsumption is allowed ( at below tariff rate duty levels ) when spot market pricesshow sustained strength for a three - year period .

this allows domestic mills accessto lower - priced foreign cotton , helping them to compete with foreign mills .

limitedglobal import quotas cannot overlap with one another .

nor can a limited globalquota be established if a step 3 "special import quota" is in place .

the precisecondition for a limited import quota is an average spot market price for a month inexcess of 130% of the average spot market price for the preceding 36 months .

cotton , as well as other agricultural commodities , benefits from several export assistance programs .

federal export credit guarantees are available to eligible foreignbuyers who want to purchase commodities with borrowed funds .

additionally , theusda administers two promotion programs that operate on a cost - share basis withthe private sector .

the foreign market development ( fmd ) cooperator program ( also widely known as the cooperator program ) focuses on generic commoditypromotion and the market access program ( map ) focuses on value - addedagricultural products .

fmd and map are exempt from uruguay round agreementsubsidy reduction commitments .

export credit guarantees .

the usda's general sales manager ( gsm ) in the foreign agricultural service ( fas ) administers three credit guarantee programs for commercial financing of u.s. exportsof food and agricultural products .

with funds from the ccc , the governmentunderwrites credit extended by the private lenders to finance exporter sales to eligibleforeign importers .

the guarantees are intended to encourage sales in countries wherecredit is necessary , but where financing may not be available .

the credit guaranteeprograms replaced more costly direct loan programs .

usda views its credit guarantee programs as commercial programs , not as export subsidies .

the programs are supposed to support and encourage commerciallyviable transactions .

sales are made by private exporters to foreign buyers at pricesand other terms , such as interest rates , negotiated by the two parties .

however , thiscountry has been working within the organization for economic cooperation anddevelopment ( oecd ) to achieve internationally agreed disciplines on the use ofexport credits .

terms and conditions for export credit programs are now beingnegotiated in the wto .

gsm - 102 guarantees repayment of short - term bank loans ( up to three years ) , and gsm - 103 guarantees repayment of intermediate - term bank loans ( up to 10years ) .

for a fee , the guarantees cover 98% of principle and a portion of the interest .

eligible countries are those that usda determines can service the debt backed byguarantees ( the "creditworthiness" test ) .

cotton - related exporter applications forfy2003 totaled $334.8 million , all under gsm - 102 .

the supplier credit guarantee program ( scgp ) guarantees short - term credit ( not to exceed 180 days ) extended by u.s. exporters directly to their foreigncustomers .

cotton - related exporter applications for fy2003 totaled $11.73 million .

if a foreign borrower defaults on a guaranteed loan , the u.s. financial institution files a claim with the ccc for reimbursement , and the ccc assumes the debt .

if acountry subsequently falls in arrears to the ccc , typically its debts are rescheduled .

under wto rules , use of credit guarantees for foreign aid , foreign policy , or debtrescheduling purposes is prohibited .

foreign market development program .

the foreign market development cooperator program ( 7 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 5722 ) began in 1955 ( under authority of p.l .

83-480 , 7 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 1701 ) with the purpose of expanding bulk commodity export opportunities over the longterm by partially financing industry - sponsored consumer promotions , technicalassistance , trade servicing , and market research .

the 2002 farm bill reauthorized thefmd through fy2007 .

funding is from discretionary appropriations of no more than$34.5 million annually .

typically , nonprofit industry organizations submit proposalsfor marketing activities to the usda .

approved projects normally are reimbursedafter completion on a cost share basis of 45% federal and 55% private sector .

cooperators receiving federal funds under fmd in fy2002 for cotton - relatedactivities were the cotton council international ( $2,312,188 ) and the nationalcottonseed products association ( $90,635 ) .

market access program .

the market access program ( map ) was originally created in 1978 as the marketpromotion program ( p.l .

95-501 , 7 u.s.c .

ï¿½ 5623 ) .

the name was changed in the1996 farm bill , and the 2002 farm bill authorized annual appropriations of up to $100million in fy2002 and gradually increasing to $200 million for fy2006 and fy2007 .

it is intended to help develop foreign markets for value - added agricultural productsand operates as a cost - share program like the fmd program .

the types of activitiesthat are undertaken through map are advertising and other consumer promotions,market research , technical assistance , and trade servicing .

about 60% of map fundstypically support generic promotion ( i.e. , non - brand name commodities or products ) ,and about 40% support brand - name promotion ( i.e. , a specific company product ) .

the federal contribution for generic promotion is up to 90% and for brandedpromotion up to 50% .

the fy2003 allocation for the cotton council internationalis $8,406,098 .
