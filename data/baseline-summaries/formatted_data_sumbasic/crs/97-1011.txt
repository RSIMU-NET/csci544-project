article i , section 6 , of the u.s. constitution , states that the compensation of members of congress shall be "ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the united states. .

additionally , the twenty - seventh amendment to the constitution states , "no law , varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives , shall take effect , until an election of representatives shall have intervened. .

this amendment was submitted to the states on september 25 , 1789 , along with 11 other proposed amendments , 10 of which were ratified and became the bill of rights .

it was not ratified until may 7 , 1992 .

since fy1983 , member salaries have been funded in a permanent appropriations account .

the most recent pay adjustment for members of congress was in january 2009 .

since then , the compensation for most senators , representatives , delegates , and the resident commissioner from puerto rico has been $174,000 .

the only exceptions include the speaker of the house ( $223,500 ) and the president pro tempore of the senate and the majority and minority leaders in the house and senate ( $193,400 ) .

there are three basic ways to adjust member pay .

specific legislation was enacted to adjust member pay prior to 1968 .

it has been used periodically since , most recently affecting pay for 1991 .

the second method by which member pay can be increased is pursuant to recommendations from the president , based on those made by a quadrennial salary commission .

in 1967 , congress established the commission on executive , legislative , and judicial salaries to recommend salary increases for top - level federal officials ( p.l .

90-206 ) .

three times ( in 1969 , 1977 , and 1987 ) congress received pay increases made under this procedure ; on three occasions it did not .

effective with passage of the ethics reform act of 1989 ( p.l .

101-194 ) , the commission ceased to exist .

its authority was assumed by the citizens' commission on public service and compensation .

although the first commission under the 1989 act was to have convened in 1993 , it did not meet .

the third method by which the salary of members can be changed is by annual adjustments .

prior to 1990 , the pay of members , and other top - level federal officials , was tied to the annual comparability increases provided to general schedule ( gs ) federal employees .

this procedure was established in 1975 ( p.l .

94-82 ) .

such increases were recommended by the president , subject to congressional acceptance , disapproval , or modification .

congress accepted 5 such increases for itself — in 1975 , 1979 ( partial ) , 1984 , 1985 , and 1987 — and declined 10 ( 1976 , 1977 , 1978 , 1980 , 1981 , 1982 , 1983 , 1986 , 1988 , and 1989 ) .

the ethics reform act of 1989 changed the method by which the annual adjustment is determined for members and other senior officials .

this procedure employs a formula based on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the employment cost index ( eci ) .

the annual adjustment automatically goes into effect unless 1 .

congress statutorily prohibits the adjustment ; 2 .

congress statutorily revises the adjustment ; or 3 .

the annual base pay adjustment of gs employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled adjustment for members , in which case members would be paid the lower rate .

under this revised method , annual adjustments were accepted 13 times ( adjustments scheduled for january 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1998 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2008 , and 2009 ) and denied 16 times ( adjustments scheduled for january 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 , 2007 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 ) .

although discussion of the member pay adjustment sometimes occurs during consideration of annual appropriations bills , these bills do not contain funds for the annual salaries or pay adjustment for members .

nor do they contain language authorizing an increase .

the use of appropriations bills as vehicles for provisions prohibiting the automatic annual pay adjustments for members developed by custom .

a provision prohibiting an adjustment to member pay could be offered to any bill , or be introduced as a separate bill .

the maximum potential january 2020 member pay adjustment of 2.6% , or $4,500 , was known when the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) released data for the change in the employment cost index ( eci ) during the 12-month period from december 2017 to december 2018 on january 31 , 2019 .

each year , the adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied or modified statutorily by congress , or limited by the general schedule ( gs ) base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the maximum potential january 2019 member pay adjustment of 2.3% , or $4,000 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2016 to december 2017 on january 31 , 2018 .

each year , the adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied or modified statutorily by congress , or limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the 2019 gs base pay adjustment was 1.4% , automatically limiting any member pay adjustment to $2,400 .

5894 ) and senate - reported versions ( s. 3071 ) of the fy2019 legislative branch appropriations bill both contained provisions to prevent this adjustment .

the member pay provision was included in the bills as introduced and no separate votes were held on this provision .

division b of p.l .

115-244 , enacted september 21 , 2018 , included the pay freeze provision .

the maximum potential january 2018 member pay adjustment of 1.8% , or $3,100 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2015 to december 2016 on january 31 , 2017 .

each year , the adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied or modified statutorily by congress , or limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the 2018 gs base pay adjustment was 1.4% , automatically limiting any member pay adjustment to $2,400 .

the house - passed ( h.r .

3162 ) and senate - reported versions ( s. 1648 ) of the fy2018 legislative branch appropriations bill both contained provisions to prevent this adjustment .

the member pay provision was included in the bills as introduced and no separate votes were held on this provision .

neither bill was enacted prior to the start of fy2018 , and legislative branch activities were initially funded through a series of continuing appropriations resolutions ( crs ) ( p.l .

115-56 , through december 8 , 2017 ; p.l .

115-90 , through december 22 , 2017 ; p.l .

115-96 , through january 19 , 2018 ; p.l .

115-120 , through february 8 , 2018 ; p.l .

115-123 , through march 23 , 2018 ) .

p.l .

115-56 contained a provision , extended in the subsequent crs , continuing "section 175 of p.l .

114-223 , as amended by division a of p.l .

114-254 . .

this provision prohibited a member pay adjustment in fy2017 .

section 7 of the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

115-141 ) prohibited the adjustment for the remainder of the year .

the maximum potential january 2017 member pay adjustment of 1.6% , or $2,800 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2014 to december 2015 on january 30 , 2016 .

both the house - passed ( h.r .

5325 ) and senate - reported ( s. 2955 ) versions of the fy2017 legislative branch appropriations bill — which would provide approximately $4.4 billion in funding for the activities of the house of representatives , senate , and legislative branch support agencies — contained a provision that would prohibit this adjustment .

the member pay provision was included in the bills as introduced and no separate votes were held on this provision .

no further action was taken on h.r .

5325 or s. 2955 , but the pay prohibition language was included in the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-254 ) .

absent the statutory prohibition on a member pay adjustment , members of congress would have automatically been limited to a 1.0% ( $1,700 ) salary increase to match the increase in base salaries for gs employees .

the maximum potential january 2016 member pay adjustment of 1.7% , or $3,000 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2013 to december 2014 on january 30 , 2015 .

the house - passed and senate - reported versions of the fy2016 legislative branch appropriations bill ( h.r .

2250 ) both contained a provision prohibiting this adjustment .

the pay adjustment prohibition was subsequently included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) .

absent the statutory prohibition on a member pay adjustment , members of congress would have automatically been limited to a 1.0% ( $1,700 ) salary increase to match the increase in base salaries for gs employees .

the maximum potential january 2015 pay adjustment of 1.6% , or $2,800 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2012 to december 2013 on january 31 , 2014 .

each year , the adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied statutorily by congress , or limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the fy2015 legislative branch appropriations bill ( h.r .

4487 ) , as reported by the committee on appropriations and passed by the house on may 1 , 2014 , contained a provision prohibiting this adjustment .

this provision was continued in the house - passed and senate - reported versions of this bill , with no separate vote on the member pay provision .

no further action on this bill was taken , but the provision was subsequently included in section 8 of division q of the fy2015 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , which was enacted on december 16 , 2014 .

on august 29 , 2014 , president obama issued an "alternative pay plan for federal civilian employees," which called for a 1.0% increase in base salaries for general schedule employees .

absent the statutory prohibition on a member pay adjustment , members of congress would have automatically been limited to a 1.0% ( $1,700 ) salary increase .

the maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2% , or $2,100 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2011 to december 2012 on january 31 , 2013 .

the continuing appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-46 , enacted october 17 , 2013 ) , however , prohibited the scheduled 2014 pay adjustment for members of congress .

each year , the adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied statutorily by congress , or limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the scheduled january 2014 across - the - board increase in the base pay of gs employees under the annual adjustment formula was 1.3% .

a scheduled gs annual pay increase may be altered only if the president issues an alternative plan or if a different increase , or freeze , is enacted .

the president issued an alternate pay plan for civilian federal employees on august 30 , 2013 .

this plan called for a january 2014 across - the - board pay increase of 1.0% for federal civilian employees , the same percentage as proposed in the president's fy2014 budget .

legislation was not enacted to prohibit or alter the gs adjustment , and executive order 13655 , issued on december 23 , 2013 , implemented a 1.0% increase for gs employees .

had the member pay adjustment not been prohibited by law , the gs base pay adjustment would have automatically limited a salary adjustment for members of congress to 1.0% ( $1,700 ) .

the maximum potential 2013 pay adjustment of 1.1% , or $1,900 , was known when the bls released data for the change in the eci during the 12-month period from december 2010 to december 2011 on january 31 , 2012 .

the adjustment takes effect automatically unless ( 1 ) denied statutorily by congress or ( 2 ) limited by the gs base pay adjustment , since the percentage increase in member pay is limited by law to the gs base pay percentage increase .

the president's budget , submitted on february 13 , 2012 , proposed an average ( i.e. , base and locality ) 0.5% adjustment for gs employees .

as stated above , projected member pay adjustments are calculated based on changes in the eci .

the projected 2011 adjustment of 0.9% was known when the bls released data for the eci change during the 12-month period from december 2008 to december 2009 on january 29 , 2010 .

this adjustment would have equaled a $1,600 increase , resulting in a salary of $175,600 .

the 2011 pay adjustment was prohibited by the enactment of h.r .

5146 ( p.l .

111-165 ) on may 14 , 2010 .

h.r .

5146 was introduced in the house on april 27 and was agreed to the same day ( roll no .

226 ) .

it was agreed to in the senate the following day by unanimous consent .

other legislation was also introduced to prevent the scheduled 2011 pay adjustment .

additionally , p.l .

111-322 , which was enacted on december 22 , 2010 , prevents any adjustment in gs base pay before december 31 , 2012 .

since the percentage adjustment in member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in the base pay of gs employees , member pay is also frozen during this period .

if not limited by gs pay , members could have received a salary adjustment of 1.3% in january 2012 under the eci formula .

pay for members of congress remained $174,000 .

under the formula established in the ethics reform act , members were originally scheduled to receive a pay adjustment in january 2010 of 2.1% .

this adjustment was denied by congress through a provision included in the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act .

section 103 of division j of the act states , "notwithstanding any provision of section 601 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 ( 2 u.s.c .

31 ( 2 ) ) , the percentage adjustment scheduled to take effect under any such provision in calendar year 2010 shall not take effect. .

had this provision not been enacted , the 2.1% projected adjustment would have been automatically reduced to 1.5% to match the 2010 gs base pay adjustment .

 table 1 provides a history of the salaries of members of congress since 1789 .

for each salary rate , both the effective date and the statutory authority are provided .

table 2 provides information on pay adjustments for members since 1992 , which was the first full year after the ethics reform act that representatives and senators received the same salary .

the table provides the projected percentage changes under the formula based on the employment cost index and the actual percentage adjustment .

the differences between the projected and actual member pay adjustments resulted from the enactment of legislation preventing the increase ( adjustments for 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 , 2007 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 ) ; limits on the percentage increase of member pay because of the percentage increase in gs base pay ( adjustments for 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1998 , 1999 , 2001 , 2003 , 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 ) ; and a combination of the above .

in some years , the percentage adjustment for member pay would have been lowered to match the percentage adjustment in gs base pay if congress had not passed legislation denying the adjustment ( adjustments for 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1999 , 2007 , 2010 , 2011 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 ) .

if members of congress had received every adjustment prescribed by the eci formula since 1992 , and the 2 u.s.c .

§4501 limitation regarding the percentage base pay increase for gs employees remained unchanged , the 2019 salary would be $210,900 .

table 3 lists the laws which have previously delayed or prohibited member pay adjustments , the dates these laws were enacted , and the text of the provision .

while many of the bills in this list are appropriations bills , a prohibition on member pay adjustments could be included in any bill , or be introduced as a separate bill .

figure 1 , which follows , shows the salary of members of congress in current and constant ( inflation adjusted ) dollars since 1992 .

it shows that member salaries , when adjusted for inflation , decreased 15% from 2009 until 2019 .
