the 2010 review conference for the nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( npt ) will take place in new york from may 3-28 , 2010 .

the npt is considered to be the cornerstone of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime .

many analysts and observers believe the regime is under great stress at this time , and that the 2010 review conference will , therefore , hold major implications for future efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons .

some review conferences , such as those in 1995 and 2000 , have been viewed as successes ; others , like the one on 2005 , have been seen as failures .

a number of factors affect these assessments , but many analysts agree that the treaty may suffer irrevocable harm if the parties do not agree on a range of measures that will strengthen the treaty and address growing concerns about nuclear proliferation .

the obama administration has emphasized in strategy documents that it views the npt as the "centerpiece" of the nonproliferation regime and has pledged to strengthen the treaty .

the administration sees a linkage between arms control and disarmament policies and progress in improving the nuclear nonproliferation measures .

the 2010 nuclear posture review , for example , says that progress on arms control is "a means of strengthening our ability to mobilize broad international support for the measures needed to reinforce the non - proliferation regime and secure materials worldwide. .

the nuclear posture review also says that the conditions for nuclear disarmament will not be possible without stronger proliferation controls .

over the years , npt states without nuclear weapons , particularly from developing countries , have cited lack of progress on disarmament as the reason they do not support further tightening of nonproliferation rules .

the ability of the administration to garner international support for its proposals to strengthen the nonproliferation regime may be tested at the 2010 npt review conference .

this report provides background information and analysis for members of congress and staff who are interested in following the discussions and debate at the review conference .

the report includes a short summary of the provisions and goals of the npt and a brief history of past review conferences .

it also discusses the key issues that the participants are likely to address during the 2010 conference .

npt member states are to "review the operation of the treaty" every five years , as required by article viii of the treaty .

npt states parties have met to review implementation of the treaty every five years since 1970 , so this will be the eighth such meeting .

npt preparatory committee ( prepcom ) meetings are held annually in the three years prior to the review conference .

states have attempted to negotiate a consensus "final declaration" at each review conference .

consensus documents were adopted in 1975 , 1985 , 1995 , and 2000 .

in 1980 , 1990 , and 2005 no document was agreed upon mainly due to disagreements between the non - aligned movement states and nuclear - weapon states over progress on nuclear disarmament ( 1980 , 1990 , 2005 ) , access to peaceful nuclear technology ( 1980 ) or cases of non - compliance and the middle east resolution ( 2005 ) .

however , adoption of a final document is not required , nor is adopting it by consensus .

the treaty does not specify what the review conferences should accomplish , other than the 1995 conference , which was to decide on extension of the treaty .

as part of the compromise package that approved indefinite extension of the npt in 1995 and again in the 2000 final document , states agreed to a strengthened review process .

the 1995 decision created prepcoms where states were to make recommendations to the review conferences and decide on procedural issues .

the review conferences are traditionally structured by issue areas: main committee i discusses nonproliferation , disarmament and negative security assurances ; main committee ii examines nonproliferation and safeguards compliance as well as nuclear - weapon - free zones ; and main committee iii looks at access to the peaceful use of nuclear energy , universality of the treaty ( meaning all countries joining the npt ) and other issues .

the 1995 decision also allowed for subsidiary bodies within each main committee for a focused look at particular issues .

the 2010 npt review conference will be held from may 3 to 28 at the united nations in new york .

ambassador libran cabactulan of the philippines will serve as president of the conference .

the npt does not have its own secretariat , but un staff support the meeting .

the 2009 prepcom agreed to an agenda for the review conference based on the main committee structure of past review conferences .

it also discussed , but did not reach final agreement on , establishing subsidiary bodies on three issues: nuclear disarmament and security assurances ; regional issues , including with respect to the middle east and the implementation of the 1995 resolution on the middle east ; and "other provisions of the treaty," including article x which covers treaty withdrawal .

the key controversies and challenges for u.s. policy makers during the review conference are discussed below in categories similar to the main committee structure of the review conference: disarmament , nonproliferation , and the peaceful use of nuclear energy , with separate sections devoted to non - npt parties and the issue of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the middle east .

it is worth noting that the ability of the united states to obtain some non - nuclear - weapon states' cooperation on some u.s. - supported initiatives could be complicated by the nuclear suppliers group's ( nsg's ) 2008 decision regarding india .

that decision exempted new delhi from the portions of the nsg guidelines requiring new delhi to have full - scope iaea safeguards .

since india obtained this benefit without joining the npt or giving up its nuclear weapons , some countries may question the fairness of additional nonproliferation demands .

many experts see the npt 2010 review conference as a chance to renew obligations under the treaty â€” both the non - nuclear - weapons states' pledge to remain non - nuclear , and nuclear - weapon states' commitment to further disarmament steps .

this could happen with or without a final consensus document , although observers tend to place importance on achieving consensus agreement .

former npt preparatory committee chairman henrik salander described a dilemma concerning the pursuit of consensus: it is difficult to judge whether it is good to have a consensus outcome that governments can just barely accept .

are principled substantive positions better in the long run , even with failed conferences and no agreements , than pragmatic and practical compromises ? .

countries will likely have a higher degree of skepticism of any new promises coming out of the review conference because many pledges made at 1995 and 2000 review conferences remain unfulfilled .

in general , however , the united states is likely to face an npt membership that is largely cynical about u.s. intentions toward the npt and fiercely defensive of its own right to access the full range of peaceful applications of nuclear energy .

despite a common view in washington that progress has been made in improving the political climate in advance of the npt meeting , according to some international observers , optimism after president obama's prague speech last spring has somewhat dissipated in the international diplomatic arena .

after all , the ctbt has not been submitted to the senate while the new start treaty has only just been concluded and is not yet in force .

these are two key indicators of progress on article vi for many npt parties .

more states may take the issue of noncompliance by iran , and possibly syria , more seriously following revelations in fall of 2009 about undisclosed an iranian centrifuge plant as well as iaea reports regarding the lack of cooperation by iran and syria with iaea investigations .

however , because iran and syria both participate in the review conference as member states , a consensus document that deals with these issues may be difficult to reach .

dr. william potter has written about this dilemma: i worry that the mistaken tendency to equate achievement of a consensus final document with a successful review outcome means shunting aside the most serious proliferation challenges , including but not limited to dprk and iranian nuclear brinkmanship , the indian and pakistani nuclear arms race , the threat of non - state actors and nuclear terrorism , and the continuing emphasis given to nuclear weapons in the security postures of the nuclear - weapon states .

if a consensus review document is adopted , it could contain new forward - looking nonproliferation and disarmament proposals .

some analysts recommend that instead of measuring implementation of the treaty , a contentious point , states should pursue agreement on forward - looking objectives .

daryl kimball of the arms control association , for example , has called for an "action plan to strengthen and reaffirm the npt. .

jean du preez wrote that a forward - looking document could "serve as a lodestar to regain confidence in the treaty's core bargains. .

agreement on many u.s. proposals or those contained in un security council resolution 1887 may be difficult to reach .

however , it is also possible that a consensus document would reflect the status of agreement and disagreement on various npt issues .

ambassador susan burk seems to be prepared for just such an outcome: we are looking forward to working with our treaty partners to try to identify areas where agreement on concrete measures to reinforce the global nuclear nonproliferation regime can be reached now , and on areas where further work and deliberation are needed so that agreement might be possible in the future .

other important aspects of the nuclear nonproliferation regime will not likely be discussed in detail at the npt review conference .

they were , however , addressed to some extent at the recent global nuclear security summit .

the npt does not address proliferation of nuclear weapons to non - state actors .

some states have proposed that in the post - 9 / 11 security environment , nuclear security issues should be a part of npt discussions .

uk foreign minister millibrand proposed that nuclear security become the "fourth pillar" of the npt .

also , eu nonproliferation representative annalisa giannella has said that since the npt requires states to prevent proliferation , "one can argue that this obligation also implies the obligation to protect nuclear or radiological material. .

iaea safeguards agreements under the npt do require physical protection measures at declared facilities .

nuclear material security as well as efforts to detect or interdict illicit transfers may be discussed at the review conference , but some developing states prefer to address these issues in other fora such as iaea meetings .

senate resolution 446 , "commemorating the 40 th anniversary of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons," originally introduced by senator casey , was reported out of the foreign relations committee and placed on the senate legislative calendar on april 13 , 2010 .

the resolution reaffirms congressional support for the npt ; urges the president to work toward universality of the treaty ; encourages the president to work with international partners on establishing the additional protocol as "the global standard for safeguards and a requirement for nuclear commerce" ; calls for the iaea to be provided the necessary resources , personnel and technology to conduct npt oversight responsibilities ; and encourages the strengthening of enforcement mechanisms and "collective responses" to any withdrawal from the npt .

appendix b .

resolution on the middle east ( 1995 ) the conference of the parties to the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons , reaffirming the purpose and provisions of the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons , recognizing that , pursuant to article vii of the treaty , the establishment of nuclear - weapon - free zones contributes to strengthening the international non - proliferation regime , recalling that the security council , in its statement of 31 january 1992 , a / affirmed that the proliferation of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction constituted a threat to international peace and security , recalling also general assembly resolutions adopted by consensus supporting the establishment of a nuclear - weapon - free zone in the middle east , the latest of which is resolution 49 / 71 of 15 december 1994 , recalling further the relevant resolutions adopted by the general conference of the international atomic energy agency concerning the application of agency safeguards in the middle east , the latest of which is gc ( xxxviii ) / res / 21 of 23 september 1994 , and noting the danger of nuclear proliferation , especially in areas of tension , bearing in mind security council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and in particular paragraph 14 thereof , noting security council resolution 984 ( 1995 ) and paragraph 8 of the decision on principles and objectives for nuclear non - proliferation and disarmament adopted by the conference on 11 may 1995 , bearing in mind the other decisions adopted by the conference on 11 may 1995 , 1 .

endorses the aims and objectives of the middle east peace process and recognizes that efforts in this regard , as well as other efforts , contribute to , inter alia , a middle east zone free of nuclear weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction ; 2 .

notes with satisfaction that , in its report ( npt / conf.1995 / mc.iii / 1 ) , main committee iii of the conference recommended that the conference "call on those remaining states not parties to the treaty to accede to it , thereby accepting an international legally binding commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices and to accept international atomic energy agency safeguards on all their nuclear activities" ; 3 .

notes with concern the continued existence in the middle east of unsafeguarded nuclear facilities , and reaffirms in this connection the recommendation contained in section vi , paragraph 3 , of the report of main committee iii urging those non - parties to the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons that operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities to accept full - scope international atomic energy agency safeguards ; 4 .

reaffirms the importance of the early realization of universal adherence to the treaty , and calls upon all states of the middle east that have not yet done so , without exception , to accede to the treaty as soon as possible and to place their nuclear facilities under full - scope international atomic energy agency safeguards ; 5 .

calls upon all states in the middle east to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable middle east zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective ; 6 .

calls upon all states party to the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons , and in particular the nuclear - weapon states , to extend their cooperation and to exert their utmost efforts with a view to ensuring the early establishment by regional parties of a middle east zone free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems .

appendix c. "13 practical steps" ( 2000 ) the conference agrees on the following practical steps for the systematic and progressive efforts to implement article vi of the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons and paragraphs 3 and 4 ( c ) of the1995 decision on "principles and objectives for nuclear non - proliferation and disarmament": 1 .
