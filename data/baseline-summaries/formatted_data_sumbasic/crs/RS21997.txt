the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , heightened interest in port and maritime security .

much of this interest has focused on cargo container ships because of concern that terrorists could use containers to transport weapons into the united states , yet only a small fraction of the millions of cargo containers entering the country each year is inspected .

some fear that a container - borne atomic bomb detonated in a u.s. port could wreak economic as well as physical havoc .

robert bonner , former head of customs and border protection ( cbp ) in the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , has argued that such an attack would lead to a halt to container traffic worldwide for some time , bringing the world economy to its knees .

stephen flynn , a retired coast guard commander and an expert on maritime security at the council on foreign relations , holds a similar view .

while container ships accounted for 30.4% of vessel calls to u.s. ports in 2005 , other ships carried crude oil ( 12.9% ) , dry bulk cargo ( 18.7% ) , and vehicles ( 6.0% ) , among other things .

these ships merit attention as well because terrorists will look for the weak link .

the 9 / 11 commission stressed the importance of a balanced approach to maritime security .

to this end , this report focuses on the threat of a terrorist nuclear attack using oil tanker ships .

this threat is of particular interest because the middle east is the chief source of anti - u.s. terrorism .

on january 24 , 2005 , s. 12 , targeting terrorists more effectively act of 2005 , was introduced and was referred to the senate committee on foreign relations .

section 325 provides for a tanker security initiative under which "[t]he secretary of homeland security shall establish a tanker security initiative to promulgate and enforce standards and carry out activities to ensure that tanker vessels that transport oil , natural gas , or other materials are not used by terrorists or as carriers of weapons of mass destruction. .

as part of this initiative , the secretary may develop standards to prevent terrorists from placing weapons of mass destruction on tankers , develop detection equipment and inspection procedures , conduct r&d on sensors to detect a nuclear device on a tanker , and aid foreign countries in carrying out provisions of this initiative .

the legislation would also require the secretary to submit a report to congress on terrorism risks posed by tankers , means of combating this risk , and a proposed budget to carry out this initiative .

this legislation was not reported from committee .

should the 110 th congress undertake further consideration of the potential tanker / nuclear threat , issues that may garner attention include: ( 1 ) how might port security grant programs enhance tanker security ? .

 ( 2 ) could imaging or radiation - detection systems available now , or deployable in the near future , significantly augment tanker security against this threat ? .

 ( 3 ) if so , is it worth the money to deploy them now , or would it be preferable to wait until more advanced systems were available ? .

 ( 4 ) if not , does the current r&d investment strategy consider tanker security , and what detection programs might be developed to do so ? .

these questions might be raised as congress oversees implementation of the safe port act , p.l .
