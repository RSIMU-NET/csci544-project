the extended appropriations process for fy2011 began with the obama administration's fy2011 budget requested in february 2010 and culminated with the enactment of p.l .

112-10 on april 15 , 2011 .

during that time , congressional debate centered around two proposals , h.r .

1 , which was approved by the house on february 19 , 2011 , and s.amdt .

149 , offered as a substitute proposal during senate consideration of h.r .

1 .

although both proposals were rejected by the senate on march 9 , they were viewed by some as the starting point of final negotiations between house and senate leaders that eventually led to the compromise embodied by p.l .

112-10 .

between the start of fy2011 on october 1 , 2010 , and the enactment of p.l .

112-10 on april 15 , 2011 , the federal government was funded through a series of resolutions continuing funding at fy2010 levels , with adjustments and exceptions .

this report is intended to facilitate comparative analysis of the key proposals in the now completed fy2011 appropriations process .

the report begins with a brief analysis of how each proposal could be expected to impact the federal budget deficit , which was a consideration of great importance to many lawmakers .

this is followed by a table depicting discretionary funding levels provided in each of the three proposals by appropriations subcommittee and bill title , and comparing the fy2010 and fy2011 enacted appropriations .

the table reflects the most recent estimates of fy2011 appropriations , which remain subject to change .

this will be the final update of this report .

a key issue in the fy2011 appropriations debate was the impact of discretionary federal spending on the nation's budget deficit .

the budget deficit represents the level of spending , as measured by outlays , in excess of revenues .

appropriations acts , like those detailed in this report , provide budget authority .

the outlays for a fiscal year result from the budget authority provided in that fiscal year as well as some budget authority provided in previous fiscal years .

included in the outlay level are all types of spending ( i.e. , emergency , non - emergency , overseas contingency operations ) occurring during the fiscal year .

under the congressional budget office ( cbo ) march 2011 baseline , the last cbo baseline estimate published prior to the enactment of p.l .

112-10 , the budget deficit for fy2011 was estimated at $1,399 billion .

in that baseline , cbo assumes a full - year continuation of funding in fy2011 at roughly fy2010 levels .

the proposals analyzed in this report provide annualized discretionary outlay levels as follows: fy2011 president's budget ( february 2010 ) — $1,415 billion cbo baseline — $1,361 billion h.r .

1 — $1,356 billion s.amdt .

149 — $1,372 billion p.l .

112-10 — $1,365 billion h.r .

1 , the proposal which proposed the greatest reduction to budget authority relative to current levels , would result in a discretionary outlay level that is $5 billion under the cbo march 2011 baseline level of discretionary outlays .

this reduction in discretionary outlays comprises 0.4% of the deficit estimated under the cbo baseline .

savings from other proposals that would produce smaller reductions in discretionary outlays would correspondingly represent a smaller fraction of the cbo march 2011baseline deficit .

the proposal that was ultimately enacted , p.l .

112-10 , is expected to result in a discretionary outlay level that is $4 billion above the cbo march 2011 baseline level of discretionary outlays .

some reductions in discretionary spending could also affect the level of mandatory or net interest spending or the amount of revenue collected , potentially impacting the ultimate deficit level for fy2011 .

the table below is intended to provide a sense of how funding for federal departments and agencies would be impacted by the different proposals , rather than the impact of each proposal on overall budget numbers .

the data represent discretionary appropriations as provided in the respective proposals , by bill title .

the final column compares the fy2010 and fy2011enacted funding levels .

the title and bill totals do not include scorekeeping adjustments .

rescissions of prior year funding are noted as separate line items and are not deducted from the title totals .
