three postsecondary student financial aid programs authorized under the higher education act of 1965 ( hea ) are collectively referred to as the campus - based programs — the federal supplemental educational opportunity grant ( fseog ) program , the federal work - study ( fws ) program , and the federal perkins loan program .

the campus - based programs are unique among the need - based federal student aid programs in that federal funds are awarded to institutions of higher education ( ihes ) according to formulas that take into account past institutional awards and the aggregate financial need of students attending the institutions .

the mix and amount of aid students receive under the programs are determined by each institution's financial aid administrator according to institution - specific award criteria , rather than according to nondiscretionary award criteria , such as that applicable for pell grants and direct subsidized loans .

the fseog and fws programs were most recently amended and extended under the higher education opportunity act ( heoa ; p.l .

110-315 ) , which reauthorized the programs that are part of the hea .

minor changes were made to these programs .

the heoa also amended and extended the perkins loan program , making several changes to it , including increases to loan limits and an expansion of loan cancellation benefits .

the campus - based programs' authorization of appropriations , along with many other provisions under the hea , expired at the end of fy2014 .

however , section 422 of the general education provisions act ( gepa ) automatically extended the programs' authorizations through fy2015 .

congress provided appropriations for the fseog and fws programs beyond fy2015 under a series of appropriations measures , most recently through march 23 , 2018 , under the continuing appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) .

the perkins loan program was amended and extended through fy2017 under the federal perkins loan program extension act of 2015 ( extension act ; p.l .

114-105 ) .

the authority for institutions to make new perkins loans expired on september 30 , 2017 .

this report begins by providing a brief description of each of the campus - based programs , including the terms under which such financial aid is awarded to students and the procedures under which federal funds are allocated to institutions for that purpose .

it then provides historical information on federal funds appropriated for each of the programs , an analysis of the number and types of students served , and selected program statistics .

this part of the report provides a description of each of the three hea campus - based financial aid programs — the fseog program , the fws program , and the federal perkins loan program .

program descriptions explain the purpose of each program and the terms under which aid is provided to students .

they also include a brief explanation of how federal funds are allocated to institutions for the purpose of providing aid to students .

this section presents budget information on past funding levels for the campus - based programs and program information including the number of institutions participating in each program , the number of students awarded aid , and average award amounts .

appropriation figures for the campus - based programs are presented in table 5 for the past decade .

funding for the fseog program decreased by approximately 10% from fy2007 to fy2013 , before experiencing an increase of 5% in fy2014 .

in recent years , the programs funding has remained level at about $730 million .

in fy2009 , an additional $200 million was provided for the fws under the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l .

111-5 ) .

funding for the fws off - campus community service program , which was established under the heoa , was only provided for fy2010 .

discretionary appropriations were last provided for perkins loan fccs in fy2004 ; and funding was last provided for perkins loan cancellations in fy2009 .

under each of the campus - based programs , federal funds are generally required to be matched by the participating institution ( or the employer under fws , if other than the institution ) .

as previously described , under each of the programs , the institutional match generally is one - third the amount of the federal share ( however , in the fws program , the required match can be as high as one - half of the federal share or as low as zero , depending on the type of employment ) .

because of the matching requirements , the campus - based programs leverage federal funding to provide an amount of student financial aid that is greater than the amount of federal funds appropriated for each program .

institutional participation in ay2015-2016 , there were 7,277 postsecondary institutions that participated in hea title iv financial aid programs .

approximately 52% of title iv institutions awarded fseog aid , 46% employed students in fws , and 20% advanced loans under the perkins loan program .

while fewer institutions of all types participate in the perkins loan program than in either fseog or fws , far fewer two - year and proprietary institutions participate in the perkins loan program than the other two programs .

it is possible that these lower levels of participation are due to factors such as the administrative burden of administering a revolving loan fund and the generally higher cohort default rates of students who attend these types of institutions .

figure 1 displays the number of institutions participating in each of the campus - based programs since ay1995-1996 .

over the past 20 years , institutional participation in fseog and fws has been relatively steady .

institutional participation in the perkins loan program has , in general , continued a pattern of decline that has occurred over the past quarter century ; however , it did experience a 4% increase in ay2013-2014 .

 figure 2 provides data on the number of students served by the fseog , fws , and perkins loan programs from ay1995-1996 to ay2015-2016 .

in terms of the number of students served , fseog is the largest of the three campus - based aid programs .

more than 1.4 million students have received awards annually through fseog since ay2004-2005 .

in ay2015-2016 , approximately 1.53 million students received an fseog award .

fws is the second largest of the three - campus - based aid programs .

on average , approximately 700,000 students are served annually through fws .

in ay2015-2016 , approximately 634,000 students participated in the fws program .

from ay1994-1995 through ay1999-2000 , institutions participating in the fws program were required to expend at least 5% of their initial and supplemental fws allocations to compensate students employed in community service jobs .

beginning with ay2000-2001 , institutions must expend 7% of their fws allotment on community service and operate at least one tutoring or family literacy project .

since the community service requirements have been in place , ed reports that the number of students employed in community service increased from 58,596 in ay1994-1995 to 109,150 in ay2015-2016 .

participation in the perkins loan program has generally declined over time , particularly since ay2006-2007 .

in ay2015-2016 , participation in the perkins loan program dropped to 421,000 , the lowest it had been in the past two decades .

on october 1 , 2015 , the program's operations were significantly curtailed , as institution's authorizations to make new perkins loans had expired on september 31 , 2015 .

several months later , congress passed the perkins loan program extension act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-105 ) , which authorized institutions to make new perkins loans to eligible borrowers through september 30 , 2017 .

while the act extended institutional authority to make loans , it further restricted which students would be eligible for perkins loan awards .

the data presented on perkins loan program participation in ay2015-2016 includes the period during which operation of the program was significantly curtailed .

 figure 3 provides the average award amount for campus - based programs from ay1995-1996 to ay2015-2016 .

to facilitate comparison of student award amounts over time , these data have been adjusted to 2015 dollars according to the consumer price index for all urban consumers ( cpi - u ) .

the average amount of aid provided per student under the fseog program is the lowest among the three campus - based programs .

the average fseog award amount was $649 in ay2015-2016 .

in constant dollars , average award amounts have declined by approximately 40% since ay2001-2002 .

in ay2015-2016 , the average fws amount was $1,726 .

over the past two decades , the average fws award amount has remained more or less level in constant dollars .

the ay2015-2016 average perkins loan amount was $2,479 .

average perkins loan amounts , measured in constant dollars , have fluctuated over the past two decades .

by ay2003-2004 , average perkins loan amounts reached a maximum ( in constant dollars ) of $2,790 .

however , by ay2010-2011 , average perkins loan amounts had decreased to a low of $2,046 .
