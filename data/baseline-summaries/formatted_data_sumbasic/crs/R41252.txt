v .

in miranda v. arizona , the supreme court held that no statement made by an individual during a custodial interrogation may be admitted into evidence against him at his criminal trial , unless he was first warned of his relevant constitutional rights and waived them .

in new york v. quarles , the court later held that the miranda rule was subject to a "public safety" exception .

throughout this period , federal law stated that following arrest a suspect should be presented to a magistrate and advised of his rights without "unnecessary delay. .

confessions made during the course of any unnecessary delay are generally inadmissible at the suspect's subsequent criminal trial .

the realities of contemporary terrorism are such that some have questioned whether these general rules can be , and should be , reexamined and adjusted .

the following miranda - related legislative proposals were offered in the 111 th congress .

comparable provisions do not appear to have been introduced since .

2454 ( 2009 ) , prohibited members of the armed forces as well as defense department officers and employees from providing miranda warnings to foreign nationals captured , or held in defense department custody , outside the united states as enemy belligerents .

the prohibition does not apply to the justice department .

the section also directed the secretary of defense to report to the armed services committees within 90 days on the impact of providing the warnings to detainees in afghanistan .

section 504 of the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( h.r .

2701 ) , as reported out of the house select committee on intelligence ( h.rept .
