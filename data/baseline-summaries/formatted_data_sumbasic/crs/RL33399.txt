interior , environment , and related agencies are being funded by p.l .

110-5 , the revised continuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 .

the law continues funds at the fy2006 account level , unless otherwise specified .

the law , enacted on february 15 , 2007 , required that agencies and departments submit an allocation of funds below the account level within 30 days of enactment .

the submissions are to be sent to the house and senate appropriations committees .

the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments , as well as numerous related agencies and bureaus .

it provides funding for department of the interior ( doi ) agencies ( except for the bureau of reclamation , funded in energy and water development appropriations laws ) , many of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs .

the bill also provides funds for agencies in two other departments: the forest service in the department of agriculture , and the indian health service in the department of health and human services , as well as funds for the environmental protection agency .

further , the annual bill includes funding for arts and cultural agencies , such as the smithsonian institution , national gallery of art , national endowment for the arts , and national endowment for the humanities , and for numerous other entities and agencies .

in recent years , the appropriations laws for interior and related agencies provided funds for several activities within the department of energy ( doe ) , including research , development , and conservation programs ; the naval petroleum reserves ; and the strategic petroleum reserve .

however , at the outset of the 109 th congress , these doe programs were transferred to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water , to consolidate jurisdiction over doe .

at the same time , jurisdiction over the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , and several smaller entities , was moved to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees covering interior and related agencies .

this change resulted from the abolition of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs , housing and urban development , and independent agencies , which previously had jurisdiction over epa .

the fy2006 interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations law contained three primary titles providing funding .

the regular , annual fy2007 legislation ( h.r .

5386 ) followed a similar organization , and this report is organized along these lines .

accordingly , the first section ( title i ) provides information on interior agencies ; the second section ( title ii ) discusses epa ; and the third section ( title iii ) addresses other agencies , programs , and entities .

a fourth section of this report discusses cross - cutting topics that encompass more than one agency .

the report does not contain fy2007 enacted levels for agencies , programs , and activities because these funding levels are being determined by the agencies , as provided under p.l .

110-5 .

in general , in this report the term appropriations represents total funds available , including regular annual and supplemental appropriations , as well as rescissions , transfers , and deferrals , but excludes permanent budget authorities .

increases and decreases generally are calculated on comparisons between fy2007 funding levels for the most recent action on h.r .

5386 , and those requested by the president for fy2007 and appropriated for fy2006 .

the house committee on appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report .

other sources of information include the senate committee on appropriations , agency budget justifications , and the congressional record .

in the tables throughout this report , some columns of funding figures do not add to the precise totals provided due to rounding .

epa was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities that had been divided among several federal agencies .

epa's responsibilities have grown as congress has enacted an increasing number of environmental laws , as well as major amendments to these statutes .

among the agency's primary responsibilities are the regulation of air quality , water quality , pesticides , and toxic substances ; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes ; and the cleanup of environmental contamination .

epa also awards grants to assist state and local governments in controlling pollution .

epa's funding over time generally reflects an increase in overall appropriations to fulfill a rising number of statutory responsibilities .

without adjusting for inflation , the agency's appropriation has risen from $1.0 billion when the agency was established in fy1970 to a high of $8.4 billion in fy2004 .

for fy2007 , the house has proposed $7.58 billion for epa , and the senate appropriations committee has recommended $7.53 billion .

the president had requested $7.32 billion .

all of these amounts are less than the fy2006 appropriation of $7.64 billion , including rescissions and supplementals .

congress made an additional $80.0 million available to epa in fy2006 by rescinding and redirecting previously appropriated agency funds that had not been obligated for certain activities .

consequently , the proposed fy2007 funding levels for epa reflect larger decreases when compared to the overall fy2006 funding of $7.72 billion , which included new appropriations of $7.64 billion and $80.0 million in rescinded prior year funds redirected to fy2006 .

in floor debate , the house agreed to two amendments that increased epa's funding by $3.8 million above the amount that the house appropriations committee had recommended .

one amendment included $1.8 million for energy star programs aimed at improving energy efficiency .

in its report on h.r .

5386 , the senate appropriations committee recommended a slight increase above the house amount for this program .

the second house floor amendment increased funding for epa's diesel emission reduction grant program by $2.0 million to a total of $28.0 million .

the senate appropriations committee recommended $20.1 million for this grant program .

the president had requested $49.5 million .

the house also passed other floor amendments that would affect epa's implementation of certain activities .

for example , one amendment would prohibit funds from being spent on implementing controversial guidance on determining federal jurisdiction over wetlands .

the senate appropriations committee did not recommend a similar prohibition .

a few other house floor amendments relevant to epa were not agreed to .

for example , one amendment would have provided $800 million in additional funds for activities of several agencies , of which $250 million would have been for epa grants to states for clean water state revolving funds ( srfs ) .

these grants assist states in issuing loans to communities for wastewater infrastructure improvements , discussed in the " water infrastructure " section , below .

traditionally , epa's annual appropriation has been requested and enacted according to various line - item appropriations accounts , of which there currently are eight .

table 16 indicates amounts by appropriations account for fy2006 enacted , fy2007 requested , fy2007 house - passed , and fy2007 senate appropriations committee - reported .
