u.s. - iran relations have been mostly adversarial since the 1979 islamic revolution in iran .

u.s. officials and official reports consistently identify iran's support for militant armed factions in the middle east region a significant threat to u.s. interests and allies .

attempting to constrain iran's nuclear program took precedence in u.s. policy after 2002 as that program advanced .

the united states also has sought to thwart iran's purchase of new conventional weaponry and development of ballistic missiles .

in may 2018 , the trump administration withdrew the united states from the 2015 nuclear agreement ( joint comprehensive plan of action , jcpoa ) , asserting that the accord did not address the broad range of u.s. concerns about iranian behavior and would not permanently preclude iran from developing a nuclear weapon .

senior administration officials explain administration policy as the application of "maximum pressure" on iran's economy to ( 1 ) compel it to renegotiate the jcpoa to address the broad range of u.s. concerns and ( 2 ) deny iran the revenue to continue to develop its strategic capabilities or intervene throughout the region .

administration officials deny that the policy is intended to stoke economic unrest in iran .

as the administration has pursued its policy of maximum pressure , including imposing sanctions beyond those in force before jcpoa went into effect in january 2016 , bilateral tensions have escalated significantly .

key developments that initially heightened tensions include the following .

on april 8 , 2019 , the administration designated the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) as a foreign terrorist organization ( fto ) , representing the first time that an official military force was designated as an fto .

the designation stated that "the irgc continues to provide financial and other material support , training , technology transfer , advanced conventional weapons , guidance , or direction to a broad range of terrorist organizations , including hezbollah , palestinian terrorist groups like hamas and palestinian islamic jihad , kata'ib hezbollah in iraq , al - ashtar brigades in bahrain , and other terrorist groups in syria and around the gulf.... iran continues to allow al qaeda ( aq ) operatives to reside in iran , where they have been able to move money and fighters to south asia and syria. .

as of may 2 , 2019 , the administration ended a u.s. sanctions exception for any country to purchase iranian oil , aiming to drive iran's oil exports to "zero. .

since may 2019 , the administration has ended five out of the seven waivers under the iran freedom and counter - proliferation act ( ifca , p.l .

112-239 ) âwaivers that allow countries to help iran remain within limits set by the jcpoa .

on may 5 , 2019 , citing reports that iran or its allies might be preparing to attack u.s. personnel or installations , then - national security adviser john bolton announced that the united states was accelerating the previously planned deployment of the uss abraham lincoln carrier strike group and sending a bomber task force to the persian gulf region .

on may 24 , 2019 , the trump administration notified congress of immediate foreign military sales and proposed export licenses for direct commercial sales of defense articlesâ training , equipment , and weapons â with a possible value of more than $8 billion , including sales of precision guided munitions ( pgms ) to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates ( uae ) .

in making the 22 emergency sale notifications , secretary of state pompeo invoked emergency authority codified in the arms export control act ( aeca ) , and cited the need "to deter further iranian adventurism in the gulf and throughout the middle east. .

on january 3 , 2020 , iraq time , a u.s. military armed drone strike killed irgc - qf commander major general qasem soleimani in what the defense department termed a "defensive action. .

the statement cited soleimani's responsibility for "the deaths of hundreds of americans and coalition service members" and his approval of the embassy blockade , and stated that he was "actively developing plans to attack american diplomats and service members in iraq and throughout the region. .

the strike , conducted while soleimani was leaving baghdad international airport , also killed kh leader abu mahdi al - muhandis , who also headed the broader popular mobilization forces ( pmf ) made up mostly of militia fighters , and other iranian and iraqi figures .

iraq's council of representatives ( cor ) on january 5 , 2020 , voted to direct the government "to work towards ending the presence of all foreign troops on iraqi soil," according to the media office of the iraqi parliament .

soleimani was widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in iran , with a direct channel to khamene'i , who serves as commander - in - chief of all iranian armed forces .

one expert described him as "the military center of gravity of iran's regional hegemonic efforts" and "an operational and organization genius who likely has no peer in the upper ranks of the islamic revolutionary guard corps. .

others contend that "he was only the agent of a government policy that preceded him and will continue without him. .

for the stated purpose of trying to deter further iranian attacks and protecting u.s. forces already in the region , the united states added forces and military capabilities in the region .

as of early 2020 , approximately 14,000 u.s. military personnel had been added to a baseline of more than 60,000 u.s. forces in and around the persian gulf , which include those stationed at military facilities in the arab states of the gulf cooperation council ( gcc: saudi arabia , kuwait , uae , qatar , oman , and bahrain ) , and those in iraq and afghanistan .

defense department officials indicated that the additional deployments mostly restored forces who were redeployed from the region a few years ago , and did not represent preparation for any u.s. offensive against iran .

among the additional deployments , the united states sent additional patriot and terminal high altitude area defense ( thaad ) missile defense systems in the region .

some of the additional forces sent deployed to prince sultan air base in saudi arabia , which is south of riyadh .

u.s. forces used the base to enforce a no - fly zone over southern iraq during the 1990s , but left there after saddam hussein was ousted by operation iraqi freedom in 2003 .

as 2020 progressed , some u.s. deployments changed .

in march 2020 , hundreds of u.s forces in iraq were redeployed from smaller bases in iraq to larger ones , and some were withdrawn to locations elsewhere in the region .

the redeployments reportedly were due to a waning threat in iraq from the islamic state organization as well as the apparent need to better defend u.s. forces from attacks by iran - backed militias .

in early may 2019 , it was reported that the united states had withdrawn some patriot air defenses and combat aircraft from saudi arabia and other locations in the gulf , although u.s. officials denied that the deployments signaled an altered assessment of the iran threat or would degrade u.s. capabilities to deter iran .

the military is a tool of national power that the united states can use to advance its objectives , and the design of a military campaign and effective military options depend on the policy goals that u.s. leaders seek to accomplish .

the trump administration has stated that its "core objective ... is the systemic change in the islamic republic's hostile and destabilizing actions , including blocking all paths to a nuclear weapon and exporting terrorism. .

as such , the military could be used in a variety of ways to try to contain and dissuade iran from prosecuting its "hostile and destabilizing actions. .

these ways range from further increasing presence and posture in the region to use of force to change iran's regime .

as with any use of the military instrument of national power , any employment of u.s. forces in this scenario could result in further escalation of a crisis .

u.s. military action may not be the appropriate tool to achieve systemic change within the iranian regime , and may potentially set back the political prospects of iranians sympathetic to a change of regime .

some observers question the utility of military power against iran due to global strategic considerations .

the 2017 national security strategy and 2018 national defense strategy both noted that china and russia represent the key current and future strategic challenges to the united states .

as such , shifting additional military assets into the united states central command ( centcom ) area of responsibility requires diverting them from use in other theaters such as europe and the pacific , thereby sacrificing other long - term u.s. strategic priorities .

secretary of defense mark esper and other u.s. officials have stated that the additional u.s. deployments since may 2019 are intended to deter iran from taking any further provocative actions and position the united states to defend u.s. forces and interests in the region .

iranian attacks after previous u.s. deployments could suggest that deploying additional assets and capabilities might not necessarily succeed in deterring iran from using military force .

on the other hand , there are risks to military inaction that might potentially outweigh those associated with the employment of force .

for example , should iran acquire a nuclear weapons capability , u.s. options to contain and dissuade it from prosecuting hostile activities could be significantly more constrained than they are at present .

for illustrative purposes only , below are some potential additional policy options related to the possible use of military capabilities against iran .

not all of these options are mutually exclusive , nor do they represent a complete list of possible options , implications , and risks .

congress has assessed its role in any decisions regarding whether to undertake military action against iran , as discussed later in this report .

the following discussion is based entirely on open - source materials .

operations against iranian a llies or proxies .

the administration might decide to take additional action against iran's allies or proxies , such as iran - backed militias in iraq , lebanese hezbollah , or the houthi movement in yemen .

such action could take the form of air operations , ground operations , special operations , or cyber and electronic warfare .

further attacks on iranian allies could be intended to seriously degrade the military ability of the iranian ally in question and undertaken by u.s. forces , partner government forces , or both .

at the same time , military action against iran's allies could harm the prospects for resolution of the regional conflicts in which iranian allies operate .

retaliatory action against iranian key targets and facilities .

the united states retains the option to undertake air and missile strikes , as well as special operations and cyber and electronic warfare against iranian targets , such as irgc navy vessels in the gulf , nuclear facilities , military bases , ports , oil installations , and any number of other targets within iran itself .

iran's major gulf ports are shown in figure 2 .

blockade .

another option could be to establish a naval and / or air quarantine of iran .

iran has periodically , including since mid - 2019 , threatened to block the vital strait of hormuz .

some observers have in past confrontations raised the prospect of a u.s. closure of the strait or other waterways to iranian commerce .

under international law , blockades are acts of war .

invasion .

although apparently far from current consideration because of the potential risks and costs , a u.s. invasion of iran to oust its regime is among the options .

press reports in may 2019 indicated that the administration was considering adding more than 100,000 military forces to the gulf to deter iran from any attacks .

such an option , if exercised , might be interpreted as potentially enhancing the u.s. ability to conduct ground attacks inside iran , although military experts have indicated that a u.s. invasion and / or occupation of iran would require many more u.s. forces than those cited .

iran's population is about 80 million , and its armed forces collectively number about 525,000 , including 350,000 regular military and 125,000 irgc forces .

there has been significant antigovernment unrest in iran over the past 10 years , but there is no indication that there is substantial support inside iran for a u.s. invasion to change iran's regime .

members of congress have responded in different ways to tensions with iran and to related questions of authorization for the use of military force .

various instances of increased u.s. - iran tensions in the past year have prompted some members to express concern about or support for potential military operations against iran .

these episodes include the june 2019 attacks against tankers in the gulf of oman and iran's shoot down of a u.s. military drone ; the september 2019 attacks on saudi oil facilities at abqaiq and khurais ; and the buildup of u.s. forces in the region in response to iranian activities .

throughout this period , congress passed legislation with provisions specifying that authorization for the use of force against iran is not granted .

for instance , section 1284 of the fy2020 ndaa ( p.l .

116-92 , december 2019 ) states that "nothing in this act , or any amendment made by this act , may be construed to authorize the use of military force , including the use of military force against iran or any other country. .

similarly , section 9024 of division a of h.r .

1158 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2020 , ( p.l .

116-89 , december 2019 ) states that "nothing in this act may be construed as authorizing the use of force against iran. .

however , congress has not prohibited the use of funds for operations against iran , despite the introduction of several standalone measures that would do so , such as the prevention of unconstitutional war with iran act of 2019 ( h.r .

2354 / s. 1039 ) .while the house did pass legislation that included a prohibition on funding for the use of force against iran , including section 1229 of h.r .

2500 , the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fy2020 , the senate rejected by a 50-40 vote an amendment ( s.amdt .

883 ) that would have added similar text to its version of the fy2020 ndaa , and the house - passed language was not included in conference text of the bill .

in response to these moves , president trump stated that he had wide - ranging authority to unilaterally initiate the use of military force , as successive administrations have maintained .

for instance , in a june 24 interview , president trump reiterated that he believed he had the authority to order military action against iran without congressional approval , adding , "i do like keeping them [congress] abreast , but i don't have to do it , legally. .

secretary pompeo suggested in an april 2019 hearing that the 2001 authorization for use of military force ( aumf , p.l .

107-40 ) against those responsible for the september 11 terrorist attacks could potentially apply to iran based on the country's ties with al qaeda .

however , in a june 28 , 2019 , letter to house foreign affairs committee chairman eliot engel , assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs mary elizabeth taylor stated that "the administration has not , to date , interpreted either [the 2001 or 2002] aumf as authorizing military force against iran , except as may be necessary to defend u.s. or partner forces engaged in counterterrorism operations or operations to establish a stable , democratic iraq. .

the killing of irgc - qf commander soleimani in a u.s. drone strike in baghdad in january 2020 dramatically increased congressional attention to u.s. - iran tensions and specifically to the authority under which soleimani was killed and whether that authority might be used to justify further military action .

immediately after the strike , house speaker nancy pelosi said in a statement that the administration launched the strike that killed soleimani "without an authorization for use of military force ( aumf ) against iran" and "without the consultation of the congress," and called for congress to be "immediately briefed on this serious situation. .

two days later , on january 4 , 2020 , president trump submitted a notification to the speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate of the soleimani drone strike , as pursuant to the war powers resolution ( p.l .

93-148 ) , including the constitutional and legislative authority for the action .

however , according to a media report , the notification "only contained classified information , according to a senior congressional aide , likely detailing the intelligence that led to the action. .

speaker nancy pelosi criticized the decision to classify the notification in its entirety as "highly unusual. .

in statements after the strike , national security adviser robert o'brien asserted that the authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002 ( "2002 aumf" ; p.l .

107-243 ) provided the president authority to direct the strike against general soleimani in iraq .

the house voted to repeal the 2002 aumf on january 30 , 2020 , when it passed the no war against iran act ( h.r .

550 ) ; no action has been taken by the senate .

in response to the strike , numerous pieces of legislation were introduced both commending and condemning the administration for the action ( for more , see crs report r46148 , u.s .

killing of qasem soleimani: frequently asked questions ) .

perhaps most significant were two resolutions that would direct the president to terminate the involvement of u.s. forces in conflict with iran .

h.con.res .

83 , introduced by representative elissa slotkin on january 8 , 2020 , pursuant to section 5 ( c ) of the war powers resolution .

the resolution would direct the president "to terminate the use of united states armed forces to engage in hostilities in or against iran or any part of its government or military," unless congress specifically authorizes such use of the armed forces , or if such force is necessary and appropriate to defend the united states or its armed forces against "imminent attack. .

the house voted to adopt h.con.res .

83 by a 224-194 vote on january 9 , 2020 ; no action has been taken by the senate .

questions have been raised about the constitutionality and effect of section 5 ( c ) concurrent resolutions .

s.j.res .

68 , introduced by senator tim kaine on january 9 , 2020 , pursuant to section 1013 of the department of state authorization act , fiscal years 1984 and 1985 ( 50 u.s.c .

â§ 1546a ) .

the resolution would have directed the president to "terminate the use of u.s. armed forces for hostilities" with iran ( changed from an earlier version that would have required "removal" of u.s. armed forces , perhaps a reflection of concern that the original language might precipitate changes in current deployments ) .

the senate voted to adopt the resolution by a 55-45 vote on february 13 , and the house passed it by a 227-186 vote on march 11 .

president trump vetoed the resolution on may 6 , 2020 , describing it as an "insulting" election ploy by congressional democrats .

the statement also stated that the resolution's implication that "the president's constitutional authority to use military force is limited to defense of the united states and its forces against imminent attack" was "incorrect. .

the senate failed to override the veto by a vote of 49-44 on may 7 , 2020 .

given ongoing tensions with iran , members are likely to continue to assess and perhaps try to shape the congressional role in any decisions regarding whether to commit u.s. forces to potential hostilities .

in assessing its authorities in this context , congress might consider , among other things , the following: does the president require prior authorization from congress before initiating hostilities with iran ? .

if so , what actions , under what circumstances , ought to be covered by such an authorization ? .

if not , what existing authorities provide for the president to initiate hostilities ? .

if the executive branch were to initiate and then sustain hostilities against iran without congressional authorization , what are the implications for the preservation of congress's role , relative to that of the executive branch , in the war powers function ? .

how , in turn , might the disposition of the war powers issue in connection with the situation with iran affect the broader question of congress's status as an equal branch of government , including the preservation and use of other congressional powers and prerogatives ? .

the iranian government may continue to take aggressive action short of directly threatening the united states and its territories while it continues policies opposed by the united states .

what might be the international legal ramifications for undertaking a retaliatory , preventive , or preemptive strikes against iran in response to such actions without a u.n. security council mandate ? .

conflict with , or increased military activity in or around , iran could generate significant costs , financial and otherwise .

with that in mind , congress could consider the following: the potential costs of heightened u.s. operations in the centcom area of operations , particularly if they lead to full - scale war and significant postconflict operations .

the need for the united states to reconstitute its forces and capabilities , particularly in the aftermath of a major conflict .

the impact of the costs of war and post conflict reconstruction on u.s. deficits and government spending .

the costs of persistent military confrontation and / or a conflict in the gulf region to the global economy .

the extent to which regional allies , and the international community more broadly , might contribute forces or resources to a military campaign or its aftermath .
