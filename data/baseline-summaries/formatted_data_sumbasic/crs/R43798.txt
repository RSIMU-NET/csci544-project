on november 20 , 2014 , president obama delivered a televised address wherein he broadly described the steps that his administration is taking to "fix" what he has repeatedly described as a "broken immigration system. .

following the president's address , executive agencies made available intra - agency memoranda and fact sheets detailing specific actions that have already been taken , or will be taken in the future .

these actions generally involve either border security , the current unlawfully present population , or future legal immigration .

the announced executive actionsâparticularly the granting of deferred action and employment authorization to some unlawfully present aliens , discussed below ( see " unlawfully present population " ) âhave revived debate about the executive's discretionary authority over immigration like that which followed the administration's june 2012 announcement of the deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) initiative .

daca has permitted some unlawfully present aliens who were brought to the united states as children and raised here to obtain temporary relief from removal and , in many cases , employment authorization .

some have argued that daca constitutes an abdication of the executive's duty to enforce the laws and runs afoul of specific requirements found in the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , among other things .

others , however , have maintained that the daca initiative is a lawful exercise of the discretionary authority conferred on the executive by the constitution and federal statute .

similar arguments will likely be made as to the november 2014 actions , which affect a significantly larger number of aliens than daca .

this report provides the answers to key legal questions related to the various immigration - related actions announced by the obama administration on november 20 , 2014 .

because the various documents outlining these actions have been available for a limited period of time , and additional information is expected to be released in the future , these answers are necessarily preliminary .

it is anticipated that the report will be updated to reflect further developments .

following the president's televised speech , executive branch agencies and , in two cases , the white house announced dozens of specific actions as to immigration .

these actions can be broadly divided into the same three categories noted by the president in his speech: ( 1 ) border security , ( 2 ) the current unlawfully present population , and ( 3 ) future legal immigration .

as of november 24 , 2014 , the president has not issued an executive order regarding these immigration - related actions ; nor has he given any indication that he will issue such an order .

with the exception of several specific actions announced in two presidential memoranda , all other actions to dateâincluding the granting of deferred action to some unlawfully present aliensâhave been announced in intra - agency memoranda or fact sheets made available by executive agencies after the president's televised address .

this is arguably consistent with prior actions in the field of immigration and , particularly , prior exercises of discretion in enforcing federal immigration law .

for example , the 1990 "family fairness" program , discussed belowâwhich gave certain unlawfully present aliens temporary relief from deportation ( later known as removal ) âwas announced in a memorandum from the head of the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) to regional officials .

similarly , president clinton relied on a memorandum to the attorney general when authorizing deferred enforced departure ( ded ) âanother type of temporary relief from removalâfor some unlawfully present aliens from liberia .

the fact that these actions were announced by means other than an executive order generally would not affect their permissibility .

in other words , whether the deferred action initiatives , for example , are permissible depends upon whether the executive has the legal authority to grant this relief , not whether the initiatives were announced by means of an executive order or a memorandum from the secretary of homeland security .

although each specific administration action involves somewhat different legal authorities , three broad types of legal authority can be said to underlie all these actions: ( 1 ) prosecutorial or enforcement discretion ; ( 2 ) express delegations of authority to the executive by congress ; and ( 3 ) the executive's discretion in interpreting and applying immigration law when congressional enactments are "silent or ambiguous" on specific issues .

the constitution confers upon the president the responsibility and obligation to "take care that the law is faithfully executed. .

some of the obama administration's immigration actionsâincluding the identification of particular categories of aliens as priorities for removal , and the expanded use of deferred action to afford certain unlawfully present aliens with temporary relief from removalâare primarily premised upon executive assertions of independent constitutional authority .

as previously noted , the executive branch is understood to have substantial discretionary authority to determine when and whether to pursue sanctions against apparent violators of federal law , an authority generally referred to as prosecutorial or enforcement discretion .

prosecutorial discretion is most closely associated with executive enforcement of federal criminal law .

but the concept of prosecutorial or enforcement discretion is often applicable in civil contexts as well , including with respect to immigration officers' decisions regarding whether to seek the removal of aliens who have entered or remained in the united states in violation of federal immigration law .

a decision not to pursue sanctions against a particular individual is generally understood to be largely shielded from judicial review .

nonetheless , there are recognized limitations to the scope of this discretionary authority .

as an initial matter , a general enforcement policy that is promulgated by an agency may not enjoy the same degree of immunity from judicial review as individual determinations not to pursue sanctions in a particular case .

moreover , courts have recognized that agency action must be consistent with congressional objectives underlying the statutory scheme it administers .

when adopting a general enforcement policy , an agency may not rely on factors "which congress has not intended it to consider" and substitute its own policy judgment for that which has been made by congress .

in particular , a general policy of non - enforcement by an agency could potentially be reviewable by a court and found to be an impermissible "abdication" of the agency's statutory responsibilities .

whether the obama administration's november deferred action initiatives constitute a permissible exercise of enforcement discretion will be the subject of heated debate .

this debate will likely center upon the administration's identification of large numbers of unlawfully present aliens as non - priorities for removal , as well as the expansion of its earlier deferred action initiative to additional aliens .

on one hand , it could be argued that aspects of these initiatives functionally constitute a blanket policy of non - enforcement of federal immigration statutes , and that this non - enforcement policy represents an abdication of dhs's statutory responsibilities to enforce federal immigration law .

the ina contains several grounds of removal which are potentially applicable to aliens who may receive deferred action under the administration's initiative .

moreover , while federal statute grants immigration authorities the power to provide some unlawfully present aliens with relief from removal , these statute - based forms of relief are limited in scope .

it could be argued that the administration's decision to focus enforcement resources almost exclusively on certain categories of removable aliens , while declining to pursue the removal of a substantial portion of the unauthorized population which does not fall within those categories , constitutes an abdication of its responsibilities under the ina .

it might also be argued that , by enabling a sizeable portion of the unlawfully present population to request deferred action ( a form of relief that is not expressly authorized by federal statute , except in narrow circumstances ) and work authorization , the executive branch is impermissibly substituting its own judgment as to whom should be legally allowed to remain in the united states for that of congress .

on the other hand , it could be argued that resource constraints preclude dhs from pursuing the removal of all unlawfully present aliens in the united states , and that the decision to focus resources primarily upon the removal of those who have engaged in criminal activity , pose a threat to public safety , or recently entered the united states is consistent with applicable statutory enactments .

additionally , while the administration's initiative would grant some unlawfully present aliens legal permission to remain in the united states for a specified period , it would not provide them with legal immigration status , or enable them to acquire benefits they are statutorily barred from receiving .

the executive might further dispute arguments that the initiative constitutes a blanket policy of non - enforcement , and note that immigration officers retain ultimate discretion to grant deferred action on a case - by case basis , and that they are not barred from seeking the removal of unlawfully present aliens who have not been identified by dhs as enforcement priorities .

it might also be argued that , particularly in light of the long - standing executive practice of granting deferred action and other forms of relief from removal , that congress has implicitly signaled its approval or acquiescence to the executive's use of these forms of administrative relief , and the ina should not be interpreted to preclude the executive from granting such relief in certain instances .

accordingly , it could be argued that the executive branch's action , while affecting a substantial number of unlawfully present aliens , does not constitute a legally impermissible abdication of its statutory duties .

in some cases , specific actions taken by the obama administration could potentially be seen to run afoul of the provisions of the ina , in which case the executive action could be found to be impermissible ( provided a plaintiff with standing to challenge the executive action were found ( see " who has standing to challenge the administration's initiatives ? .

" ) ) .

for example , one federal district court recently found that daca is contrary to three purportedly "interlocking provisions" in ina â§235 which some assert require that unlawfully present aliens be placed in removal proceedings .

these provisions state that 1. any alien present in the united states who has not been admitted shall be deemed an applicant for admission ; 2. applicants for admission shall be inspected by immigration officers ; and 3. in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission , if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted , the alien shall be detained for removal proceedings .

thus , the district court concluded that daca runs afoul of the ina because many of the aliens granted deferred action through daca had never been placed in removal proceedings as required , in the court's view , by ina â§235 .

 ( this same court , however , later ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the case .

that decision has been appealed , and it is presently unclear whether and how the court's earlier decision construing ina â§235 could be seen to restrain any future grants of deferred action. ) .

similar statutory constraints could potentially be also be implicated in other obama administration actions , particularly as executive agencies take action to clarify the meaning and application of certain statutory language .

for example , ina â§212 ( a ) ( 9 ) ( b ) ( v ) would appear to preclude dhsâin issuing guidance regarding waivers of the 3- and 10-year bars upon the admission of aliens who have been unlawfully present in the united states for more than 180 daysâfrom granting waivers based on mere "hardship," as opposed to "extreme hardship," or from considering hardship to u.s. citizen or lpr children , as opposed to u.s. citizen or lpr spouses or parents .

this is because ina â§212 ( a ) ( 9 ) ( b ) ( v ) expressly refers to waivers in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse or son or daughter of a united states citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence , if it is established ... that the refusal of admission to such [an] alien would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such alien .

a grant of deferred action does not constitute "legalization," as that term is generally understood .

in the immigration context , the term legalization is widely used to describe a process whereby persons who are unlawfully present are able to acquire legal status , typically as lprs .

lprs may generally acquire u.s. citizenship after a period of time if certain conditions are met .

aliens granted deferred action are generally seen as "lawfully present" for purposes of federal law .

this means that they do not acquire additional unlawful presence for application of the 3- and 10-year bars on the admissibility of aliens who have been unlawfully present in the united states for more than 180 days .

aliens granted deferred action may also be eligible for certain thingsâlike the issuance of driver's licensesâthat are made available , pursuant to federal , state , or local law , to persons who are "lawfully present" ( or "legally residing" ) in the united states .

 ( see " will aliens granted deferred action be eligible for public benefits ? .

" ) .

however , lawful presence is not the same as lawful status , and aliens granted deferred action lack lawful status .

as such , a grant of deferred action , in itself , will not result in an alien obtaining lpr status , a "green card," or citizenship , or the ability to sponsor family members for immigration benefits .

aliens granted deferred action could potentially have their status legalized by congress in the future , though , as happened with earlier "groups" of aliens granted temporary relief from removal .

as a general matter , aliens granted deferred action are not eligible for federal , state , or local public benefits because of the provisions of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) of 1996 , as amended .

prwora established a definition of qualified alien that does not include aliens granted deferred action , and generally barred aliens who are not qualified aliens from receiving federal , state , and local public benefits .

nonetheless , aliens granted deferred action could potentially be eligible for certain benefitsâor things sometimes perceived as benefitsâbecause aliens granted deferred action are seen as "lawfully present" ( or "legally residing" ) in the united states .

this is , in part , because one congress cannot bind future congresses .

thus , despite prwora's restrictions upon the receipt of public benefits by aliens who are not included within its definition of "qualified aliens," subsequent congresses have enacted legislation that provides for aliens' receipt of public benefits that is inconsistent withâand does not use the language ofâprwora .

for example , section 214 of the children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 ( chipra ) gives states the option to provide medicaid and children's health insurance program ( chip ) coverage to otherwise eligible children and pregnant women "who are lawfully residing in the united states," a phrase which has been taken to include aliens granted deferred action .

the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) of 2010 similarly permits persons who are "lawfully present" to participate in certain health care programs established under the act .

however , while lawfully present for purposes of aca has generally been construed in the same way as lawfully residing for purposes of chipra , those granted deferred action through daca have been deemed ineligible for certain benefits under aca .

 ( as of the date of this report , the administration does not appear to have formally addressed how aliens granted deferred action through the november initiatives will be treated for purposes of aca. ) .

another reason why aliens granted deferred action may be eligible for state and local benefits , in particular , is that prwora expressly contemplates states enacting legislation , subsequent to prwora's enactment , that "affirmatively provides" for "unlawfully present aliens" to receive state and local public benefits .

numerous states have exercised this authority to enact legislation that makes at least some state or local public benefits available to either unlawfully present aliens or aliens who are not qualified aliens for purposes of prwora .

in addition , it is important to note that prwora's definition of public benefit is limited to ( a ) any grant , contract , loan , professional license , or commercial license provided by [a government] agency ... or by appropriated funds ... ; and ( b ) any retirement , welfare , health , disability , public or assisted housing , postsecondary education , food assistance , unemployment benefit , or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual , household , or family eligibility unit by [a government] agency ... or by appropriated funds .

given this definition , prwora has not been seen as barring the provision of certain benefits or services that some might characterize as public benefitsâsuch as driver's licenses or admission to public institutions of higher education âbut that are generally not seen as included within the definition of "public benefits" given by prwora .

the feasibility of legal challenges to the obama administration's actions will depend , in part , upon which specific actions are challenged and the legal bases for the challenge .

however , regardless of the specifics of individual cases , standing requirements seem likely to pose a significant barrier for any legal challenge .

standing requirements are concerned with who is a proper party to seek judicial relief from a federal court .

they derive from article iii of the constitution , which confines the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual "cases" and "controversies. .

the case - or - controversy requirement has long been construed to restrict article iii courts to the adjudication of real , live disputes involving parties who have "a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. .

parties seeking judicial relief from an article iii court must generally show three things in order to demonstrate standing: ( 1 ) they have suffered an "injury in fact" that is ( a ) concrete and particularized and ( b ) actual or imminent ; ( 2 ) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant ; and ( 3 ) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision .

competing arguments have been made as to whether there is historical precedent for the obama administration's actions , particularly in granting deferred action to certain aliens brought to the united states as children and to the parents of u.s. citizen or lpr children .

such arguments are shaped , in part , by which historical actions are viewed as analogous to the current ones .

the executive has historically exercised its prosecutorial or enforcement discretion , delegated discretion , and / or discretion in interpreting and applying statutes to provide certain relief from removal to individual aliens who share certain characteristics and could , thus , be said to form a group or category .

at different times , such relief has been made available under the rubric of parole ( or refugee parole ) , extended voluntary departure ( evd ) , indefinite voluntary departure ( ivd ) , deferred enforced departure ( ded ) , temporary protected status ( tps ) , and deferred action .

however , the shared name given to such actions can mask important differences in the legal basis for particular grants of discretion , among other things .

for example , not all grants of parole to aliens in the 1960s should be seen as exercises of prosecutorial or enforcement discretion since congress enacted legislation in 1960 that temporarily provided the executive with express statutory authority to parole "refugees" into the united states .

likewise , in some cases , congress has expressly adopted legislation encouraging the executive to exercise particular forms of prosecutorial or enforcement discretion in certain cases , which could potentially be said to indicate congressional "approval" of the executive's exercise of this authority .

the temporary relief from removal granted to unlawfully present aliens that some have asserted most closely resembles the obama administration's deferred action initiatives âparticularly in terms of the percentage of the unauthorized alien population affectedâare the so - called "family fairness" initiatives of 1987 and 1990 .

in those cases , the reagan and george h.w .

bush administrations , respectively , granted indefinite voluntary departure ( ivd ) and employment authorization to certain immediate relatives of aliens who had legalized their status pursuant to irca .

 ( these relatives were themselves ineligible for legalization under irca for various reasons. ) .

the obama administration's 2014 deferred action initiatives can be likened to the family fairness initiatives in that they involve the granting of temporary relief from removal and work authorization to certain unlawfully present aliens based , in part , on humanitarian factors .

however , certain differences could also be noted between the current and earlier initiatives , including that ( 1 ) the reagan and bush administrations did not establish a centralized process whereby aliens could apply for relief from removal , instead permitting regional officials to grant relief ; ( 2 ) some aliens who were denied relief through the family fairness initiatives were reportedly placed in removal proceedings , something that has not been reported with daca ; and ( 3 ) the family fairness initiatives were preceded ( and followed ) by the enactment of legislation legalizing certain unlawfully present aliens , whereas congress has enacted no such legislation here .

how much weight is given to these similarities or dissimilarities may ultimately depend upon one's views as to the permissibility and / or desirability of the current initiatives .
