the mã©rida initiative , named for the location of a march 2007 meeting between presidents george w. bush and felipe calderã³n of mexico , expands bilateral and regional cooperation to combat drug trafficking organizations , gangs , and other criminal groups .

the stated objective of the mã©rida initiative , according to the u.s. and mexican government joint statement of october 2007 , is to maximize the effectiveness of existing efforts against drug , human , and weapons trafficking .

the joint statement highlights current efforts of both countries , including mexico's 24% increase in security spending in 2007 and u.s. efforts to reduce weapons , human , and drug trafficking along the mexican border .

the central america portion of the initiative aims to support implementation of the u.s. strategy for combating criminal gangs from central america and mexico and to bolster the capacity of governments to inspect and interdict unauthorized drugs , goods , arms , and people .

the administration requested $500 million for mexico and $50 million for central american countries in its fy2008 supplemental appropriations request .

in the fy2009 foreign aid request , the administration requested another $550 million for the mã©rida initiative â $450 million for mexico and $100 million for central american countries .

all of the proposed funding has been requested through the international narcotics control and law enforcement ( incle ) account , administered by the department of state bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs ( inl ) .

table 1 provides a broad summary of the types of programs to be funded by the initiative .

while several members of congress initially expressed concern that they were not adequately consulted by the administration during the development of the mã©rida initiative , a majority have subsequently voted in support of the package .

on may 14 , 2008 , the house committee on foreign affairs approved h.r .

6028 ( berman ) , the merida initiative to combat illicit narcotics and reduce organized crime authorization act of 2008 .

the bill would authorize $1.6 billion over three years , fy2008-fy2010 , for both mexico and central america , $200 million more than originally proposed by president bush .

of that amount , $1.1 billion would be authorized for mexico , $405 million for central america , and $73.5 million for activities of the u.s. bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives ( atf ) to reduce the flow of illegal weapons from the united states to mexico .

among the bill's various conditions on providing the assistance , the measure requires that vetting procedures are in place to ensure that members or units of military or law enforcement agencies that may receive assistance have not been involved in human rights violations .

in terms of appropriations legislation , fy2008 supplemental funding for the mã©rida initiative was considered as part of a broader fy2008 supplemental appropriations act , h.r .

2642 ( edwards ) .

originally introduced june 11 , 2007 as the fy2008 military construction and veterans affairs appropriations act , this bill subsequently became the vehicle for the second fy2008 supplemental appropriations measure .

the may 15 , 2008 house - amended version of the bill would have provided $461.5 million for the mã©rida initiative .

mexico would have received $400 million divided between incle , economic support fund ( esf ) , and foreign military financing ( fmf ) accounts , while central america , haiti , and the dominican republic would have received a total of $61.5 million divided between incle , esf , fmf , and nonproliferation , anti - terrorism , demining and related programs ( nadr ) aid accounts .

the senate version of h.r .

2642 , as amended on may 22 , 2008 , would have provided $450 million for the mã©rida initiative , with $350 million for mexico in the incle account ; and $100 million for central america , haiti , and the dominican republic divided between the incle and esf accounts .

on june 19 , 2008 , the house approved an amended version of the fy2008 supplemental appropriations act , h.r .

2642 , that provides $465 million in fy2008 and fy2009 supplemental assistance for mexico and central america .

the senate approved the compromise house version of h.r .

2642 on june 26 , 2008 .

the bill was then signed into law by president bush on june 30 , 2008 ( p.l .

110-252 ) in the act , mexico receives $352 million in fy2008 supplemental assistance and $48 million in fy2009 bridge fund supplemental assistance , while central america , haiti , and the dominican republic receive $65 million in fy2008 supplemental assistance .

the measure has human rights conditions softer than compared to earlier house and senate versions , largely because of mexico's objections that some of the original conditions , particularly those in the senate version of the bill , would violate its national sovereignty .

the language in the final enacted measure reduced the amount of funding subject to human rights conditions , from 25% to 15% , removed conditions that would have required the mexican government to try military officials accused of abuses in civilian courts and to enhance the power of its national human rights commission , and softened the language in other conditions .
