this report addresses the authority of the district of columbia council to implement a proposed reorganization of the district of columbia board of education .

specifically , the report addresses the authority of the council to implement the proposed district of columbia public education reform amendment act of 2007 ( hereinafter education reform bill ) , a bill currently being considered by the council .

in addition , the report considers to what extent congress would be required to legislate to implement this reorganization .

the education reform bill is a comprehensive proposal to change the governing structure of the district of columbia school system and to delegate significant authority over the public schools to the mayor .

it involves extensive revision of the d.c. code , including parts of the district of columbia home rule act ( home rule act ) .

although the home rule act provides the d.c. council with extensive legislative authority , it also includes certain limitations .

consequently , the question arises as to whether these limitations would apply to the education reform bill , necessitating congressional action to implement the bill .

in conclusion , it would appear likely that the d.c. council has sufficient authority to "create , abolish , or organize" or "define the powers , duties , and responsibilities" of independent "agencies," including the board of education .

however , the council may not have the necessary budgetary authority to allocate funds to individual schools , nor may it delegate such authority to the mayor .

thus , although it would appear that the council could engage in significant reorganization of the board under the education reform bill , congressional implementation would appear to be needed to address the public schools budget restrictions provided for under the home rule act .
