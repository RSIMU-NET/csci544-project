congress may consider legislation designed to create new methods of budget enforcement or alter existing budget enforcement mechanisms .

such budgetary restrictions can take many forms .

if they are to be enforced internally by the house and senate they may be added to the house and senate rules , included in a budget resolution , or included in a rule - making statute that becomes law .

congress has typically incorporated some type of internal budget enforcement in each recent congress .

congress has also passed legislation that creates budgetary requirements that are enforced outside of the house and senate .

for example , in 2011 congress passed the budget control act creating discretionary spending limits , among other things .

since the enactment of the bca , several pieces of legislation have been enacted making changes to the spending limits and the enforcement procedures .

most recently , the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( p.l .

114-74 , enacted november 2 , 2015 ) increased discretionary spending limits for fy2016 and fy2017 , among other things .

such budget enforcement legislation is primarily within the jurisdiction of the house and senate budget committees and often the judiciary and rules committees as well .

consideration of such legislation is shaped primarily by house and senate rules as well as the budget act .
