increasing use of coastal and marine resources is driving proposals for congress and the administration to alter current relationships between environmental protection and sustainable resource management .

recent reports note declines in marine resources and shortcomings in what are perceived as fragmented and limited approaches to resource protection and management in federal and state waters .

a further concern is the increasing pressures and conflicts that arise from economic activity associated with continued human population growth in coastal areas .

a common concern is habitat loss or alteration , due both to natural processes , such as climate variation , and to development , changes in land management practices , competition from invasive species , and other factors , nearly all related to economic , political , or social interests .

congress faces the issue of how to balance these diverse interests ( which may fall on various sides of any given controversy ) while promoting the sustainable management of fishery and other marine resources and protection of the marine environment .

congress last reauthorized and extensively amended the magnuson - stevens fishery conservation and management act ( msfcma ) in the 109 th congress ( p.l .
