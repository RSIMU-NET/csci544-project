the term "cloning" is used by scientists to describe many different processes that involve making copies of biological material , such as a gene , a cell , a plant or an animal .

the cloning of genes , for example , has led to new treatments developed by the biotechnology industry for diseases such as diabetes and hemophilia .

in the context of this report , a human embryo produced via cloning involves the process called somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) .

in scnt , the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from a mature body cell , such as a skin cell .

in cloning , the embryo is created without sexual reproduction: there is no joining of egg and sperm .

concern over the possibility of producing a human clone increased with the announcement on february 24 , 1997 , that scientists in scotland had used scnt in 1996 to produce the first cloned adult mammal , dolly , the sheep .

ian wilmut's group at the roslin institute in edinburgh removed the nucleus from a sheep egg and replaced it with the nucleus of a mammary gland cell from an adult sheep .

the resulting embryo was then transferred to the uterus of a surrogate sheep .

a total of 277 such embryos were transferred , but only one lamb was born .

analyses of dolly's genetic material confirmed that she was derived from the sheep mammary cell .

dolly was euthanized on february 14 , 2003 , after developing a lung infection .

although some claim that her somewhat early death at six years was related to being a clone , scientists at the roslin institute believe her ailment may be due to the fact that she was raised indoors ( for security reasons ) rather than as a pastured sheep , which can live to 11 or 12 years of age .

although scientists have been successful in using scnt to produce other animals ( such as a cat , goat , cow , horse , mule , pig , mouse , and rabbit ) , the efficiency of the procedure is still very low and frequently results in abnormal development .

proponents maintain that one day cloning may be very useful for a number of agriculture applications , including the improvement of livestock .

currently , cloned mice are used for basic research on human health applications .

at the present time , no u.s. laws or regulations would prohibit all cloning research .

however , federal funding of any type of research involving human embryos , starting with in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) then later cloning and the creation of stem cell lines from embryos , had been blocked by various policy decisions dating back 25 years .

as of april 18 , 2006 , 15 states have passed laws pertaining to human cloning .

arkansas , california , connecticut , indiana , iowa , maryland , massachusetts , michigan , new jersey , north dakota , rhode island , south dakota , and virginia have all enacted measures to prohibit reproductive cloning .

arizona and missouri have passed laws that address the use of public funds for cloning .

in addition , louisiana has enacted legislation prohibiting reproductive cloning but the law expired in july 2003 .

six of the states also prohibit cloning for research or therapeutic purposes ( arkansas , indiana , iowa , michigan , north dakota , south dakota ) .

the virginia law may also prohibit therapeutic cloning , "but it may be unclear because the law does not define the term 'human being' which is used in the definition of human cloning. .

the california and new jersey laws specifically permit cloning for research purposes .

the rhode island law is silent on therapeutic cloning and cloning for research purposes , and has a sunset date of july 7 , 2010 .

the 109 th congress addressed the issue of cloning and embryo research in the labor , hhs and education appropriations act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-149 ) by again including the dickey amendment , which has banned , since fy1996 , almost all publically funded human embryo research .

in addition , the science , justice and commerce appropriations act , 2006 ( p.l .

109-108 ) bars the patent and trademark office from spending money "to issue patents on claims directed to or encompassing a human organism. .

this restriction , which was first included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2004 ( p.l .

108-199 ) , and in the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ( p.l .

108-447 ) , could potentially deter human embryo research and stem cell research because researchers might not be able to claim ownership of their work .

h.r .

810 ( castle ) , the stem cell research enhancement act , passed the house on may 24 , 2005 , on a vote of 238-194 .

it would amend the public health service act and direct the secretary of hhs to conduct and support research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from a human embryo .

stem cell lines derived after enactment must meet ethical guidelines established by the nih .

only embryos that were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and in excess of clinical need are eligible for stem cell derivation .

only embryos that the individuals seeking fertility treatments have determined will not be implanted in a woman and will be discarded are eligible for stem cell derivation .

written consent is required for embryo donation .

the secretary in consultation with the director of nih shall promulgate guidelines 60 days after enactment .

no federal funds shall be used to conduct research on unapproved stem cell lines .

the secretary shall annually report to congress about stem cell research .

a companion bill , s. 471 ( specter ) , was introduced on february 28 , 2005 .

on june 29 , 2006 , senate majority leader bill frist announced an agreement on scheduling a vote in the senate on stem cell research legislation , more than a year after the house passed h.r .

810 .

under the agreement , amendments were not allowed on a package of three bills ; each needed 60 votes to pass: h.r .

810 , s. 2754 ( santorum ) the alternative pluripotent stem cell therapies enhancement act , and s. 3504 ( santorum ) the fetus farming prohibition act .

s. 3504 does not address the issue of stem cell research but rather the use of tissue from a later stage embryo or fetus .

the second bill in the agreement , s. 2754 , was introduced on may 5 , 2006 .

it would amend the public health service act adding a new section 409j "alternative human pluripotent stem cell research. .

the bill would require the secretary of hhs to develop techniques for the isolation , derivation , production , or testing of stem cells that are capable of producing all or almost all of the cell types of the developing body and may result in improved understanding of treatments for diseases and other adverse health conditions , but are not derived from a human embryo .

within 90 days of enactment , the secretary would be required to: ( 1 ) provide guidance concerning the next steps required for additional research ; ( 2 ) prioritize research with the greatest potential for near - term clinical benefit ; and ( 3 ) take into account techniques outlined by the president's council on bioethics and any other appropriate techniques and research .

the secretary would be required to prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of congress an annual report describing the activities and research conducted .

the bill authorizes such sums as may be necessary for fy2007 through fy2009 .

a companion bill , h.r .

5526 ( bartlett ) , was introduced on june 6 , 2006 .

the third bill , s. 3504 , was introduced on june 13 , 2006 .

it would amend the public health service act to prohibit the solicitation or acceptance of human fetal tissue obtained from a humanâ pregnancy that was deliberately initiated to provide such tissue , or tissue obtained from a human embryo ( or fetus ) that was implanted in the uterus of a nonhuman animal .

the bill was referred to the senate health , education , labor and pensions committee .

a companion bill , h.r .

5719 ( weldon ) , was introduced on june 29 , 2006 , and referred to the house energy and commerce committee .

on july 18 , 2006 , the senate passed h.r .

810 ( 63 to 37 ) , s. 2754 ( 100-0 ) and s. 3504 ( 100-0 ) .

on the same day , the house passed s. 3504 ( 100-0 ) but failed to pass s. 2754 with the required 2 / 3 vote ( 273-154 ) .

on july 19 , 2006 , president bush signed s. 3504 and vetoed h.r .

810 , the first veto of his six years in office .

an attempt in the house on july 19 to override the veto of h.r .

810 did not receive the required 2 / 3 vote ( 235-193 ) .

h.r .

1357 ( dave weldon ) , the human cloning prohibition act of 2005 , was introduced on march 17 , 2005 .

h.r .

1357 amends title 18 of the united states code and would ban the process of human cloning as well as the importation of any product derived from an embryo created via cloning .

under this measure , cloning could not be used for reproductive purposes or for research on therapeutic purposes , which would have implications for stem cell research .

h.r .

1357 includes a criminal penalty of imprisonment of not more than 10 years and a civil penalty of not less than $1 million .

h.r .

1357 is essentially identical to the measure which passed the house in the 107 th congress ( h.r .

2505 ) and the 108 th congress ( h.r .

534 ) .

h.r .

1357 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary .

a companion bill , s. 658 ( brownback ) , was introduced on march 17 , 2005 .

it is similar to h.r .

1357 , except that ( 1 ) it does not contain the ban on importation of products derived from therapeutic cloning ; and ( 2 ) it amends title 4 of the public health service act ( 42 u.s.c .

â§â§ 289 et seq. ) .

instead of title 18 of the united states code .

s. 658 includes a criminal penalty of imprisonment of not more than 10 years and a civil penalty of not less than $1 million .

it requiresâ gao to conduct a study to assess the need ( if any ) for any changes of the prohibition on cloning in light of new developments in medical technology , the need for scnt to produce medical advances , current public attitudes and prevailing ethical views on the use of scnt and potential legal implications of research in scnt .

the study is to be completed within four yearsâ of enactment .

s. 658 has been referred to the senate health , education , labor , and pensionsâ committee .

s. 876 ( hatch ) , the human cloning ban and stem cell research protection act of 2005 , was introduced on april 21 , 2005 .

a similar bill , h.r .

1822 ( bono ) , the human cloning ban and stem cell research protection act of 2005 , was introduced on april 26 , 2005 .

s. 876 amends title 18 of the united states code and h.r .

1822 amends the food , drug and cosmetic act ( 21 u.s.c .

â§â§â 301 et seq. ) .

both bills would ban human reproductive cloning but allow cloning for medical research purposes , including stem cell research .

s. 876 and h.r .

1822 include a criminal penalty of imprisonment of not more than 10 years ; s. 876 has a civil penalty of not less than $1 million , h.r .

1822 has a civil penalty not to exceed $10 million .

s. 876 requires the comptroller general to prepare a series of four reports within one year of enactment .

the first report describes the actions taken by the attorney general to enforce the prohibition on human reproductive cloning , the personnel and resources used to enforce the prohibition , and a list of any violations of the prohibition .

a second report describes similar state laws that prohibit human cloning and actions taken by the states' attorney general to enforce the provisions of any similar state law along with a list of violations .

a third report describes the coordination of enforcement actions among the federal , state and local governments .

a fourth report describes laws adopted by foreign countries related to human cloning .

h.r .

1822 requires a similar set of three reports to be prepared by the secretary of health and human services .

s. 876 and h.r .

1822 would amend the public health service act by requiring that human scnt be conducted in accordance with the ethical requirements ( such as informed consent , examination by an institutional review board , and protections for safety and privacy ) contained in subpart a of 45 c.f.r .

part 46 , or parts 50 and 56 of 21â c.f.r .

s. 876 and h.r .

1822 have a prohibition on conducting scnt on fertilized human eggs ( oocytes ) , and both state that "unfertilized blastocysts" shall not be maintained after more than 14 days from its first cell division , aside from storage at temperatures less that zero degrees centigrade .

s. 876 and h.r .

1822 stipulate that a human egg may not be used in scnt research unless the egg is donated voluntarily with the informed consent of the woman donating the egg .

both bills also specify that human eggs or unfertilized blastocysts may not be acquired , received or otherwise transferred for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce .

in addition , scnt may not be conducted in a laboratory in which human eggs are subject to assisted reproductive technology treatments or procedures , such as in vitro fertilization for the treatment of infertility .

violation of these provisions in s. 876 and h.r .

1822 regarding ethical requirements would result in a civil penalty of not more than $250,000 .

s. 876 has been referred to the senate judiciary committee .

h.r .

1822 has been referred to the house energy and commerce committee .

supporters of a ban on human cloning , such as that contained in h.r .

1357 , argue that a partial ban on human cloning , like the one contained in s. 876 , would be impossible to enforce .

critics of the ban on human cloning argue that scnt creates a "clump of cells" rather than an embryo , and that the ban would curtail medical research and prevent americans from receiving life - saving treatments created overseas .

the possibility of using cloning technology not just for therapeutic purposes but also for reproducing human beings raises profound moral and ethical questions .

as previously mentioned , the bush administration and the national academies have made their positions clear .

in july 2002 , the president's council on bioethics issued its report , human cloning and human dignity , which contained two opinions and sets of recommendations: one of the 10-7 majority , and one of the minority .

the majority and minority both opposed reproductive cloning .

it was on the topic of therapeutic cloning , which the majority opposed and the minority favored , that the council wasâ split .

a predecessor to the president's council , the national bioethics advisory commission ( nbac ) , recommended , in cloning human beings , the continuation of a moratorium on federal funding for reproductive purposes with a call for voluntary compliance from the private sector .

it further recommended the enactment of legislation with a three - to five - year sunset clause banning cloning for reproductive purposes .

however , it made clear that all measures taken should "be carefully written so as not to interfere with other important areas of scientific research. .

various other organizations , individuals , and councils have issued opinions and reports on cloning as well .

some , such as the united states conference of catholic bishops ( usccb ) oppose human cloning for any purpose: "the cloning procedure is so dehumanizing that some scientists want to treat the resulting human beings as subhuman , creating them solely so they can destroy them for their cells and tissues. .

others , such as a group of forty nobel laureates , former first lady nancy reagan , and former president gerald ford , would allow regulated cloning for therapeutic purposes , but disallow it for reproductive ones .

still others , such as such as dr. severino antinori , and clonaid , favor cloning for reproductive purposes , and even claim to have created human clones via scnt .

the human cloning debate centers around number of different ethical and pragmatic issues .

exploration of these issues reveals variation in ethical and moral as well as factual beliefs .

theâ following discussion breaks down the arguments surrounding human cloning according to these issues , demonstrating both the complexity of the issues and the points of resonance among the groups .

as clonaid advertised and the president's council acknowledged , supporters of reproductive cloning favor it because it might "allow infertile couples to have genetically - related children," enable families to avoid genetic disease in their genetically - related children , facilitate the replication of specific persons ( such as lost loved ones ) , or to create ideal transplant donors .

likewise , the nbac recognized that some of the principles that underlie these purposes are a "presumption in favor of individual liberty," that "human reproduction [is] particularly personal and should remain free of constraint , ... [and] as a society , we ought not limit the freedom of scientific inquiry. .

however , for a number of other reasons , the idea of cloning for reproductive purposes is presently rejected by most groups and organizations , including the president's council and nbac .

of the groups and individuals listed in the ethical and social issues section , only clonaid and dr. antinori favor reproductive cloning at this time .

despite the apparent uniformity of views rejecting reproductive cloning , there is a great deal of variation in the lines of reasoning underlying such objections .

according to the usccb , donum vitae instructs that "attempts or hypotheses for obtaining a human being without any connection with sexuality through 'twin fission,' cloning or parthenogenesis are to be considered contrary to the moral law , since they are in opposition to the dignity both of human procreation and of the conjugal union. .

this objection to reproductive cloning , that procreation should be limited to conjugal unions , is not supported by most groups .

if accepted , it would lead to a rejection of other forms of assisted reproduction , such as in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) .

of the groups and individuals listed above , only uccsb cites the need for a conjugal union as a persuasive argument against reproductive cloning .

the most agreed upon objection to human reproductive cloning is one of safety .

the president's council on bioethics concluded that , "[g]iven the high rates of morbidity and mortality in the cloning of other mammals , we believe that cloning - to - produce - children would be extremely unsafe , and that attempts to produce a cloned child would be highly unethical. .

the national bioethics advisory commission reached a consensus in its objection to reproductive cloning "because current scientific information indicate[d] that this technique [was] not safe in humans...." the national academies agrees with this line of reasoning , given that animal experimentation has demonstrated that "only a small percentage of attempts are successful," "many of the clones die during gestation," and "newborn clones are often abnormal , or die. .

while these objections about safety are widely held , they may be temporary in nature .

as research advances , it may become less risky , and thus some may find it less objectionable to attempt reproductive human cloning .

unlike concerns about safety , other types of objections , while not so widely held , may be more lasting because they are not likely to be alleviated by scientific progress .

these tend to be philosophical in nature .

these concerns , listed in the following paragraphs , have been acknowledged by the president's council , nbac , ucssb , and the national academies .

according to the president's council , "[d]ifferent council members give varying moral weight to [the following] different concerns. .

only the ucssb found the concerns persuasive in total .

some objections to reproductive cloning are based upon fears that cloned children will have difficulty with their identities "because each will be genetically virtually identical to a human being who has already lived and because the expectations for their lives may be shadowed by constant comparisons to the life of the 'original." .

these concerns are dismissed by others , who point out that this argument rests largely on "the crudest genetic determinism. .

they cite both the effect that environment plays on individual development , and the lack of difficulty with identity experienced by naturally occurring identical twins .

other philosophical objections have to do with a fear that cloned children "might come to be considered more like products of a designed manufacturing process than 'gifts' whom their parents are prepared to accept as they are .

such an attitude toward children could also contribute to increased commercialization and industrialization of human procreation. .

this , in turn , may fuel a new eugenics in which parents select not only whether to have a child , but which child to have .

others point out that these types of concerns were raised about most forms of assisted reproduction ( such as in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis ) , which have not led to objectification .

in addition , if being born is a considered to be a benefit to the one born , "toâ the extent that the technology is used to benefit the child ... no objectification of the child takes place. .

a complicated lineage has also been introduced as an objection to reproductive cloning: "by confounding and transgressing the natural boundaries between generations , cloning could strain the social ties between them .

fathers could become "twin brothers" to their "sons" ; mothers could give birth to their genetic twins ; and grandparents would also be the "genetic parents" of their grandchildren .

genetic relation to only one parent might produce special difficulties for family life. .

others point out that children "born through assisted reproductive technologies may also have complicated relationships to genetic , gestational , and rearing parents ... [yet] there is no evidence that confusion over family roles has harmed children born through assisted reproductive technologies , although the subject has not been carefully studied. .

concerns have been voiced about the effects of cloning on society: "cloning - to - produce - children would affect not only the direct participants but also the entire society that allows or supports thisâ activity .

even if practiced on a small scale , it could affect the way society looks at children and set a precedent for future nontherapeutic interventions into the human genetic endowment orâ novel forms of control by one generation over the next. .

this objection is rejected by others,â who argue that "people can , and do , adapt in socially redeeming ways to new technologiesâ ... [a] child born through somatic cell nuclear transfer could be loved and accepted like any other child.... .

cloning for therapeutic purposes is more broadly supported than reproductive cloning , and the issues involved are somewhat different .

the safety concerns of reproductive cloning do not apply in therapeutic cloning , placing much of the scientific community , such as the national academies , in favor of it .

in addition , the nbac , a minority of the president's council , the group of nobel laureates , nancy reagan , and gerald ford also generally support cloning for therapeutic purposes .

opponents include a majority of the president's council , and the usccb .

the central debate over therapeutic cloning rests on the relative weight ascribed to potential research benefits , and that ascribed to cloned embryos themselves .

all sides generally agree that research involving cloning may generate biomedical advancements that relieve human suffering .

as described the president's council , the research "may offer uniquely useful ways of investigating and possibly treating many chronic debilitating diseases and disabilities , providing relief to millions. .

yet a majority of council members were dissuaded from the research , arguing that "[i]f we permit this research to proceed , we will effectively be endorsing the complete transformation of nascent human life into nothing more than a resource tool. .

similar arguments are made by the usccb .

the council's minority offered an opposing viewpoint: "we believe there are sound moral reasons for not regarding the embryo , in its earliest stages as the moral equivalent of a human person" but rather as having a "developing and intermediate moral worth that commands our special respect. .

the minority based its opinion on the fact that , at the blastocyst stage ( the one useful for stem cell research , for example ) , the cells are still undifferentiated and could still be split and develop into two separate twinned embryos , "suggesting that the earliest stage embryo is not yet an individual. .

furthermore , they note that the possibility for the development of a human child from a cloned embryo would require its transference to a uterus , as is currently the case with ivf .

ivf often results in the creation of embryos that remain unimplanted , and is permitted in the united states .

for all of the above reasons , the council minority , nbac , nancy reagan , gerald ford , and the nobel laureates support therapeutic cloning .

in july 2004 , dr. paul mchugh , a member of the president's council who objects to the destruction of human embryos and who had voted with the council majority for a moratorium on cloning - for - biomedical research , argued in a medical journal article that scnt "resembles a tissue culture," and that the products of scnt should be available for research once regulations are in place to ensure that scnt is conducted ethically .

at the december 2004 council meeting , dr. william hurlbut , another council member who objects to the destruction of human embryos and voted for the moratorium , made a proposal to explore the possibility of using scnt in combination with techniques to ensure that the group of cells created cannot give rise to human life but can generate embryonic stem cells .

dr. hurlbut explained , "using the technique of nuclear transfer , it may be possible to produce embryonic stem cells within a limited cellular system that is biologically and morally akin to a complex tissue culture and thereby bypass moral concerns about the creation and disruption of human embryos. .

some have criticized dr. hurlbut's proposal to create something that is not an embryo , yet generates embryonic stem cells , as one focused on a "semantic issue , not a scientific one. .

others have lauded dr. hurlbut's proposal as a potential scientific solution to a moral problem .

included among them is dr. leon kass , the chair of the council and a well - known opponent of embryo destruction , who said the proposal raises the possibility that , "the partisans of scientific progress and the defenders of nascent human life can go forward in partnership without anyone having to violate things they hold dear. .

a second set of considerations underlying the debate have to do with a moral aversion to the prospect of creating life in order to destroy it .

as a majority of the president's council pointed out , cloning for therapeutic purposes requires "the creation of human life expressly and exclusively for the purpose of its use in research , research that necessarily involves its destruction , ... transform[ing] nascent human life into nothing more than a resource tool. .

the usccb agrees with this characterization .

the council minority countered that the "embryos would not be 'created for destruction,' but for use in the service of life and medicine. .

further , the "practice of sacrificing the life of the unborn in order to save the live of the pregnant womanâwhile not a moral parallel to the case of using cloned embryos for biomedical researchâshows that there is some moral precedent for subordinating nascent human life to more developed human life. .

the nbac , nancy reagan , gerald ford , and the nobel laureates agree with this characterization .

the effect of therapeutic cloning upon society has been debated by opponents and proponents alike .

the president's council majority fear negative effects , such as the subjugation of weak members of society , or genetic manipulation of developing life: "as much as we wish to alleviate suffering now and to leave our children in a world where suffering can be more effectively relieved , we also want to leave them in a world ... that honors moral limits , that respects all life whether strong or weak , and that refuses to secure the good of some human beings by sacrificing the lives of others. .

approving therapeutic cloning would harm society by "crossing the boundary from sexual to asexual reproduction , thus approving in principle the genetic manipulation and control of nascent human life. .

usccb also shares this point of view .

counter arguments have been made by those who note that "[h]istorically , scientific inquiry has been protected and even encouraged because of the great societal benefit the public recognizes in maintaining the sanctity of knowledge and the value of intellectual freedom. .

in addition , they note that cloning is replication , rather than transformation: "in an important sense , cloning is not the most radical thing on the horizon .

much more significant ... would be the ability to actually alter or manipulate the genome of offspring , ... which could then lead to a child being born with characteristics other than it would have had...." the council minority , nbac , nancy reagan , gerald ford , and the nobel laureates share this perspective .

some , such as the majority of the president's council and usccb , believe that policies allowing therapeutic cloning would create a slippery slope , "opening the door to other moral hazards , such as cloning - to - produce - children or research on later - stage embryos and fetuses. .

others , such as the council minority , nbac , nancy reagan , gerald ford , and the nobel laureates , believe that it is possible to circumscribe acceptable practices with good policy .

"both the federal government and the states already regulate the researchers' methods in order to protect the rights of research subjects and community safety. .

government might regulate "the secure handling of embryos , licensing and prior review of research projects , the protection of egg donors , and the provision of equal access to benefits. .

the topic of egg procurement came to the public's attention in november 2005 with allegations that some human eggs used in south korean scientist dr. hwang's laboratory had been obtained under coercive conditions .

the alleged situation in dr. hwang's laboratory raises the issue of coercion both because subordinate women in the laboratory allegedly donated eggs , and because some women were allegedly paid for their eggs .

a 2002 study conducted by a university of pennsylvania student raised the issue of insufficient information , finding that a number programs seeking donor eggs for reproductive purposes were not up front about the risks involved in egg retrieval .

the wide consensus regarding the need for informed consent necessarily implies similarâ consensus on the need for an information - rich , coercion - free method of obtaining eggs ; however , there is some disagreement on the specifics of whether payment for eggs necessarily constitutes coercion .

the prospect of paying women for their eggs , which has been debated in the context of seeking donor eggs both for reproductive purposes ( for example , to enable women who do not produce their own eggs to become pregnant ) , and for research purposes , is not unheard of in the united states .

according to a 2000 study by the american society of reproductive medicine ( asrm ) , some ivf programs reportedly offered as much as $5,000 for one egg retrieval cycle , though $2,500 appeared to be a more common amount .

offers of much higher amounts ( $50,000-$100,000 ) have been reported elsewhere .

dr. huang's laboratory reportedly made payments of $1,400 to each woman who donated eggs .

payments are not illegal in the unites states , nor were they illegal in south korea at the time dr. huang's laboratory allegedly made them .

the questions are , is payment for egg donation ever acceptable , and if so , what amount is appropriate ? .

several arguments have been put forth in favor of payment for egg donation , many focused on donation for reproductive purposes .

first , some have argued that payment creates incentives to increase the number of egg donors , thus facilitating research and benefitting infertile couples .

second , some reason that payment for eggs gives women parity with sperm donors , who may be compensated for donating gametes at a lower rate , given that they require a much less involved procedure .

third , some allege that fairness dictates that women who donate eggs ought to be able to benefit from their action .

fourth , some claim that pressures created by financial incentives may be no greater than those experienced by women asked to make altruistic egg donations for relatives or friends , and may thus not rise to the level of coercion .

these are the types of arguments that led asrm to recommend in 2000 that sums of up to $5,000 may be appropriate for typical egg donation , while sums of up to $10,000 may possibly be justified if there are particular difficulties a woman must endure to make her donation .

several arguments have also been put forth against payment for egg donation .

first , some voiced fears that payment might lead to the exploitation of women , particularly poor women , and the commodification of reproductive tissues .

second , some have argued that payment for eggs for research purposes might undermine public confidence in endeavors such as human esr .

arguments such as these have prompted both the nas and the pcbe to recommend that women not be paid for donating their eggs for research purposes .

it also led the pcbe to note that in theory , there is the possibility that eggs could be procured from ovaries harvested from cadavers , which might at least alleviate concerns related to coercion .

it is worth noting that a woman may choose to undergo egg retrieval for her own reproductive purposes , which would effectively take the process of egg procurement out of the research arena and avoid the question of payment entirely .

 ( for example , this could be an option for a woman seeking ivf because her fallopian tubes are blocked ) .

one final set of arguments center around the types of actions that the government may take with respect to therapeutic and / or reproductive cloning .

these include permitting , regulating , funding , discouraging , and temporarily or permanently banning the practices .

as a starting point , nbac offers: "in the united states , governmental policies that prohibit or regulate human actions require justification because of a general presumption against governmental interference in individual activities. .

as may be expected , the opinions regarding appropriate courses of action are largely linked to points of view about the appropriateness of the various endeavors .

the most permissive approach available , permitting cloning with no restrictions , is not supported by any of the individuals or organizations referenced herein .

by contrast , the next most permissive approach , regulating cloning , is supported by the council minority , nbac , nancy reagan , gerald ford , and the nobel laureates as appropriate for therapeutic cloning , so as to enable it to continue in accordance with socially accepted scientific research practices .

as summarized by the council minority , "we believe that this research could provide relief to millions of americans , and that the government should therefore support is , within sensible limits imposed by regulation. .

a voluntary prohibition , the third most permissive approach , was recommended by nbac as theâ appropriate immediate response to reproductive cloning by the private sector .

nbac calledâ for "an immediate request to all firms , clinicians , investigators , and professional societies in theâ private and non - federally funded sectors to comply voluntarily with the intent of the federalâ moratorium. .

as a longer term approach , nbac recommended the fourth most permissive approach , a temporary ban on reproductive cloning .

"federal legislation [should] be enacted to prohibit anyone from attempting , whether in a research or clinical setting , to create a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer .

it is critical , however , that such legislation include a sunset clause to ensure that congress will review the issue after a specified time period ( three to five years ) in order to decide whether the prohibition continues to be needed. .

readers may be interested to note that , if enacted in 1997 when nbac's report was published , a five - year ban on reproductiveâ cloning would have expired in 2002 .

the national academies also recommended a ban on reproductive cloning , and did not call it temporary but did add that it should be reconsidered every five years .

on the topic of therapeutic rather than reproductive cloning , a majority of the council recommended a temporary moratorium as the proper approach , because it would "reaffirm the principle that science can progress while upholding the community's moralâ norms , and would therefore reaffirm the community's moral support for science and biomedical technology. .

the most restrictive approach to cloning , a permanent ban , was proposed by the council minority and majority , and nancy reagan as appropriate for reproductive cloning .

"by permanently banning cloning - to - produce children , this policy gives force to the strong ethical verdict against [it] , unanimous in the council ... and widely supported by the american people. .

this approach is also favored by the usccb not only for reproductive cloning , but also for therapeutic cloning .

one related issue , that of the use of federal funding for therapeutic cloning , has also been discussed .

no proposals have been made by any of the groups or individuals listed above for the use of federal funding for reproductive cloning .

opponents of funding therapeutic cloning , such as the council majority , have expressed concern that use of federal funding for therapeutic cloning would put "the federal government in the novel and unsavory position of mandating the destruction of nascent human life. .

proponents of federal funding for therapeutic cloning , such as the council minority , nbac , nancy reagan , gerald ford , and the nobel laureates , cite as support the advancements that might be powered by the infusion of federal dollars into the research , as well as the ethical protections that would attach with the money .
