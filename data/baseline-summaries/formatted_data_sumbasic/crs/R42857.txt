for most rank - and - file federal employees in the executive branch of government there is no general , overall statutory or regulatory restriction or prohibition on outside , additional compensated employment activity â€” known colloquially as "moonlighting. .

broad restrictions on outside , compensated employment may apply to more senior officials in the executive branch .

however , for rank - and - file federal employees the concept of "conflicts of interest" generally controls the restriction on or permissibility of outside , compensated activity , and would bar such "moonlighting" when ( 1 ) a statute or a specific agency regulation expressly prohibits that particular kind of outside employment activity , or ( 2 ) an outside activity , because of the particular official duties of the employee , would require that the employee "recuse" or disqualify himself or herself from official duties to such an extent as to impair the effectiveness of his or her employment for the government .

the conflict of interest limitations on outside , additional private employment of federal employees , which are set out in provisions of federal law , regulation , and executive order , establish the general principle that employees may not receive compensation from certain private parties where a potential "conflict of interest" may arise , that is , where the outside private activity may conflict with one's federal , public position and duties .

this may limit and restrict outside employment opportunities both as to the source of compensation and , potentially , as to the subject matter and nature of the duties of an outside position .

general ethical standards promulgated by executive order specifically require that employees avoid "outside employment or activities ... that conflict with official government duties and responsibilities. .

the office of government ethics ( oge ) has stated in the government - wide ethics regulations promulgated for the executive branch that outside employment would "conflict" with official duties in two specific instances: 1 .

express statutory or regulatory restriction .

initially , the office of government ethics notes that conflicting activities include those that are prohibited by statute or by agency supplemental regulations .

each federal agency , upon approval from the office of government ethics , is authorized to issue ethics and conflict of interest regulations supplemental to oge's government - wide provisions , which may relate to and bear upon the particular function and mission of that agency .

employees must thus examine their individual agency's own regulations on outside employment and conflicts of interest before engaging in outside compensated activity .

in addition to specific restrictions on certain kinds of outside employment , it is common for agency supplemental regulations to require the employee to receive express prior approval to engage in outside employment activities .

2 .

employment which creat es a disqualifying conflict of interest .

secondly , the regulations provide that a "conflicting" outside employment would result if that activity necessitated the employee's disqualification and recusal from official matters so central to the individual's governmental duties that it would "materially impair" the employee's capacity to perform his or her official responsibilities .

"recusal" or disqualification from participating in a governmental matter under consideration is one of the principal "conflict of interest" avoidance mechanisms in federal law and regulation .

under current conflict of interest law and regulation , an employee in the executive branch is required to disqualify himself or herself from official governmental activities regarding any "particular matter" when such matter would have a "direct and predictable effect" upon a personal financial interest of the employee , or upon the financial interests of the employee's outside employer or business associates .

outside activities which entangle federal employees in outside employment , business , or economic relationships requiring such regular recusals or disqualifications under federal law or regulation would thus be prohibited , on a case - by - case basis , under this standard .

federal employees are cautioned as a general matter that outside employment and other outside activities must comply with the other ethics standards and provisions promulgated by the office of government ethics and by executive order , including "the principle that an employee shall endeavor to avoid actions creating the appearance of violating any of the ethical standards" promulgated by oge , and "the prohibition against use of official position for an employee's private gain or for the private gain" of one with whom he or she has a business or economic relationship .

employees are expressly restricted by regulation from using official government resources , supplies , or their official government time , to work on outside , private activities .

it should also be noted that general ethical standards for executive branch personnel provide that "an employee shall not ... solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action from , doing business with , or conducting activities regulated by the employee's agency , or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties. .

this standard must be observed by federal employees in the conduct of any outside business and financial activities and relationships .

there are certain specific statutory restrictions which might apply in some circumstances to restrict or prohibit the receipt of outside compensation by executive branch personnel , or to limit certain types of outside activities for private parties .

no employee of the u.s. government may receive anything of value "for or because of" any official act performed or to be performed by that employee or officer ; no employee may receive or share in compensation for private "representational services" rendered to parties in any matter before a federal agency ; federal employees may not represent private parties in any matter in which the united states is a party or is interested , before an agency of the government or a court , whether for compensation or not ; federal employees must disqualify themselves from working on any government matter in which they have a personal financial interest , or in which a firm or entity for whom they serve as an officer or employee has a financial interest ; and no executive branch employee may be compensated by a private source for his or her government work , that is , one may not receive salary supplementation from outside private sources for services performed within the scope of one's federal employment .

furthermore , no federal government officer or employee may receive any compensation ( "emoluments" ) from a foreign government or other official foreign entity , without the consent of congress , nor may any federal employee act as an "agent" of a "foreign principal. .

employees of the federal government who earn over a particular amount are restricted by tax consequences from "self - dealings" with private foundations , which may include limitations on the receipt of compensation and expenses from such entities .

there are other , broad prohibitions and restrictions for higher - ranking government officials which may not generally apply to rank - and - file government employees .

by executive order of the president , an officer or employee who is appointed by the president to a full - time , non - career position in the executive branch , including all full - time employees of the white house and the office of policy development , may not receive any outside earned income during that appointment .

other higher - level officials in the executive branch , that is , non - career officials who are compensated at the rate above a gs - 15 , are limited in their outside earned income opportunities by other provisions of the ethics reform act of 1989 .

such officials may not have outside earned income which exceeds 15% of the official salary earned by a level ii on the executive schedule ; may not receive compensation for affiliating with a firm to provide professional services involving a fiduciary relationship ; may not permit their names to be used by any such firm ; may not receive any compensation for practicing a profession which involves a fiduciary relationship ; may not serve for compensation as an officer or member of the board of any association , corporation , or other entity ; and may not receive compensation for teaching without prior notification of and approval by the appropriate supervisory ethics office .

when higher - ranking officials are allowed to accept compensation for writing or speaking on the outside , these officials have more restrictions on the subject matter and content of such activities than do rank - and - file employees .

unlike rank - and - file federal employees , a non - career official who is compensated at a rate above a gs - 15 is prohibited by office of government ethics regulations from receiving compensation for speaking , lecturing , or writing activity if the subject matter of the speech , article , or appearance "deals in significant part with ... the general subject matter area , industry , or economic sector primarily affected by the programs and operations of his agency," and must receive authorization in advance to engage in outside , compensated teaching activities .

although the general restriction on compensated outside employment in the executive order applicable to presidential appointees may supersede many specific statutory limitations on directors or administrators of federal regulatory agencies , there may also be statutory provisions , often enacted as part of the organic act creating the particular agency or federal entity , which â€” for certain high - level officials such as the director or head of such entity â€” may limit professional or employment activity in a particular field or endeavor that the agency regulates or oversees , or outside employment generally .

for example , the administrator and deputy administrator of the federal aviation administration are instructed by statute not to "engage in another business , vocation , or employment. .

financial disclosure statements and reports are required from many federal officials and employees under the provisions of the ethics in government act of 1978 , as amended .

financial disclosure reports under the ethics in government act require annual public reporting and disclosure of a wide range of personal financial information , including the disclosure of compensated outside employment activities , outside income , and financial transactions , as well as certain positions held in outside organizations or entities .

even when a public report is not required because of an employee's salary level , a confidential statement may be required of certain employees , depending on their duties and responsibilities , by the employing agency .

although not intended to be an exhaustive list , such agency regulations which provide specific restrictions on particular types or areas of outside , compensated private employment include the following: commodities futures trading commission : a commission member or other employee shall not engage in non - federal employment or any other outside activity that: ( 1 ) involves the rendering of advice concerning any legal , accounting or economic matter , or any agricultural , mining , foreign currency market or other commodity - related matter , in which the commission may be significantly interested ( except that this prohibition shall not apply to a special government employee unless the special government employee: ( i ) has participated personally and substantially as an employee or special government employee in the same matter ; or ( ii ) has served with the commission 60 days or more during the immediately preceding period of 365 consecutive days ) ; ( 2 ) involves an appearance in court or on a brief in a representative capacity in relation to any matter which relates to any policy , program or operation of the commission ; or ( 3 ) is prohibited by section 2 ( a ) ( 7 ) of the commodity exchange act , as incorporated in 17 cfr 140.735-2 and 140.735-3 .
