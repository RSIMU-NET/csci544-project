congress annually considers 12 regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that begins on october 1 .

these billsâtogether with other legislative measures providing appropriations known as supplemental and continuing appropriations ( also referred to as continuing resolutions or crs ) âprovide annual appropriations for the agencies , projects , and activities funded therein .

the annual appropriations cycle is often initiated after the president's budget submission .

the house and senate appropriations committees then hold hearings at which agencies provide further information and details about the president's budget .

these hearings may be followed by congressional consideration of a budget resolution establishing a ceiling on overall spending within appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year .

committee and floor consideration of the annual appropriations bills occurs during the spring and summer months and may continue through the fall and winter until annual appropriations actions are completed .

this report discusses fy2019 congressional appropriations actions and the impacts of the statutory budget enforcement framework established in the budget con trol act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l .

112-25 ) and the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l .

115-123 ) .

it includes a chronological discussion and timeline ( figure 1 ) of these actions .

fy2019 appropriations actions were impacted by the bca , which placed statutory limits on spending for fy2012-fy2021 , divided between defense and nondefense .

in addition , the law created procedures that would automatically lower those caps if specified deficit - reducing legislation were not enacted .

congress has adjusted these statutory caps , including through the bipartisan budget acts ( bbas ) of 2013 ( for fy2014 and fy2015 ) , 2015 ( for fy2016 and fy2017 ) , 2018 ( for fy2018 and fy2019 ) , and 2019 ( for fy2020 and fy2021 ) , which provided for spending cap increases in both defense and nondefense categories .

bba 2018 capped fy2019 discretionary spending for defense at $647 billion and for nondefense at $597 billion .

it also provided that in the absence of agreement on a budget resolution for fy2019 , the budget committees in the house and senate could make committee allocations that could function as enforceable limits under section 302 of the congressional budget act .

in may 2018 , the house and senate submitted these filings .

with a "top - line" for fy2019 funding established , the appropriations committees could proceed with consideration of the 12 appropriations bills and provide enforceable 302 ( b ) suballocations for each regular appropriations bill .

the house and senate appropriations committees completed their drafting and consideration of all 12 regular appropriations bills by the end of july 2018 .

in the 115 th congress and prior to the start of fy2019 on october 1 , 2018 , the house passed half of the regular bills ( 6 out of 12 ) , and the senate passed 9 bills ( see table 2 and table 3 ) .

in both chambers , separate regular appropriations bills were combined for floor consideration into consolidated appropriations bills , commonly referred to as "minibuses" ( in contrast to an omnibus bill comprising most or all regular appropriations bills ) .

these appropriations bill groupings were also used for resolving differences between the house and senate through conference committees .

three appropriations bills were combined for initial consideration in the house: energy and water , legislative branch , and military construction and veterans affairs ( h.r .

5895 ) .

the house passed this combined measure on june 8 , 2018 .

the senate subsequently agreed to the combined measure with amendment on june 25 .

a final measure was negotiated in a conference committee .

the senate passed the final measure on september 12 .

the house passed it on september 13 .

it was enacted into law on september 21 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-244 ) .

the house passed the defense appropriations bill ( h.r .

6157 ) on june 28 , 2018 .

the senate added the text of the labor , hhs , and education appropriations bill and passed the combined measure on august 23 , 2018 .

the combined measure was then sent to conference .

the senate passed the final measure on september 18 .

the house passed it on september 26 .

it was enacted into law on september 28 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-245 ) .

in addition , the house passed a measure combining the interior and environment appropriations bill with the financial services appropriations bill ( h.r .

6147 ) on july 19 , 2018 .

the senate added the text of the agriculture appropriations bill and the transportation and hud appropriations bill and passed the combined measure on august 1 , 2018 .

although a conference committee was appointed to negotiate on this measure , it did not report an agreement back to the house and senate .

fy2019 thus began on october 1 , 2018 , with five of the regular appropriations bills enacted .

funding for agencies , projects , and activities covered by the remaining seven regular appropriations bills was provided through december 7 , 2018 , in a cr ( division c of p.l .

115-245 , the same measure that provided funding for defense and labor , hhs , and education ) .

a second cr was enacted on december 7 , extending funding for the remaining seven appropriations bills through december 21 , 2018 ( p.l .

115-298 ) .

in the senate , a third cr for fy2019 ( h.r .

695 ) was passed by voice vote on december 19 , 2018 .

this cr would have extended funding through february 8 , 2019 .

the house subsequently considered and amended it the following day , adding $5.7 billion to the u.s. customs and border protection's "procurement , construction , and improvements" account to remain available until fy2024 , as well as $7.8 billion for disaster relief .

the amended cr passed the house by a vote of 217-185 and was sent back to the senate for further consideration .

on december 21 , the senate agreed to a motion to proceed to the house amendment by a vote of 48-47 , with vice president pence casting the tie - breaking vote .

following the vote , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell stated the following: however , obviously , since any eventual solution requires 60 votes here in the senate , it has been clear from the beginning that two things are necessary: support from enough senate democrats to pass the proposal at 60 and a presidential signature .

as a result , the senate has voted to proceed to legislation before us in order to preserve maximum flexibility for a productive conversation to continue between the white house and our democratic colleagues .

i hope senate democrats will work with the white house on an agreement that can pass both houses of congress and receive the president's signature .

colleagues , when an agreement is reached , it will receive a vote here on the senate floor .

without such an agreement , the senate did not complete action on the house's proposal .

the house and senate adjourned later that day .

when the second crâwhich provided funding for the agencies , programs , and activities covered by the remaining seven fy2019 appropriations billsâexpired at midnight on december 21 , funding lapsed and a partial government shutdown ensued .

while the senate continued consideration of the house amendment on december 22 , december 27 , and january 2 , no further votes on appropriations occurred during the 115 th congress .

the 115 th congress adjourned sine die on january 3 , 2019 , and the 116 th congress took office the same day .

majority control of the house in the 116 th congress changed from the republican party to the democratic party .

in addition , any appropriations measures introduced and only reported or considered in the 115 th congress were no longer pending .

new measures needed to be introduced for the 116 th congress to complete action on fy2019 appropriations .
