the u.s. - peru trade promotion agreement ( ptpa ) is a comprehensive trade agreement that eliminates tariffs and other barriers in goods and services trade between the united states and peru .

on december 7 , 2005 , the united states and peru concluded negotiations on the agreement and , on january 6 , 2006 , president bush notified the congress of his intention to enter into a free trade agreement with peru .

the agreement was signed on april 12 , 2006 by the u.s. trade representative and the peruvian minister of foreign trade and tourism .

on november 8 , 2007 , the house of representatives passed ( 285-132 ) h.r .

3688 to implement the ptpa under the trade promotion authority , which requires an expedited process with limited debate and an up or down vote .

the senate approved ( 77-18 ) legislation on december 4 , 2007 , and president bush signed the implementing bill for the free trade agreement on december 14 , 2007 ( p.l .

110-138 ) .

in peru , the peruvian congress voted 79 to 14 to approve the agreement on june 28 , 2006 .

on january 16 , 2009 , president bush issued a proclamation to implement the u.s. - peru trade promotion agreement as of february 1 , 2009 .

the ptpa negotiations began in may 2004 , when the united states , colombia , peru , and ecuador participated in the first round of negotiations for a u.s. - andean free trade agreement ( fta ) .

after thirteen rounds of talks , however , negotiators failed to reach an agreement .

peru continued negotiations alone with the united states and concluded the bilateral agreement in december 2005 .

implementing legislation for the ptpa was considered by the u.s. congress under title xxi ( bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 ) of the trade act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-210 ) , which requires an expedited process with limited debate and an up or down vote .

trade promotion authority ( tpa ) procedures require the president to submit formally the agreement and implementing legislation to congress after entering into an agreement .

in early 2007 , a number of members of congress indicated that some of the agreement's provisions would have to be strengthened to gain their approval , particularly relating to core labor standards .

after several months of negotiation , congress and the administration reached an agreement on may 10 , 2007 on a new bipartisan trade framework that calls for the inclusion of core labor and environmental standards in the text of pending and future trade agreements .

on june 25 , 2007 , u.s. trade representative susan schwab announced that the united states reached an agreement with peru on a number of legally binding amendments to the ptpa on labor , the environment , and other matters to reflect the bipartisan agreement of may 10 .

on june 27 , 2007 , peru's unicameral congress voted 70 to 38 in favor of the amendments to the ptpa .

several house democratic leaders issued a press release on june 29 , 2007 , stating that the ptpa had potential to improve the standards of living in the united states and peru , and that it reflects "... long - standing democratic priorities with the inclusion of enforceable , internationally recognized labor rights and environmental standards. .

the press release , however , also stated that house democratic leaders expected the peruvian government to change their laws "... so these agreements can come into effect promptly thereafter" , and that house ways and means committee chairman charles rangel would lead a bipartisan delegation of members of congress to peru and panama in august 2007 to consult with the two countries' legislatures and executive branches .

the house ways and means committee chairman charles b. rangel and the house trade subcommittee chairman sander m. levin issued a statement following president bush's proclamation to implement the ptpa as of february 2009 .

the two democratic leaders stated that , while the agreement was a positive step in the development of a new policy to spread the benefits of trade more broadly , the peruvian congress had passed legislation that included provisions "inconsistent with their commitments" .

they stated that they had made it clear to the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) that those issues should be resolved prior to certification of the agreement .

other members of congress issued statements in support of the agreement , stating that it will remove trade barriers and open new markets for u.s. exports in goods and services .

u.s. trade represenative susan c. schwab stated that the bush administration had worked closely with the government of peru to ensure that the obligations and responsibilities of each party had been met under the agreement .

with a population of 29 million people , peru is the fifth most populous country in latin america , after brazil , mexico , colombia , and argentina .

peru's economy is relatively small compared to the u.s. economy ( see table 1 ) .

peru's gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2007 was $107 billion , about 0.8% of u.s. gdp ( $13.8 trillion in 2007 ) .

peru's economy has shown strong growth over the past five years , much of it fueled by strong domestic demand which boosted sectors such as construction and commerce .

real gdp growth was 7.7% in 2006 and 8.9% in 2007 .

estimates for 2008 show a real gdp growth rate of 9.1% , but the economy is expected to slowdown in 2009 with a forecast real gdp growth rate of 3.1% .

peru's exports accounted for 28% of gdp in 2007 , while imports accounted for 22% .

the united states ranks first among peru's export markets , though the share of peru's exports that are headed to the united states has fallen since 2005 .

in 2007 , the united states accounted for 19.0% of peru's exports , down from 23.3% in 2006 and 30.4% in 2005 .

though peru's reliance on the united states as an export market is decreasing , any change in u.s. demand for peruvian products could still have a noticeable effect on peru's economy .

peru's president alan garcía was elected to his second term on june 4 , 2006 .

president garcia took office for a five - year term at the end of july 2006 , replacing outgoing president , alejandro toledo .

in spite of the recent economic growth , over half of peruvians live in poverty and a large portion of the population is underemployed .

unemployment and underemployment levels total 64.5% nationwide .

the economic sector in peru with the highest employment is wholesale / retail trade and repair services , followed by manufacturing .

since taking office , president garcía has taken steps to assure the international financial community that he is running peru as a moderate rather than as the leftist he had been in his early career .

garcía's first presidency ( 1985-1990 ) was marked by hyper - inflation , increased poverty , and a crumbling infrastructure , which were largely caused by his unorthodox economic policies .

by 1990 , the last year of garcía's term , the rate of inflation exceeded 7,500% .

during the 1980s , a violent guerrilla insurgency took place in the country .

in the mid 1980s , the army was given responsibility for counter - insurgency operations , and widespread violations of human rights ensued .

during the regime of former president alberto fujimori ( 1990-2000 ) , the government led a major crackdown on terrorism , and implemented a radical economic reform program to control hyperinflation and bring economic stability to the country .

president fujimori's administration implemented measures to eliminate price controls and state subsidies , liberalize markets , and implement structural reforms .

the program also included a wide - ranging privatization plan and a relaxation of foreign investment restrictions to help increase foreign investment .

existing labor laws were relaxed significantly during this time .

since 2001 , however , peru has made much progress in strengthening labor protections by implementing labor law reform and protecting workers' rights .

president alejandro toledo ( 2001-2006 ) presided over a period in which peru was one of the fastest growing economies in latin america , largely due to growth in the mining and export sectors .

president toledo's administration could be characterized as one marked by public protests and a number of government scandals , but it was also responsible for having a broadly orthodox economic policy which helped control public spending and promote economic growth .

peru's gdp rate of growth increased from 0.2% in 2001 to 8.0% in 2006 .

president garcía has continued the pro - market economic policies of his predecessor , president alejandro toledo .

since initiating his political comeback in 2001 , garcía has softened his populist rhetoric , and apologized for his earlier errors .

he says he is now governing not as a leftist but as a moderate .

hoping to regain credibility with peru's business sector and international financial institutions , he has pledged to maintain orthodox macro - economic policies .

garcía has appointed a fiscal conservative as finance minister and cut the pay of government workers .

he also has sought to reassure poor peruvian citizens that he is addressing their needs by pledging austerity measures such as halving the government palace's annual spending and redirecting the funds to a rural irrigation project .

garcía has embraced the ptpa in his efforts to strengthen the bilateral relationship with the united states and to fight poverty and inequality in peru .

recognizing that a free trade agreement would not be sufficient to eliminate inequality , president garcía has initiated a number of internal reforms that would help spread benefits of free trade to the poorer regions of the country and reduce the level of poverty .

over half of peru's population lives below the poverty line .

poverty is concentrated in rural and jungle areas , and among the indigenous population .

the comprehensive free trade agreement would eliminate tariffs and other barriers to goods and services .

this section summarizes several key provisions in the original agreement text as provided by the united states trade representative ( ustr ) , and the legally binding amendments agreed upon by the united states and peru in june 2007 .

the amendments reflect the bipartisan trade framework that was agreed upon by congress and the bush administration on may 10 , 2007 .

implementing legislation for a ptpa was considered by the u.s. congress under title xxi ( bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 ) of the trade act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-210 ) on an expedited basis that is limited in debate and with no amendments .

gaining passage of a ptpa was a high priority for the government of peru .

peruvian president alan garcía perez met with president bush on at least two occasions to discuss the free trade agreement .

after an april 2007 meeting , president garcía stated that he was in the united states to promote a free trade agreement with the united states .

he said that "it is vital for our country .

it is fundamental to continue this path of growth and social redistribution that we have started in my country. .

the bush administration was a strong supporter of the expansion of free trade with peru and issued a statement in october 2006 that a ptpa would be mutually beneficial "in strengthening bilateral ties while leveling the trade playing field , spurring job creation , and reducing poverty and inequality" .

on july 9 , 2007 , president bush reaffirmed his support for the agreement and called on congress to approve the ptpa by the beginning of august 2007 .

house democratic leaders expressed concerns in 2007 and early in 2009 regarding peru's labor and environmental laws , with particular concern regarding workers rights to freely associate and collectively bargin .

they believe that peru's adoption of new labor laws and regulations in 2008 created loopholes to laws that had been passed by the peruvian government in 2007 to strengthen worker rights .

other members of congress have expressed strong support for the ptpa and for the government of peru in its efforts to strengthen laws and regulations on labor , environment , intellectual property .

they stated that the implementation of the ptpa reflected over fourteen months of work between the u.s. and peruvian governments to improve labor and environmental conditions in peru .

president alan garcía met with members of congress on several occasions to emphasize the importance for peru of strengthening trade relations with the united states in its efforts to fight poverty and strengthen equality among the peruvian people .

president garcía had stated that a considerable share of peru's exports to the united states receives trade preferences under the atpa and , without renewal or passage of a ptpa , many of peru's exports to the united states would have faced higher duties .

atpa supporters maintain that the program has had a positive impact in the region by increasing investor confidence , creating thousands of jobs in alternative sectors , and preventing organized crime .

some peruvian policymakers believe that maintaining confidence in the bilateral trade environment with the united states is key to the long - term stability of the region .

in the united states , a number of groups , such as the afl - cio , public citizen , and american friends service committee generally are skeptical of free trade agreements .

they argue that , among other things , that the ptpa will erode protection for the environment and workers' rights in peru .

in general , such groups argue that ftas tend to protect the rights and profits of multinational corporations and cost the u.s. economy jobs .

public citizen issued a statement after the may 10 bipartisan agreement , saying that bipartisan agreement between congress and the administration did not go far enough in making changes to the ptpa in order to protect the rights of the people and that the ftas with peru and panama would undermine access to essential services in these countries .

according to the statement , the provisions on trade in services and foreign investment would place limits on the ability of the government to regulate essential services such as education , health services , and electric power distribution .

such limitations , according to public citizen , could potentially prevent the distribution of these services throughout the country .

much of the business community in the united states supports a u.s. - peru fta .

the national association of manufacturers ( nam ) , for example , issued statements in support of the ptpa .

after the bush administration's january 2009 proclamation to implement the ptpa , nam issued a statement welcoming the implementation of the agreement .

nam "expressed satisfaction" that the agreement was to go into effect , stating that about 80% of peru's tariffs on u.s. manufactured goods would disappear immediately after implementation and that the rest would follow in phases .

the president of nam stated that nam would ask the commerce department to work with u.s. manufacturers to help u.s. companies take advantage of the newly - opened peruvian market .
