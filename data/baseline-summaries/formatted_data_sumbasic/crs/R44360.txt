the dietary guidelines for americans ( dga ) provides federally developed food - based recommendations for americans two years of age and older , designed to promote health and prevent disease .

as mandated by the 1990 national nutrition monitoring and related research act ( p.l .

101-445 ) , the guidelines are to be reviewed and updated at least every five years by the secretaries of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and agriculture ( usda ) .

the statute requires that the dga be based on a preponderance of scientific and medical knowledge .

this report provides responses to frequently asked questions about the dga , including the dga development process , as well as specific recommendations contained in the 2015-2020 dga .

it remains to be seen how , if at all , the dga development process will change pursuant to the findings of the congressionally mandated nam study .

in addition to any recommendations following nam's mandated study , the 2020-2025 dga will expand to include infants and toddlers from birth to age two , as well as additional guidance for women who are pregnant , as required by the 2014 agricultural appropriations act ( p.l .

113-79 ) .
