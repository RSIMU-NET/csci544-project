the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( h.r .

2764 ) , was passed by the house on december 17 , 2007 , and the senate passed a measure the next day , december 18 , with an amendment ( mcconnell amendment â€” adding funding for the iraq war ) .

the house agreed to the mcconnell amendment on december 19 .

the bill was signed into law ( p.l .

110-161 ) on december 26 .

the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act , 2008 ( milcon - va appropriations act ) , was included as division i of p.l .

110-161 .

under p.l .

110-161 , the total amount of funding for the veterans health administration ( vha ) is $37.2 billion ; of this amount , $2.6 billion was designated as contingent emergency funding and was available for obligation only after the president submitted a budget request to congress .

on january 17 , 2008 , the president transmitted a request to congress designating $2.6 billion as an emergency requirement in accordance with the provisions of p.l .

110-161 .

table 1 provides funding levels for va and vha as included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 .

the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules , including disability compensation and pensions , education , training and rehabilitation services , hospital and medical care , assistance to homeless veterans , home loan guarantees , and death benefits that cover burial expenses .

the va carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals ( bva ) .

the veterans health administration ( vha ) is responsible for health - care services and medical research programs .

the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) is responsible , among other things , for providing compensations , pensions , and education assistance .

the national cemetery administration ( nca ) is responsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries ; providing grants to states for establishing , expanding , or improving state veterans cemeteries ; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons , among other things .

the va's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts .

mandatory funding supports disability compensation , pension benefits , vocational rehabilitation , and life insurance , among other benefits and services .

discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services , including medical care .

in fy2007 , discretionary budget authority accounted for about 48.1% of the total va budget authority of approximately $80 billion , with about 90% of this discretionary funding going toward supporting va health - care programs .

the vha operates the nation's largest integrated direct health - care delivery system .

the va's health - care system is organized into 21 geographically defined veterans integrated service networks ( visns ) .

although policies and guidelines are developed at va headquarters to be applied throughout the va health - care system , management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the visns .

congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to the visns based on the veterans equitable resource allocation ( vera ) system , which generally bases funding on patient workload .

prior to the implementation of the vera system , resources were allocated to facilities primarily on the basis of their historical expenditures .

unlike other federally funded health insurance programs , such as medicare and medicaid , which finance medical care provided through the private sector , the vha provides care directly to veterans .

in fy2007 , the vha operated 155 medical centers , 135 nursing homes , 717 ambulatory care and community - based outpatient clinics ( cbocs ) , and 209 readjustment counseling centers ( vet centers ) .

the vha also pays for care provided to veterans by private - sector providers on a fee basis under certain circumstances .

inpatient and outpatient care is also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the civilian health and medical program of the department of veterans affairs ( champva ) .

in addition , the vha provides grants for construction of state - owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities , and collaborates with the department of defense ( dod ) in sharing health - care resources and services .

during fy2007 , the vha had an estimated total enrolled veteran population of 7.9 million and provided medical care to about 5.2 million unique veteran patients ( see tables 2 and 3 ) .

according to vha estimates , the number of unique veteran patients is estimated to increase by approximately 110,000 , from 5.2 million in fy2007 to 5.3 million in fy2008 .

as shown in table 3 , there would be a 2.4% increase in the total number of unique patients ( both veterans and non - veterans ) , from 5.7 million in fy2007 to 5.8 million in fy2008 .

the total number of outpatient visits , including visits to vet centers , reached 60.2 million during fy2006 and is projected to increase to 64.4 million in fy2007 and 67.4 million in fy2008 .

in fy2007 , the vha estimates that it will spend approximately 64.8% of its medical services obligations on outpatient care .

the vha is funded through multiple appropriations accounts that are supplemented by other sources of revenue .

although the appropriations account structure has been subject to change from year to year , the appropriation accounts used to support the vha traditionally include medical care , medical and prosthetic research , and medical administration .

in addition , congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities through a larger appropriations account for construction for all va facilities .

in fy2004 , "to provide better oversight and [to] receive a more accurate accounting of funds," congress changed the vha's appropriations structure .

the department of veterans affairs and housing and urban development and independent agencies appropriations act , 2004 ( p.l .

108-199 , h.rept .

108-401 ) , funded vha through four accounts: ( 1 ) medical services , ( 2 ) medical administration , ( 3 ) medical facilities , and ( 4 ) medical and prosthetic research .

provided below are brief descriptions of these accounts .

on february 6 , 2006 , the president submitted his fy2007 budget proposal to congress .

the administration requested $32.7 billion for the vha , an 11.3% increase over the fy2006 enacted amount of $29.3 billion and a 10% increase over fy2005 enacted amount of $29.7 billion ( see table 5 and appendix d ) .

the fy2007 request included $25.5 billion for medical services , a 12% increase over the fy2006 enacted amount ; $3.2 billion for medical administration , an 11.2% increase over fy2006 ; $3.6 billion for medical facilities , an 8.2% increase over fy2006 ; and $399 million for medical and prosthetic research , a 3.2% decrease from the fy2006 enacted amount .

 ( for a detailed breakdown of funding levels for the vha for fy2005 and fy2006 , see appendix d ) .

on february 5 , 2007 , the president submitted his fy2008 budget proposal to congress .

the total amount requested by the administration for the vha for fy2008 was $34.6 billion , a 1.93% increase in funding compared with the fy2007 enacted amount .

the total amount of funding that would have been available for the vha under the president's budget proposal for fy2008 , including collections , was approximately $37.0 billion ( see table 5 ) .

for fy2008 , the administration requested $27.2 billion for medical services , a $1.2 billion , or 4.8% , increase in funding over the fy2007 enacted amount .

the administration's budget proposal also requested $3.4 billion for medical administration , $3.6 billion for medical facilities , and $411 million for medical and prosthetic research ( see table 5 ) .

as in fy2003 , fy2004 , fy2005 , fy2006 , and fy2007 , the administration included several cost - sharing proposals .

these legislative proposals are discussed in detail in the " key budget issues " section at the end of this report .

in its fy2008 budget request , the administration has put forward several legislative proposals .

these proposals are similar to previous ones included in the administration's budget requests for fy2003 , fy2004 , fy2005 , fy2006 , and fy2007 and rejected by congress each year .

however , unlike previous budget proposals , revenue from the proposals in the fy2008 budget request would not be deposited in the medical care collections fund ( mccf ) , but would be classified as mandatory receipts to the treasury .

aside from the administration's budget proposals , the house and senate appropriations committees have expressed concern on the long - term cost of providing health care for veterans and the administration's inability to accurately estimate the future cost of providing those services .

the president's fy2008 budget request includes three major policy proposals: assess a tiered annual enrollment fee for all priority 7 and 8 veterans based on the family income of the veteran .

increase pharmaceutical co - payments from $8 to $15 ( for each 30-day prescription ) for all enrolled veterans in priority groups 7 and 8 .

bill veterans receiving treatment for nonservice - connected conditions for the entire co - payment amount .

a detailed description of these budget proposals follows .

the administration is proposing a tiered annual enrollment fee , which is structured to charge $250 for priority 7 and 8 veterans with family incomes from $50,000 to $74,999 ; $500 for those with family incomes from $75,000 to $99,999 ; and $750 for those with family incomes equal to or greater than $100,000 .

the va has estimated that this proposal would contribute more than $138 million to the treasury annually , beginning in fy2009 , and will increase revenue by $526 million over five years .

the milcon - va appropriation act ( p.l .

110-161 ) does not include any bill language that would give the va the authority to impose enrollment fees .

the administration proposes increasing the pharmacy co - payments from $8 to $15 for all enrolled priority group 7 and priority group 8 veterans whenever they obtain medication from the va on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a nonservice - connected condition .

the administration put forward this proposal in its fy2004 , fy2005 , fy2006 , and fy2007 budget requests as well , but did not receive any approval from congress .

at present , veterans in priority groups 2-8 pay $8 for a 30-day supply of medication , including over - the - counter medications .

the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 ( p.l .

101-508 ) authorized the va to charge most veterans $2 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished on an outpatient basis for treatment of a nonservice - connected condition .

the veterans millennium health care and benefits act of 1999 ( p.l .

106-117 ) authorized the va to increase the medication co - payment amount and establish annual caps on the total amount paid , to eliminate financial hardship for veterans enrolled in priority groups 2-6 .

when veterans reach the annual cap , they continue to receive medications without making a co - payment .

on november 15 , 2005 , the vha issued a directive stating that effective january 1 , 2006 , the medication co - payment will be increased to $8 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished on an outpatient basis for treatment of a nonservice - connected condition , and that the annual cap for veterans enrolled in priority groups 2-6 will be $960 .

there is no cap for veterans in priority groups 7 and 8 ( see appendixes b and c ) .

the va estimates that if the current proposal to raise the co - payment were enacted , it would contribute $311 million to the treasury in fy2008 and will increase revenue by $1.6 billion over five years .

the milcon - va appropriation act ( p.l .

110-161 ) does not include any bill language that would give the va the authority to increase co - payments .

according to va estimates , of the 5.8 million unique patients that it expects to see in 2008 , 111,000 may choose not to use the system if an enrollment fee is imposed and the pharmacy copays are increased .

the administration is requesting that congress amend the va's statutory authority by eliminating the practice of reducing first - party co - payment debts with third - party health - insurance collections .

the va asserts that this proposal would align the va with the dod health - care system for military retirees and with the private sector .

with the enactment of p.l .

99-272 in 1986 , congress authorized the va to collect payments from third - party health insurers for the treatment of veterans with nonservice - connected disabilities ; it also established co - payments from veterans for this care .

under current law , the va is authorized to collect from third - party health insurers to offset the cost of medical care furnished to a veteran for the treatment of a nonservice - connected condition .

if the va treats an insured veteran for a nonservice - connected disability , and the veteran is also determined by the va to have co - payment responsibilities , the va will apply the payment collected from the insurer to satisfy the veteran's co - payment debt related to that treatment .

under the current co - payment billing process , in cases where the cost of a veteran's medical care for a nonservice - connected condition appears to qualify for billing under reimbursable insurance and co - payment , the va medical facilities sends the bill to the insurance provider .

the veteran's co - payment obligation is placed on hold for 90 days pending payment from the third - party payer .

if no payment is received from the third - party payer within 90 days , a bill is sent to the veteran for the full co - payment amount .

however , when insurers reimburse the va after the 90-day period , the va must absorb the cost of additional staff time for processing a refund if the veteran has already paid the bill .

on all insurance policies , the entire amount of the claim payment is applied first to the co - payment .

the veteran is then billed only for the portion of the co - payment not covered by the insurance reimbursement and the portion of the co - payment for services not covered by the veteran's insurance plan ( see figure 2 ) .

under the administration's proposal , veterans receiving medical care services for treatment of non - service - connected disabilities will receive a bill for their entire co - payment , and the co - payment will not be reduced by collection recoveries from third - party health plans .

this proposal would apply to all veterans who make co - payments .

according to va estimates , this proposal will increase revenue by $44 million in fy2008 and $217 million over five years .

the house and senate appropriations committees have not addressed this issue because it is an issue in the purview of the authorizing committees .

on february 15 , 2007 , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) testified that "assuming no major changes in policy and no major changes in enrollment trends ... that [vha] medical spending would increase from $35 billion in 2007 to $66 billion in 2025 , or 88 percent cumulative real growth .

that increase implies annual real growth that averages 3.6 percent over the period. .

the house and senate appropriations committees have expressed concern that the president's budget has not accurately projected the future cost of health care for veterans from fy2008-fy2012 .

furthermore , the house appropriations committee expressed doubt in the actuarial model currently used to project health - care demand for operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) veterans .

the house appropriations committee has included a general provision in h.r .

2642 directing the cbo to submit a report projecting the annual funding level necessary for the vha to continue providing health care for veterans from fy2009 through fy2012 .
