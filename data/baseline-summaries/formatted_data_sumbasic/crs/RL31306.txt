on june 28 , 2002 , the billwas reported ( s. 2708 , s.rept .

107-201 ) and placed on the senatecalendar .

on september 4 , 2002 , the senate began consideration of h.r .

5093 , the house funding bill , with the senate version as a substitute amendment .

the senate debated the bill for 10 days , agreeing to a number of amendments , butdiscontinued debate on september 25 , 2002 .

the senate did not pass an interiorfunding bill in the 107th congress .

controversies involving funding for , andmanagement of , wildfires were largely responsible for the protracted debate and lackof a vote on final passage .

there were unsuccessful attempts to invoke cloture on awildland fire amendment offered by sen. byrd ( no .

4480 ) to provide $825 millionin fy2002 emergency funds for firefighting costs .

an amendment by sen. craig ( no .

4518 ) on forest thinning was a major focus of the floor debate , with noresolution .

both fire amendments remained pending when the senate discontinueddebate on the bill .

 ( for more information , see "u.s. forest service" below. ) .

the senate debated other contentious issues .

on september 10 , 2002 , the senate adopted a second degree amendment ( no .

another controversy involved anamendment by sen. dodd ( no .

4522 ) on federal recognition of indian tribes , whichwas tabled .

issues in addition to fire and drought that generated significant discussion during house and / or senate consideration included: stewardship contracting and wildernessin the tongass national forest ( see fs ) ; development in the arctic national wildliferefuge and renewal of grazing permits and leases ( see blm ) ; missouri river flows ( see fws ) ; everglades restoration ; ( see nps and cross - cutting issues ) ; funding forland acquisition and conservation ( see cross - cutting issues ) ; development of oil andgas leases off the california coast ( see mms ) ; and management of the indian tribes'trust funds and assets ( see bia and ost ) .

several issues that have been the focus ofattention in previous years , including funding for the national endowment for thearts and energy conservation and weatherization programs , were not as controversialin this appropriation cycle .

on january 23rd , 2003 , the senate passed h.j.res .

2 , the omnibus appropriations bill for fy2003 that included funding for interior and relatedagencies and the 10 other fy2003 appropriations bills that have not been enacted .

for interior and related agencies , the senate bill contained $18.97 billion forfy2003 , and $825 million for fy2002 to replace monies spent on wildfire fighting,for a bill total of $19.80 billion .

these figures do not reflect across - the - board cutscontained in the omnibus measure , as it is unclear how they would be calculated forthe interior and related agencies bill overall and for particular departments , agencies,and programs in the bill .

specifically , the omnibus bill contained an across - the - boardrescission of 1.6% .

another section of the bill requires an increase to that rescissionby the amount necessary to offset $5 billion in additional education spending .

according to cbo , this amount could generate an additional 1.252% reduction , fora total reduction in the senate - passed bill currently estimated at 2.852% .

the senate omnibus bill , like the house - passed bill of last year , contained more money for doi and related agencies for fy2003 than the administration .

thehouse - passed bill has the highest total amount - - $19.71 billion for fy2003 , plus a $700 million fire supplemental for fy2002 , for a bill total of $20.41 billion .

although the senate - passed bill did not specifically fund the conservation spendingcategory ( table 18 ) , the house bill provides $1.44 billion for fy2003 , higher thanthe administration ( $1.32 billion ) .

the house - passed bill provides higher fundingfor wildland fire fighting in fy2003 than the senate or the administration .

both thehouse and senate proposed increases over fy2002 for the u.s. geological survey,while the administration proposed a sizeable decrease for that agency .

thehouse - passed bill also contained increases over the administration's and senate'slevels for the bureau of land management , national park service , fish and wildlifeservice , forest service , energy department programs , and indian health service .

conferees on h.j.res .

2 were appointed by the senate on january23 , 2003 , and by the house on january 29 , 2003 .

the house - passed version of theinterior bill was contained in h.r .

5093 ( 107th congress ) .

the house and senate agreed to the conference report ( h.rept .

108-10 ) on h.j.res .

2 , the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 , onfebruary 13 , 2003 , providing appropriations for the interior and related agenciesand 10 other regular appropriations measures .

on february 20 , 2003 , presidentgeorge bush signed the measure into law as p.l .

108-7 .

previously , interior andrelated agencies were operating under a series of resolutions that continued fundingat fy2002 levels .

the final appropriation for fy2003 provided $19.08 billion forthe interior and related agencies plus $825.0 million for fire fighting to repaytransferred amounts for fire fighting in fy2002 .

it provided that a 0.65% cut beapplied on a proportionate basis to each account , and to each program , project , andactivity within an account .

the figures in this report do not reflect across - the - boardcuts , as it is unclear how they would be calculated for the interior and relatedagencies .

table 18 .

conservation spending category:interior appropriations ( $ in millions ) a source: house appropriations committee .

a the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ( 2 u.s.c .

901 ( c ) ) as amended established 3 discretionary spending categories: general purpose,highway , and mass transit .

title viii of p.l .

106-291 , the department of theinterior and related agencies appropriations act for fy2001 , established a fourthcategory of discretionary spending - for "conservation. .

that law also identified thespecific activities that would be included within the "conservation spendingcategory. .

the category essentially includes those activities , identified by congress,in particular budget accounts ( or portions thereof ) providing appropriations topreserve and protect lands , habitat , wildlife , and other natural resources ; to providerecreational opportunities ; and for other purposes .

this table presents the current andproposed distribution of these conservation funds .

dashes indicate that the fundingis understood to be zero .

further , several programs in this category have not receivedseparate funding under conservation spending for fy2001-fy2003 .

they includecompetitive grants for indian tribes , fws neotropical migratory birds , fsstewardship incentives program , and national wildlife refuge fund , fws .

in fy2003 , the house , senate , and appropriations law ( p.l .

108-7 ) did not contain calculations of funding for the csc .

the joint explanatory statement of theconference report on the enacted measure stated that no funds in the law are derivedfrom the csc , but that most of the programs previously funded under that categoryare continued in fy2003 .

b the administration is seeking $3.0 million under the doi departmental management ( dm ) line item for the shivaist indian water settlement act of 1999,which authorizes lwcf funds for the paiute tribe in utah .

c subtotals and totals may not add due to rounding .

d $50 million of this total is part of a new cooperative conservation initiative , andthe remaining $150 million would be distributed to states using an allocation formuladeveloped by the administration for the traditional land acquisition and sitedevelopment activities of states .

e for fy2001 , an additional $50 million was appropriated for formula grants whichwere authorized in title ix of the fy2001 commerce appropriations law .

further,the fy2002 enacted amount reflects a rescission of $25.0 million .

f in fy2003 , four additional programs are proposed to be funded from lwcf: fwscooperative endangered species conservation fund ; fws north americanwetlands conservation fund ; fs forest legacy ; and fs forest stewardship .

g funds for fs , forest stewardship were not considered part of the csc in fy2001and fy2002 so funds in those years are not counted in the column totals .

becausethe program is proposed to be included in the csc in fy2003 , the requested levelis included in the column total .

this could tend to exaggerate the difference betweenlevels of csc funding in fy2003 and earlier years .
