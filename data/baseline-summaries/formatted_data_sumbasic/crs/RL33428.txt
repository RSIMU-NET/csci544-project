this report describes the president's fy2007 request for funding for dhs programs and activities , as submitted to congress on february 6 , 2006 .

it compares the enacted fy2006 amounts to the request for fy2007 .

this report also tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the fy2007 dhs appropriations bill , with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts .

however , this report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory funding — such as retirement pay — nor does the report systematically follow any legislation related to the authorization or amendment of dhs programs .

title i covers the general administrative expenses of dhs .

it includes the office of the secretary and executive management ( os&em ) , which is comprised of the immediate office of the secretary and 11 entities that report directly to the secretary ; the office of screening coordination and operations ( osco ) ; the undersecretary for management ( usm ) and its components , such as offices of the chief procurement officer , chief human capital officer , and chief administrative officer ; the office of the chief financial officer ( ocfo ) ; the office of the chief information officer ( cio ) ; analysis and operations office ( aoo ) ; and the office of the inspector general ( oig ) .

table 5 shows title i appropriations for fy2006 and congressional action on the request for fy2007 .

title ii funds security , enforcement , and investigations .

title ii contains the appropriations for the u.s. - visitor and immigrant status indicator ( us - visit ) program , the bureau of customs and border protection ( cbp ) , the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , the us coast guard , and the us secret service .

table 6 shows the fy2006 enacted and fy2007 enacted appropriation for title ii .

the preparedness directorate includes ( among others ) appropriations accounts for the undersecretary for preparedness , state and local programs , emergency management planning grants ( empg ) , the u.s. fire administration and fire assistance grants , and infrastructure protection and information security ( ipis ) .

table 10 provides account - level appropriations detail for title iii .

title iv includes appropriations for u.s .

citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) , the federal law enforcement training center ( fletc ) , the science and technology directorate ( s&t ) , and the domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) .

table 13 provides account - level details of title iv appropriations .

the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget .

the senate budget resolution , s.con.res .

83 was introduced on march 10 , 2006 , and passed the senate on march 16 , 2006 .

s.con.res .

83 , would provide $873 billion in discretionary budget authority for fy2007 .

h.con.res .

376 was introduced and reported on march 31 , 2006 , and passed the house on may 18 , 2006 .

h.con.res .

376 would provide $873 billion in discretionary budget authority for fy2007 .

the anticipated difficulties in resolving the substantial differences between the house - and senate - passed versions of the budget resolution led to both the house and the senate adopting deeming resolutions .

these deeming resolutions set the discretionary spending levels for fy2007 at $873 billion .

there is currently no separate functional category for homeland security in the budget resolution .

however , homeland security budget authority amounts are identified within each major functional category , though these amounts are typically not available until the publication of the committee reports that will be attached to the budget resolution .

hurricane katrina reallocations and rescissions division b , title i , chapter 4 , of p.l .

109-148 provides emergency supplemental appropriations to various dhs accounts to address the impacts of hurricane katrina .

on october 28 , 2005 , the president submitted a request to congress to reallocate $17.1 billion of the $60 billion previously appropriated by congress to fema's disaster relief fund ( drf ) to respond to hurricanes katrina , rita , wilma , and other disasters .

the congressional response to this request was included in title i of division b of p.l .

109-148 ; the rescissions ( from dhs accounts ) funding this request were included in title iii of division b of p.l .

109-148 .

109-62 , see supplemental funds for hurricane katrina below ) from fema's disaster relief account to the "disaster assistance direct loan program account" to carry out the direct loan program .

additional border security funding during the conference consideration of h.r .

2863 , two other divisions , c and d , were inserted into the conference report ( h.rept .

109-359 ) attached to the bill .

division c , the american energy independence and security act of 2005 , would have allowed oil well drilling in alaska's national wildlife refuge ( anwr ) .

division d contained provisions that would have distributed the revenues from the anwr drilling .

among the items that would have been funded with these revenues was more than $1 billion in additional border security funding for dhs .

17 after a contentious floor debate concerning the attachment of the anwr provisions to the defense appropriations bill , both divisions c and d were removed from the bill by s.con.res .

74 , the enrollment correction measure , and are not included in p.l .

109-148 .

appendix b. dhs appropriations in context federal - wide homeland security funding since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts .

the office of management and budget , as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act , has published an annual report to congress on combating terrorism .

beginning with the june 24 , 2002 edition of this report , homeland security was included as a part of the analysis .

in subsequent years , this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined , as distinctions ( and account lines ) between homeland and non - homeland security activities have become more precise .

this means that while table b - 1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons , they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis , as outlined above .

with regard to dhs funding , it is important to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts .

in fact , while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within dhs , the dhs homeland security request for fy2007 accounts for approximately 48% of total federal funding for homeland security .

the department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 29% of all federal spending on homeland security .

the department of health and human services at 7.8% , the department of justice at 5.6% and the department of energy at 2.9% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security .

these five agencies collectively account for nearly 93% of all federal spending on homeland security .

it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities .

the legacy agencies that became a part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related .

therefore , while the fy2007 requests included a total homeland security budget authority of $27.7 billion for dhs , the requested total gross budget authority was $39.8 billion .

the same is true of the other agencies listed in the table .
