appendix c. dhs appropriations in context federal - wide homeland security funding since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts .

the office of management and budget , as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act , has published an annual report to congress on combating terrorism .

beginning with the june 24 , 2002 edition of this report , homeland security was included as a part of the analysis .

in subsequent years , this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined , as distinctions ( and account lines ) between homeland and non - homeland security activities have become more precise .

this means that while table c - 1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons , they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis , as outlined above .

with regard to dhs funding , it is important to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts .

in fact , while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within dhs , the dhs homeland security request for fy2008 accounts for approximately 49% of total federal funding for homeland security .

the department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 29% of all federal spending on homeland security .

the department of health and human services at 7.2% , the department of justice at 5.5% and the department of energy at 3.0% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security .

these five agencies collectively account for nearly 94% of all federal spending on homeland security .

it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities .

the legacy agencies that became a part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related .

therefore , while the fy2008 request included total homeland security budget authority of $29.7 billion for dhs , the requested total gross budget authority was $43.0 billion .

the same is true of the other agencies listed in the table .
