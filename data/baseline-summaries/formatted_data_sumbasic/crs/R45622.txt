under the appointments clause of the constitution , the president and the senate share responsibility for making appointments to the supreme court , as well as to various lower courts of the federal judiciary .

while the president nominates persons to fill federal judgeships , the appointment of each nominee also requires senate confirmation .

historically , the vast majority of appointments to federal judgeships ( other than to the supreme court ) have typically not involved much public disagreement between the president and the senate or between the parties within the senate .

debate in the senate over particular lower court nominees , or over the lower court appointment process itself , was uncommon .

typically , such nominations were both reported out of the judiciary committee and confirmed by the senate without any recorded opposition .

in recent decades , however , appointments to two kinds of lower federal courts — the u.s. circuit courts of appeals and the u.s. district courts — have often been the focus of heightened senate interest and debate , as has the process itself for appointing judges to these courts .

given congressional interest in the subject , this report provides statistics and analysis related to the nomination and confirmation of u.s. circuit and district court judges from 1977 ( the beginning of the carter presidency ) through 2018 ( the second year of the trump presidency ) .

the report's exclusive focus are the u.s. circuit courts of appeals and u.s. district courts .

excluded from the scope of the report are the u.s. supreme court ; the u.s. court of international trade ; the u.s. court of federal claims ; and territorial district courts ( eg , the district court of guam ) .

opportunities for a president to make circuit and district court appointments arise when judgeships are vacant or are scheduled to become vacant .

various factors influence the number of such opportunities a president will have during his tenure in office , including the frequency with which judicial departures occur ; whether any new judgeships are statutorily created by congress ( which consequently provide a president with the opportunity to nominate individuals to the new judgeships ) ; the number of judicial nominations submitted by a president ; and the speed by which the senate considers such nominations .

table 1 reports the percentage of u.s. circuit and district court judgeships that were vacant on january 1 immediately prior to the beginning of each new congress and four - year presidential term from 1977 through 2017 .

overall , during this period , the median percentage of circuit court judgeships that were vacant immediately prior to the start of a new congress was 8.9% .

the median percentage of district court judgeships that were vacant immediately prior to the start of a new congress was 7.2% .

as shown by the table , the percentage of u.s. circuit judgeships that were vacant was highest at the beginning of the 96 th congress , 28.8% , and lowest at the beginning of the 98 th congress , 3.5% .

the percentage of u.s. district court judgeships that were vacant was also highest at the beginning of the 96 th congress , 24.7% , and lowest at the beginning of the 109 th congress , 3.1% .

the percentage of judgeships that are vacant at the beginning of a presidency is influenced , in part , by the extent to which the preceding president's nominees were approved by the senate during the final year or two of his term .

for example , most recently , at the beginning of the trump presidency , the percentage of u.s. district court judgeships that were vacant was 12.8% .

this was due , in part , to the comparatively small number of district court nominations confirmed by the senate during the final two years of the obama presidency .

various factors influence the number and percentage of judicial nominees confirmed during any given presidency or congress .

these factors include , but are not limited to , the frequency with which judges depart the bench ; the speed with which a presidential administration vets and selects nominees for vacant judgeships ; whether a president is of the same political party as the majority party in the senate ; whether a congressional session coincides with a presidential election year ; and the point in a congressional session when nominations arrive in the senate .

over the last several presidencies , it has become increasingly common for a president to nominate an individual two or more times to a u.s. circuit or district court judgeship prior to final action on the nomination by the senate ( irrespective of whether the senate ultimately approved the nomination ) .

consequently , the percentage of nominees confirmed during a presidency who were nominated two or more times prior to being approved by the senate has also increased in recent years .

 table 6 provides data related to the number of u.s. circuit and district court nominees whose nominations were returned by the senate to the president at the end of each congress , from the 95 th through the 115 th .

the table also indicates how many of these nominees had been given a hearing ( or not ) by the judiciary committee as well as how many had their nominations reported by the committee and pending on the executive calendar prior to being returned to the president .

for a congress that did not coincide with the last two years of a presidency , it was not uncommon for a nominee whose nomination was returned at the end of it to be resubmitted during a subsequent congress and eventually be approved by the senate .

for a congress , however , that did coincide with the last two years of a presidency , a nominee whose nomination was returned at the end of it was not confirmed by the senate .

this section provides , for nominees confirmed by the senate from 1977 through 2018 , the median number of days from nomination to confirmation by presidency and by congress .

in general , the length of time from when a president nominates an individual to a vacant circuit or district court judgeship to when the senate approves that nomination has steadily increased , for most nominees , since 1977 .

in addition to the general increase in the length of time of the confirmation process itself , an individual nominee might experience a relatively longer period of time from nomination to confirmation due to opposition to the nomination by the nonpresidential party in the senate ; committee and floor scheduling decisions unrelated to partisan opposition to the nomination ; and delays in receiving requested background information from the nominee .

the president customarily transmits a circuit or district court nomination to the senate in the form of a written nomination message .

once received , the nomination is numbered by the senate executive clerk , read on the floor , and then immediately referred to the judiciary committee .

the judiciary committee's processing of the nomination typically consists of three phases — a prehearing phase , the holding of a hearing on the nomination , and voting on whether to report the nomination to the senate .

during a hearing on the nomination , lower court nominees engage in a question - and - answer session with members of the senate judiciary committee .

the hearing typically is held for more than one judicial nominee at a time .

from 1977 through 2018 , the median length of time from when an individual was first nominated to a circuit court judgeship to when he or she received a hearing by the judiciary committee was 63.0 days ( or 2.1 months ) .

during this same period , the median length of time from when an individual was nominated to a district court judgeship to when he or she received a hearing was also 63.0 days .

as shown in table 9 , the median length of time from nomination to committee hearing for circuit and district court nominees has , however , varied across presidencies .

for individuals nominated during more recent presidencies , the length of time from nomination to committee hearing has been relatively longer than the median for all nominees from 1977 through 2018 .

the median number of days from nomination to committee hearing for u.s. circuit court nominees ranged from a low of 23.0 days ( during the reagan presidency ) to a high of 154.0 days ( during the george w. bush presidency ) .

for the first two years of the trump presidency , the median number of days from nomination to hearing for u.s. circuit court nominees was 69.0 days .

the median number of days from nomination to committee hearing for u.s. district court nominees ranged from a low of 22.0 days ( during the reagan presidency ) to a high of 87.5 days ( during the george w. bush presidency ) .

for the first two years of the trump presidency , the median number of days from nomination to hearing for u.s. district court nominees was 77.0 days .

after a nominee receives a hearing by the judiciary committee , she awaits a vote by the committee on whether her nomination will be reported to the senate as a whole .

if the nomination is not put to the committee for a vote , or if the committee votes against reporting it ( i.e. , rejects the nomination ) , the nomination will not move forward , ultimately failing to receive senate confirmation .

the committee , in reporting a nomination to the senate as a whole , has three options — to report a nomination favorably , unfavorably , or without recommendation .

almost always , when the committee votes on a nomination , it votes to report favorably .

the committee , however , may vote ( as it has done in the past , but only on rare occasions ) to report unfavorably or without recommendation .

such a vote advances the nomination for senate consideration despite the lack of majority support for it in committee .

after it is reported by the judiciary committee , a circuit or district court nomination is listed on the executive calendar and is eligible for floor consideration .

the nominees who are included in this part of the analysis all had their nominations reported by the judiciary committee ( i.e. , their nominations advanced to the full senate for consideration ) and were confirmed by the senate .

from 1977 through 2018 , the median length of time from when an individual who was nominated to a circuit court judgeship had his nomination reported by the judiciary committee to when he was confirmed by the senate was 9.0 days .

during this same period , the median length of time from when a district court nominee had his nomination reported to when he was confirmed was 8.0 days .

there was , however , variation during this period across presidencies in how long circuit and district court nominees waited to be confirmed once their nominations were reported by the judiciary committee — with nominees during more recent presidencies waiting longer to be confirmed once their nominations were reported by the committee .

as shown by table 10 , for completed presidencies , the median number of days from committee report to confirmation for u.s. circuit court nominees ranged from a low of 1.0 day ( during the george h. w. bush presidency ) to a high of 98.0 days ( during the obama presidency ) .

for the first two years of the trump presidency , the median number of days from committee report to confirmation was 26.0 days .

for completed presidencies , the median number of days from committee report to confirmation for u.s. district court nominees ranged from a low of 1.0 day ( during the george h. w. bush presidency ) to a high of 84.0 days ( during the obama presidency ) .

for the first two years of the trump presidency , the median number of days from committee report to confirmation for u.s. district court nominees was 133.0 days .

since 1953 , every presidential administration , except those of george w. bush and donald trump , has sought prenomination evaluations of its candidates for district and circuit court judgeships by the american bar association ( aba ) .

the committee that performs this evaluation , the aba's standing committee on the federal judiciary , is made up of 15 lawyers with various professional experiences .

the stated objective of the committee is to assist the white house in assessing whether prospective judicial nominees should be nominated .

it seeks to do so by providing what it describes as an "impartial peer - review evaluation" of each candidate's professional qualifications .

this evaluation , according to the committee , focuses strictly on a candidate's "integrity , professional competence and judicial temperament" and does not take into account the candidate's "philosophy , political affiliation or ideology. .

in evaluating professional competence , the committee assesses the prospective nominee's "intellectual capacity , judgment , writing and analytical abilities , knowledge of the law , and breadth of professional experience. .

following the multistep evaluation process by the committee , a nominee is given an official rating of "well qualified," "qualified," or "not qualified. .

a rating is provided strictly on an advisory basis ; it is solely in the president's discretion as to how much weight to place on a judicial candidate's aba rating in deciding whether to nominate him or her .

as shown by table 11 , there is some variation across presidencies in the percentage of confirmed u.s. circuit and district court nominees who received a particular rating by the aba .

for u.s. circuit court nominees for completed presidencies , the percentage who received a well qualified rating ranged from a low of 56.6% during the reagan presidency to a high of 80.0% during the obama presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 80.0% of confirmed circuit court nominees also received a well qualified rating .

none of the completed presidencies listed in the table had any confirmed circuit court nominees who were rated as not qualified by the aba .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , two circuit court nominees were rated as not qualified ( comprising 6.7% of the circuit court nominees confirmed during this period ) .

for confirmed u.s. district court nominees , the percentage who received a well qualified rating ranged from a low of 51.0% during the carter presidency to a high of 69.3% during the george w. bush presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 62.3% of confirmed district court nominees received a well qualified rating .

for completed presidencies during which at least one confirmed district court nominee was rated as not qualified , the percentage of nominees who received such a rating ranged from a high of 1.5% of all confirmed nominees during the carter and george w. bush presidencies to a low of 1.3% of such nominees during the clinton presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 3.8% of confirmed district court nominees received a rating of not qualified .

the senate may confirm nominations by unanimous consent , voice vote , or by recorded roll call vote .

when the question of whether to confirm a nomination is put to the senate , a roll call vote will be taken on the nomination if the senate has ordered "the yeas and nays. .

the support of 11 senators is necessary to order the roll call .

historically , the senate confirmed most u.s. circuit and district court nominations by unanimous consent or by voice vote .

as shown by figure 4 , however , using roll call votes to confirm nominees has become much more common during recent presidencies .

a relatively small percentage of circuit court nominees were confirmed by roll call vote during the carter , reagan , and george h. w. bush presidencies .

specifically , 7.1% , 6.0% , and 2.4% of circuit court nominees were confirmed by roll call during each of these three presidencies , respectively .

additionally , only one district court nominee was confirmed by roll call vote during each of the carter and reagan presidencies , and no district court nominees were confirmed by roll call vote during george h. w. bush's presidency .

confirmation by roll call vote became more common during the clinton presidency , with nearly one - quarter , 24.6% , of circuit court nominees and 10.5% of district court nominees receiving roll call votes at the time of senate confirmation .

it was not , however , until the george w. bush presidency that a majority of lower court nominees were approved using roll call votes , with 80.3% of circuit court nominees and 54.0% of district court nominees confirmed in this way .

this trend continued under president obama , with 89.1% of circuit court nominees and 64.6% of district court nominees being confirmed by roll call vote .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , all u.s. circuit court nominees were confirmed using roll call votes , representing an increase from recent years in the frequency of using roll call votes to confirm circuit court nominees .

in contrast , 50.9% of district court nominees were confirmed by roll call vote , representing a decrease from recent years in the frequency of using roll call votes to confirm district court nominees .

this section provides data related to the gender and race of u.s. circuit and district court nominees confirmed by the senate during each presidency since the carter administration .

these particular demographic characteristics of judicial nominees are of ongoing interest to congress .

such interest is demonstrated especially at the time circuit and district court nominations are considered by the senate .

for example , floor statements by senators in support of circuit or district court nominees frequently emphasize the particular demographic characteristics of nominees who would enhance the diversity of the federal judiciary .

as shown by figure 6 , for completed presidencies , the percentage of confirmed u.s. circuit court nominees who were women ranged from a low of 7.2% during the reagan presidency to a high of 43.6% during the obama presidency .

for district court nominees , the percentage of confirmed nominees who were women ranged from a low of 8.3% during the reagan presidency to a high of 41.0% during the obama presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 20.0% of confirmed u.s. circuit court nominees were women , while 26.4% of confirmed district court nominees were women .

 figure 7 shows the percentage of each president's confirmed u.s. circuit and district court nominees who were african american , asian american , hispanic , and white .

for completed presidencies , the percentage of confirmed u.s. circuit court nominees who were african american ranged from a low of 1.2% during the reagan presidency to a high of 16.4% during the obama presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , no confirmed circuit court nominees were african american .

for completed presidencies , the percentage of confirmed u.s. district court nominees who were african american ranged from a low of 2.1% during the reagan presidency to a high of 18.7% during the obama presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 1.9% of confirmed district court nominees were african american .

for completed presidencies , there were no asian american circuit court judges appointed during the reagan , george h. w. bush , or george w. bush presidencies .

the greatest percentage was appointed during the obama presidency ( 7.3% ) .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 10.0% of confirmed circuit court nominees were asian american .

for past presidencies , there were no asian american district court judges appointed during the george h. w. bush presidency .

the greatest percentage was appointed during the obama presidency ( 5.2% ) .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 3.8% of confirmed district court nominees were asian american .

for completed presidencies , the percentage of confirmed u.s. circuit court nominees who were hispanic ranged from a low of 1.2% during the reagan presidency to a high of 10.9% during the obama presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , no confirmed circuit court nominees were hispanic .

for completed presidencies , the percentage of confirmed u.s. district court nominees who were hispanic ranged from a low of 4.1% during the george h. w. bush presidency to a high of 10.3% during the george w. bush presidency .

during the first two years of the trump presidency , 1.9% of confirmed district court nominees were hispanic .
