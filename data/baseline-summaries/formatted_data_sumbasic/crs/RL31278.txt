from alaska's prudhoe bay eastward 200 miles to the canadian border is an area of uniquenatural wealth .

an area teeming with wildlife , it has been called the "serengeti of the arctic. .

theeastern part of the region also contains one of america's best remaining onshore oil prospects,beneath the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge ( anwr ) .

 ( see figure 1. ) .

this remote and largely untouched area is an example of an arctic ecosystem that , by virtue of being essentially intact , is increasingly rare .

it is an important habitat for musk oxen , migratorywaterfowl , vast numbers of caribou , and predators such as grizzly bears , polar bears , wolves , andgolden eagles .

moreover , the coastal plain is immensely promising for oil and natural gas , possibly on the scale of prudhoe bay's resources .

its development could help reduce america's energy dependenceto some degree and keep the alaska pipeline in use for decades - - benefitting the national economy,the oil industry , and people in alaska .

the debate over whether to open the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge ( anwr ) to energy leasing has raged for decades , with the main periods of controversy occurringin the late 1950s before the refuge was established ; the period 1977-1980 at the passage of thealaska national interest lands conservation act ; 1987 when the final legislative environmentalimpact statement ( fleis ) was released ; the early 1990s during the persian gulf war ; and the currentdebate , which began months before the attacks on new york and washington , but was certainlyheated by those events .

the purpose of this report is to collect the background information and new developments that have arisen since the 1987 fleis , and to discuss the possibilities and implications of emergingapproaches to development .

the report does not focus on any particular legislation .

 ( 2 ) rather , itprovides background and basic material for analyzing proposals and ideas about developing or notdeveloping the 1002 area .

physically , what is called the north slope of alaska consists of those landsnorth of the brooks range where waters drain into the beaufort and chukchi seas .

its area exceeds 100,000 square miles ( 64,000,000 acres ) , and includes the northernside of the mountains , foothills , and a relatively flat coast plain .

the western part ofthe north slope is very broad , with the crest of the brooks range being as much as250 miles from the coast .

the eastern part of the north slope , which includes partof the refuge , is relatively narrow , with the crest of the range lying as little as 30miles from the coast .

 ( see figures 1 and 2. ) .

the foothills of the brooks range merge gradually into the coastal plain of the north slope .

the western portion of the plain is extremely flat , and much of it iscovered in small lakes .

in the narrower eastern coastal plain , the topography issufficiently rolling that lakes are much less common in the refuge .

lying north of the arctic circle , darkness and extreme cold prevail much of the year .

the area is underlain by permafrost - - a permanently frozen layer 1,000 to2,000 feet thick .

during the brief summer , about 3 feet of soil thaws , supportinglichens , mosses , grasses , forbs , and other low shrubby plants that make up the tundra .

although precipitation is low , flat areas become wetlands in summer .

most streamsand rivers are frozen in winter , flood in spring breakup , and meander in braidedchannels of gravel until freeze - up .

because the 1002 area has more topographicrelief , its drainage is better established , and its vegetation is more woody than thewetland grasses that dominate prudhoe bay and other developed areas .

foothills andthe hilly portions constitute 45% and 22% , respectively , of the anwr coastal plain .

the foothills reach 1,250 ft , while the hills are mostly less than 100 ft above theirsurroundings ( fleis , p. 18-19 ) .

however , conditions on the north slope have changed somewhat since the fleis was prepared in 1987 .

in recent decades , the climate of the north slope , likethat of most of the area north of the arctic circle , has been warming , particularlyduring winter .

 ( 5 ) the warming has generally resultedin earlier greening of vegetationin the spring and later die - back in the fall .

 ( in 2000 and 2001 , spring snowmeltbucked this longer trend and was unusually late. ) .

arctic natives , basing their claimson traditional knowledge , have reported decreasing predictability of weather patterns,more dangerous snow and ocean ice conditions , the appearance of insects and birdsnew to the area , and similar phenomena .

 ( 6 ) .

a chronology of the refuge's history might begin in 1956 , with the visit tonortheastern alaska by naturalists olaus and margaret murie , who reported the vastmigrating herd of caribou that winter in the united states and canada around theporcupine river .

upon their return , the muries worked with other scientists to setaside the area to protect the caribou herd and the whole relatively intact arcticecosystem of which they were a central part .

however , the first group actually topropose that the area become a national wildlife range , in recognition of the manygame species found in the area , was the tanana valley ( alaska ) sportsmen'sassociation .

 ( 7 ) the following is a description , inchronological order , of major eventsconcerning the refuge , and related energy development in northern alaska since the1950s .

in 1967 , oil was discovered on the north slope of alaska at prudhoe bay , about60 miles west of anwr .

 ( see figure 2 . ) .

since that time , developments followingfrom that discovery have affected the economics , potential support facilities , andunderstanding of proposed development of the refuge .

this section provides a shorthistory of related energy development on the north slope and describes how thatdevelopment has influenced the anwr debate .

as the years have passed , new fields in the area have been discovered , developed , and produced .

as production at the original giant field rose to a peak andthen fell again , additional fields have been brought on - line , though this has notreversed a long term decline in north slope production .

there are five phases of oil development on federal lands: the leasing process,exploration , development , production , and reclamation .

if economic quantities of oilare not found , only three phases - - leasing , exploration and reclamation - - wouldoccur .

in a large area with numerous tracts , all of these phases could be occurringsimultaneously: exploration in some fields , development in others and production instill other fields .

exploration specialists might move from prospect to prospect forseveral years , followed by construction and other workers carrying out developmentwhere discoveries occurred , and so on .

the following section describes these fivephases .

 ( 27 ) where newer technologies are used , they may reduce not only environmental damage or risk , but also costs .

cost - effective technologies would likely be usedwhether specified in legislation or not .

where savings are less likely , legislationcould be required to ensure use of advanced technologies or to ensure environmentalstandards ( with the latter perhaps driving development of still newer technologies ) .

however , any federal requirements to use advanced or environmentally friendlytechnology may not necessarily apply to native lands unless congress explicitlyapplies them .

 ( see crs report rl31115 , legal issues related to proposed drillingfor oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge . ) .

while much is still unknown regarding both the biological and geologicalresources of the 1002 area , much has also been learned during 40 years of debateover the refuge .

among the areas with improved information are estimates of theoil and gas potential of the area and the ecology of several of the species that frequentthe area .
