t his report provides an overview of economic and fiscal conditions in the u.s. virgin islands ( usvi ) .

the political status of the u.s. virgin islands and responses to hurricanes irma and maria are not covered in depth here .

fiscal and economic challenges facing the usvi government raise several issues for congress .

first , congress may choose to maintain oversight of federal policies that could affect the usvi's long - term fiscal stability .

second , congress may consider further legislation that would extend or restructure long - range disaster assistance programs to mitigate those challenges and promote greater resiliency of infrastructure and public programs .

federal responses to the usvi's fiscal distress could conceivably affect municipal debt markets more broadly .

the u.s. virgin islands are located about 45 miles east of puerto rico and about 1,000 miles southeast of miami , florida .

the three larger islandsâst .

croix , st. thomas , and st. johnâare home to nearly all of the roughly 105,000 people living in the u.s. virgin islands .

the usvi capital , charlotte amalie , is located on st. thomas , which is the primary center for tourism , government , finance , trade , and commerce .

the virgin islands national park covers about two - thirds of the island of st. john , which is located to the east of st. thomas .

st. croixâsituated approximately 40 miles south of st. thomas and st. johnâis the agricultural and manufacturing center of the usvi .

the u.s. virgin islands also includes a fourth smaller islandâwater islandâas well as many other smaller islands and cays .

the british virgin islands ( bvi ) are , by and large , east and slightly north of the u.s. virgin islands .

the southern shore of tortola , the largest island in bvi , is less than two miles north of the northern shore of st. john , usvi .

on his second voyage to the caribbean in november 1493 , admiral christopher columbus and his crew reached the archipelago of the lesser antillesâthe string of islands ranging southeast from puerto rico .

as his ships sailed northwest toward puerto rico , they encountered one larger island , which columbus named santa ursula , and saw to the north what they thought were at least 40-odd other islands , which were called "las once mil vã­rgenes. .

santa ursula , now known as st. croix , was described as "very high ground , most of which was bare , the likes of which no one had seen before or after. .

over time those islands became known as the virgin islands .

in the decades following columbus's voyages , the spanish crown had nearly sole control over all trade and navigation in the caribbean .

by the mid - 1500s , merchants and privateers from france , england , and holland moved into the region to trade with colonists who chafed at the high prices and narrow restrictions of spanish imperial rules .

spanish galleons returning to spain with goods and gold provided an additional motivation to privateers and pirates .

the spanish shifted much of their settlements and operations to the south american mainland and to the larger caribbean islands , where resources were easier to exploit and defenses were easier to mount .

the smaller islands to the east in the lesser antilles were thus largely left to others .

control of many of those islands , including the virgin islands , shifted back and forth among european powers , as peace treaties settled in europe seldom applied in the new world .

in 1672 , the royal danish west indian company ( det kongelige octroyerede danske vestindiske compagnie ) took control of st. thomas and set up plantations .

the company expanded to st. john ( then st. jan ) in 1718 and then purchased st. croix from france in 1733 .

sugar production and export was the primary economic sector during the period of danish colonial control , although cotton , tobacco , indigo , and other products were also exported .

in 1754 , the king of denmark established a free trading policy , which encouraged commercial activity on st. thomas , sidestepping restrictions imposed by the main european powers of the time .

economic conditions on those islands , however , slowed in the 1830s , and a slave revolt in 1848 led to the abolition of slavery .

after 1848 , the virgin islands' economy slowed for a combination of reasons .

other caribbean ports attracted more trade , steam - powered ships traveled more directly between north america and europe , and the expansion of beet sugar production in europe , russia , and north america led to lower prices for the cane sugar industry .

in 1867 , secretary of state william seward reached an agreement with denmark to buy the islands .

the senate , however , declined to ratify the treaty .

after other unsuccessful attempts in the first decade of the 20 th century , the u.s. government purchased the islands from denmark in 1917 , after a set of negotiations prompted by concerns that germany might use the islands to attack american shipping .

the u.s. government assumed control of the islands on march 31 , 1917 , just a week before the united states entered world war i .

while the united states acquired the islands for strategic reasons , the islands have not generally served a strategic purpose beyond keeping them out of the control of potentially hostile powers .

naval officers administered the islands after the united states took possession and made important improvements in public health , water supply , education , and social services .

efforts to advance economic development were less successful .

in 1931 , governance responsibilities were transferred to the u.s. department of the interior .

in the 1930s , civilian administrators soughtâlargely unsuccessfullyâto revive sugar production and convert failing plantations into smallholder homesteads .

the diversion of labor to military projects during world war ii led to further declines in agricultural production .

after the end of prohibition in 1933 , however , rum distilling became a growing source of manufacturing employment , and taxes on rum have been an important revenue source .

other types of manufacturing once employed significant numbers , but have declined in recent years .

several watch assembly plants started up in 1959 , but the last one closed in 2015 .

a large bauxite processing plant was built on st. croix in the early 1960s , but closed in 2000 after several ownership changes .

near that site , hess oil partnered with a venezuelan oil company to build a major oil refinery .

that refinery , known as hovensa , for a time was one of the largest in the world , but closed in 2012 .

early efforts in the 1950s to promote tourism were another success , especially after the closing of cuba to american tourism after the 1959 cuban revolution .

tourism remains the major employer and economic activity in the u.s. virgin islands .

the revised organic act of 1954 ( p.l .

83-517 ) included a provision to rebate , or "cover over," federal excise taxes on goods produced in the virgin islands to the island's government .

the cover over of federal taxes on rum has been an especially important revenue source .

typical incomes in the usvi are lower than on the u.s. mainland and poverty rates are higher .

median household income in the usvi in 2009 , according to the u.s. census bureau , was $37,254 , about 75% of the mainland estimate of $50,221 .

demographic and economic data for u.s. territories are typically less extensive and reported less frequently than for states .

table 1 compares the distribution of household incomes in 2009 for the usvi with the u.s. total .

the distribution of household income levels in the usvi is skewed toward lower income brackets compared to u.s. totals .

for example , 13.5% of usvi households had incomes below $10,000 in 2009 , as compared to 7.8% for the u.s. total .

gross domestic product ( gdp ) per capita provides another measure of economy activity .

gdp is defined as the value of goods and services produced in a given area during a year .

while income produced in an area that is repatriated elsewhere is included in gdp , it is excluded from gross national product ( gnp ) , which reflects incomes of area residents .

for areas where flows of repatriated earnings are large , gdp may be a flawed measure of local incomes .

data on such flows of repatriated earnings , which may result from tax avoidance or minimization strategies , are difficult to obtain .

the european union added the usvi to a list of "non - cooperative tax jurisdictions" in march 2018 .

the european council , a body consisting of eu heads of government and senior eu officials , stated that jurisdictions added to the list "failed to make commitments at a high political level in response to all of the eu's concerns. .

the usvi government called that decision "unjustified. .

in october 2019 , the european council declined to remove the usvi from the list of noncooperative tax jurisdictions .

with those caveats regarding gdp in mind , figure 1 presents trends in per capita gdp from 2004 through 2015 .

florida and louisiana , which have both been affected by major hurricanes in that time period , are included for comparison .

while usvi per capita gdp did not fall during the 2007-2009 great recession , it did drop sharply after the demise of the hovensa refinery .

in recent years , tourism and related trade has been the predominant component of the economy of the virgin islands .

in years before hurricanes irma and maria , about 1.2 million cruise passengers and about 400,000 airplane passengers arrived each year .

virgin islands tourist destinations compete with many other caribbean destinations .

much of the growth in caribbean tourism has taken place in all - inclusive resorts that rely on low - wage labor , such as in the dominican republic .

many hotels and resorts were seriously damaged or destroyed in the september 2017 hurricanes .

employment and tourist arrival data , discussed below , suggest the tourism sector has started to rebound , although that process could take years to complete .

manufacturing , which had played a major role in the virgin islands since the 1960s , now plays a minor economic role aside from two rum distilleries , which enjoy extensive public subsidies .

slightly more than 600 people were employed in manufacturing in 2015 , mostly in small firms .

the cruzan distillery , which has a capacity to produce about 9 million proof gallons per year , claims a presence in the virgin islands since the mid - 18 th century .

cruzan was sold to fortune brands in 2008 , after several changes in ownership .

the diageo distillery , which can produce some 20 million proof gallons per year , was built as part of a 2008 agreement with the territorial government .

diageo is a british multinational corporation specializing in the marketing of alcoholic beverages , which previously operated a distillery in puerto rico .

a separate agreement between cruzan and the usvi government was negotiated in 2009 .

in 2012 , the usvi government agreed to modify the cruzan agreement to increase subsidies , subject to set sales and marketing expense benchmarks .

the agreements with the virgin islands government and diageo and fortune brands included an estimated $3.7 billion in subsidies and tax exemptions over 30 years , provided through proceeds of bonds that securitized "cover - over" excise taxes on rum sales rebated from the u.s. government and local tax abatements .

the agreements also committed the usvi government to provide ongoing production and marketing subsidies paid from cover - over revenues .

the agreement bars the usvi government from seeking reductions in rum subsidies .

as noted above , federal excise taxes on rum imported into the united states from the usvi and puerto rico ( pr ) , or from anywhere else , are "covered over" to the pr and the usvi governments .

the hovensa oil refinery , mentioned above , had been one of the usvi's largest employers , with about 1,200 workers and nearly 1,000 contractors .

since 1998 , the refinery operated as a joint venture between hess oil and petrã³leos de venezuela , a petroleum company owned by the venezuelan government .

the refinery suddenly shut down in 2012 after running large losses .

while mainland refineries had shifted to natural gas as an energy source , the hovensa facility relied on relatively expensive fuel oil .

hovensa filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2015 .

the usvi government received $220 million as part of the agreement to resolve hovensa's assets , which was used to cover the government's budget deficit for 2015 .

limetree bay purchased some hovensa facilities to build an oil storage facility that initially employed about 80 people and which later expanded to employ about 650 people .

a renovation of the hovensa refinery complex was reportedly three - quarters complete in late 2019 , potentially allowing fuel deliveries in early 2020 .

over many decades , agriculture's role in the economy has dwindled to a marginal activity .

most of the island's food supply and essentially all of the molassesâa syrup extracted from sugar caneâused to produce rum is imported .

the high cost of electricity in the u.s. virgin islands is one factor that hinders economic development .

residential customers pay 40 cents per kilowatt / hour ( kwh ) or about three times the average cost on the mainland .

commercial electricity rates are approximately $0.47 / kwh .

island power systems do not benefit from gas pipelines or electric grids that extend over large areas , thus face higher costs than mainland systems .

u.s. virgin islands water and power authority ( viwapa ) supplies electrical power and water .

the bulk of power generation is fueled by oil and diesel , although initiatives to enable use of propane and natural gas have been under way .

for instance , viwapa modified some electric generating units to allow them the option to use natural gas , propane , or fuel oil .

expanding the efficient use of renewable sources of electricity , such as wind and solar , may require upgrades in transmission and generation systems .

in 2015 , renewable sources made up 8% of viwapa's peak demand generating capacity .

fiscal challenges facing the usvi government have intensified in recent years .

several news reports in 2017 posed pointed questions about the sustainability of the islands' public debts , which total about $2 billion .

those debt levels , on a per capita or on a percentage of gdp basis , are extremely high compared to other subnational governments in the united states .

in addition , the most recent actuarial analysis of public pensions found a net pension liability of about $4 billion .

in 2017 , the government accountability office ( gao ) found that "more than a third of usvi's current bonded debt outstanding as of fiscal year 2015 was issued to fund government operating costs. .

a 2019 gao report noted that the usvi government had been shut out of capital markets since 2017 , which could hobble its ability to roll over maturing debt .

the report also summarized concerns with the solvency of the public pension system , growth prospects , effects of 2017 changes in the federal tax law , and the uncertain status of federal medicaid funding .

concerns about debt levels had led each of the three major credit ratings agencies to downgrade at least part of the islands' public debts .

others suggested that usvi's public debts would have to be restructured .

in august 2017 , then - governor mapp said that communications with credit ratings agencies had been suspended , which prompted those agencies to drop usvi's credit ratings .

the u.s. virgin islands and other u.s. territories are not covered by the provisions of the puerto rico oversight , management , and economic stability act ( promesa ; p.l .

114-187 ) .

nonetheless , some credit ratings agencies saw enactment of promesa as a sign that congress and the president could enact future legislation to enable debt adjustments in other territories .

like many state governments , usvi public revenues were severely affected by the 2007-2009 great recession .

tourism , the mainstay of the usvi economy , was affected .

in turn , government revenues , typically closely tied to economic activity , also fell .

in addition , rum subsidy payments doubled from 2006 to 2007 and 2008 .

as noted above , the closure of the hovensa refinery in 2012 resulted in hundreds of lost jobs and a significant contraction of the usvi tax base .

in recent years , the islands' government has run structural deficits and has used bond proceeds to cover shortfalls .

kenneth mapp , who was inaugurated as governor in january 2015 , had proposed various fiscal measures intended to reduce or eliminate those deficits .

in august 2016 , the islands' government took steps to issue bonds , which were to be used to cover financing shortfalls for its fy2017 budget .

that issue was postponed until january 2017 and then cancelled .

the loss of access to capital markets at reasonable rates left the islands' government with a narrow set of liquidity resources .

in january 2017 , then - governor mapp proposed a series of measures intended to strengthen public finances , including certain tax increases , enhanced revenue collection measures , and reductions in public spending .

a package of tax measures , including higher taxes on beer , liquor , sodas , and timeshare rentals , which were part of the governor's proposals , was enacted on march 22 , 2017 .

gao , in an analysis of debts of u.s. territories , expressed doubts that those fiscal measures would restore access to capital markets or address shortfalls in the funding of public pensions and other retirement benefits .

then - governor mapp also had announced that a $40 million revenue anticipation note would soon be issued through banco popular , which he contended would provide the usvi government with liquidity through september 2017 .

it appears that issuance was also suspended .

the form of usvi's public debt service , in which many funds are routed through escrow accounts before reaching government coffers , also limits options for usvi policymakers .

governor albert bryan jr. , who succeeded mapp in january 2019 , claimed to have stabilized government operations and finances in his first year in office , including by taking steps to reestablish relations with credit rating agencies and enhance transparency of public finances .

the usvi was hit by two powerful hurricanes in september 2017 , which caused extensive damage from which island residents are continuing to recover .

hurricane irmaâshown in figure 2 âwas "one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes on record in the atlantic basin. .

irma passed directly over st. thomas and st. john on september 6 , 2017 , causing "widespread catastrophic damage. .

two weeks later , on september 20 , hurricane maria hit st. croix , before continuing on to devastate puerto rico .

figure 3 shows paths and zones of extreme wind speeds for both hurricanes in the vicinity of usvi .

in november 2017 , the usvi government estimated that uninsured damage from the hurricanes would exceed $7.5 billion .

disaster declarations following hurricane irma and hurricane maria enabled the usvi government and its residents to receive federal assistance through various provisions of the stafford act ( p.l .

93-288 , as amended ) .

those declarations authorized the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) to assist local and territory governments , certain private nonprofit organizations , and individuals through grants , loans , and direct aid .

fema , the u.s .

corps of engineers , and the u.s. coast guard , among other federal agencies , also directly supported disaster response and recovery efforts .

other forms of federal disaster assistance have included loans and grants to individuals and small businesses , including through the small business administration disaster loan program .

the usvi government and two hospital authorities received community disaster loans ( cdls ) on january 3 , 2018 .

the usvi government cdl totaled $10 million with a term of 20 years .

cdls were designed to provide liquidity to local governments that have suffered revenue declines due to disasters .

estimates based on usvi fiscal data suggest that public revenues were halved after the two hurricanes .

funding for disaster relief has been augmented by several supplemental appropriations .

the extent of federal disaster assistance received by the usvi will depend , in part , on how funds provided in response to needs resulting from hurricanes and fires in 2017 are allocated among affected areas .

in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ; â§20301 ) , enacted on february 9 , 2018 , congress provided the usvi and puerto rico with additional medicaid funding for the period january 1 , 2018 , through september 30 , 2019 .

for the usvi medicaid program , an additional $107 million was provided .

another $35.6 million would be available to the usvi subject to certain medicaid program integrity and statistical reporting requirements .

the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) was also raised from 55% to 100% for both the usvi and puerto rico medicaid programs during that interval .

on february 4 , 2020 , house appropriations chairwoman nita m. lowey introduced h.r .

5687 , an emergency supplemental appropriations bill .

title b of the measure includes provisions that would provide additional resources to territories , including the usvi , through support for child tax credits ( and certain expansions of eligibility ) and other tax credits , as well as a relaxation on limits on rum cover - over revenues directed to puerto rico and usvi .

the house passed the measure on february 7 , 2020 , on a 237-161 vote .

the administration warned it would veto the measure .

hurricanes irma and maria damaged an estimated 80% to 90% of viwapa's transmission and distribution lines , although power - generating plants were less affected .

the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) estimated that 93% of total usvi customers had their electric power restored by the end of january 2018 .

according to the u.s. virgin islands action plan submitted to and approved by hud , the energy sector infrastructure needs as a result of the hurricanes totaled nearly $2.3 billion .

the u.s. department of housing and urban development ( hud ) allocated $67.7 million ( approximately 3% ) to the u.s. virgin islands from a $2 billion community development block grant - disaster recovery ( cdbg - dr ) appropriation included in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) "to provide enhanced or improved electrical power systems" for puerto rico and the usvi .

governor bryan reportedly asked hud to "acknowledge that the virgin islands needs at least $350 million of these funds to make a meaningful impact in strengthening the grid and lowering the high cost of electricity in the virgin islands. .

on september 16 , 2019 , $774 million in mitigation funds ( cdbg - mit funds ) were allocated to the u.s. virgin islands ; however , hud announced that [t]he grantee is prohibited from using cdbg - mit funds for mitigation activities to reduce the risk of disaster related damage to electric power systems until after hud publishes the federal register notice governing the use of the $2 billion for enhanced or improved electrical power systems .

this limitation includes a prohibition on the use of cdbg - mit funds for mitigation activities carried out to meet the matching requirement , share , or contribution for any federally - funded project that is providing funds for electrical power systems until hud publishes the federal register notice governing the use of cdbg - dr funds to provide enhanced or improved electrical power systems .

the prohibition on the use of cdbg - mit funds combined with viwapa's cash flow challenges limits viwapa's ability to improve resiliency .

without sufficient available funds , viwapa is unable to meet federal funding matching requirements in order to make use of eligible mitigation funding from fema to permanently harden the electrical power systems .

the government of the u.s. virgin islandsâviwapa's largest customerâhas been slow in providing payment for services .

the uvsi legislature , however , moved to appropriate $22.2 million for hospitals to pay outstanding obligations to viwapa , among other provisions .

throughout 2018 and 2019 , usvi policymakers expressed concerns over viwapa's financial stability .

for instance , delegate stacey plaskett called on governor bryan and usvi senate president francis to declare a state of emergency in response to the territory's "energy crisis. .

in his fy2019 budget proposals , governor mapp set forth plans to extend the solvency of the usvi public pension systems .

according to those proposals , the projected insolvency of those plans would be postponed from 2024 to 2025 .

additional measures , to be outlined in the future , were claimed to suffice to postpone insolvency for three additional years .

the fy2019 budget proposals also called for a lifting of a hiring freeze .

additional revenues were expected from expanded federal reimbursement for health programs , along with recovery - related investment activity , although decreased tourist traffic is expected to keep accommodation tax and related collections well below prehurricane levels in fy2019 .

the usvi economy has relied heavily on tourism and related business activity , which made it more vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes than jurisdictions with more diverse economies .

 figure 4 shows employment trends in the tourism - dependent leisure and hospitality sector , the territorial government , the manufacturing sector , and the construction sector .

employment in the leisure and hospitality sector shows a steep decline after hurricane marilyn in 1995 and after hurricanes irma and maria in september 2017 , after which employment in that sector was halved .

leisure and hospitality employment took about six years to recover to pre - marilyn levels .

increases in the construction sector offset about half of those losses in 1996 and 1997 , presumably due to recovery and reconstruction work .

as of december 2019 , tourism sector employment has recovered somewhat , but remains well below pre - 2017 levels .

construction employment also rose in 2018 and 2019 , but that uptick appears much smaller than in the post - marilyn time period .

moreover , the posthurricane increases in construction - related activity have been small relative to the loss of tourism employment after 2017 .

employment in the usvi territorial government declined over the 2010-2014 period , but has remained relatively stable since then .

the severity of damage from irma and maria , and the subsequent disruption of the usvi tourism industry , suggest that a full economic recovery could take years .

many hotels have remained closed since the hurricanes , although some reopened in 2019 .

cruise ship passenger arrivals fell from 1.8 million in calendar year ( cy ) 2016 to 1.3 million in 2017 , but have rebounded somewhat .

air passenger arrivals fell from nearly 800,000 in 2016 to less than 500,000 in 2018 .

air arrivals for the first three quarters of cy2019 ran 44% ahead of the same period in 2018 .

the economic effects of hurricanes irma and maria can also be seen in initial unemployment claims data , shown in figure 5 .

the post - irma and maria uptick in late 2017 is more than twice the size of the 2011-2012 upticks near the time of the closure of the hovensa refinery .

the new york federal reserve bank compared the economic effects of hurricanes irma and maria on the usvi and puerto rico , noting that the estimated percentage job loss following those hurricanes ( - 7.8% ) was far greater than the percentage job losses in new york city ( - 3.3% ) during the great recession .

researchers report that many young professionals and health care workers have left the usvi for positions on the mainland , which may complicate recovery efforts in the health care sector .

tracking the progress of usvi economic recovery is complicated as many federal statistical programs report fewer data series for u.s. territories than for states .

the virgin islands bureau of economic research ( viber ) , however , reports regularly on economic , tourism , and population trends .

the fiscal and economic challenges facing the usvi government raise several issues for congress .

first , congress may consider further legislation that would extend or restructure long - range disaster assistance programs to mitigate those challenges and promote greater resiliency of infrastructure and public programs .

second , if fiscal pressures on the usvi intensify , congress might consider a framework similar to that established by the puerto rico oversight , management , and economic stability act ( promesa ; p.l .

114-187 ) .

in the past , however , usvi policymakers opposed making promesa provisions available to other territories because of concerns about borrowing costs .

at present , the usvi lacks access to the federal bankruptcy code or other processes for debt restructuring involving judicial processes .

third , congress might consider proposals to support initiatives to lower energy costs for the usvi .

mainland electrical power generation , to a large extent , has shifted to using more natural gas as a fuel .

construction of a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) import facility and accompanying generation plants could lead to lower energy prices and an enhanced capacity to employ renewable energy sources .

other innovative energy technologies might also be used to that end .

while viwapa has taken some steps to modernize its generating units , some major investments may be required .

for example , construction of a lng facility and further conversions of generating units could lower electricity rates , but would require financial commitments that would likely challenge the fiscal capacity of the usvi government and viwapa .

moreover , lng supply contracts typically extend over decades due to the scale of required investments , arrangements which could be difficult to negotiate given the usvi's fiscal situation .

fourth , congress may expand oversight of federal agencies that administer disaster assistance programs , including fema and hud , to ensure the timely receipt of assistance by grantees .

several members of congress have expressed concerns that funds for federal disaster recovery efforts have been unduly delayed .

congress could also examine the interplay among federal agencies , federal rules and regulations that apply to disaster responses operations , and local governments and nonprofits in affected areas .

fifth , congress may revisit the structure of the rum cover - over program to assess whether its current structure is appropriately fitted to public purposes .

the contractual bar to usvi advocacy of changes in the cover - over program could require congress to initiate any such alterations .

sixth , congress may choose to promote economic and social development through a wide range of tax and social program rules , some of which treat usvi differently than states .
