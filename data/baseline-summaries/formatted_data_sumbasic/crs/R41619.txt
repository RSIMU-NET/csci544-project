national security letters ( nsls ) are roughly comparable to administrative subpoenas .

intelligence agencies issue them for intelligence gathering purposes to telephone companies , internet service providers , consumer credit reporting agencies , banks , and other financial institutions , directing the recipients to turn over certain customer records and similar information .

the 111 th congress saw a number of proposals to amend nsl authority .

none were enacted , but s. 193 , introduced early in the 112 th congress by senator leahy , would carry forward in large measure the provisions approved by the senate judiciary committee in the 111 th .

s. 193 would also have extended three usa patriot act - related amendments to the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) then scheduled to expire earlier this year .

the senate judiciary committee reported out an amended version of s. 193 on april 6 , 2011 .

thereafter , congress extended the fisa amendments separately .

senator leahy then reintroduced the reported version of s. 193 as s. 1125 , stripped of the fisa extension provisions .

representative conyers introduced companion legislation in the house ( h.r .

1805 ) .

senator paul offered several bills that address many of the same issues ( s. 1050 , s. 1070 , s. 1073 , s. 1075 ) .

s. 1125 and h.r .

1805 would repeal one of nsl's authorizing statutes , section 627 of the fair credit reporting act ( 15 u.s.c .

1681v ) ; return the others , as of december 31 , 2013 , to their pre - usa patriot act form ; amend the judicial review procedure to reflect judicial constructions ; and adjust the audit and reporting requirements .

s. 1073 would require the attorney general to issue minimization procedures for nsls .

s. 1075 would permit issuance of a nsl only upon the order of a fisa court judge .

s. 1050 and s. 1070 would combine the two proposals and require minimization procedures and fisa court orders for nsls .

prior to the usa patriot act , the nsl statutes were four .

one , 18 u.s.c .

2709 , obligated communications providers to supply certain customer information upon the written request of the director of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) or a senior fbi headquarters official .

when customer identity , length of service , and toll records were sought , the letters had to certify ( 1 ) that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation and ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe the information pertained to a foreign power or its agents .

when only customer identity and length of service records ( but not toll records ) were sought , the letters had to certify ( 1 ) again that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation , but ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the customer information pertained to use of the provider's facilities to communicate with foreign powers , their agents , or those engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities .

in like manner a second statute , section 1114 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the right to financial privacy act , obligated financial institutions to provide the fbi with customers' financial records upon written certification of the fbi director or his designee ( 1 ) that the records were sought for foreign counterintelligence purposes and ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the records were those of a foreign power or its agents .

and so it was with a third , section 626 of the fair credit report act , which obligated consumer credit reporting agencies to provide customer identification , and the names and addresses of financial institutions at which a designated consumer maintained accounts .

here too , the obligation was triggered by written certification of the fbi director or his designee ( 1 ) that the information was necessary for a foreign counterintelligence investigation , and ( 2 ) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the consumer was either a foreign power , a foreign official , or the agent of a foreign power and was engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities .

the fourth , section 802 of the national security act , was a bit different .

it reached a wider range of potential recipients at the demand of a large group of federal officials , but for a more limited purpose .

it rested the obligation to provide consumer reports , together with financial information and records , upon consumer reporting agencies , financial agencies , and financial institutions , or holding companies .

the requirement was triggered by the certification of senior officials of law enforcement and intelligence agencies , but confined to information pertaining to federal employees with access to classified information and being sought for clearance purposes and inquiries into past or potential security leaks .
