this report describes the president's proposal for fy2006 appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs , as submitted to congress on february 7 , 2005 , and the congressional response to that proposal .

it compares the president's fy2006 request to the fy2005 l - hhs - ed amounts .

it tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to the l - hhs - ed appropriations bill , with particular attention paid to discretionary programs .

in addition , the report summarizes activities related to the annual budget process , such as the congressional budget resolution , continuing resolutions , and supplemental appropriations ( see " related legislation " ) .

however , the report does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory l - hhs - ed programs — such as medicare or social security — nor will it follow any authorizing legislation that may be needed prior to funding some of the president's budget initiatives .

for a glossary of budget terms and relevant websites , see " appendix a : terminology and web resources. .

for funding resources for l - hhs - ed agencies , see " appendix b : context of l - hhs - ed appropriations. .

the l - hhs - ed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills , not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs , but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues , such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion , stem cell research , or human cloning .

this bill provides discretionary funds for three federal departments and 14 related agencies including the social security administration ( ssa ) .

among the various appropriations bills , l - hhs - ed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs ; the defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs .

according to the budget of the united states government fiscal year 2006 , table s - 4 , the fy2005 l - hhs - ed bill accounted for $142.4 billion ( 17.3% ) and the defense bill accounted for $390.4 billion ( 47.5% ) of the estimated $822.7 billion total for all federal discretionary budget authority in fy2005 .

this section summarizes major funding changes proposed for l - hhs - ed and related issues such as 302 ( b ) allocations , advance appropriations , and earmarks for specific projects .

several proposals related to l - hhs - ed appropriations have been considered by the 109 th congress , including a series of fy2006 continuing resolutions , the fy2006 budget resolution , and fy2006 and fy2005 supplemental appropriations .

fy2005 l - hhs - ed appropriations were provided by the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ( p.l .

108 - 447 ) , which was enacted by the 108 th congress following a series of three fy2005 continuing resolutions ( p.l .

108 - 309 ) .

a series of three continuing resolutions — p.l .

109 - 77 , p.l .

109 - 105 , and p.l .

109 - 128 — provided temporary fy2006 appropriations for most ongoing l - hhs - ed activities , including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees , for the period october 1 through december 30 , 2005 .

an fy2006 continuing resolution was necessary because the regular l - hhs - ed appropriations were not enacted by the start of fy2006 on october 1 , 2005 .

under the fy2006 continuing resolution , the funding level for each activity was provided at a rate of operations not to exceed the "current rate" or the rate permitted in the house - passed version of the fy2006 l - hhs - ed appropriations , whichever is lower , under fy2005 conditions and authority — with one exception: if an activity was zeroed out in the house - passed bill for fy2006 , the funding level was not allowed to exceed the current rate [§101 ( d ) ] .

new initiatives were prohibited unless otherwise authorized .

for programs with high spend - out rates that normally would occur early in the fiscal year , special restrictions prohibited spending levels that would impinge on final fy2006 funding decisions .

obligations for mandatory payments were allowed for payments due on or about november 1 , 2005 ; december 1 , 2005 ; and january 1 , 2006 [§114 ( b ) ] .

special provisions were made for funding certain appeals for medicare ( §120 ) and social security ( §118 ) .

the amounts that would have been provided by the senate - passed version of l - hhs - ed appropriations were excluded from the funding calculations under the continuing resolution because they were not passed by october 1 , 2005 .

2863 , h.rept .

109 - 359 ) , the department of defense , emergency supplemental appropriations to address hurricanes in the gulf of mexico , and pandemic influenza act , 2006 .

in particular , division b of p.l .

109 - 148 , the emergency supplemental appropriations act to address hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and pandemic influenza , 2006 , includes both ( a ) disaster assistance for areas damaged by 2005 hurricanes ( $29.0 billion ) and ( b ) avian and pandemic influenza preparedness ( $3.8 billion ) , as well as various rescissions including the 1% rescission applicable to most fy2006 discretionary appropriations .

for additional information on emergency assistance , please see crs report rl33053 , federal stafford act disaster assistance: presidential declarations , eligible activities , and funding , by [author name scrubbed] ( pdf ) ; for information on pandemic influenza , please see crs report rl33145 , pandemic influenza: domestic preparedness efforts , by [author name scrubbed] .

for l - hhs - ed activities , p.l .

109 - 148 appropriated $2.5 billion for hurricane disaster assistance and $3.3 billion for influenza preparedness and response .

these amounts are not included in the fy2006 appropriations discussed in other parts of this report .

all fy2006 l - hhs - ed supplemental appropriations were classified as emergency funding and are therefore not subject to the 1% rescission applicable to most fy2006 discretionary appropriations .

the supplemental l - hhs - ed emergency funds were allocated as follows: dol , training and employment services , national emergency grants , $125 million ; hhs , social services block grant , social and health care services and facilities , $550 million ; hhs , children and family services , head start , services for displaced children , $90 million ; ed , elementary and secondary , assistance to restart school operations and reimburse states , $750 million ; ed , homeless education , assistance for displaced children and youth , $5 million ; ed , elementary and secondary , grants for temporary emergency impact aid for displaced students , $645 million ; ed , higher education , grants for college students and institutions for "unanticipated expenses," $200 million ; hhs , public health and social services emergency fund , influenza preparedness and response , $3.1 billion , including $350 million for upgrading state and local capacity and $50 million for laboratory capacity and research at the cdc ; dol and hhs , expenses related to 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , $50 million for new york state uninsured employers fund and $75 million for the cdc ( §5011 , p.l .

109-148 ) — according to the conferees ( h.rept .

109-359 ) , this supplemental replaces funds rescinded by p.l .

109-149 ; and hhs , public health and social services emergency fund , influenza preparedness and response for international activities and activities in foreign countries , $246 million , including $150 million for the cdc for global and domestic disease surveillance , laboratory diagnostics , rapid response , and quarantine .

the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget .

among other provisions , the conference agreement on the fy2006 resolution , h.con.res .

95 ( h.rept .

109 - 62 ) , proposes total discretionary budget authority of $843 billion ; of this amount , $391 billion is provided for discretionary programs other than for defense and homeland security , according to the april 28 , 2005 summary prepared by the majority staff of the house committee on the budget .

the fy2006 discretionary ceiling represents an increase of 2.1% relative to the fy2005 discretionary total of $840 billion ; the subtotal for programs other than defense and homeland security represents a 0.8% reduction .

report language outlines the funding assumptions made for selected programs that might be used to reach the spending targets .

the fy2006 budget resolution does not specify a discretionary funding total for l - hhs - ed programs , nor amounts for individual departments , agencies , and programs ; these specific amounts are only determined through the enactment of l - hhs - ed appropriations .

table 14 shows the assumed levels of discretionary budget authority for budget functions relevant to l - hhs - ed programs from the fy2006 resolution .

the budget resolution includes reserve funds for , among other purposes: the family opportunity act for medicaid coverage for the families of disabled children ( §302 ) ; elimination of the shortfall for pell grants ( §303 ) ; health care costs and services for the uninsured ( §304 ) ; health information technology and performance - based measures to improve health care ( §306 ) ; safe imports of prescription drugs ( §309 ) ; and restoration of schip funds ( §310 ) .

the reserve fund for pell grants allows $4.3 billion in new budget authority for fy2006 ; other reserve provisions prohibit increases in the federal deficit that might result from legislation to implement such provisions .

the fy2006 budget resolution instructs authorizing committees to report legislation to reduce mandatory spending for the period fy2006 through fy2010 ( §201 for the house , §202 for the senate ) .

subsequently , these proposals would be combined in a single reconciliation bill by the budget committees .

the house committee on education and the workforce is responsible for a reduction of $1.0 billion for fy2006 and $12.7 billion for fy2006 through fy2010 ; the senate committee on health , education , labor , and pensions ( help ) is responsible for $1.2 billion for fy2006 and $13.7 billion for fy2006 through fy2010 .

two other committees include l - hhs - ed programs in their jurisdiction: the house committee on ways and means is responsible for a reduction of $0.3 billion for fy2006 and $1.0 billion for fy2006 through fy2010 ; and the senate committee on finance is responsible for $10.0 billion for fy2006 through fy2010 .

regular fy2005 funding for l - hhs - ed activities was enacted late in the second session of the 108 th congress , more than two months after the start of fy2005 on october 1 , 2004 .

eight of the 13 regular fy2005 appropriations bills were combined into a single omnibus bill , h.r .

4818 ; division f of the omnibus provided appropriations for l - hhs - ed programs .

a series of three continuing resolutions , p.l .

in an effort to meet the overall spending limitations requested by the president , the h.r .

4818 conferees required a rescission to some appropriations from what would have been provided otherwise .

this provision was specified in §122 of division j of p.l .

108 - 447 .

it required a decrease of 0.80% in fy2005 discretionary appropriations for each program , project , or activity , whether enacted in p.l .

108 - 447 or in other appropriations .

discretionary funds from defense , military construction , and homeland security appropriations were excluded , as were all fy2005 supplemental appropriations .

advance appropriations enacted through p.l .

108 - 447 for fy2006 or beyond were excluded as well .

the rescission was estimated to save approximately $3.5 billion ; for additional information , please see crs report rs21983 , fy2005 consolidated appropriations act: reference guide , by [author name scrubbed] ( pdf ) .

p.l .

108 - 447 required several reductions other than the 0.80% cut described above .

one reduction was germane to l - hhs - ed appropriations ; §519 of the l - hhs - ed part of the bill required an $18 million reduction in l - hhs - ed administrative expenses .

congress did not specify the actual amounts of these reductions but merely the process for their calculation .

the application of these reductions to accounts and line items was to be determined by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the individual agencies following enactment of p.l .

108 - 447 .

as a result , the tables in the fy2005 conference report , h.rept .

108 - 792 , show pre - reduction levels , whereas the post - reduction amounts , as approved by omb , are incorporated into the tables shown in this report .

fy2005 supplemental appropriations of $75.9 billion were enacted in response to the president's request for additional funds for military operations in iraq and afghanistan , tsunami relief and rehabilitation , and other activities .

the bill , h.r .

1268 ( h.rept .

109 - 72 ) was signed into law on may 11 , 2005 .

among other provisions , it provided $10 million for domestically produced vaccines under the public health and social services emergency fund ( phssef ) of hhs and $58 million for the purchase of influenza countermeasures for the strategic national stockpile under the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .

several unobligated balances from fy2005 hhs funds were rescinded as an apparent offset to the $10 million supplemental , along with a rescission of $58 million from appropriations enacted for the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 .

appendix a. terminology and web resources the following items include some of the key budget terms used in this report ; they are based on crs report 98-720 , manual on the federal budget process , by [author name scrubbed] and allen schick ( pdf ) .

the websites provide general information on the federal budget and appropriations .

advance appropriation is budget authority that will become available in a fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is enacted ; scorekeeping counts the entire amount in the fiscal year it first becomes available for obligation .

appropriation is budget authority that permits federal agencies to incur obligations and to make payments out of the treasury for specified purposes .

appropriations represent the amounts that agencies may obligate during the period of time specified in the law .

annual appropriations are provided in appropriations acts ; most permanent appropriations are provided in substantive law .

major types of appropriations are regular , supplemental , and continuing .

budget authority is legal authority to incur financial obligations that normally result in the outlay of federal government funds .

major types of budget authority are appropriations , borrowing authority , and contract authority .

budget authority also includes the subsidy cost to the federal government of direct loans and loan guarantees , estimated on a net present value basis .

budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by both houses of congress , but not requiring the signature of the president , setting forth the congressional budget for at least five fiscal years .

it includes various budget totals and functional allocations .

discretionary spending is budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts , other than appropriated entitlements .

context of l - hhs - ed appropriations budget authority for all federal programs is estimated at $2,477.4 billion for fy2005 .

budget authority for all l - hhs - ed departments and related agencies is estimated at $1,264.9 billion , or slightly more than half — 51.1% — of the federal total .

table b - 1 shows funding for the major l - hhs - ed agencies and provides context for the current year discretionary funding provided by l - hhs - ed appropriations — $142.7 billion , or 5.8% of the federal total in fy2005 .

of the $1,264.9 billion for l - hhs - ed agencies , as shown in table b - 1 , the l - hhs - ed appropriations subcommittees generally have effective control only over the $142.7 billion in discretionary funds , or 5.8% of the total federal budget .

what accounts for the remaining $1,122.2 billion of l - hhs - ed funds ? .

first , funding for mandatory programs accounts for more than two - thirds of the l - hhs - ed bill — $354.2 billion , or 14.3% of the fy2005 federal total .

although appropriations are enacted for these mandatory activities annually — these are sometimes called "appropriated entitlements" — the amounts provided generally must be sufficient to cover program obligations and entitlements to beneficiaries .

for these programs , as well as the programs funded through trust funds and permanent authorities , most changes in funding levels are made through amendments to authorizing legislation rather than through annual appropriations bills .

federal administrative costs for these programs typically are subject to annual discretionary appropriations , however .

for l - hhs - ed agencies , these mandatory programs include supplemental security income , black lung disability payments , foster care and adoption , the social services block grant , and vocational rehabilitation , as well as general ( non - earmarked ) fund support for medicare and medicaid .

second , other appropriations bills account for a small portion of l - hhs - ed agency funding — $4.7 billion , or 0.2% of the fy2005 federal total .

two hhs agencies are fully funded by other appropriations bills , and two hhs programs are partially funded by bills other than l - hhs - ed , as described below .

prior to fy2006 , the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) was partially funded outside of the l - hhs - ed bill .

the hhs food and drug administration is funded by the agriculture appropriations ( $1.5 billion in fy2005 ) .

the hhs indian health service is funded by the interior appropriations ( $3.0 billion in fy2005 ) .

the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) is primarily funded under l - hhs - ed ( $4.5 billion in fy2005 ) ; it received fy2005 funds from the veterans affairs and housing and urban development ( va - hud ) appropriations for the agency for toxic substances and disease registry ( atsdr ) ( $76 million ) .

for fy2006 , interior appropriations will provide atsdr funding .

the national institutes of health ( nih ) is primarily funded under l - hhs - ed ( $28.4 billion in fy2005 ) ; it received fy2005 funds from va - hud appropriations for the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) ( $80 million ) .

for fy2006 , interior appropriations will provide niehs funding .

the cncs — one of the related l - hhs - ed agencies — was funded in two separate bills before fy2006 .

the l - hhs - ed bill funded programs authorized under the domestic volunteer service act of 1973 ( $354 million in fy2005 ) ; the va - hud bill funded americorps and other programs authorized by the national community service act and the cncs inspector general ( $573 million in fy2005 ) .

for fy2006 , all funding for cncs activities will be provided by l - hhs - ed .

for purposes of comparability , all fy2005 cncs funding has been included in this report as if it had been appropriated in its entirety through the l - hhs - ed bill .

third , the remaining l - hhs - ed agency funds — an estimated $763.3 billion , or 30.8% of the total fy2005 federal budget — are received automatically without congressional intervention and are funded outside of the annual appropriations process .

these funds are provided from permanent appropriations and trust funds .

the major l - hhs - ed programs in this category include unemployment compensation , medicare , railroad retirement , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf , the welfare assistance program ) , student loans , state children's health insurance , and social security benefits .
