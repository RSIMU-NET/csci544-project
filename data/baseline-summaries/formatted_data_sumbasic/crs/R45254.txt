the financial services and general government ( fsgg ) appropriations bill includes funding for more than two dozen independent agencies primarily in title v. these agencies perform a wide range of functions , including the management of federal real property , the regulation of financial institutions and markets , and mail delivery .

this report focuses on funding for those independent agencies in title v of the fsgg appropriations bill .

it also addresses general provisions that apply government - wide , which appear in title vii , and provisions on cuba sanctions , which appear in title i .

in addition , the fsgg bill funds the department of the treasury ( title i ) , the executive office of the president ( eop ; title ii ) , the judiciary ( title iii ) , and the district of columbia ( title iv ) .

it typically funds mandatory retirement accounts in title vi , which also contains general provisions applying to the fsgg agencies .

the fsgg bills also occasionally address other issues , particularly those involving financial regulation , in additional titles .

although financial services are a major focus of the bills , fsgg appropriations bills do not fund many financial regulatory agencies , which are instead funded outside of the appropriations process .

the fsgg bill has existed in its current form since the 2007 reorganization of the house and senate committees on appropriations .

the house and senate fsgg bills fund the same agencies , with one exception .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is funded through the agriculture appropriations bill in the house and the fsgg bill in the senate .

in this report , the cftc funding is generally included in the combined totals of funding for fsgg independent agencies .

the fsgg appropriations act includes general provisions applying government - wide .

most of the provisions include language that has appeared under the general provisions title for several years because congress has decided to reiterate the language rather than make the provisions permanent .

an administration's proposed government - wide general provisions for a fiscal year are generally included in the budget appendix .

among the new provisions proposed but not enacted for fy2018 were the following: if new budget authority provided in fy2018 appropriations acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit for any category set forth in section 251 ( c ) of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 because of estimating differences with cbo , the omb director will make an adjustment to the fy2018 discretionary spending limit in such category in the amount of the excess .

the total of all such adjustments will not exceed 0.2% of the sum of the adjusted fy2018 discretionary spending limits for all categories .

 ( section 736 , fy2018 budget proposal and section 748 of the senate draft bill. ) .

an alien who is authorized to be employed in the united states pursuant to the deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) program established under the june 15 , 2012 , memorandum of the secretary of homeland security would be eligible for federal government employment .

 ( section 746 , h.r .

3280 as reported. ) .

the treasury department's office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) administers the main body of cuba embargo regulations , the cuban assets control regulations , which were first issued in 1963 , and have been amended many times over the years to reflect changes in u.s. policy toward cuba .

as reported , h.r .

3280 had two provisions that would have tightened u.s. economic sanctions on cuba , but they were not included in p.l .

115-141 .

section 130 would have provided that no funds made available by the act could be used to approve , license , facilitate , authorize , or otherwise allow the use , purchase , trafficking , or import of property confiscated by the cuban government .

the provision appeared to be aimed at prohibiting the importation of rum and tobacco products by authorized u.s. travelers as accompanied baggage .

in the 114 th congress , a similar provision had been included in the house appropriations committee version of the fy2017 fsgg appropriations bill , h.r .

5485 ( section 133 ) , but was not included in the fy2017 enacted omnibus appropriations measure .

section 131 , which relates to a trademark sanction on cuba , would have provided that no funds made available by the act could have been used to authorize a general license or approve a specific license with respect to a mark , trade name , or commercial name that is substantially similar to one that was used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated by the cuban government unless the original owner expressly consented .

the provision , which would have prohibited ofac from licensing the payment of trademark registration fees , relates to a long - standing dispute between a cuban company and the bermuda - based bacardi limited over the havana club trademark .

in january 2016 , ofac issued a specific license for the cuban company to make payments related to the renewal of the havana club trademark , and the u.s. patent and trademark office subsequently renewed the havana club trademark until 2026 .

a similar provision had been included in h.r .

5485 in the 114 th congress , but was not included in the fy2017 final appropriations measure .
