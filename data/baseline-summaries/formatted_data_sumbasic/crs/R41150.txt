energy and water development funding for fy2010 was provided in h.r .

3183 , which became p.l .

111-85 when signed by president obama on october 28 , 2009 .

appropriations for these programs in p.l .

111-85 totaled $33.5 billion .

in addition , some of the $44.3 billion included in the american recovery and reinvestment act ( the "stimulus" act , p.l .

111-5 ) to fund numerous programs in the corps of engineers , the bureau of reclamation , and the department of energy , remained to be expended in fy2010 .

president obama's proposed fy2011 budget for energy and water development programs , released in february 2010 , totaled $35.3 billion .

on july 15 , 2010 , the house appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development approved a bill to fund these programs at $34.7 billion , but the full committee did not report out the bill .

in the senate , the energy and water development subcommittee approved a bill on july 20 , and the full appropriations committee reported out s. 3635 ( s.rept .

111-228 ) on july 22 , with a total of $35.0 billion .

the bill did not come to the floor of either the house or the senate .

on september 30 , the senate and the house passed a continuing resolution ( h.r .

3081 , p.l .

111-242 ) , funding government programs at the fy2010 level , until december 3 .

later , p.l .

111-322 extended funding through march 4 , 2011 .

h.j.res .

44 ( p.l .

112-4 ) , signed by the president on march 2 , amended p.l .

111-242 , extending funding through march 18 , 2011 , and reducing funding levels for a number of energy and water development programs .

on february 14 , 2011 , h.r .

1 was introduced , continuing funding through the rest of fy2011 at the fy2010 level , but with many specified exceptions in which funding was reduced .

the house appropriations committee announced that the energy and water development funding level in h.r .

1 was $29.9 billion .

on february 19 the house passed h.r .

1 by a vote of 235-189 .

in the senate , s.amdt .

149 was offered as a substitute for h.r .

1 , continuing funding through the rest of fy2011 but with fewer funding reductions , totaling approximately $32.4 billion in energy and water development funding .

on march 9 the senate rejected both the house - passed version of h.r .

1 and the s.amdt .

149 .

after two more short - term extensions , h.r .

1473 was introduced april 11 , passed by the house and senate april 14 , and signed by the president april 15 ( p.l .

112-10 ) .

the bill funds energy and water development programs at approximately $32.2 billion .

 table 1 indicates the current status of the fy2011 funding legislation .

the energy and water development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior's central utah project ( cup ) and bureau of reclamation , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies , including the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) .

table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for fy2004 to fy2011 .

table 3 lists totals for each of the bill's four titles .

it also lists the total of several scorekeeping adjustments .

tables 4 through 15 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2010-fy2011 .

accompanying these tables is a discussion of the key issues involved in the major programs in the four titles .

funding in h.r .

1 , for s.amdt .

149 , and for p.l .

112-10 , was derived from the bill texts , and is included in the overall title tables .

these bills did not specify funding levels below the major program level .

the energy and water development bill has funded all doe's programs since fy2005 .

major doe activities historically funded by the energy and water bill include research and development on renewable energy and nuclear power , general science , environmental cleanup , and nuclear weapons programs , and the bill now includes programs for fossil fuels , energy efficiency , the strategic petroleum reserve , and energy statistics , which formerly had been included in the interior and related agencies appropriations bill .

the fy2010 appropriations acts funded doe programs at $27.1 billion .

in addition , some of the $38.7 billion appropriated in the arra ( p.l .

111-5 ) for selected doe programs — primarily conservation and renewable energy , electricity delivery , fossil energy r&d , science , and environmental clean - up — remained unexpended in fy2010 .

for fy2011 , the obama administration requested $29.6 billion for doe programs .

the house - passed h.r .

1 continuing resolution would have funded doe programs at $24.6 billion .

the final legislation , p.l .

112-10 , appropriated $26.3 billion .

independent agencies that receive funding from the energy and water development bill include the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the appalachian regional commission ( arc ) , and the denali commission .

the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) requested $1.053 billion for fy2011 ( including $10.1 million for the inspector general's office ) , a decrease of $13.3 million from the fy2010 funding level .

major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors and oversight of nuclear materials users .

p.l .

112-10 provides $1.052.3 billion , including the inspector general .

the nrc budget request included $272.5 million for new reactor activities , a $7.8 million increase from fy2010 , largely to handle new nuclear power plant license applications .

until recently , no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to nrc since the 1970s .

however , volatile fossil fuel prices , the possibility of controls on carbon emissions , and incentives provided by the energy policy act of 2005 prompted electric utilities and other generating companies to apply for licenses for 30 reactors since september 2007 , with several more possible through 2011 .

however , several license applicants have suspended work on their projects .

nrc's proposed fy2011 budget also included $10 million from the nuclear waste fund for licensing doe's previously planned yucca mountain nuclear waste repository .

because the obama administration wants to cancel the yucca mountain project and filed a motion to withdraw the license application on march 3 , 2010 , the nrc funding request would cover the costs of adjudicating the license withdrawal motion ( which is being contested ) as well as "work related to an orderly closure of the agency's yucca mountain licensing support activities such as archiving material , knowledge capture and management , and maintenance of certain electronic systems," according to nrc's budget presentation .

the requested amount was included in p.l .

112-10 .

for regulation of operating reactors , nrc's fy2011 budget request included $531.6 million , $10.5 million below the fy2010 level .

those activities include reactor safety inspections , license renewals and modifications , collection and analysis of reactor performance data , and oversight of security exercises .

homeland security spending throughout nrc is to increase by $3.8 million in fy2011 , to $26.1 million .

 ( for more information on protecting licensed nuclear facilities , see crs report rl34331 , nuclear power plant security and vulnerabilities , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. ) .

the energy policy act of 2005 permanently extended a requirement that 90% of nrc's budget be offset by fees on licensees .

not subject to the offset are expenditures from the nuclear waste fund to pay for waste repository licensing , spending on general homeland security , and doe defense waste oversight .

the offsets in the fy2011 request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million , a $16.4 million decrease from fy2010 .

p.l .

112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million , including the inspector general's office .
