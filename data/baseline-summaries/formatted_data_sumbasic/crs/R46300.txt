the u.s. government's visa waiver program ( vwp ) allows eligible nationals from 39 countries to enter the united states for stays of fewer than 90 days for tourism or business purposes without applying for a visa from a u.s. embassy or consulate ( see figure 1 ) .

originally established in 1986 as a pilot program , the vwp was made permanent in 2000 .

vwp countries now account for the largest group of visitors to the united states other than travelers from neighboring canada and mexico .

in fy2018 , 22.8 million vwp visitors were admitted to the united states , the largest number of people ever to enter under the program in a single year , up almost 30% from 17.6 million in fy2008 .

countries that want to join the vwp must meet strict criteria , including signing on to information - sharing agreements , issuing tamper - proof travel documents , and upholding security standards at their borders .

travelers from vwp countries are not automatically guaranteed admission into the united states .

every vwp traveler must obtain preclearance to board a flight or ship to the united states through the electronic system for travel authorization ( esta ) .

this web - based application checks the traveler's information against relevant law enforcement and security databases and determines eligibility for travel under the vwp .

in addition , as with all international travelers , customs and border protection ( cbp ) officers may deny entry to a vwp traveler upon arrival .

this report offers an overview of the vwp .

it discusses the potential effects on national security and considers the likely economic effects on the u.s. travel and tourism industries if more countries were to be added to the program .

the report also reviews legislative proposals in the 116 th congress related to the expansion and implementation of the vwp , and legislation targeting u.s. travel promotionâânamely the brand usa program , which is partially funded by esta .

the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , in consultation with the department of state ( dos ) , has the authority to designate participants into the vwp .

the secretary of state must formally make the nomination ; dhs then conducts a final review and certifies that the aspiring participant meets all the requirements .

to be eligible , a country must comply with an extensive list of conditions specified in several different laws .

it must offer reciprocal privileges to u.s. citizens ; have had a nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate of less than 3% for the previous year or a lower average percentage over the previous two fiscal years ; issue electronic , machine - readable passports that contain a biometric identifier ( known as e - passports ) ; certify that it issues tamper - resistant , machine - readable visa documents that incorporate biometric identifiers , which are verifiable at the country's port of entry ; certify that it has in place mechanisms to validate machine - readable passports and e - passports at each port of entry ; enter into an agreement with the united states to report or make available through interpol information about the theft or loss of passports no later than 24 hours after a theft or loss is reported to the vwp country ; certify , to the maximum extent allowed under its laws , that it is screening each foreign national who is admitted or departs , using relevant interpol databases and notices , or other means designated by the secretary of homeland security ( this requirement only applies to countries that have an international airport ) ; accept the repatriation of any citizen , former citizen , or national against whom a final order of removal from the united states is issued no later than three weeks after the order is issued ; enter into and fully implement an agreement with the united states to share information regarding whether a national traveling to the united states represents a threat to u.s. security or welfare ; and be determined , by the secretary of homeland security , in consultation with the secretary of state , not to compromise the law enforcement or security interests of the united states by its inclusion in the program .

as of march 2020 , 31 european countries , 7 asia - pacific countries , and 1 country in south america are in the program ( see figure 1 ) .

since the establishment of the vwp , the number of participating countries has been increased several times and two countries have been removed .

the united kingdom was the first country to be admitted , in july 1988 , followed by japan in december of the same year ( see figure 3 ) .

six countries were added in 1989 .

an additional 13 countries were admitted in 1991 , and another eight countries joined from 1993 to 1999 .

there was a gap until 2008 , when another eight countries were admitted .

in the past 10 years , chile , greece , taiwan , and , most recently , poland have been added .

adding countries to the vwp is done through bilateral negotiations , and membership is often perceived as evidence of close ties with the unitedâ states .

argentina and uruguay are the only two countries that have been removed from the program , in 2002 and 2003 , respectively .

national security is a key goal of the vwp .

over the years , congress has continued to add security criteria for vwp participation .

one of the vwp's most significant security additions was esta , which was put in place in 2009 and is administered by dhs .

in addition , several laws require vwp partner countries to share information with the united states and to set standards for travel documentation .

nevertheless , debate remains as to whether the vwp sufficiently vets individual travelers prior to arrival at a u.s. port of entry .

a principal objective of the vwp is to boost the u.s. travel and tourism sectors by encouraging travel from high - volume and low - risk countries to the united states .

the number of international visitors arriving in the united states totaled 79.3 million in 2019 , down slightly from a record high of 79.7 million in 2018 .

because of the sharp decline in international travel in the wake of the covid - 19 pandemic , many international flights have been cancelled and visitor volume is likely to fall sharply in 2020 .

in 2018 , the travel and tourism sectors accounted for 2.9% of u.s. gross domestic product , a larger share than many other industries , including agriculture , mining , or utilities , and they directly and indirectly employed 9.2 million workers .

every dollar international visitors spend in the united states counts as an export .

collectively , foreign visitors spent about $256 billion in 2018 on domestic passenger fares aboard u.s. airlines and on travel - related goods and services , which makes tourism the united states' single - largest services sector export .

every year since 1989 , the u.s. travel and tourism industries have posted a trade surplus , which in 2018 was $69.6 billion .

travel - and tourism - related exports accounted for 31% of all u.s. services exports and 10% of total exports in 2018 .

each overseas visitor spends , on average , about $4,200 per trip in the united states on travel activities such as shopping , lodging , dining , and sightseeing .

according to the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) , international travelers account for a disproportionate amount of all travel and tourism spending in the united states .

one reason for this is that international visitors have relatively longer stays than domestic visitors , spending , on average , 18 nights in the united states .

travelers from vwp countries are among the highest in spending and visitor volume ( see table 1 ) .

however , an increasing number of overseas visitors come from non - vwp countries , notably china , venezuela , brazil , and india .

combined , these four non - vwp countries accounted for nearly 6.7 million visitors to the united states in 2019 , down 4% from a year earlier .

travelers from these countries spent more than $5,000 on average per trip during their visits to the united states , with visitors from china leading in country - level travel spending .

spending in the united states by visitors from large source markets has risen substantially in recent years , up 45% from china and 78% from india since 2013 .

proposals introduced in the 116 th congress would give dhs greater flexibility to admit countries into the vwp that do not meet the criteria discussed above .

representative mike quigley introduced the jobs originated through launching travel ( jolt ) act ( h.r .

2187 ) , which would reinstate dhs's authority to grant a waiver for the nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate .

that bill would also change the name of the vwp to secure travel partnership .

h.r .

1996 , also introduced by representative quigley , would solely rename the vwp to secure travel partnership .

representative dan lipinski introduced the allied nations travel modernization act ( h.r .

2946 ) , which would allow countries to be designated into the vwp if , instead of a low nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate , they have a low visa overstay rate and agree to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense ; according to the sponsor , the bill was drafted "to create an alternative pathway into the program for nato nations like poland. .

as noted above , poland was recently designated into the vwp .

in previous congresses , numerous bills have been introduced to designate israel and hong kong into the vwp .

senator john cornyn introduced the humanitarian upgrades to manage and assist our nation's enforcement ( humane ) act of 2019 ( s. 1303 ) ; among other provisions , it seeks to deter vwp overstays by amending the immigration and nationality act's terms and conditions of admission for vwp travelers , the vwp waiver of rights , and the detention and repatriation of visa waiver violators .

the 116 th congress also addressed the spending of esta funds .

senator mike enzi introduced the responsibly enhancing america's landscapes act ( s. 2783 ) , which would establish the national park service legacy restoration fund to help with the backlog of maintenance projects in national parks .

this fund would be paid for by increasing the esta fee by $16 , along with an increase in nonimmigrant visitor visa fees by $25 and a park fee increase of $5 .

the further consolidated appropriations act of 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) , which passed in december 2019 , extended the authority for brand usa to receive fees from the vwp through the end of september 2027 and raised the esta fee ( as described in " the vwp and u.s. travel promotion efforts " section above ) .

the private sector still must provide at least $100 million per year in in - kind contributions and cash to the brand usa program in order for it to receive these federal funds .
