on august 1 , 2018 , the world health organization ( who ) reported a new ebola outbreak in eastern drc , about a week after having declared the end of a separate outbreak in the west of the country .

as of september 24 , 2019 , the who had reported 3,175 cases in the current outbreak , including 2,119 deaths .

about 58% of all cases have been women and 28% children .

the current outbreak is the 10 th on record in drc , the largest to have occurred in the country , and the second largest ever , after the 2014-2016 ebola outbreak in west africa .

cases have been concentrated in north kivu and ituri provinces ( figure 1 ) , where long - running conflicts had already caused a protracted humanitarian crisis and are complicating ebola control efforts .

the number of new ebola cases identified per week has fluctuated since the start of the outbreak ( figure 2 ) , but has generally trended downward slowly since peaking in april 2019 .

the current outbreak has coincided with a fraught political transition process in drc .

a new president , parliament , provincial - level assemblies , and governors were elected between late 2018 and mid - 2019 , after years of delays , gridlock , political violence , and repression of opposition voices .

election delays in the ebola - affected areas , an opposition stronghold , heightened tensions and spurred conspiracy theories , arguably hindering ebola response .

president felix tshisekedi , inaugurated in january 2019 , was previously an opposition figure , but the coalition of his predecessor joseph kabila won supermajorities in parliament and at the provincial level .

observers questioned the legitimacy of the election results , and tense negotiations between the two political blocs ( tshisekedi's and kabila's ) delayed the naming of a new cabinet until late august 2019 , while complicating relations between the national and provincial / local officials .

several factors have foiled outbreak control efforts , including low ebola awareness ( early symptoms are similar to other common ailments like malaria ) , community distrust of health interventions , belated visits to health facilities ( at which point survival prospects decline rapidly ) , and infection prevention control lapses in health facilities .

attacks by militia and criminal groups , political protests , health worker strikes , and security force abuses have also disrupted and impeded the response .

in mid - september , for example , violent attacks in a new hotspot ( lwemba , ituri province ) after the death of a local healthcare worker from ebola prompted the indefinite suspension of ebola control activities in the area .

as a result , new cases continue to stem from unknown chains of transmission , and deaths continue to occur outside ebola treatment centers .

u.s. officials and other health experts have repeatedly raised concerns about broader challenges in drc related to its health care system , political tensions , local grievances , and instability .

usaid administrator mark green testified to congress in april 2019 that in drc , "you have a failed democracy in many , many waysâ¦ .

it will take more than simply a medical approach .

it will take a development approach to try to tackle this terrible disease and to contain its outbreak. .

after traveling to drc in august 2019 , administrator green wrote , "decades of corrupt , authoritarian rule during which communities were denied any meaningful voice in their government have undermined the congolese people's trust in institutions. .

health experts have been troubled by reports of ebola cases in major drc cities ( including the capital of north kivu , goma ) and outside of drc .

between june and august 2019 , a total of four cross - border cases were detected in uganda .

observers expressed optimism about the rapid detection and containment of these cases , but new concerns have arisen about subsequent suspected cases in tanzania .

in mid - september , who was informed by unofficial sources of a number of suspected ebola cases in that country , including in the capital city of dar es salaam , while tanzanian authorities asserted that there were no confirmed or suspected ebola cases in the country .

who has reportedly since sent personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and vaccination supplies to tanzania , and recommended that the sickened patients ( one of whom reportedly died ) receive secondary confirmation testing at a who facility .

as of september 21 , none of the cases had received secondary confirmation .

ebola control in other neighboring countries such as south sudan , burundi , or central africa republic , which have minimal state capacity and are affected by protracted conflicts and political crises , could be highly challenging if required .

outbreak control , treatment , and disease surveillance activities are being carried out primarily by drc government employees ( including health workers and frontline workers , who provide routine and essential services ) , as well as by international nongovernmental organizations , with u.n. agencies ( including the who ) , other multilateral entities ( including the world bank ) , and foreign governments providing funding , expertise , coordination , and logistical assistance .

classic ebola outbreak control protocol entails infection prevention control ( ipc ) in health care facilities ; management and isolation of patients in ebola treatment centers ( etcs ) ; fever surveillance with rapid diagnosis ; tracing of ebola cases and their contacts ; and community awareness and adherence to ipc protocols , safe patient and body transport , safe burials , and household and environmental decontamination .

the extraordinary conditions on the ground in affected areas of eastern drc have limited the effectiveness of conventional control measures , however , and are requiring ever - evolving strategies for containment , including aggressive vaccination campaigns ( see text box below ) .

since the who declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) in july 2019 , it has sought to garner additional donor funds , as well as international support for addressing the political and security issues affecting ebola control .

in july 2019 , the who and the drc ministry of health ( moh ) released a fourth strategic response plan to "definitively defeat" the ebola epidemic ( table 1 ) .

the strategic plan is expected to cost over $462 million , including about $288 million for the public health response portion ( table 1 ) .

in july 2019 , the world bank announced that it would provide $300 million toward the plan , about half of which would support the public health response , on top of prior funding commitments ( discussed below ) .

the public health portion of the strategic plan , covering july 1 through december 31 , 2019 , purportedly takes into account lessons learned from the third strategic response plan ( february through july 2019 ) .

this portion of the plan is based on strengthening political commitment , security , and operational support to improve acceptance of the response and access to insecure areas ; deepening support for addressing the varied needs of communities affected by ebola ( beyond a single - minded focus on containment efforts ) , as a means toward fostering community ownership and involvement in ebola responses ; improving financial planning , monitoring and reporting ; and bolstering preparedness of neighboring provinces and countries .

the world bank has urged other countries to provide additional support , and the who director - general has urged donors to address disbursement delays .

as of september 11 , 2019 , the who had received less than $60 million of the $288 million it sought for the current phase of the public health response .

the united states is the top country donor for the public health response and has provided almost $158 million for the ebola humanitarian response , largely supporting activities by nongovernmental organizations ( ngos ) , as discussed below .

in fy2015 , in the context of the west africa outbreak , congress appropriated $5.1 billion for ebola response and preparedness on an emergency basis , including $1.436 billion in multiyear international disaster assistance ( ida ) funds ( title ix of division j , p.l .

113-235 ) .

u.s. funding for responding to the current outbreak has drawn primarily on the unobligated balance of these ida funds .

according to usaid , $105.5 million of these funds remained available for expenditure as of september 9 , 2019 .

should the outbreak continue or expand in new ways , congress may consider what funding mechanisms , if any , the united states might use to support ebola control .

at the same time , the united states remains the lead country donor to the current ebola response effort .

members may examine the u.s. role , vis - ã  - vis other actors ( including other countries , multilateral entities , and private sources ) , in financing ebola response activities , and may debate strategies for securing additional contributions from other donors .

drc is ranked as "tier iii" ( worst ) under the trafficking victims protection act ( tvpa , p.l .

106-386 , as amended ) , which triggers prohibitions on certain types of u.s. aid absent a full or partial presidential waiver .

in fy2019 , in a departure from previous practice , president trump did not partially waive the restrictions for drc .

thus , pursuant to the tvpa , no "nonhumanitarian , nontrade - related" assistance may be provided "to the government" of drc .

ida funds , the core source of funding for u.s. ebola response support to date , are exempt from the tvpa restrictions ( 22 u.s.c .

â§7102[10] ) .

the tvpa further exempts economic and development assistance "in support of programs of nongovernmental organizations. .

in practice , the administration has interpreted the tvpa restrictions to apply broadly to various programs funded through the development assistance ( da ) and economic support fund ( esf ) accounts , including some that would be implemented by ngos , though it has not publicly provided a full account of affected activities .

some members of congress have expressed concern that some u.s. assistance that could help promote humanitarian access in ebola - affected areas has been held up as a result .

testifying before the senate in july 2019 , a senior usaid official affirmed that some fy2018 aid resources that could help with ebola control remained restricted in connection with the tvpa , but he and other administration witnesses did not provide further details .

two bills introduced in the 116 th congress ( s. 1340 , the ebola eradication act of 2019 , and h.r .

3085 , a house companion bill ) would authorize assistance for a range of activities that could help lower community resistance or otherwise support ebola control efforts in drc and neighboring states , "notwithstanding" the tvpa restrictions .

s. 1340 passed the senate on september 23 , 2019 .

similar language was included in a draft fy2020 state , foreign operations appropriations bill circulated by the senate appropriations committee on september 18 , 2019 .

that bill would also broadly provide at least $298.3 million in u.s. bilateral assistance for "stabilization , global health , and bilateral economic assistance" to drcâslightly higher than the u.s. allocation for drc in recent years , not counting food aidâ"including in areas affected by , and at risk from , the ebola virus disease. .

the current ebola outbreak has prompted resumption of discussions about strengthening health systems worldwide , particularly with regard to pandemic preparedness .

in 2014 , during the obama administration , the united states and the who co - launched the global health security agenda ( ghsa ) to improve countries' ability to prevent , detect , and respond to infectious disease threats .

the united states , the largest donor to this multilateral effort , pledged to support it with $1 billion from fy2015 through fy2019 .

the trump administration has built on these efforts .

in may 2019 , the white house released the united states government global health security strategy , which outlined the u.s. role in extending the global health security agenda and improving global health security worldwide .

although the trump administration , through the strategy and public statements , has supported extending the ghsa through 2024 , officials have not provided comprehensive information on what that support would entail .

members of congress may continue to debate what role , if any , the united states should play in supporting global health system strengthening efforts to bolster global health security , and whether to adjust funding levels to meet ongoing and future infectious disease threats .

through regular appropriations , disease outbreak prevention and global health security efforts are funded through usaid pandemic influenza and cdc global health protection line items ( table 2 ) .

on september 19 , 2019 , the house passed the continuing appropriations act , 2020 , and health extenders act of 2019 ( h.r .

4378 ) , which would authorize the transfer to the cdc of up to $20 million for ebola preparedness and response activities from the infectious disease rapid response reserve fund .

other relevant bills introduced in the 116 th congress include h.r .

2166 , which would codify u.s. engagement in the ghsa as specified in an executive order issued by the obama administration , and h.r .

826 , which seeks to facilitate research and treatment of neglected tropical diseases , including ebola .
