almost four decades after the supreme court ruling in regents of the university of california v. bakke , the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy .

many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination , but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty .

justice powell , in his opinion for the bakke court , stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is "a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education," noting that "[t]he atmosphere of 'speculation , experiment , and creation' so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body. .

in subsequent years , however , federal courts began to question the powell rationale , unsettling expectations about whether diversity - based affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring decisions is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment .

in striking down the admissions process at the university of texas school of law , the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit in hopwood v. texas concluded that any use of race in the admissions process was forbidden by the constitution .

reverberations of the 1996 hopwood opinion are apparent in several subsequent cases , which voided race - conscious policies maintained by institutions of higher education , as well as public elementary and secondary schools .

some judges avoided resolving the precedential effect of justice powell's opinion by deciding the case on other grounds not dependent on the constitutional status of student diversity as a compelling state interest .

but , in johnson v. board of regents , the eleventh circuit court of appeals sided with hopwood by rejecting diversity as constitutional justification for a numerical "racial bonus" awarded minority freshman applicants to the university of georgia .

a circuit court conflict was created when the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit relied on bakke to uphold an affirmative action admissions policy to the university of washington law school that made extensive use of race - based factors .

smith v. university of washington was the first federal appeals court to rely on justice powell's decision as binding precedent on the issue .

the judicial divide over bakke 's legacy was vividly underscored by a pair of separate trial court decisions , one upholding for diversity reasons the race - based undergraduate admissions policy of the university of michigan , the other voiding a special minority law school admissions program at the same institution .

restoring a degree of clarity to the law , the supreme court concluded its 2002 term with rulings in the michigan cases .

in grutter v. bollinger , a 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the law school had a compelling interest in the "educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body," which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble a "critical mass" of underrepresented minority students .

but in a companion decision , gratz v. bollinger , six justices decided that the university's policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional scrutiny .

however , the grutter and gratz decisions did not address whether diversity is a permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting .

to resolve this question , the court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools .

the cases were meredith v. jefferson county board of education — formerly macfarland v. jefferson county public schools — and parents involved in community schools v. seattle school district no .

1 .

in parents involved in community schools v. seattle school district no .

1 , a consolidated 2007 ruling that resolved both cases , the court ultimately struck down the school plans at issue , holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment .

more recently , the court's decision to hear challenges in two separate affirmative action cases has once again revived the issue of diversity in higher education .

in its 2013 ruling in fisher v. university of texas at austin , the court reaffirmed its holding in grutter , but nevertheless vacated and remanded an appellate court's decision to uphold a race - conscious undergraduate admissions plan at the university of texas at austin .

however , on remand , the appellate court upheld the university's admissions program for a second time , a decision that appeared to prompt the court to agree to review the case yet again during its 2015 term .

meanwhile , in 2014's schuette v. coalition to defend affirmative action , the court upheld michigan's proposal 2 , which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education .

the first part of this report briefly reviews the judicial evolution of race - based affirmative action , particularly in relation to public education .

the report then reviews major rulings involving challenges to the use of race - conscious admissions , and concludes with a discussion of the implications for the future of affirmative action law .

the origins of affirmative action law may be traced to the early 1960s as first the warren , and then the burger court , grappled with the seemingly intractable problem of racial segregation in the nation's public schools .

judicial rulings from this period recognized an "affirmative duty," cast upon local school boards by the equal protection clause , to desegregate formerly "dual school" systems and to eliminate "root and branch" the last "vestiges" of state - enforced segregation .

these holdings ushered in a two - decade era of massive desegregation — first in the south , and later the urban north — marked by federal desegregation orders frequently requiring drastic reconfiguration of school attendance patterns along racial lines and extensive student transportation schemes .

school districts across the nation operating under these decrees have since sought to be declared in compliance with constitutional requirements in order to gain release from federal intervention .

the supreme court eventually responded by holding that judicial control of a school system previously found guilty of intentional segregation should be relinquished if , looking to all aspects of school operations , it appears that the district has complied with desegregation requirements in "good faith" for a "reasonable period of time" and has eliminated "vestiges" of past discrimination "to the extent practicable. .

a statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education was enacted by the civil rights act of 1964 .

public and private employers with 15 or more employees are subject to a comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under title vii of the 1964 act .

the title vii remedial scheme rests largely on judicial power to order monetary damages and injunctive relief , including "such affirmative action as may be appropriate," to make discrimination victims whole .

except as may be imposed by court order or consent decree to remedy past discrimination , however , there is no general statutory obligation on employers to adopt affirmative action remedies .

but the equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) has issued guidelines to protect employers and unions from charges of "reverse discrimination" when they voluntarily take action to correct the effects of past discrimination .

the term "affirmative action" resurfaced in federal regulations construing the 1964 act's title vi , which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs or activities , including public or private educational institutions .

the office of civil rights of the department of education interpreted title vi to require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination and to encourage "voluntary affirmative action to attain a diverse student body. .

another title vi regulation permits a college or university to take racial or national origin into account when awarding financial aid if the aid is necessary to overcome effects of past institutional discrimination .

affirmative action in higher education also came before congress in 1998 , when the full house defeated a bill to prohibit federal aid to colleges and universities that consider race , ethnicity , or sex in the admission process .

the bakke ruling in 1978 launched the contemporary constitutional debate over state - sponsored affirmative action .

a "notable lack of unanimity" was evident from the six separate opinions filed in that case .

one four - justice plurality in bakke voted to strike down as a violation of title vi a special admissions program of the university of california at davis medical school which set aside 16 of 100 positions in each incoming class for minority students , though the institution itself was not shown to have discriminated in the past .

another bloc of four justices argued that racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes were foreclosed neither by the constitution nor the civil rights act and would have upheld the minority admissions quota .

justice powell added a fifth vote to each camp by condemning the davis program on equal protection grounds , while endorsing the nonexclusive consideration of race as an admissions criterion to foster student diversity .

in justice powell's view , neither the state's asserted interest in remedying societal discrimination , nor of providing role models for minority students was sufficiently compelling to warrant the use of a suspect racial classification in the admission process .

but the attainment of a "diverse student body" was , for justice powell , "clearly a permissible goal for an institution of higher education" since diversity of minority viewpoints furthered "academic freedom," a "special concern of the first amendment. .

accordingly , race could be considered by a university as a "plus" or "one element of a range of factors" — even if it "tipped the scale" among qualified applicants — as long as it "did not insulate the individual from comparison with all the other candidates for the available seats. .

the "quota" in bakke was infirm , however , since it defined diversity only in racial terms and absolutely excluded non - minorities from a given number of seats .

by two 5-to - 4 votes , therefore , the supreme court affirmed the lower court order admitting bakke but reversed the judicial ban on consideration of race in admissions .

bakke was followed by wygant v. jackson board of education , where a divided court ruled unconstitutional the provision of a collective bargaining agreement that protected minority public school teachers from layoff at the expense of more senior white faculty members .

while holding the specific layoff preference for minority teachers unconstitutional , seven wygant justices seemed to agree in principle that a governmental employer is not prohibited by the equal protection clause from all race - conscious affirmative action to remedy its own past discrimination .

another series of decisions approved of congressionally mandated racial preferences to allocate the benefits of contracts on federally sponsored public works projects , and in the design of certain broadcast licensing schemes , while condemning similar actions taken by local governmental entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs .

however , in each of these cases , the justices failed to achieve a consensus on most issues , with bare majorities , pluralities , or — as in bakke — a single justice , determining the outcome of the case .

by the mid - 1980s , the supreme court had approved the temporary remedial use of race - or gender - conscious selection criteria by private employers under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act .

these measures were deemed a proper remedy for "manifest racial imbalance" in "traditionally segregated" job categories , if voluntarily adopted by the employer , or for entrenched patterns of "egregious and longstanding" discrimination by the employer , if imposed by judicial decree .

in either circumstance , however , the court required proof of remedial justification rooted in the employer's own past discrimination and its persistent workplace effects .

thus , a "firm basis" in evidence , as revealed by a "manifest imbalance" — or "historic," "persistent," and "egregious" underrepresentation — of minorities or women in affected job categories was deemed an essential predicate to preferential affirmative action .

second , but of equal importance , all racial preferences in employment were to be judged in terms of their adverse impact on "identifiable" non - minority group members .

remedies that protected minorities from layoff , for example , were most suspect and unlikely to pass legal or constitutional muster if they displaced more senior white workers .

but the consideration of race or gender as a "plus" factor in employment decisions , when it did not unduly hinder the legitimate expectations of non - minority employees , won ready judicial acceptance .

affirmative action preferences , however , had to be sufficiently flexible , temporary in duration , and narrowly tailored to avoid becoming rigid quotas .

not until 1989 , however , did a majority of the justices resolve the proper constitutional standard for reviewing equal protection challenges to governmental classifications by race enacted for a remedial or other benign legislative purpose .

disputes prior to city of richmond v. j.a .

croson yielded divergent views as to whether state affirmative action measures for the benefit of racial minorities were subject to the same strict scrutiny as applied to invidious racial discrimination under the equal protection clause , an intermediate standard resembling the test for gender - based classifications , or simple rationality .

in croson , a 5-to - 4 majority settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate a 30% set - aside of city contracts for minority - owned businesses because the program was not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest .

while race - conscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination by the affected governmental entities , racial balancing untailored to specific and identified evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible .

croson suggested , however , that because of its unique equal protection enforcement authority , a constitutional standard more tolerant of racial line - drawing may apply to congress .

this conclusion was reinforced a year later when , in metro broadcasting , inc. v. fcc , the court upheld certain minority broadcast licensing schemes approved by congress to promote the important governmental interest in broadcast diversity .

the two - tiered approach to equal protection analysis of governmental affirmative action was short - lived .

in adarand constructors , inc. v. pena , the court applied "strict scrutiny" to a federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals," defined so as to prefer members of designated racial minorities .

although the court refrained from deciding the constitutional merits of the particular program before it , and remanded for further proceedings below , it determined that all racial classifications by government at any level must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end .

but the majority opinion sought to "dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict in theory , but fatal in fact,'" by acknowledging a role for congress as architect of remedies for discrimination nationwide .

"the unhappy persistence of both the practices and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate reality , and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. .

no further guidance was provided , however , as to the scope of remedial power remaining in congressional hands , or of the conditions required for its exercise .

bottom line , adarand suggests that racial preferences in federal law or policy are a remedy of last resort and must be adequately justified and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster .

over the years , the supreme court has addressed the constitutionality of affirmative action in a variety of educational contexts , including both higher education and elementary and secondary education .

each of these contexts is discussed separately below .

the michigan cases resolved an issue that had vexed the lower federal courts for a quarter - century .

historically , judicial insistence on strict scrutiny has largely condemned governmental distinctions based on race , except in the most narrowly circumscribed circumstances .

to the short list of governmental interests sufficiently compelling to warrant race - based decisionmaking , a majority of the court added the pursuit of diversity in higher education .

but this expansion has been curtailed somewhat by the court's more recent pronouncement involving elementary and secondary school plans to promote racial diversity , its less deferential approach in fisher , and its subsequent decision to reconsider ut's admissions plan during the upcoming term .

although the court's decision to strike down the seattle and louisville school assignment and transfer plans likely had a profound impact on similar plans at many of the nation's elementary and secondary schools , the parents involved in community schools case did not completely foreclose the possibility that school districts may constitutionally pursue certain measures to avoid racial isolation , prevent resegregation , and promote racial diversity in their schools .

however , it is not entirely clear what these measures might entail .

while the facially race - neutral methods identified in justice kennedy's concurring opinion — such as engaging in strategic site selection of new schools , altering attendance zones , providing resources for special programs , and recruiting students and faculty — seem more likely to survive judicial scrutiny , the fate of other kinds of race - conscious school plans may become apparent only as a result of legal developments that emerge over time .

indeed , there is evidence that some school districts are abandoning race - based school assignment plans in favor of plans based on socioeconomic status , which is a non - suspect classification for purposes of constitutional review .

likewise , some colleges and universities have taken similar steps in anticipation of judicial rulings limiting the use of race in higher education .

meanwhile , the seeds of future controversy may lie in questions arguably raised but not fully addressed by the latest rulings .

for example , the court's latest rulings left unanswered the constitutional status of racially exclusive diversity policies not directly involving admissions , such as the legality of race - based scholarship and financial aid , recruitment and outreach , or college preparation courses that exclusively target minority populations .

in addition , the question of whether schools or universities may completely avoid constitutional shoals by adopting race - neutral plans to increase racial diversity may not be fully answered by the court's latest rulings .

such race - neutral alternatives include percentage plans like those approved in texas , florida , and california that guarantee college admission to top graduates from every state high school , regardless of race .

in addition to percentage plans , educational authorities have experimented with other forms of alternative action , or policies designed to promote racial diversity without relying on racial preferences .

class - based affirmative action , for example , takes socioeconomic status or the family educational background of students into account .

such strategies may include replacing race and ethnicity with other socioeconomic and geographical proxies for diversity ; increasing need - based financial aid programs ; improving low - performing primary and secondary schools ; providing additional educational services at such schools ; and considering diversity or hardship essays in which applicants describe challenging life experiences such as poverty , english as a second language , or having a family member in prison .

by avoiding the use of explicit racial classifications and dual - track admission policies , these efforts are far less susceptible to facial challenge as an equal protection violation .

programs involving the explicit consideration of race remain most at risk .

but policies that employ nonracial factors as a proxy for race may be vulnerable if the purpose or intent is to benefit minority groups .

in washington v. davis and related rulings , the supreme court determined that a race - neutral law with a disparate racial impact on minority groups is subject to strict scrutiny if it is enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose .

racial motive was made a constitutional touchstone for equal protection analysis , and whether reflected by a racial classification or other evidence of discriminatory purpose , strict scrutiny was triggered by evidence of such intent .

similarly , alternatives to traditional racial diversity policies may not escape strict judicial scrutiny if an objecting non - minority applicant is able to show that the plan was racially motivated .

the same limitations may apply to private institutions , which are immune from constitutional limitations , under title vi of the 1964 civil rights act .

beyond education , issues may inevitably arise concerning the implications of grutter , parents involved in community schools , and fisher on efforts to achieve racial diversity in other social and economic spheres .

to date , the court has permitted race - conscious hiring criteria by private employers under title vii , either as a remedy for past discrimination or to redress a "conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories," but refused to find that a state's interest in faculty diversity to provide teacher role models was sufficiently compelling to warrant a race - conscious layoff policy .

lower courts are similarly divided , though a few have applied an "operational need analysis" to uphold police force diversity policies , recognizing "that 'a law enforcement body's need to carry out its mission effectively , with a workforce that appears unbiased , is able to communicate with the public and is respected by the community it serves,' may constitute a compelling state interest. .

but current standards under the federal civil rights laws generally allow for consideration of race in hiring and promotion decisions only in response to demonstrable evidence of past discrimination by the employer or within the affected industry .

no rule of deference like that extended to educational institutions has been recognized for employers , nor is one likely to be applied in the wake of parents involved in community schools or fisher .
