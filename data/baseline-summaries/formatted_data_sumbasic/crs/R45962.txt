mapping broadband availability , which means graphically displaying where broadband is and is not available on a map , is complex and depends on dataâwith the accuracy of the map depending on the accuracy of the data used to compose the map .

congress has an interest in accurate broadband mapping data , because accurate data can help ensure that federal broadband programs target areas of the country that are most in need of assistance .

the telecommunications act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-104 ) requires the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to determine annually whether broadband is being deployed to all americans on a timely basis , and the fcc relies on broadband mapping data to make this determination .

additionally , the fcc uses broadband mapping data to direct billions of dollars per year to deploy broadband in unserved or underserved areas .

congress has also taken an interest in broadband mapping due to concerns from constituents that certain areas , especially rural areas , remain underserved or unserved .

pinpointing where broadband is and is not available in the united states has been an ongoing challenge .

current data on broadband availability is provided by private telecommunications providers , collected by the fcc , and displayed on the fcc's fixed broadband deployment map .

difficulty in accurately mapping broadband availability has been attributed to a number of factors , including the adequacy of census block data , the lack of independent data validation outside the fcc , and the absence of a challenge process for consumers and other entities that believe the fixed broadband deployment map may overstate availability in their area .

in early 2019 , it came to the fcc's attention that inaccuracies in the fixed broadband deployment map's broadband data may cause broadband deployment to be overstated .

the fixed broadband deployment map may indicate that areas have access to broadband when in reality , they do not .

inaccurate data on broadband deployment could lead to overbuilding in areas that currently have broadband while leaving other areas underserved or unserved .

in the 116 th congress , numerous pieces of legislation on improving broadband mapping efforts have been introduced , and multiple hearings have been held on the issue .

in august 2019 , the fcc adopted a report and order to establish a new digital opportunity data collection ( dodc ) .

the goal of this effort is to make the fixed broadband deployment map more accurate and reliable byâamong other thingsâincorporating public feedback and obtaining additional granularity of data .

options for congress in this area could include oversight of the fcc effort and additional legislative action to improve the accuracy of broadband mapping .

the term broadband commonly refers to high - speed internet access that is faster than dial - up access and is immediately accessible .

broadband includes several high - speed transmission technologies , such as: digital subscriber line ( dsl ) , cable modem , fiber , wireless , satellite , and broadband over power lines ( bpl ) .

the internet became publicly available in the 1990s and has evolved since that time as information has continually become digital ( eg , job applications and government forms have moved online ) .

however , not all americans currently have equal access to broadband .

as methods to reach the internet have evolved , so have speeds , with the fcc's current broadband benchmark speed set at 25 megabits per second ( mbps ) download and 3 mbps upload ( 25 / 3 ) .

table 1 shows how the fcc's broadband definition has changed from 1996 to its current definition , which was adopted in 2015 .

the term digital divide refers to a gap between those americans who use or have access to telecommunications and information technologies and those who do not .

while urban areas likely see speeds close to 25 / 3 , broadband speeds in rural areas often do not approach that speedâwith some areas having no access to broadband .

several factors contribute to geographic disparity , including terrain , population density , demography , and other market factors .

these factors discourage build - out to areas that are not as densely populated , because they typically result in a lower return on investment for broadband providers .

although strides have been made in the deployment of broadband to rural areas , the urban / rural digital divide persists .

in a survey conducted by the pew research center in 2018 , adults who live in rural areas were more likely to say that getting access to high - speed internet is a major problem in their local communities .

the primary goal of broadband mapping is to identify areas without access to broadband so that policymakers can make informed decisions on policies to address the urban / rural digital divide .

the major federal agencies involved in broadband mapping are the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) in the department of commerce , the fcc , and the department of agriculture ( usda ) .

accurate broadband data and mapping helps policymakers to make informed decisions about where federal funding should be directed , such as with the fcc's upcoming rural digital opportunity fund , and enables federal agencies to fulfill certain statutory requirements , such as the fcc's annual "reasonable and timely deployment" determination .

difficulty in mapping broadband availability has been attributed to a number of factors , including lack of data granularity , overstated availability , lack of independent data validation , and the difficulty in keeping up with real - time deployments .

as congress considers broadband mapping , it may consider ways to address the challenges of data granularity and lack of validation , the frequent differences between advertised and actual broadband speeds , the balance between short - term and long - term solutions , ways to improve interagency coordination , and state efforts that might be models for future federal action .

some of these issues are address by legislation already introduced in the 116 th congress ( see appendix a ) .

broadband mapping has garnered congressional interest since the creation of the sbi under the broadband data improvement act ( p.l .

110-385 ) and introduction of the ntia's national broadband map .

mapping efforts have continually improved since that time , but congressional interest in mapping accuracy has been heightened due to recent challenges that have resulted in potential overstatement of broadband availability .

the fcc's dodc , which will take effect once specifications for the coverage polygons are defined through the fcc's comment - and - reply process , is a first step in obtaining more granular and accurate broadband mapping data .

as the new collection effort unfolds , congress may take an interest in monitoring whether the effort seems sufficient to alleviate the current broadband mapping issues , whether to wait on distribution of federal funding until the map is determined accurate , or whether additional legislative action should be taken .
