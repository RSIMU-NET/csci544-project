more than 80 benefit programs provide cash and noncash aid that is directedprimarily to persons with limited income .

these benefit programs cost $522.2 billionin fy2002 , a record high .

this sum was up $45.3 billion ( 9.5% ) from the previouspeak of fy2001 , and it equaled 5% of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) .

federalfunds provided 71.5% of the total .

higher medical spending accounted for $32.8billion of the year's net increase , and 54 cents out of every welfare dollar went formedical benefits .

federal welfare outlays represented 18.6% of the federal budget,with 8% attributed to medical assistance .

see table 1 for fy2000-fy2002summary .

after adjustment for price inflation , 2002 welfare spending was up $38.2 billion ( 7.9% ) from that of 2001 , the previous peak .

real spending increases ( 2002 dollars ) were dominated by medical assistance ( up $29.1 billion ) .

other increases were:education benefits,$ 4.1 billion ; food benefits , $3.3 billion ; housing , $2.3 billion ; andservices , $1.2 billion .

outlays for cash aid dropped by $1.2 billion ; and for jobs andtraining , by $0.5 billion .

spending for "human capital" programs ( ones providing education and employment and training activities ) accounted for 7.3% of all welfare dollars ( compared with 19.6% for cash assistance ) .

this report consists of a catalog of 85 need - based programs .

 ( 1 ) for each programthe report provides the funding formula , eligibility requirements , and benefit levels .

at the back of the report , summary table 14 gives expenditure data ( federal andstate / local ) and recipient data for fy2000-fy2002 by program .

two programs arenew to this series of reports: farmers' market nutrition programs ( formerly treatedas a component of the food stamp program ) and housing assistance for specialpopulations - - elderly and disabled .

historical tables have been revised to accountfor these additions .

most of these programs base eligibility on individual , household , or family income , but some use group or area income tests ( see table 7 - - page 16 ) ; and afew offer help on the basis of presumed "need. .

most provide income "transfers. .

that is , they transfer income , in the form of cash , goods , or services , to persons whomake no payment and render no service in return .

however , in the case of the joband training programs and some educational benefits , recipients must work or studyfor wages , training allowances , stipends , grants , or loans .

further , the tanf blockgrant program requires adults to commence work ( defined by the state ) after a periodof enrollment , the food stamp program imposes work and training requirements,and public housing programs require recipients to engage in "self - sufficiency"activities or to perform community service .

finally , the earned income tax credit ( eitc. ) .

is available only to workers .

this report excludes income maintenance programs that are not income - tested , including social insurance and many veterans' benefits , and all but two tax - transferprograms .

thus , it excludes social security cash benefits , unemploymentcompensation , and medicare .

outlays for the old - age , survivors , and disabilityinsurance programs ( social security cash benefit programs ) in fy2002 totaled $456billion , financed primarily from payroll tax collections .

the report also excludespayments , even though financed with general revenues , that may be regarded as"deferred compensation," such as veterans' housing benefits and medical care forveterans with a service - connected disability .

the report includes two tax - transfer programs , the eitc for low - income workers with children and the child tax credit .

the eitc reduces the taxes ofworking families with gross income below specified limits and makes directpayments ( "refunds" ) to those whose income is below the tax threshold or whose taxliability is smaller than their credit .

before the 2001 tax law , the child tax credit wasrefundable only to some taxpayers with three or more children , but it now isrefundable ( up to certain limits ) for those with earnings above $10,000 .

this reporttreats the direct payment component of these credits , but not the reduction in taxliability , as a welfare expenditure .

other tax benefits are excluded from the reportbecause they are not refundable ( make no direct payments ) .

further , in most casesthey impose no income test for eligibility .

examples of these other tax benefits arethe deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes on owner - occupied homes ( equivalent to outlays of $63.3 billion and $21.8 billion , respectively , in 2002 ) .

these tax transfers increase families' disposable income by reducing their taxliability and are known as "tax expenditures. .

 ( the standard deduction and personalexemption in the income tax code also decrease families' taxable income. ) .

note: program data on which this table is based are found in summary table ( table 14 ) at the back of the report .

the dramatic change since 1978 in the composition of total spending forincome - tested benefits is shown in figure 2 and in table 6 .

in fy1978spending forcash relief and medical aid was about equal .

each accounted for 29% of total welfarespending covered by this report .

thereafter , outlays for medical benefits rapidlyovertook cash aid , topping 50% in fy2000 and reaching 54% in 2002 .

the eligibility of noncitizens for major federal means - tested benefit programslargely depends on their immigration status and whether they arrived in the unitedstates , or were enrolled in a benefit program , before enactment of the 1996 welfarelaw ( p.l .

104-193 ) on august 22 , 1996 .

that law sharply restricted welfareeligibility for noncitizens , though it has since been modified .

for noncitizensentering after august 22 , 1996 , many of the restrictions imposed by the 1996 lawremain essentially unchanged .

however , for persons who legally resided in theunited states before enactment of the new law , provisions have been significantlyrevised by 1997 , 1998 , and 2002 amendments .

the most significant recent change ( made in the 2002 farm bill , p.l .

107-171 ) opened up food stamp eligibility to alllegal permanent resident ( lpr ) children , regardless of date of entry or length ofresidence , and to legal permanent residents ( lprs ) who meet a 5-year residence test .

those lprs who were admitted to the united states as refugees and asylees are treated differently from other lprs , as follows: refugees and asylees .

eligible for ssi benefits , medicaid , and food stamps for 7 years after arrival , and for 5 years for tanf .

after this term , they generally areineligible for ssi , but states may extend federally aided tanf and medicaid to them .

legal permanent residents ( lprs ) who have a work history or military connection .

if they have ( a ) a substantial work history , generally 10 years ( 40 quarters ) of work documentedby social security or other employment records , or ( b ) a military connection ( activeduty military personnel , veterans , and their families ) , lprs are eligible for majorbenefits ; who were legally resident as of august 22 , 1996 .

if theyreceived ssi as of august 22 , 1996 , these lprs continue to be eligible for ssi .

ifthey are disabled , they are eligible for ssi and , as a result , for food stamps ( regardlessof the date of disability ) .

if they were elderly ( 65+ ) as of august 22 , 1996 , they areeligible for food stamps .

if they were children ( under 18 ) as of august 22 , 1996 , theyare eligible for food stamps until they become 18 ; who are qualified ssi recipients .

if they meet ssi noncitizeneligibility tests , these lprs must receive medicaid ; and who entered the united states after august 22 , 1996 .

theselprs are barred from tanf , food stamps , and medicaid for 5 years .

thereafter , thestate may extend federally - aided tanf , food stamps , and medicaid to them .

 ( anotable exception is that lpr children are eligible for food stamps no matter whenthey entered the country or how long they have lived here. ) .

the census bureau reports that 7.2 million families ( including 5.4 million withchildren ) in 2002 had total pre - tax money income - - after counting any cash from thewelfare programs of tanf , supplemental security income ( ssi ) , and generalassistance ( ga ) - - that was below their poverty threshold .

 ( 4 ) the bureau found thatthe money income poverty rate among related children in families was 16.3% , thehighest since 1999 ( 16.6% ) .

overall , 34.6 million persons were classified as poor on the basis of 2002 pre - tax money income ( compared with 31.1 millions in 2000 ) .

of these persons,66.6% were in households that received means - tested aid from at least one of eightprograms ( tanf , ssi , ga , school lunch , food stamps , medicaid , subsidizedhousing , low - income home energy assistance ) .

by race and ethnicity , the followingpercentages of poor persons were in households that received pre - tax aid from oneor more of the eight programs: non hispanic whites , 53.5% , blacks , 80% , andpersons of hispanic origin , 78.6% .

figure 3 depicts income - tested aid provided to families with children who were poor before receiving any cash aid from tanf , ga , or the eitc .

in 2002 , thesefamilies totaled 5.7 million ( compared with 5.1 million in 2000 ) : 3.4 million witha female householder and 2.3 million with a male householder ( chiefly two - parentfamilies ) .

these numbers , based on crs estimates , include unrelated subfamilies ( the bureau excludes these subfamilies from its "family" counts ) .

as the chartshows , all but 8.9% of the female - headed families and 11.8% of the male - presentfamilies whose pre - tax , pre - welfare money income fell short of the poverty thresholdreceived means - tested aid .

for male - present families , the eitc , which goes only topersons with earnings , was the dominant form of aid .

in all , 71.7% of male - presentfamilies who were poor before transfers received the eitc ( compared with 75.2%in 2000 ) ; for 25.4% it was the only aid .

among female - headed families who werepoor before transfers , 53.7% received the eitc ( compared with 59.6% in 2000 ) ; for11.7% it was the only aid .

various combinations of cash assistance ( tanf , ga,eitc ) and noncash aid ( food stamps , housing subsidies , medicaid or coverage underthe state children's health insurance program ( s - chip ) , went to 23.5% offemale - headed families and to 10.6% of male - present families .

 ( 5 ) .

more than 90% of the programs in this report have an explicit test of income .

the others base eligibility on area of residence , enrollment in another welfareprogram , or other factors that presume need .

the explicit income tests are of fivekinds: income ceiling related to ( 1 ) one of the federal government's official povertymeasures ( federal poverty income guidelines or census bureau poverty thresholds ) ; ( 2 ) state or area median income ; ( 3 ) the lower living standard income level of thebureau of labor statistics ; ( 4 ) an absolute dollar standard ; ( 5 ) level deemed toindicate "need. .

for llsils for other family sizes , see federal register entry noted above .

b .

the llsil is used for several purposes under the workforce investment act ( wia ) .

wia defines "low income individual" for eligibility purposes in termsof the llsil or the poverty line .

for purposes of state formula allotments , itdefines the terms "disadvantaged adult" or "disadvantaged youth" in terms ofthe llsil or the poverty line .

c. to assess whether employment will lead to "self - sufficiency," wia sets 100% ofthe llsil as the minimum pay needed .

d. wia provides that the terms "low - income" person and "disadvantaged adult" maybe defined as a member of a family that received total family income that , inrelation to family size , does not exceed 70% of the llsil .

further , the internalrevenue code provides that the term "economically disadvantaged" may bedefined as 70% of the llsil for purposes of the work opportunity tax credit ( wotc ) .

note: effective on july 1 , 1997 ( earlier in most states ) , p. l. 104-193 endedaid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) , a cash assistance program underwhich recipients were automatically eligible for medicaid .

the replacement blockgrant program of temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) does not entitleall tanf recipients to medicaid coverage .

however , those who meet the income,resource , and categorical eligibility criteria of the former afdc program , as in effectin their state on july 16 , 1996 ( and subsequently modified , if applicable ) , are entitledto medicaid .

the description below summarizes medicaid as it operated after afdcwas replaced by tanf .

note: this entry describes use of tanf block grant funds for cash aid .

federal plusstate expenditures in fy2002 for tanf cash aid ( 76 ) were estimated at $10.4 billion ( excluding administrative costs ) .

for tanf child care , tanf work programs andactivities , and tanf services , see separate entries in this report .

note: this entry describes the program of general assistance ( ga ) to indiansoperated by the bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) .

however , tribes may design theirown ga programs , changing eligibility rules and benefit levels , provided they payany net cost increase , use any savings for tribal needs , and receive bia approval oftheir plan .

 ( 112 ) tribes may administer theirredesigned plan themselves or request biato do so .

note: the federal trio programs consist of six programs authorized by titleiv of the higher education act of 1965 , as amended: upward bound , studentsupport services , talent search , educational opportunity centers , ronald e.mcnair postbaccalaureate achievement , and staff development .

the first threewere the original "trio" programs .

the staff development activities provideshort - term training for trio program staff ; they are not described below .

note: this program was known as the state student incentive grant ( ssig ) program until october 1 , 1998 , when it was revised and renamed by p.l .

105-244 .

note: this program , formerly called ellender fellowships ( title x , part g of theelementary and secondary education act of 1965 ) has been funded even thoughrecent federal budgets have requested no appropriation for it .

 ( 324 ) close up fellowshipsnow are authorized by title i , part e , of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act ( p.l .

107-10 ) .

this entrysummarizes ellender fellowships and close up fellowships rules under both laws .

note: no part of the original tanf block grant was earmarked for workprograms , but in 1997 , congress added a 2-year $3 billion program ofwelfare - to - work ( wtw ) grants to help states meet tanf work requirements .

the energy conservation and production act of 1976 ( p.l .

94-385 ) , as amended , provides 100% federal funding for weatherization assistance tolow - income persons through grants administered by the department of energy ( doe ) .

 ( 400 ) administrative costs may not exceed10% of grant funds .

weatherizationfunds are allocated among the states on the basis of factors that include: number ofheating degree days and cooling degree days , number of low - income owner - occupiedand renter - occupied dwellings , percentage of total residential energy used for spaceheating and space cooling .

although states are not required to provide matchingfunds , ( 401 ) state and local funds often supplementfederal amounts .

appropriationstotaled $230.0 million in fy2002 .

states and other grantees design and administer their own programs under general federal guidelines .

the law makes eligible all "low - income" households andoffers alternate definitions of this term .

states are permitted to give doeweatherization assistance to households whose ( a ) combined income falls at or below125% of the federal poverty income guidelines , a ceiling equal in the 48 contiguousstates to $23,000 for a family of four in 2003 ( at state option , the ceiling can be liftedto 150% of the poverty guideline , if the state has adopted that income limit forliheap ) and ( b ) families with a member who received cash welfare paymentsduring the previous 12 months from tanf , ssi , or state assistance programs .

legislation allows a maximum average expenditure , adjusted annually for price inflation ( $2,614 in fy2003 ) , per dwelling unit for weatherization materials , labor,and related matters ( such as transportation of materials and workers ; maintenance,operation and insurance of vehicles ; maintenance of tools and equipment ; purchaseor lease of tools , equipment and vehicles ; employment of on - site supervisors ; andstorage of weatherization materials ) .

doe reports that it weatherized more than97,000 homes in fy2001 and 5.2 million over the 27-year history of the program .

the low - income home energy assistance program ( liheap ) usually spends morefunds on weatherization assistance than the doe program .
