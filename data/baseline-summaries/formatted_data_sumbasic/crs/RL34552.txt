the president signed h.r .

1 on february 17 , 2009 .

with regard to the regular appropriations , congress had passed two continuing resolutions including state , foreign operations appropriations .

most recently , the 111 th congress passed a continuing resolution ( p.l .

111-6 ) to provide funding through march 11 , 2009 .

the 110 th congress had passed p.l .

110-329 , which continued funding for most state - foreign operations through march 6 , 2009 , at fy2008 levels .

president bush signed it into law on september 30 , 2008 .

it included up to $5.0 million to help liberia in debt reduction ; and an increase from $631.2 million to $670.65 million of foreign military financing ( fmf ) funds to be made available for procurement in israel of defense articles and services in fy2009 .

the measure also provided $37.5 million for emergency repair and construction for the united states - mexico international boundary and water commission water quantity program , with no deadline for expenditure .

p.l .

110-329 also contained some fy2008 supplemental funding , as well .

among these are $9.0 million to be transferred to the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction to remain available until september 2010 and $465.0 million within the economic support fund ( esf ) , of which $365.0 million is for georgia for humanitarian , economic , and relief assistance , and the remainder for hurricane relief in the caribbean .

on may 2 , 2008 , the george w. bush administration sent an fy2009 supplemental budget request to congress amending its fy2009 regular request by a total of $5.12 billion for international affairs accounts — $2.24 billion for the department of state and $2.88 billion for foreign assistance .

the supplemental appropriation act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-252 ) was signed on june 30 , 2008 , with a total of $6.15 billion in fy2008 supplementals and $3.94 billion in fy2009 supplementals for state , foreign operations and related agencies .

while division j of the consolidated appropriations act , fy2008 ( p.l .

110-161 , signed december 26 , 2007 ) contained both regular appropriations and $2.4 billion for fy2008 supplemental funding for international affairs , the administration stated that $5.4 billion of the fy2008 supplemental request ( $2.2 billion for the department of state and $3.2 billion for foreign assistance ) was lacking .

 ( for account - by - account detail , see the tables in appendix c and appendix d .

also , for more information on the current supplemental appropriations , see crs report rl34451 , fy2008 spring supplemental appropriations and fy2009 bridge appropriations for military operations , international affairs , and other purposes ( p.l .

110-252 ) , by [author name scrubbed] et al. ) .

the international affairs budget , also known as function 150 , funds a variety of u.s. government programs and activities , including foreign economic and military assistance , contributions to international organizations and multilateral financial institutions , state department and u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) operations , public diplomacy , and international broadcasting programs .

figure 1 provides a percentage breakout of the fy2009 budget request , including international food aid that is appropriated in the department of agriculture appropriations bill .

on february 4 , 2008 , the president sent his fy2009 regular international affairs ( function 150 account ) budget request to congress .

the request seeks a total of $39.5 billion for both the department of state and foreign operations .

this represents an increase from the previous year of 8.5% ( excluding recent supplementals ) at a time when much of the rest of the budget request is flat .

included in the fy2009 request is a new program referred to as the civilian stabilization initiative ( csi ) to help stabilize and transition countries from war to peace .

the omnibus appropriations act , fy2009 ( h.r .

1105 ) , was introduced in congress on february 23 , 2009 .

the house passed it on february 25 , 2009 , and the senate passed it on march 10 without an amendment .

it was signed into law ( p.l .

111-8 ) on march 11 , 2009 .

the administration's fy2009 budget request for the department of state is $11.456 billion , representing a 5.6% increase over the fy2008 estimate , including rescissions and supplementals enacted in the consolidated appropriation ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

for international broadcasting , the fy2009 request of $699.5 million represents a 2.6% increase over the fy2008 estimate , including rescissions and supplementals .

related agencies , which are funded in the state and foreign operations appropriations bill , include the broadcasting board of governors ( bbg ) , and u.s. assessed contributions to united nations ( u.n. ) , international organizations , and u.n. peacekeeping .

also included are funding for the asia foundation , the national endowment for democracy , and several other small educational and exchange organizations , as well as resources for international commissions , and the u.s. institute of peace .

table 4 and figure 3 show appropriations for the last decade in both current and constant dollars .

the foreign operations budget comprises the majority of u.s. foreign assistance programs , both bilateral and multilateral .

 ( see tables at the back of this report for foreign operations accounts and funding levels. ) .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill funds all u.s. bilateral development assistance programs , managed mostly by usaid and the state department , together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the millennium challenge corporation , the peace corps , and the inter - american and african development foundations .

it supports u.s. obligations to major multilateral financial institutions , such as the world bank , and united nations activities , such as unicef .

the foreign operations appropriation also includes funds for the export - import bank , whose activities are regarded more as trade promotion than foreign aid .

on occasion , the bill replenishes u.s. financial commitments to international financial institutions , such as the world bank and the international monetary fund .

international food aid , such as the p.l .

480 food for peace program , however , is funded in the agriculture appropriations bill , although it is also considered foreign aid .

the fy2009 request for food aid programs totals $1.326 billion .

the regular foreign operations budget request for fy2009 totals $26.1 billion in foreign assistance programs , representing a 8.8% increase from the previous year's enacted level of $24.0 billion , excluding recent supplemental funds .

this increase is larger than the overall fy2009 budget increase of 4.9% , and continues the general trend of foreign aid increases since september 11 , 2001 .

table 5 and figure 4 provide funding levels , including supplementals and rescissions , for foreign operations since fy1999 in both current and constant dollars .

since 1999 , foreign aid funding increased by nearly 86% in current dollars , but by 43% in constant dollars .

prior to 9 / 11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan , israel and egypt typically received the first and second largest amounts of u.s. foreign aid .

in recent years , after supplementals are added , iraq or afghanistan have moved egypt to third or fourth place .

except for fy2004 when funding to iraq jumped to more than $18 billion , israel and egypt typically are at the top of the list for receiving the most aid from the united states in recent years .

see table 6 for top u.s. aid recipients from fy2008 to the fy2009 request .

since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the role of foreign assistance as a tool of foreign policy has come into sharper focus .

president george w. bush elevated global development as a third pillar of national security , with defense and diplomacy , as articulated in the u.s. national security strategy of 2002 , and reiterated in 2006 .

at the same time that foreign aid is being recognized as playing an important role in u.s. foreign policy , it has also come under closer scrutiny by congress , largely in response to a number of presidential initiatives , and by critics who argue that the u.s. foreign aid infrastructure dates back to the cold war era , is cumbersome and fragmented , and that a national aid strategy is lacking .

in recent years , several initiatives have heightened congressional interest in , and caused a re - examination of , u.s. foreign assistance policy and programs , including organizational structure .

in january 2006 , secretary of state rice announced an initiative to bring coordination and coherence to u.s. aid programs .

the secretary created a new state department position — director of foreign assistance ( dfa ) — the occupant of which serves concurrently as administrator of the u.s. agency for international development .

a new bureau of foreign assistance ( f bureau ) was created to coordinate assistance programs , led by the dfa , who in 2006 , developed a strategic framework for foreign assistance to align u.s. aid programs with strategic objectives .

the framework guided the writing of the fy2008 and fy2009 budget requests .

this year a number of members of congress and nongovernmental organizations have indicated an interest in exploring greater reforms including the establishment of a national strategy on u.s. foreign aid policy , elevating the importance of foreign aid as a foreign policy tool to more closely align with that of diplomacy and defense , and rewriting the foreign assistance act of 1961 to change the emphasis from the cold war era to the post - 9 / 11 era , among other things .

despite a proposed 8.8% increase in the bush administration's fy2009 regular foreign aid budget request , most of the additional funds are concentrated in a few areas .

the fy2009 budget continues to focus on the war on terrorism and reconstruction in afghanistan and iraq , as well as assistance to front - line states .

other areas that would see significant increases include two of the president's cornerstone initiatives — the millennium challenge corporation ( up 44% ) and the president's malaria initiative ( up 9.3% ) .

the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) , which in the past also addressed treatment and prevention of malaria , increased by .5% .

africa and the near east continue to see higher levels of assistance than other regions , but for africa , most of the funds are concentrated in hiv / aids programs , with other types of assistance , such as basic education , decreasing .

for the near east , the aid increases are primarily for iraq reconstruction .

 ( see appendix d for account - by - account funding levels for fy2007 , fy2008 estimates , and the fy2009 request. ) .

the bush administration's fy2009 foreign aid request would increase the millennium challenge corporation by 44% , the international narcotics control and law enforcement by116% , the andean counterdrug program by 27% , and debt restructuring by 368% .

smaller increases in the budget request include the child survival and health programs ( csh ) up 16% , the economic support fund ( esf ) up 5.5% , peace corps up 3.8% , the global hiv / aids initiative ( ghai ) up 2.5% , and nonproliferation , anti - terrorism , demining , and related programs ( nadr ) up 3.3% .

the administration's fy2009 foreign aid budget request would reduce some programs from the fy2008 level , including international disaster assistance ( ida ) , down 30.6% , migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) , down 25.3% , and peacekeeping operations ( pko ) , down 5.4% .

the administration has requested fy2009 supplemental funds which include additional funding for ida , mra , and pko , however .

comparing the fy2009 request to the fy2008 funding estimates , figure 5 shows that u.s. foreign assistance would increase to all regions except east asia and pacific ( eap ) , which would decline by 18.7% and europe ( eur ) , which would decline by 6.4% .

the eap decline is due in part to accounting — the administration moved some funds to the department of state budget and others to usaid's global programs .

the decline in aid to europe reflects the graduation from development assistance of 11 countries in the region and the critical need for aid elsewhere in the world .

the western hemisphere ( wh ) region would receive more u.s. aid in the fy2009 request than any other region — up by 39.7% over the fy2008 estimates .

the increase is largely due to the mérida initiative which , for mexico , includes $477.8 million in the fy2009 request , up from $26.6 million the year before .

without mérida , the funding level would be similar to that of the previous year .

africa would benefit from a 2% increase in fy2009 , with no increase over the fy2008 level in global hiv / aids ( ghai ) funds .

 ( in fy2008 , ghai funds to africa increased by 39% , with other programs reduced. ) .

south and central asia would see a increase of nearly 3.3% in fy2009 , largely due to increased esf assistance to pakistan .

the near east would receive a 5.1% increase , mainly due to iraq assistance .

over the years , congress has expressed interest in various aid sectors , such as education , democracy , human rights , trade , maternal and child health , family planning and reproductive health , agriculture and environment .

table 7 provides fy2008 funding estimates and the fy2009 budget request for many of these sectors .

some sectors are cut significantly by the fy2009 request , as listed below , while others receive sizeable increases .

increases in counter narcotics programs in the regular budget request are up 54.3% , for example .

establishment of the mérida initiative , a program that supports mexico and central america in combating drug activity throughout the region , is the primary reason for the large increase in the counter narcotics sector .

in addition to the fy2009 request for merida funds , the fy2008 supplemental request includes $500 million for mexico and $50 million for central america for the mérida initiative .

another key country receiving increased counter - narcotics support is pakistan , under the president's commitment to support the federally administered tribal areas .

the fy2009 budget reflects decreases in global health - related programs , including a decline in funding for tuberculosis , maternal and child health , family planning and reproductive health , and water supply and sanitation .

the fy2009 request also decreases funding levels for education and civil society .

in october 2007 , the united states and mexico announced the mérida initiative , a multi - year proposal for $1.4 billion in u.s. assistance to mexico and central america aimed at combating drug trafficking , gangs , and organized crime .

the first year of funding for this initiative — $500 million for mexico and $50 million for central american countries — is included in the administration's fy2008 supplemental appropriation request .

in latest legislative actions , on june 19 and 26 , 2008 , the house and senate approved compromise language on the fy2008 supplemental , h.r .

2642 , that would provide $465 million in fy2008 supplemental and fy2009 supplemental assistance for the mérida initiative , with softened human rights conditions compared to earlier house and senate versions .

for mexico , $400 million would be provided , with $352 million in fy2008 supplemental assistance ( within the incle , fmf , and esf accounts ) and $48 million in fy2009 supplemental assistance ( within the incle account ) .

for central america , $65 million would be provided for central america , haiti , and the dominican republic ( within the incle , nadr , esf , and fmf accounts ) , with haiti and the dominican republic receiving $2.5 million each in fy2008 incle funding and none for fy2009 .

the fy2009 budget request also includes another $550 million — $450 million for mexico and $100 million for central american countries — within the incle account .

in launching in 2003 the president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) , president bush pledged to provide this five - year initiative with a total of $15 billion by fy2008 .

congress appropriated an estimated $5.97 billion in fy2008 which met total pledged funding over the five year period .

on may 30 , 2007 , president bush announced a follow - on plan to provide a total of $30 billion through fy2013 .

the fy2009 request of $6.0 billion begins the new five - year $30 billion program .

of the $6.0 billion requested , $4.8 billion is within the department of state budget and $439.1 million is within usaid's budget .

the remaining funds are within the department of health and human services .

the president's malaria initiative was announced in 2006 to provide an increased focus on malaria , pledging that the united states would spend an additional $1.2 billion over a five - year period ( fy2006-fy2010 ) .

congress appropriated $122 million in fy2006 and $248 million in fy2007 .

the president's request for fy2008 is $388 million , keeping the pledge on target .

including supplementals and rescissions , congress provided $352 million for pmi in fy2008 .

the fy2009 request is $385 million , within the child survival and health programs account .

in announcing the creation of the new independent millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) , the president pledged $5 billion annual funding by fy2006 .

in fact , requests have never topped $3 billion a year .

congress has consistently cut the mcc request with some members expressing concern that the program was slow to get started , and has not disbursed much of its existing funding .

in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l .

110-161 , h.r .

2764 ) , congress provided $1.544 billion , almost half of the administration's request .

the fy2009 mcc budget request is for $2.225 billion , reflecting a 44% increase over the fy2008 level .

supplemental resources for foreign operations programs , which in fy2004 exceeded regular foreign operations funding , have become a significant source of funds for u.s. international activities , especially those related to reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan .

supplemental appropriations bills have often been used as vehicles to provide additional funding to respond to unanticipated emergencies or natural disasters .

there has been some criticism that the administration has relied too heavily on supplementals , keeping funds off budget and difficult for year - to - year comparisons or future - year planning .

some supplemental appropriations , particularly those relating to iraq , should be incorporated into the regular appropriations cycle if they are going to be on an annual basis , according to critics .

the administration counters that given the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and unforeseen emergencies , it is necessary to make supplemental requests for unexpected and non - recurring expenses .

including both base budgets and supplemental appropriations , the share of u.s. bilateral foreign assistance going to iraq and afghanistan has increased sharply since fy2002 .

foreign aid to afghanistan mushroomed from $590 million in fy2003 to $1.799 billion the next year .

for iraq , assistance consisted of small sums to support iraqi opposition groups in the early 2000s , but picked up precipitously in fy2004 to more than $17 billion , and then fell to $1.6 billion in fy2006 and roughly $2.2 billion in fy2007 .

table 8 tracks funding to both countries from fy2002 through the fy2009 and includes both regular budgets and supplemental funds .

amounts for fy2009 represent requested amounts .

fy2007 regular and supplemental funding for iraq and afghanistan together comprises about 16% of total foreign aid spending .

the share of the fy2008 budget is just under 13% .

the fy2009 aid requested for iraq and afghanistan , before supplementals , is 5.3% .
