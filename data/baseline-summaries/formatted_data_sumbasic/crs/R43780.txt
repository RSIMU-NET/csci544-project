recent reports that certain entities continued to receive federal government contracts after reincorporating overseas have prompted questions about current and proposed restrictions on contracting with "inverted domestic corporations. .

these questions are shaped , in part , by the broader debate over whether such corporations are to be seen as "deserters," who change their corporate citizenship to avoid paying u.s. taxes , or as evidencing systemic problems in the u.s. tax code .

however , they also reflect long - standing debate over whether and to what degree the federal procurement process should be used to promote socioeconomic goals that one court described as "only indirectly related to conventional procurement considerations" ( i.e. , acquiring the supplies and services that best meet the government's needs at the lowest price ) .

congress has sought to discourage corporate inversions by barring certain contracts with inverted domestic corporations ever since it enacted the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-296 , â§835 ) .

as amended , this act prohibits the department of homeland security from awarding a contract to an inverted domestic corporation , or a subsidiary thereof , unless the secretary of homeland security determines that a waiver is necessary in the interest of national security .

the act also establishes its own definition of inverted domestic corporation , which is different from that in the internal revenue code .

subsequent legislation imposed similar prohibitions upon other agencies , although only as to funds appropriated or otherwise made available under specific acts of congress .

however , some commentators have argued that inverted domestic corporations have continued to receive federal contracts because of "loopholes" or "gaps" in these measures .

thus , some members of the 114 th congress have proposed legislation to reduce or remove opportunities for inverted domestic corporations to receive government contracts .

similar legislation was introduced in the 113 th congress .

there have also been calls by members of both the 113 th and 114 th congresses for the executive to take action to further restrict agencies' ability to contract with inverted domestic corporations .

this report provides the answers to 14 frequently asked questions regarding the current restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations , proposed amendments thereto , and the relationship between the prohibitions upon contracting with inverted domestic corporations and other provisions of law that restrict dealings with "foreign" contractors .

many questions pertain to the current restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations , including ( 1 ) the nature of the restrictions , ( 2 ) what constitutes an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the restrictions , and ( 3 ) whether the restrictions can be waived .

this section provides answers to these and other questions .

other questions and answers pertain to legislation introduced in the 114 th congress that would make the preexisting ban on contracting with inverted domestic corporations permanent law and strengthen it ( h.r .

1809 , the no federal contracts for corporate deserters act ; s. 975 , the american business for american companies act ) .

yet other questions concern the relationship between the current or proposed restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations and other provisions of federal law that ( 1 ) generally require federal agencies to purchase "domestic" items , and ( 2 ) expressly or effectively preclude some or all foreign corporations from performing certain contracts .

the buy american act generally would not bar federal agencies from purchasing supplies or construction materials from foreign personsâincluding inverted domestic corporationsâso long as the supplies or construction materials are mined , produced , or manufactured in the united states , as required by the act .

where it applies , the buy american act generally requires that any "end products" or "construction" materials be mined or produced in the united states , in the case of unmanufactured items ; or manufactured in the united states "substantially all" from items mined , produced , or manufactured in the united states , in the case of manufactured items .

the regulations implementing the buy american act further provide that items are manufactured "substantially all" from items mined , produced , or manufactured in the united states if either ( 1 ) at least 50% of the costs of their components are mined , produced , or manufactured in the united states , or ( 2 ) the item is a commercially available off - the - shelf ( cots ) item .

end products or construction materials that satisfy the act's requirements qualify as "domestic," regardless of the offeror's nationality .

purchases of services are generally not subject to the buy american act .

foreign corporationsâor corporations that are not incorporated or legally organized within the united statesâare not per se excluded from contracting with the u.s. government .

there are certain provisions of federal law that expressly or effectively preclude some or all foreign corporations from performing specific contracts .

for example , section 836 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the national defense authorization act for fy1993 ( p.l .

102-484 , codified at 10 u.s.c .

â§2536 ) prohibits the departments of defense and energy from awarding contracts under a "national security program" to entities "controlled" by foreign governments if that entity would need to be given access to a "prescribed category of information" ( eg , special access information ) in order to perform the contract .

similarly , sections 402 and 406 ( c ) of the omnibus diplomatic security and antiterrorism act of 1986 ( p.l .

99-399 , codified in 22 u.s.c .

â§4852 ) limit certain construction projects abroad to "u.s. persons" or "u.s. joint venture persons," and exclude entities that have "business arrangements" with libya .

however , as these examples illustrate , restrictions on contracting with foreign corporations are not synonymous with the current or proposed restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations .
