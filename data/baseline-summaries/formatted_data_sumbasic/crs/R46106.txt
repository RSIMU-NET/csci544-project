the government's purchase card program has its origins in executive order ( e.o. ) .

12352 , issued by president ronald reagan in 1982 .

e.o .

12352 directed agencies to develop programs that simplified procedures and reduced the administrative costs of procurement , particularly with regard to "small" purchases ( $25,000 or less ) .

several agencies subsequently participated in a pilot program that evaluated the use of a commercial credit card , called a purchase card , as an acquisition tool .

at the time , even a routine order for widely available items , such as office supplies , typically required agency program staff to submit a written procurement request to a contracting officer , who reviewed it , obtained the necessary signatures , made the actual purchase , and processed the associated paperwork .

to critics , this process was inefficient , especially for small purchases .

not only was it time - consuming for both program and procurement personnel , but it also prevented program offices from quickly filling immediate needs .

under the pilot program , nonprocurement staff used purchase cards to conduct small - dollar transactions directly with local suppliers , thus bypassing procurement officers entirely .

a report on the pilot program concluded that purchase cards could reduce administrative costs and improve delivery time , and in 1989 the office of management and budget ( omb ) tasked the general services administration ( gsa ) with making purchase cards available government - wide .

participation in gsa's purchase card program was not mandatory , and card use did not initially grow as rapidly as some had expected .

in 1993 , however , a report issued by the national performance review ( npr ) sparked a number of legislative and regulatory reforms intended to increase purchase card use .

the npr was a clinton administration initiative that sought to "reinvent" the federal government by making government operations both less expensive and more efficient .

one of the npr's objectives was to identify opportunities to streamline a number of government - wide processes , including procurement .

drawing on input from experts in the public and private sectors , the npr's initial report recommended expanding the use of purchase cards across the government , a step it said would "lower costs and reduce bureaucracy in small purchases. .

in a separate report that focused solely on procurement , the npr estimated that if half of all small acquisitions were made using purchase cards , the government would realize $180 million in savings annually .

the report further recommended amending the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) âthe government's primary source of procurement guidanceâto promote the use of purchase cards for small purchases .

building on the npr's recommendations , congress passed the federal acquisition streamlining act ( fasa ; p.l .

103-355 ) in 1994 .

fasa introduced several reforms that increased the use of purchase cards .

among these , title iv of fasa established a simplified acquisition threshold ( sat ) of $100,000 ( increased to $250,000 in 2017 ) .

purchases at or below the threshold were exempted from the provisions of a number of procurement laws .

this reform obviated the need for procurement officials to make small purchases .

to further streamline procedures for the smallest acquisitions , title iv also established a "micro - purchase" threshold of $2,500 ( which was increased to $3,000 in 2006 , and again to $10,000 in 2017 ) .

fasa further exempted micro - purchases from sections of the buy american act and the small business act , and they could be made without obtaining a competitive bid , if the cost was deemed reasonable by the cardholder .

at the same time , the clinton administration took steps to increase the use of purchase cards .

citing the need to make agency procurement procedures "more consistent with recommendations of the national performance review," president clinton issued executive order 12931 on october 13 , 1994 .

e.o .

12931 directed agency heads to ( 1 ) expand purchase card use ; and ( 2 ) delegate the micro - purchasing authority provided in fasa to program offices , which would enable them to make purchases whose value did not exceed the micro - purchase threshold .

e.o .

12931 also directed agency heads to streamline procurement policies and practices that were not mandated by statute , and to ensure that their agencies were maximizing their use of the new simplified acquisition procedures .

in addition , the far was amended in 1994 to designate the purchase card as the "preferred method" for making micro - purchases .

card use increased sharply as agencies implemented these reforms .

the dollar value of goods and services acquired with purchase cards increased from $527.0 million in fy1993 to $19.5 billion in fy2011 .

during that same time span , the number of cardholders nearly tripled to 278,000 , and the number of purchase card transactions increased from 1.5 million to just under 22.8 million in fy2011 .

the flexibility of the purchase card may have contributed to its growth: it could be used for in - store purchases , which allowed the cardholder to take immediate possession of needed goods , or it could be used to place orders by telephone or over the internet and have goods delivered .

according to gsa , the use of purchase cards now saves the government $1.7 billion a year in administrative costs .

the federal purchase card program is implemented by individual agencies , with the involvement of gsa and omb .

in broad terms , agencies establish and maintain their own programs , but they select pu rchase card services from contracts that gsa negotiates with selected banks , and their programs must conform to the government - wide guidance issued by omb .

audits of agency purchase card programs conducted by the government accountability office ( gao ) and agency inspectors general ( igs ) through fy2011 attracted congressional attention with their revelations of abusive purchases made by government employees .

among the many cases of abuse cited by auditors were a department of agriculture ( usda ) employee who , over a period of six years , used her purchase card to funnel $642,000 to her boyfriend ; a forest service employee who charged $31,342 to his purchase card for personal items , including sony playstations , cameras , and jewelry ; and a coast guard cardholder who used his purchase card to buy a beer brewing kitâand then brewed alcohol while on duty .

congress held several hearings to address purchase card misuse and the underlying internal control weaknesses that auditors said allowed it to occur .

the following section examines the weaknesses identified in audit reports published between 2002 and 2011 , which highlight the issues that led to the passage of the charge card act .

in response to these findingsâand evidence of similar abuse in agency travel card programsâcongress passed the government charge card abuse prevention act of 2012 ( charge card act ; p.l .

112-194 ) .

the charge card act established new internal control and reporting requirements for both purchase cards ( â§2 ) , and travel cards ( â§3 and â§4 ) .

the following paragraphs examine the charge card act's requirements for purchase cards .

given that the charge card act directly amends the u.s. code , the requirements are identified by their location in code rather than in the act itself .

in an effort to assess compliance with the charge card act and other purchase card requirements across the government , gao reviewed agency policies and data from fy2014 and released its analysis in 2017 .

more recently , the council of the inspectors general on integrity and efficiency ( cigie ) launched a coordinated audit of fy2017 purchase card data .

the igs at 20 agencies sampled a total of 1,255 "high - risk" transactionsâpurchases that potentially violated program policies or proceduresâfrom and shared their findings with cigie .

by july 2018 , the igs had released their own reports and cigie had issued a summary and analysis of the findings .

according to the cigie analysis , while there were few examples of fraud at the 20 agencies that participated in the project , nearly 51% ( 501 ) of the purchases sampled failed to comply with at least one purchase card policy .

patterns of noncompliance , with examples and analysis from the gao report , individual agency audits , and the cigie report are discussed below .

although the cigie initiative did not assess the implementation status of every requirement in the charge card act , the igs' findings indicated weaknesses remain in many agencies' internal controls .

in particular , the audit results showed that aos did not adequately monitor cardholder purchases ; employee training on purchase card policies and procedures is insufficient ; and agency policies and procedures have gaps .

oversight of agency purchase card programs is limited by the availability of data .

while the cigie report identified areas where implementation of the charge card act is incomplete , not all agencies had provided data and the data provided did not reflect or represent all of the law's requirements .

moreover , implementation of the charge card act is ongoing and some agencies may have already addressed the weaknesses identified in the cigie initiative , which analyzed fy2017 data .

going forward , congress has the option of requesting a study of the implementation of the charge chard act .

if gao were to examine implementation of the charge card act , it would possibly be able to use more recent data and it could target agencies with the highest risk of card misuse , as determined by dollar volume or history of violations , among other criteria .

gao might be asked to evaluate specific requirements , particularly in areas that were cited by auditors prior to the charge card act .

have agencies implemented policies that require separation of duties ? .

have agencies established appropriate dollar thresholds for various categories of cardholders ? .

are agencies invalidating purchase cards when an employee terminates employment or is transferred to another component ? .

the cigie report noted another potential weaknessâapproximately 8.6% of the high - risk transactions sampled involved purchase card activity on closed accounts .

the extent of agency compliance with these and other purchase card requirements will not be known without additional , timely information .

in addition to agency efforts , an evaluation of the effectiveness of smartpay bank services and tools might be useful .

as noted , agencies have reported that merchant block codes do not always prevent transactions from being approved at prohibited merchants .

in addition , gao found that smartpay banks did not always retain records for the amount of time required by their contracts , in part due to confusion over which records were considered part of the transaction .

an evaluation of bank services might identify additional issues that need to be addressed .

it also might include a comparison of the technologies different agencies utilize and discuss what benefits they have realized .

given the potential for technology to enhance oversight , reduce administrative burden , and mitigate the risk of improper purchases , an assessment of smartpay bank services may help agencies identify potentially useful technologies they have not yet incorporated into their charge card programs .
