as the fifth - largest country and the ninth - largest economy in the world , brazil plays an important role in global governance ( see figure 1 for a map of brazil ) .

over the past 20 years , brazil has forged coalitions with other large , developing countries to push for changes to multilateral institutions and to ensure that global agreements on issues ranging from trade to climate change adequately protect their interests .

brazil also has taken on a greater role in promoting peace and stability , contributing to u.n. peacekeeping missions and mediating conflicts in south america and further afield .

although recent domestic challenges have led brazil to turn inward and weakened its appeal globally , the country continues to exert considerable influence on international policy issues that affect the united states .

u.s. policymakers have often viewed brazil as a natural partner in regional and global affairs , given its status as a fellow multicultural democracy .

repeated efforts to forge a close partnership have left both countries frustrated , however , as their occasionally divergent interests and policy approaches have inhibited cooperation .

the trump administration has viewed the 2018 election of brazilian president jair bolsonaro as a fresh opportunity to deepen the bilateral relationship .

bolsonaro has begun to shift brazil's foreign policy to bring the country into closer alignment with the united states , and president trump has designated brazil a m ajor n on - nato a lly .

nevertheless , ongoing differences over trade protections and relations with china threaten to leave both the united states and brazil with unmet expectations once again .

the 116 th congress has expressed renewed interest in brazil , recognizing brazil's potential to affect u.s. initiatives and interests .

some members view brazil as a strategic partner for addressing regional and global challenges .

they have urged the trump administration to forge stronger economic , security , and military ties with brazil to bolster the bilateral relationship and counter the influence of extra - hemispheric powers , such as china and russia .

other members have expressed reservations about a close partnership with the bolsonaro administration .

they are concerned that bolsonaro is presiding over an erosion of democracy and human rights in brazil and that his environmental policies threaten the amazon and global efforts to mitigate climate change .

congress may continue to assess these differing approaches to u.s. - brazilian relations as it carries out its oversight responsibilities and considers fy2021 appropriations and other legislative initiatives .

a 30% increase in fires in the brazilian amazon in 2019 compared to the previous year led many brazilians and international observers to express concern about the rainforest and the extent to which its destruction is contributing to regional and global climate change .

covering nearly 2.7 million square miles across seven countries , the amazon basin is home to the largest and most biodiverse tropical forest in the world .

scientific studies have found that the amazon plays an important role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing and sequestering carbon .

although findings vary , one recent study estimated the forest absorbs 560 million tons of carbon dioxide per year and its biomass holds 76 billion tons of carbonâan amount equivalent to seven years of global carbon emissions .

the amazon also pumps water into the atmosphere , affecting regional rainfall patterns throughout south america .

an estimated 17% of the amazon basin has been deforested , however , and some scientists have warned that the forest may be nearing a tipping point at which it is no longer able to sustain itself and transitions to a drier , savanna - like ecosystem .

efforts to conserve the forest often focus on brazil , since the country encompasses about 69% of the amazon basin .

within brazil , the government has established an administrative zone known as the legal amazon , which includes nine states: acre , amapã¡ , amazonas , maranhã£o , mato grosso , parã¡ , rondã´nia , roraima , and tocantins ( see figure 1 ) .

although rainforest covers most of the legal amazon , savanna ( cerrado ) and wetlands ( pantanal ) are present in portions of the region .

the legal amazon was largely undeveloped until the 1960s , when the military - led government began subsidizing the settlement and development of the region as a matter of national security .

partially due to those incentives , the human population in the legal amazon grew from 6 million in 1960 to 25 million in 2010 .

forest cover in the legal amazon has declined by approximately 20% as settlements , roads , logging , ranching , farming , and other activities have proliferated in the region .

the united states and brazil historically have enjoyed robust political and economic relations , but the countries' divergent perceptions of their national interests have inhibited the development of a close partnership .

those perceptions have changed somewhat under president bolsonaro .

whereas the past several brazilian administrations sought to maintain autonomy in foreign affairs , bolsonaro has called for close alignment with the united states .

within latin america , for example , the bolsonaro administration has adopted a more confrontational approach toward cuba and has closely coordinated with the trump administration on measures to address the crisis in venezuela .

the bolsonaro administration also has expressed support for controversial u.s. actions outside the region , such as the killing of iranian military commander qaasem soleimani .

bolsonaro's realignment of brazilian foreign policy has been controversial domestically , with some analysts arguing it has not resulted in many concrete benefits for brazil .

they note , for example , that the trump administration maintainedâand threatened to imposeâtrade barriers on key brazilian exports , such as beef and steel , despite having signed several bilateral commercial agreements during bolsonaro's official visit to the white house in march 2019 ( see " recent trade negotiations " ) .

likewise , u.s. officials reportedly have warned brazil that the closer defense ties implied by president trump's designation of brazil as a major non - nato ally could be in jeopardy if brazil allows chinese telecommunications company huawei to participate in brazil's 5g cellular network ( see the " defense cooperation " section ) .

some brazilian analysts also argue that abandoning the country's commitment to autonomy in foreign affairs has weakened brazil's international standing and caused tensions in its relations with other important partners , such as fellow members of the brics ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) group .

there does not appear to be public support for the trump administration's foreign policy within brazil ; in 2019 , 60% of brazilians expressed no confidence in president trump to "do the right thing regarding world affairs. .

in some cases , domestic opposition has prevented bolsonaro from aligning brazilian foreign policy more closely with the united states .

for example , during his 2018 presidential campaign , bolsonaro indicated he would follow president trump's lead in withdrawing from the paris agreement on climate change and taking a more confrontational approach toward chinese trade and investment .

he has backed away from those positions since taking office , reportedly due to concerns about losing access to foreign markets , particularly within the powerful agribusiness sector , which accounts for 21% of brazil's gdp and is a major component of bolsonaro's political base .

although some members of the 116 th congress have urged the trump administration to seize on bolsonaro's goodwill to develop a strategic partnership with brazil , others have expressed reservations about the current brazilian administration .

they are concerned about bolsonaro's commitment to democracy , human rights , and the rule of law , as well as about changes to brazil's environmental policies that appear to have contributed to fires and deforestation in the brazilian amazon ( see " u.s. support for amazon conservation " ) .

more than five years after the country fell into recession and more than three years after the controversial impeachment and removal from office of president rousseff , brazil remains mired in difficult domestic circumstances .

there are some signs that economic growth may be accelerating slowly , but tens of millions of brazilians continue to struggle with poverty and precarious employment conditions .

repeated budget cuts have reduced social services for the most vulnerable and have weakened the brazilian government's capacity to address other challenges , such as high levels of crime and increasing deforestation .

president bolsonaro was elected , in part , on his pledge to clean up the political system , but his interference in justice sector agencies and frequent attacks on the press , civil society groups , and other branches of government have placed additional stress on the country's already - strained democratic institutions .

brazilian policymakers are likely to remain focused on these internal challenges for the next several years , limiting brazil's ability to take on regional responsibilities or exert its influence internationally .

u.s. - brazilian relations have grown closer since 2019 , as president bolsonaro's foreign policy has prioritized alignment with the trump administration .

in addition to coordinating on international affairs , the u.s. and brazilian governments have taken steps to bolster commercial ties and enhance security cooperation .

nonetheless , policy differences have emerged over sensitive issues , such as bilateral trade barriers and relations with china , which affect the economic and geopolitical interests of both countries .

those disagreements suggest the trump and bolsonaro administrations may need to engage in more extensive consultations and confidence - building measures if they intend to avoid the historic pattern of u.s. - brazilian relations , in which heightened expectations give way to mutual disappointment and mistrust .

the 116 th congress may continue to shape u.s. - brazilian relations using its legislative and oversight powers .

although there appears to be considerable support in congress for forging a long - term strategic partnership with brazil , many members may be reluctant to advance major bilateral commercial or security cooperation initiatives in the near term , given their concerns about democracy , human rights , and the environment in brazil .

for the time being , congress may continue appropriating funding for programs with broad support , such as amazon conservation efforts , while members continue to advocate for divergent policy approaches toward the bolsonaro administration .
