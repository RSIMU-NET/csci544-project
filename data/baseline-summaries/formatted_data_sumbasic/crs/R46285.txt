by late february and early march 2020 , the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) , a viral respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus , had entered a new phase , with community spread occurring in many countries and several u.s. states .

concerns grew over the potential for the disease to spread widely , leading to increased hospitalizations and deaths .

on march 6 , 2020 , congress and the president enacted the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-123 ) , to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to prevent , prepare for , and respond to the coronavirus outbreak .

this report provides an overview of appropriations in division a and relevant policies and requirements pursuant to the supplemental .

funding in division a is designated as being provided as an emergency requirement .

for the purposes of the supplemental , the term "coronavirus" refers to sars - cov - 2 , the virus that causes covid - 2019 , or another coronavirus with pandemic potential .

for an overview of congressional reporting requirements in the act , see crs insight in11236 , oversight provisions in h.r .

6074 , the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act , by ben wilhelm .

titles i and iii of p.l .

116-123 provide a total of about $6.5 billion in appropriations to the department of health human services ( hhs ) for health emergency response activities related to covid - 19 .

the funds in these titles are provided to "prevent , prepare for , and respond to coronavirus , domestically or internationally. .

funds largely support domestic activities , but certain accounts have available funding for hhs global health activities .

 ( for information on additional international funding , see the " foreign operations " section of this report. ) .

title ii of p.l .

116-123 provides the small business administration ( sba ) with $20 million until expended for administrative expenses to carry out the sba disaster loan program .

title ii also deems the coronavirus outbreak a disaster under section 7 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( d ) of the small business act .

prior to the amendment , some questioned whether the coronavirus outbreak would meet the small business act's legal definition of a disaster .

the amendment addresses this question and clarifies that sba economic injury disaster loans ( eidl ) can be made available .

title ii does not provide additional funding to the sba for disaster loans , including sba eidl .

instead , sba eidl loan funding in response to the coronavirus outbreak ( as well as sba disaster loan funding for other incidents ) is to be funded by roughly $1.2 billion in disaster loan credit subsidy , which includes just over $1.1 billion in disaster loan credit subsidy carried over from previous years .

this is possible because the disaster loan account is a "no - year" account .

no - year funding does not lapse at the end of the fiscal year .

rather , it is carried over to the next fiscal year .

a summary of the supplemental released by the house appropriations committee noted that the sba is expected to make $1 billion in credit subsidy available to support the cost of anticipated defaults and related expenses of about $7 billion in eidl loans .

still , the $1.2 billion in loan subsidy may be of concern to some if eidl assistance in response to the outbreak becomes significant , if there is an uptick in 2020 disasters , or both .

consequently , congress could consider providing additional supplemental funding through another appropriations package .

in addition , though the coronavirus outbreak is now considered by the sba to be a disaster , sba eidl is not being made automatically available to businesses .

instead , eidl must be requested by the state or territory governor by requesting one of the following types of declarations: ( 1 ) a major disaster declaration under the under the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( p.l .

93-288 , as amended ) ; ( 2 ) an sba eidl declaration under the small business act ( p.l .

83-163 ) ; ( 3 ) an sba eidl declaration under the small business act based on the determination of a natural disaster by the secretary of agriculture ; or ( 4 ) an sba eidl declaration based on the determination of the secretary of commerce that a fishery resource disaster has occurred .

title iv of p.l .

116-123 provides a total of $1.25 billion for department of state , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) appropriations accounts , $264 million of which is to be managed by the department of state and $971 million of which is to be managed by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .

title iv designates $264 million for the department of state's diplomatic programs account , which is the department's principal operating account .

generally , the account provides for human resources functions , overseas programs , security programs , and diplomatic policy and support .

p.l .

116-123 indicates that the emergency funds for diplomatic programs are meant to support consular operations , reimburse evacuation expenses , and bolster emergency preparedness measures .

the act specified the provision of $971 million across a number of bilateral assistance appropriations accounts .

these include the following: office of inspector general .

$1 million to usaid's office of inspector general to support oversight of covid - 19-related programming .

global health programs .

$435 million to the global health programs ( ghp ) account , with which usaid intends to prioritize the following interventions in developing countries affected by and at - risk of covid - 19: screening at points of entry and exit ; the purchase of key health commodities ( eg , diagnostics , personal protective equipment , and disinfectants ) ; the prevention and control of infections in critical health facilities ; readiness to identify , diagnose , manage , and treat cases rapidly ; the identification and follow - up of contacts ; awareness - raising in populations through risk - communication and community - engagement ; the implementation of health measures for travelers ; logistics and supply - chain management ; global and regional coordination ; and country - level readiness and response .

according to usaid , the "funding will help address the threat of covid - 19 in the following high - priority countries:â the islamic republic of afghanistan ; the republics of angola , indonesia , iraq , kazakhstan , kenya , south africa , tajikistan , the philippines , turkmenistan , uzbekistan , zambia , and zimbabwe ; the people's republic of bangladesh ; burma ; the kingdom of cambodia ; the federal democratic republic of ethiopia ; the kyrgyz republic ; the lao people's democratic republic ; mongolia ; the federal republic of nepal ; the federal republic of nigeria ; the islamic republic of pakistan ; the kingdom of thailand ; and the socialist republic of vietnam. .

the supplemental specifies that , out of the total appropriated to the ghp account , $200 million is to be transferred into usaid's emergency reserve fund ( erf ) to support coronavirus - related programs , including pandemic prevention , preparedness , and control .

the erf was established under the ghp account within final fy2017 appropriations ( p.l .

115-31 ) "to enable the united states and the international public health community to respond rapidly to emerging health threats. .

international disaster assistance .

$300 million for coronavirus response efforts through the international disaster assistance ( ida ) account .

broadly , the account is used for relief and recovery efforts in the wake of disastersâboth natural and human - induced .

economic support fund .

$250 million in emergency funds for addressing coronavirus - related "economic , security , and stabilization requirements" through the economic support fund ( esf ) .

the esf account supports myriad objectives , ranging from more traditional development activities to those that advance u.s. political and strategic goals .

in the general provisions of title iv of p.l .

116-123 , congress primarily offers guidance and requirements on transfer authorities , the administration's strategy for fighting covid - 19 on an international scale , and the intervals in which congress requires reporting .

transfer authorities .

the act provides broad transfer authorities across ghp , ida , and esf , in an effort to grant flexibility to usaid in its covid - 19 response .

however , five days prior to transferring funds , the secretary of state or usaid administrator must notify the house and senate appropriations committees of the transfer's details .

strategy .

the act requires the secretary of state and usaid administrator to issue a joint strategy to "prevent , prepare for , and respond to coronavirus abroad" within 15 days of the supplemental's enactment .

reporting .

in addition to regular reporting requirements for each appropriations account , the act includes a provision that requires additional reporting for the supplemental funds .

the act requires the secretary of state and usaid administrator to jointly submit to the house and senate appropriations committees a report detailing the use of the supplemental funds within 30 days of enactment .

following submission of the report , it is required to be updated every 60 days until september 30 , 2022 , and then every 180 days after that until all funds have been expended .

this reporting structure is relatively consistent with other sfops supplemental appropriations measures that have been enacted in the past decade .

use of funds to restore prior obligations .

the act specifies that supplemental funds appropriated to certain accounts ( diplomatic programs , ghp , ida , and esf ) may be used to reimburse accounts administered by the department of state and the usaid for obligations incurred prior to enactment for activities to prevent , prepare for , and respond to coronavirus .

 ( certain limitations are placed on use of these funds for certain obligations previously incurred by esf. ) .
