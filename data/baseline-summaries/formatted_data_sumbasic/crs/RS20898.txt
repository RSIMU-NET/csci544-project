the deadlocked november 2000 presidential election focused national attention on previously obscure details of election administration .

even before the u.s. supreme court decision resolving that election , more than a dozen bills had been introduced in the 106 th congress to address the issues with voting systems , voter registration , and other aspects of election administration that the deadlock had exposed .

legislative activity continued when the 107 th congress convened , along with the release of various independent reports and studies on election reform .

in december 2001 , the house passed h.r .

3295 , the help america vote act , with no floor amendments .

the senate passed s. 565 , the martin luther king , jr .

equal protection of voting rights act , in early 2002 , after adopting 40 amendments .

following conference negotiations , the compromise bill , the help america vote act of 2002 ( hava ; p.l .

107-252 ) , was enacted in october .

hava , for the first time , provided major federal funding to the states for the purpose of purchasing more modern voting equipment and for improving various aspects of election administration highlighted in the controversial 2000 presidential election cycle .

in addition , hava imposed a number of requirements on the states with respect to election administration , created a new independent agency , made some changes to improve military and overseas voting , and authorized other election reform activities .

among its major provisions , hava did the following: it established payment and grant programs to help states meet the law's requirements ; replace punchcard and lever voting machines and make general election improvements ; promote accessibility in the electoral process ; promote student participation ; and support research and pilot programs .

it created the election assistance commission ( eac ) , an independent , bipartisan agency to carry out payment and grant programs , provide for testing and certification of voting systems , study election issues , and assist state and local election officials by issuing guidelines and other guidance for voting systems and implementation of the act's requirements , in consultation with election officials and other stakeholders .

it established requirements in the states to provide a provisional ballot to a voter who is not on the registration list or whose registration is in question ; post a sample ballot and voter information at polling places on election day ; restate the requirement for first time voters who registered by mail , to vote in person ( first required by the national voter registration act , nvra ) and impose a new voter identification standard ; provide for voter error correction on voting systems used in federal elections ; provide accessibility for persons with disabilities via at least one properly equipped voting machine per polling place ; provide for manual auditing of the voting system and alternative - language accessibility ; and create and maintain a computerized , verified statewide voter registration list .

in addition , hava required the eac to develop voting system guidelines for computer hardware and software for voluntary use by the states , and voluntary guidance to assist states in meeting hava requirements ; left methods of implementation to the states and prohibited rulemaking by the eac , leaving enforcement to the u.s. attorney general while requiring states to establish grievance procedures ; and amended the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act ( uocava ) to make improvements to voting procedures for members of the military and overseas citizens .

although many bills have been introduced to amend hava since it became law , only a minor change has been enacted .

in 2009 , the military and overseas voter empowerment act ( move act ) established new military and overseas voting requirements under uocava .

it also amended hava to authorize appropriations to achieve compliance with those requirements .

in general , local election officials ( leos ) have supported hava and its provisions , although some , such as the provisional ballot requirement , were initially controversial .

a number of the issues raised during the legislative debate on hava have resurfaced subsequently , and some new ones have emerged .

topics and issues discussed in this report include the role of the eac , hava funding and requirements , voter registration , voter identification , uocava , the voting rights act , and election technology , including cybersecurity .

the report also discusses relevant legislative activity in the 114 th congress .

before hava , federal activities relating to election administration were performed by the office of election administration ( oea ) of the federal election commission ( fec ) .

oea provided assistance in developing voluntary standards for voting systems and performed clearinghouse functions and some administrative activities under the national voter registration act ( nvra — also called the "motor - voter" law — p.l .

103-31 ) .

hava replaced the oea with the election assistance commission ( eac , http: / / www.eac.gov ) , an independent , bipartisan federal agency .

the act also established two eac boards , with broad - based state and local membership .

the standards board was designed to have 55 state election officials and 55 local election officials .

the board of advisors was designed to have 37 members representing various associations , such as the national governors association and national association of state election directors , as well as the justice department , the federal voting assistance program at the department of defense , and a number of science and technology professionals recommended by u.s. house and senate leadership .

hava also established the technical guidelines development committee , chaired by the director of the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , with members jointly appointed by the eac and nist , to address aspects of voting system technical standards and certification .

the statute also provides for technical support and participation by nist ( see http: / / vote.nist.gov / ) .

the eac carries out grant programs , provides for testing and certification of voting systems , studies election issues , and issues voluntary guidelines for voting systems and guidance for the requirements in the act .

the eac has no rule - making authority ( except for limited authority under the nvra ) and does not enforce hava requirements .

the act established two enforcement processes: the u.s. attorney general may bring civil action with respect to hava requirements , and states , as a condition for receipt of funds , were required to establish administrative grievance procedures to handle complaints from individuals .

a broad consensus emerged after the 2000 election that resolving the problems that were encountered would require a range of solutions that addressed diverse issues .

as a result , hava facilitated replacement of obsolete voting technology — especially punchcard and lever - machine voting systems — and other improvements .

as discussed below , the act established technical requirements for voting systems and voter registration lists , as well as mechanisms for developing and updating technical standards for voting systems , certifying systems against those standards , and providing guidance to the states .

but the act also stimulated controversy about election technology and other issues in election administration .

many of those issues remain part of the current policy debate , and some have taken on new urgency in light of developments relating especially to cybersecurity .

see " election administration issues since hava " for discussion of several of those issues .

hava established the following payment and grant programs ( see table 2 for authorized and appropriated amounts ) .

election administration improvements .

provided expedited , one - time formula payments for general election administration improvements to states that applied , with a $5 million minimum combined payment per state for this and the replacement program ( see next paragraph ) .

administered by general services administration ( gsa ) .

 ( §101. ) .

replacement of punchcard and lever machine systems .

provided expedited , one - time formula payments to replace punchcard systems and lever machines in qualifying states , with a $5 million minimum combined payment per state for this and the improvements program , summarized above .

administered by gsa .

 ( §102. ) .

payments to meet election requirements .

provides formula payments to states to meet the act's requirements and for general election administration improvements once the requirements have been met .

requires a 5% match and submission of a state plan .

administered by the election assistance commission ( eac ) created in the act .

 ( §§251-258. ) .

payments to assure accessibility .

provides payments to states to make polling places accessible to persons with disabilities .

requires application .

administered by department of health and human services ( hhs ) .

 ( §§265-265. ) .

payments for protection and advocacy systems .

provides payments to state protection and advocacy systems to ensure electoral participation by persons with disabilities .

requires application .

administered by hhs .

 ( §§291-292. ) .

grants for research and pilot programs .

provides grants for research to improve voting technology ( §§271-273 ) and for pilot programs to test new voting technology ( §§281-283 ) .

requires application .

administered by eac .

student programs .

establishes three programs , one to recruit college students as poll workers ( §§501-503 ) , one to recruit high school students ( §601 ) , and one to provide grants for the national student and parent mock election ( §§295-296 ) .

in addition , congress has provided appropriations to fund eac operations ( §210 ) , including support by nist .

states and territories were eligible to receive the requirements payments appropriated under hava once each jurisdiction had published a "state plan" in the federal register , followed by a 45-day public comment period and the filing of a certification with the eac .

the state plans were published on march 24 , 2004 .

the initial $2.3 billion appropriations , in fy2003 and fy2004 , could not be allocated until establishment of the eac and publication of the state plans .

the eac distributed all of that funding to states by december 2005 ; no additional funding for requirements payments was appropriated until fy2008 , when $115 million was appropriated .

an additional $100 million was appropriated for fy2009 .

those payments have also been distributed .

several of the issues discussed herein are likely to continue to be relevant with respect to hava , including funding for programs to support election administration investments and activities by the states .

no funds for payments to states for election administration programs have been appropriated since fy2010 .

among specific potential uses for such payments are replacement of obsolete voting equipment and improvements in the security of the election infrastructure .

the eac did not have any commissioners for a period of time between december 2011 and january 2015 .

the senate approved nominations for three of the four commissioner seats on december 16 , 2014 , and the new commissioners were sworn in on january 13 , 2015 .

tasks that require commissioner approval , such as adopting revisions to hava guidance and voting system guidelines , holding public hearings , and issuing new advisory opinions , have resumed .

a fourth commissioner was nominated in april 2016 .

the increased use of information technology in election administration , spurred by hava requirements as well as the broad integration of such technology into business and government activities , has arguably improved many aspects of the election process , but it also creates challenges .

especially prominent in the run - up to the 2016 election have been cybersecurity and the aging of the technology that is currently in use .

legislation to either eliminate or reauthorize the eac was introduced in the 112 th and 113 th congresses .

legislation to eliminate the agency was again introduced in the 114 th congress and was reported by the committee on house administration on march 4 , 2015 .

the eac has been criticized by some for exceeding its authority , or for being slow , ineffectual , or even unnecessary .

others believe that the agency is a necessary federal resource for improving election administration and has been hampered by budgetary constraints and difficulties in the nomination process for commissioners .

voter identification and management of voter registration remain controversial in some cases , with some state laws being challenged in the courts .

issues not covered in this report , such as the number and locations of polling places , provision for early voting , and mail - in or absentee balloting , have also been raised in this election cycle .

fy2003 the fy2003 omnibus appropriations bill ( h.j.res .

2 , h.rept .

108-10 , p.l .

108-7 ) , signed into law on february 20 , 2003 , contained $1.5 billion for election reform programs authorized by hava , including $650 million combined for the election administration improvement and voting system replacement payments to be administered by gsa ( with no specific allocation designated for either program and a maximum of $500,000 for administrative costs ) .

gsa disbursed all of these funds to states in june 2003 .

all states and territories received payments for election administration improvements , based on a formula using each state's voting - age population , and payments to replace punchcard and lever voting systems were made to all states that applied .

also included was $830 million for requirements payments ( with a maximum of 0.1% to be paid to any territory ) , and $20 million for other programs — $13 million for accessibility payments , $2 million for protection and advocacy programs , $1.5 million each for the college and high school programs , and $2 million for the eac .

p.l .

108-7 also included a $15 million appropriation to gsa for one - time payments to certain states that had obtained optical scan or electronic voting systems prior to the november 2000 election .

fy2004 the president's budget request for fy2004 included $500 million , one - half the amount authorized , to fund eac requirements payments and administration .

no funds were specifically requested for the other programs described above .

the final omnibus appropriations bill , h.r .

2673 , signed into law on january 23 , 2004 ( p.l .

108-199 ) , contained just over $1.5 billion for election reform , including $1.0 billion for requirements payments , $500 million for election reform programs , $10 million for accessibility payments , $5 million for protection and advocacy systems , and $1.2 million for the eac .

fy2005 for fy2005 , the president's budget request included $65 million for election reform , of which $40 million was additional funding for requirements payments and $10 million was for eac administrative expenses .

the request also included $5 million for protection and advocacy programs and $10 million for accessibility payments .

the omnibus appropriations bill for fy2005 , h.r .

4818 , was signed into law on december 8 , 2004 , and included $14 million for the eac , of which $2.8 million was to be transferred to nist , and $15 million for disability voting access , with $5 million of that amount to apply to protection and advocacy systems .

also included was $200,000 for the student parent mock election program and $200,000 for the help america vote college program .

fy2006 the president's fy2006 budget request included $17.6 million for the eac ( of which $2.8 million was for nist ) , as well as $5 million for protection and advocacy programs and $9.9 million for accessibility payments administered by hhs .

the final appropriation ( p.l .

109-115 ) contained $14.2 million , including $2.8 million for nist , with $13.5 million and $8.6 million , respectively , for the hhs programs , and $250,000 "encouraged" to be spent on the help america vote college program .

fy2007 the fy2007 request included $16.9 million for the eac ( $5 million for nist ) , $4.83 million for protection and advocacy programs , and $10.89 million for accessibility payments administered by hhs .

the 109 th congress adjourned without enacting an appropriations measure , providing instead temporary funding until february 15 , 2007 , via a continuing resolution ( h.j.res .

102 ) .

continued funding through september 30 for fy2007 was subsequently provided via another continuing resolution , h.j.res .

20 , which was signed by the president on february 15 ( p.l .

110-5 ) .

it provided $16.24 million for the eac , of which $4.95 million was for nist , $4.83 million for protection and advocacy programs , and $10.89 million for disability access .

fy2008 the fy2008 request included $15.5 million for the eac ( $3.25 million for nist ) , and $4.83 million for protection and advocacy programs and $10.89 million for accessibility payments administered by hhs .

from the start of fy2008 until december 31 , 2007 , continued funding for the eac was provided by a series of continuing resolutions .

ultimately , fy2008 funding was provided by the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 , enacted on december 16 , 2007 ( p.l .

110-161 ) .

it provided $16.53 million for the eac , of which $3.25 million was for nist , and $200,000 was for the student and parent mock election program .

it also provided $115 million for requirements payments , $10 million for data collection grants to selected states , $4.83 million for protection and advocacy programs , and $12.37 million for disability access .

fy2009 the fy2009 request included $16.68 million for the eac ( with $4 million for nist ) , as well as $5.26 million for protection and advocacy programs and $12.15 million for accessibility payments administered by hhs .

the fy2009 appropriations were provided initially in a continuing resolution ( p.l .

110-329 ) , which provided the same funding levels as fy2008 , and then in an omnibus bill ( p.l .

111-8 ) that was passed on march 11 , 2009 .

the omnibus provided $18 million for the eac , with $4 million of that to be transferred to nist , $750,000 for the college program , and $300,000 for the high school mock election program .

it also provided funding for requirements payments to the states in the amount of $100 million , with an additional $5 million for grants for research on voting technology improvements and $1 million for a pilot program for grants to states and localities to test voting systems before and after elections .

finally , the omnibus provided $12.2 million for disability access and $5.3 million for protection and advocacy programs .

fy2010 for fy2010 , the president's budget request included $16.5 million for the election assistance commission ( eac ) and $106 million for election reform payments to states , with $5.26 million for protection and advocacy programs and $12.15 million for accessibility payments administered by hhs , as in fy2009 .

the house and senate bills ( h.r .

3170 , s. 1432 ) would have provided about the same amount for the eac .

the house bill would have provided nearly the same amount for election payments , while the senate bill called for $52 million in election payments .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l .

111-117 ) , that was signed into law on december 16 , 2009 , included $18.0 million for the eac , of which $3.5 million was to be transferred to nist , $750,000 was for the help america vote college program , and $300,000 was for a competitive grant program to support student and parent mock elections .

it also included $75 million for election reform programs , with $70 million of that amount for requirements payments , $3 million for research grants to improve voting technology with respect to disability access , and $2 million for grants to states and localities for voting system logic and accuracy testing .

also , the omnibus provided $12.15 million for disability access and $5.26 million for protection and advocacy programs .

fy2011 for fy2011 , the president's budget request included $16.8 million for the eac , of which $3.25 million was to be transferred to nist .

it also included $5.26 million for protection and advocacy programs and $12.15 million for accessibility payments administered by hhs .

it included eac "election reform grants" among programs to be terminated , and therefore provided no funding for requirements payments , research and pilot program grants , the college program , and mock elections .

as justification , it pointed out that about $1 billion in eac payments to states remained unspent , and claimed that states had accrued $763 million in interest on previously appropriated payments .

the eac , in contrast , listed accrued interest through 2008 as totaling $279 million .

the cause of this discrepancy is not clear .

funding for federal agencies , including the eac , was provided at fy2010 levels according to a series of seven continuing resolutions between september 30 , 2010 , and april 15 , 2011 .

on that date , a continuing resolution was enacted to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year .

h.r .

1473 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 , provided $16.3 million for the eac , of which $3.25 million was to be transferred to nist .

it provided no new funding for election reform programs .

fy2012 for fy2012 , the president's budget request included $13.7 million for the eac , of which $3.25 million was to be transferred to nist , resulting in a 23% reduction in operating funds for the eac from the fy2011 request and a 28% reduction from the fy2010 appropriation .

the budget request also included no funding for the hava - authorized protection and advocacy programs and accessibility payments administered by hhs .

p.l .

112-74 provided $11.5 million for the eac , of which $2.75 million was for nist and $1.25 million was for the office of the inspector general .

fy2013 for fy2013 , the president's budget request included $11.5 million for the eac , of which $2.75 million was to be transferred to nist and $1.3 million was for the office of the inspector general .

funding was provided under a continuing resolution , p.l .

112-175 , until march 2013 , when it was superseded by p.l .

113-6 , the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 .

under the president's sequester order , appropriations under the law were reduced for all federal agencies , although the specific amounts of the reductions are not known .

the house and senate reports for fy2014 appropriations for financial services and general government both note that the fy2013 appropriation for the eac was $11.5 million before the sequester reduction .

fy2014 for fy2014 , the president's budget request included $11.0 million for the eac , of which $2.75 million of that amount was to be transferred to nist for its work on testing guidelines for voting system hardware and software .

the house committee on appropriations recommended eliminating the eac and provided no funding for the agency ; the senate committee on appropriations would have provided $11.0 million for the eac , with $2.75 million to be transferred to nist .

the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 ( h.r .

3547 ) provided $10.0 million for the eac , including $1.9 million for nist .

fy2015 for fy2015 , the president's budget request included $10.0 million for the eac , with $1.9 million of that amount to be transferred to nist for its work on testing guidelines for voting system hardware and software .

the house committee on appropriations recommended eliminating the eac and provided no funding for the agency in h.r .

5016 , which passed the house on july 16 , 2014 .

funding for the eac was provided in consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 ( h.r .

83 ) , which included $10.0 million , of which $1.9 million was for nist .

fy2016 for fy2016 , the president's budget request included $9.6 million for the eac , with $1.5 million of that amount to be transferred to nist for its work on testing guidelines for voting system hardware and software .

the house committee on appropriations included $4.8 million for the agency in h.r .

2995 , which was reported to the house on july 9 , 2015 .

the senate committee on appropriations included $9.6 million for the agency , with $1.9 million of that amount to be transferred to nist , in s. 1910 , which was reported to the senate on july 30 , 2015 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( h.r .

2029 ) , provided $9.6 million for the eac , including $1.5 million for nist .
