the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules ; these benefits include medical care , disability compensation and pensions , education , vocational rehabilitation and employment services , assistance to homeless veterans , home loan guarantees , administration of life insurance as well as traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers , and death benefits that cover burial expenses .

the va carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals ( bva ) .

the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) is responsible for , among other things , providing compensation , pensions , and education assistance .

the national cemetery administration ( nca ) is responsible for maintaining national veterans' cemeteries ; providing grants to states for establishing , expanding , or improving state veterans' cemeteries ; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons , among other things .

the veterans health administration ( vha ) is responsible for health care services and medical and prosthetic research programs .

the vha is primarily a direct service provider of primary care , specialized care , and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system .

inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the civilian health and medical program of the department of veterans affairs ( champva ) .

the vha is also a provider of health care education and training for physician residents and other health care trainees .

the other statutory missions of vha are to serve as a contingency backup to the department of defense ( dod ) medical system during a national security emergency , and to provide support to the national disaster medical system and the department of health and human services as necessary .

in general , eligibility for va health care is based on previous military service , presence of service - connected disabilities , and / or other factors .

veterans generally must enroll in the va health care system to receive medical care .

once enrolled , veterans are assigned to one of eight categories ( see appendix a ) .

it should be noted that in any given year , not all enrolled veterans obtain their health care services from the va .

while some veterans may rely solely on the va for their care , others may receive the majority of their health care services from other sources , such as medicare , medicaid , private health insurance , and the military health system ( tricare ) .

va - enrolled veterans do not pay premiums or enrollment fees to receive care from the va ; however , they may incur out - of - pocket costs for va care related to conditions that are not service - connected .

in fy2014 , there were approximately 21.9 million living veterans in the nation whose service ranged from world war ii , korea , vietnam , the gulf war ( which includes operation enduring freedom / operation iraqi freedom / operation new dawn ( oef / oif / ond ) ) and the intervening periods .

of this number approximately 9.1 million were estimated to be enrolled in the va health care system ( see table 1 ) .

from fy2011 through fy2014 the total number of enrollees has increased by 6.3% .

of the total number of enrolled veterans in fy2014 , va anticipated treating approximately 5.9 million unique veteran patients ( see table 2 ) .

for fy2015 , vha estimates that it will treat about 6 million unique veteran patients , and of these , va anticipates treating more than 757,000 operation enduring freedom ( oef ) , operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , and operation new dawn ( ond ) veterans .

in fy2015 , oef , oif , and ond patients would represent approximately 11.2% of the overall patients served by the va. vha also provides medical care to certain non - veterans ; in fy2015 this population is expected to increase by more than 14,000 patients over the fy2014 level .

in total , including non - veterans , it is estimated the vha will treat nearly 6.7 million patients in 2015 , a slight increase of 1.9% over the number of patients treated in fy2014 ( see table 2 ) .

between fy2011 and fy2015 , the number of patients treated by va has grown by 9.3% .

the total number of outpatient visits , including visits to vet centers , reached 91.7 million during fy2013 and is projected to increase to approximately 94.6 million in fy2014 and 97.2 million in fy2015 .

the rest of this report focuses on appropriations for vha .

it begins with a brief overview of vha's budget formulation , a description of the accounts that fund the vha , and a summary of the fy2014 vha budget .

the report ends with a section discussing recent legislative developments pertaining to the fy2015 vha budget .

in order to understand annual appropriations for the veterans health administration ( vha ) , it is essential to understand the role of advance appropriations .

in 2009 , congress enacted the veterans health care budget reform and transparency act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-81 ) authorizing advance appropriations for three of the four accounts that comprise vha: medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities .

the fourth account , the medical and prosthetic research account , is not funded with an advance appropriation .

p.l .

111-81 also required the department of veterans affairs to submit a request for advance appropriations for vha with its budget request each year .

congress first provided advance appropriations for the three vha accounts in the fy2010 appropriations cycle ; the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l .

111-117 ) , provided advance appropriations for fy2011 .

subsequently , each successive appropriation measure has provided advance appropriations for the vha accounts: the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ) , provided advance appropriations for fy2012 ; the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 ( p.l .

112-74 ) , provided advance appropriations for fy2013 ; the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 ( p.l .

113-6 ) , provided advance appropriations for fy2014 ; and the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-76 ) provided advance appropriations for fy2015 .

the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( h.r .

83 ; p.l .

113-235 ) provides advance appropriations for fy2016 .

additionally , the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( h.r .

83 ; p.l .

113-235 ) , amended 38 u.s.c ยง117 and included three more accounts to the advance appropriations list of accounts .

this authorizes advance appropriations for three mandatory va programs within the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) : compensation and pensions , readjustment benefits , and veterans insurance and indemnities .

beginning with the fy2016 milcon - va appropriations bill , those accounts would receive advance appropriations for fy2017 in addition to the three vha accounts that are already authorized to receive advance appropriations .

under current budget scoring guidelines , advance appropriations of budget authority are scored as new budget authority in the fiscal year in which the funds become newly available for obligation , and not in the fiscal year the appropriations are enacted .

therefore , throughout the funding tables of this report , advance appropriations numbers are shown under the label "memorandum" and in the corresponding fiscal year column .

for example , the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2015 ( h.r .

83 ; p.l .

113-235 ) provides advance appropriations for the medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities accounts for fy2016 .

funding shown for fy2015 does not include advance appropriations provided in fy2015 by p.l .

113-235 for use in fy2016 .

instead , the advance appropriation provided in fy2015 for use in fy2016 is shown in the memorandum in the fy2016 column .

the va budget includes both mandatory and discretionary funding .

mandatory accounts fund disability compensation , pensions , vocational rehabilitation and employment , education , life insurance , housing , and burial benefits ( such as graveliners , outer burial receptacles , and headstones ) , among other benefits and services .

discretionary accounts fund medical care , medical research , construction programs , information technology , and general operating expenses , among other things .

appendix b provides enacted appropriations from fy1995 to fy2014 for the va , including all three administrations that compose the va: vba , vha , and nca .

figure 1 provides a breakdown of fy2014 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary programs .

in fy2014 , the total va budget authority was approximately $147.9 billion ; discretionary budget authority accounted for about 42.8% ( $63.2 billion ) of the total , with about 86.9% ( $54.9 billion ) of this discretionary funding going toward supporting va health care programs , including medical and prosthetic research .

the va's mandatory budget authority accounted for about 57.4% ( $84.7 billion ) of the total va budget authority , with about 84.4% ( $71.4 billion ) of this mandatory funding going toward disability compensation and pension programs .

figure 2 provides a breakdown of the fy2015 president's budget request for both mandatory and discretionary programs .

for fy2015 , the administration requested approximately $158.6 billion .

this includes approximately $65.1 billion in discretionary funding and $93.5 billion in mandatory funding .

a major portion of the mandatory benefits will be for compensation and pension benefits for veterans and surviving spouses , dependent children , and dependent parents .

similar to most federal agencies , the va begins formulating its budget request approximately 10 months before the president submits the budget to congress , generally in early february .

vha's budget request to congress begins with the formulations of the budget based on the enrollee health care projection model ( ehcpm ) , and the civilian health and medical program veterans administration ( champva ) model .

the two models collectively estimate the amount of budgetary resources vha will need to meet the expected demand for most of the health care services it provides .

the ehcpm's estimates are based on three basic components: the projected number of veterans who will be enrolled in va health care , the projected utilization of va's health care services โ that is , the quantity of health care services enrollees are expected to use โ and the projected unit cost of providing these services .

each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of va health care and the veterans who access va's health care services .

the ehcpm makes projections three or four years into the future .

each year , vha updates the ehcpm estimates to "incorporate the most recent data on health care utilization rates , actual program experience , and other factors , such as economic trends in unemployment and inflation. .

for instance , in 2013 , vha used data from fy2012 to develop its health care budget estimate for the fy2015 request , including the advance appropriations request for fy2016 .

the champva model is a more recent model adopted by vha in 2010 .

the champva model projects the cost of providing medical coverage to champva eligible beneficiaries .

the champva model is composed of two major components: the enrollment model and the claims cost model .

the enrollment model projects the number of beneficiaries enrolled in champva , and the claims cost model projects expenditures for providing care to beneficiaries .

according to the vha , the "2013 champva model was developed using data from fiscal years 2005 to 2012 , publically available research , and input from a development team ( including subject matter experts from vha and vha's champva program ) . .

table 3 provides a detailed timeline for formulating the fy2015 budget request and the fy2016 advance appropriations request .

the president submitted his fy2015 budget request to congress in march 2014 .

the fy2015 president's budget is requesting $158.6 billion for the va as a whole ( see table 4 ) .

for va medical services , the administration's budget is requesting $367.8 million in additional funding above the fy2015 advance appropriations of $45 billion provided in fy2014 .

in total , the president is requesting $56.6 billion for vha for fy2015 .

this includes $45.4 billion for the medical services account , $5.9 billion for the medical support and compliance account , $4.7 billion for the medical facilities account , and nearly $589 million for the medical and prosthetic research account ( see table 5 ) .

as required by the veterans health care budget reform and transparency act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-81 ) , the president's budget is requesting $58.6 billion in advance appropriations for the three medical care appropriations ( medical services , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities ) for fy2016 ( see table 5 ) .

this request for advance appropriations would provide care for over 6.8 million unique patients in fy2016 .

on april 3 , 2014 , the house military construction and veterans affairs subcommittee approved its version of a military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations bill for fy2015 ( milcon - va appropriations bill ) .

the pilot program will be titled the ''physician ambassadors helping veterans program.' .

according to the explanatory statement: in some communities non - va physicians have encountered difficulties when seeking to volunteer time at va medical facilities .

under existing authority , section 7405 ( a ) ( 1 ) of title 38 , united states code , the secretary may appoint on a without compensation basis such personnel found necessary for the provision of healthcare for veterans .

at medical facilities exhibiting staffing shortages and appointment backlogs due to waiting time issues , the va is urged to utilize this existing authority to appoint physicians on a volunteer basis to serve veterans' healthcare needs at va medical facilities .
