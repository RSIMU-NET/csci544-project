since early 2018 , certain foreign nations have targeted u.s. food and agricultural products with retaliatory tariffs ( for more on tariffs , see box 1 ) in response to u.s .

section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and u.s .

section 301 tariffs levied on imports from china .

the first u.s. trade action occurred on march 8 , 2018 , when president trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports ( with some flexibility on the application of tariffs by country ) using presidential powers granted under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 .

section 232 authorizes the president to impose restrictions on certain imports based on an affirmative determination by the department of commerce that the targeted import products threaten national security .

the targeted exporters , china , canada , mexico , the european union ( eu ) , and turkey , responded by levying retaliatory tariffs on u.s. food and agricultural products , and other goods .

india proposed retaliatory tariffs but did not implement them until june 2019 .

a second action occurred in july 2018 when the trump administration used a section 301 investigation to impose tariffs of 25% on $34 billion of selected imports from china , citing concerns over china's policies on intellectual property , technology , and innovation .

in august 2018 , the administration levied a second round of section 301 tariffs , also of 25% , on an additional $16 billion of imports from china .

in september 2018 , additional tariffs of 10% were applied to $200 billion of imports from china and , in may 2019 , these were raised to 25% .

on august 13 , 2019 , the office of u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) published two lists of additional chinese imports that would face 10% tariffs , effective september 1 , 2019 , and december 15 , 2019 .

the imposition of the section 301 tariffs on chinese goods resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china .

additionally , in august 2019 , china asked its state - owned enterprises to halt purchases of u.s. agricultural goods .

on august 23 , 2019 , china further retaliated by levying two additional sets of tariffs: 5% or 10% tariffs on u.s. imports , including 695 different u.s. agricultural tariff lines effective september 1 , 2019 ; and another 5% or 10% tariffs on u.s. imports including 184 different u.s. agricultural tariff lines effective december 15 , 2019 .

during 2018 , china , canada , mexico , the eu , and turkey jointly levied retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,000 u.s. food and agricultural tariff lines .

india prepared a list of u.s. products targeted for retaliatory tariffs in 2018 but refrained from implementing them .

then in 2019 , india implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain u.s. lentils , apples , and tree nuts after the united states removed india from the u.s. generalized system of preferences ( gsp ) program on may 31 , 2019 .

gsp provides duty - free tariff treatment for certain products from designated developing countries .

india's removal from gsp is expected to raise duties valued at about $5 billion to $6 billion on goods the united states imports from indiaâor slightly more than 10% of india's total 2018 exports of $54 billion to the united states .

in response to u.s. action , india implemented the retaliatory tariffs identified in 2018 , with some changes , effective june 16 , 2019 .

on may 17 , 2019 , the trump administration reached an agreement with canada and mexico to remove the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from those countries and to remove all retaliatory tariffs imposed on u.s. goods .

the administration reduced tariffs on turkish steel imports , and turkey responded on may 21 , 2019 , by halving its retaliatory tariffs on u.s. imports .

except for china , which faces both section 232 and section 301 tariffs , other countries' retaliatory tariffs respond only to u.s .

section 232 tariffs on u.s. imports of certain steel and aluminum products .

higher retaliatory tariffs represent increases above the world trade organization ( wto ) most favored nation ( mfn ) tariff rates or beyond any existing preferential tariff rates .

retaliatory tariffs for canada and mexico are increases from the existing north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) rates , most of which , at zero percent , are below the mfn rates .

table 1 summarizes the retaliatory tariff increases on u.s. agricultural products by comparing tariff increases of september 2018 with the retaliatory tariffs in effect in june 2019 .

a potential reason for observed changes in applied tariffs rates is that some tariffs are levied based on quantity ( such as per ton or per kilograms ) and , for purposes of analyses , tariffs are converted to percentage of total import value , ad valorem rates ( see box 2 ) .

when the price of a traded product changes , the ad valorem tariff rate imposed on a product can change .

additionally , it is not always possible to match the u.s. harmonized tariff schedule ( hts ) with the retaliatory country's 8- or 10-digit tariff code ( see box 1 ) .

thus , it may be difficult to link the u.s. census bureau trade data with the tariff codes of products affected by retaliatory tariffs .

therefore , this report makes use of both u.s. export data and partner country import data as appropriate to provide the most accurate measure of the magnitude of the affected u.s. trade .

for u.s. retaliating trade partners , table 1 provides the minimum , maximum , and simple ( not trade - weighted ) average retaliatory tariff hike rates .

foreign nations may target u.s. food and agricultural products with retaliatory tariffs for several reasons .

first , the united states is the largest exporter of food and agricultural products , so many countries are able to retaliate against those goods .

second , agricultural commodities are often more easily substituted from among potential suppliers , so curbing imports from one country would not necessarily limit an importing country's access to the commodity .

third , several food and agricultural products are produced primarily in certain regions of the united states , and thus may be targeted with a view to negatively and disproportionately affecting the constituents of specific u.s. lawmakers .

the retaliatory tariffs imposed by u.s. trading partners affected many products exported by the united states , including meats , grains , dairy products , specialty and horticultural crops , and alcoholic beverages .

as discussed in box 3 , "tariffs increase import prices," a number of factors affect trade , including tariffs that tend to increase the price of imported goods .

in 2018 , total imports of affected u.s. food and agricultural products by all retaliating countries amounted to almost $22 billion , based on customs data from these countries .

this represents a 27% decline from the $29.7 billion in 2017 ( figure 1 ) .

based on chinese customs data , the total value of chinese agricultural imports from the united states affected by retaliatory tariffs declined from $22.5 billion in 2017 to $14.7 billion in 2018 .

canadian customs data show that imports of u.s. agricultural products declined to $2.3 billion in 2018 from $2.4 billion in 2017 .

canadian retaliatory tariffs include certain tariff lines covering prepared product categories under beef , poultry , dairy , fruit , vegetables , drinks , coffee and spices , chocolate and confectionary , and whiskey .

as noted earlier , canada removed its retaliatory tariffs on u.s. imports in may 2019 , in response to the u.s. removal of section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from canada .

a review of mexican customs data finds that imports of u.s. agricultural products by mexico also declined from $2.6 billion in 2017 to $2.5 billion in 2018 , largely accounted for by sausage and pork products .

mexico's imports of these products declined from $2.3 billion in 2017 to $1.6 billion in 2018 .

in addition to pork products , mexico had imposed retaliatory tariffs on cheeses , apples , prepared fruit , vegetables and other food , and whiskey .

mexico also removed its retaliatory tariffs on u.s. imports in may 2019 , in response to u.s. removal of section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from mexico .

eu customs data show the import value of u.s. food and agricultural products affected by the eu retaliatory tariffs increased to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $1.1 billion in 2017 .

the eu imposed tariff hikes on certain prepared vegetables , pulses , breakfast cereals , fruit juices , peanut butter , tobacco products , whiskey , and essential oils .

a temporary surge in sales in the months prior to the imposition of duties appears to have offset a slump in sales that coincided with the onset of retaliatory duties later in the year ( figure 2 ) .

based on the quarterly import data , by the first quarter of 2019 , the total value of eu imports of u.s. products affected by retaliatory tariffs was lower than during the last quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018 .

since the second quarter of 2018 , eu imports of affected food and agricultural products from the united states declined .

as discussed above , beyond the tariff increases , a number of factors may have contributed to this reduction in imports .

for instance , when countries first released their proposed lists of products that they targeted for retaliation , some eu importers may have imported larger quantities of the affected products prior to the imposition of the duties , thus boosting eu imports of u.s. agricultural goods in 2018 .

similar to the eu , the total value of turkish imports of u.s. food and agricultural products affected by retaliatory tariffs increased between 2017 ( $299 million ) and 2018 ( $316 million ) , based on turkish customs data .

turkey had imposed tariff hikes on certain tree nuts , prepared food , rice , tobacco , whiskey , and other alcoholic beverages .

imports in the months prior to the imposition of duties had increased ( figure 2 ) , which may have offset the decline in imports during the second half of 2018 .

in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 , turkish imports of affected u.s. food and agricultural products declined .

since may 2019 , turkey halved its retaliatory tariffs on imports from the united states .

during 2018 , india did not levy any retaliatory tariffs on imports of u.s. food and agricultural products .

starting in june 16 , 2019 , india implemented retaliatory tariffs on imports of u.s. almonds , walnuts , chickpeas , lentils , and apples .

based on the indian customs data , the total value of indian imports of these products was $824 million in 2017 and $859 million in 2018 .

the chinese market is important for several u.s. agricultural products .

for example , in 2016 and 2017 , the united states supplied over a third of china's total soybean imports , almost all of china's distillers' grain imports ( primarily used as animal feed ) , and most of china's sorghum imports .

in 2017 , the chinese market accounted for about 57% of global u.s. soybean exports , 17% of global u.s. cotton exports , 80% of global u.s. sorghum exports , 11% of global u.s. dairy product exports , 10% of global u.s. pork exports , 6% of global u.s. wheat exports , and 5% of global u.s. fruit exports .

in response to u.s .

section 232 and section 301 tariffs on u.s. imports of chinese goods imposed in 2018 , china levied retaliatory tariffs on imports of almost all u.s. agricultural products .

in 2017 , china was the second - leading export market by value for u.s. agricultural products .

however , after the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on u.s. imports beginning in april 2018 , u.s. agricultural exports to china experienced a 53% decline from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $9.2 billion in 2018 ( figure 3 ) .

china thus moved down in rank to become the fourth - largest u.s. agricultural market , after canada , mexico , and japan .

among other goods , china imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on u.s. soybeans in july 2018 .

since 2000 , china had been the top export market for u.s. soybeans .

in 2017 , china imported about $12 billion worth of u.s. soybeans , accounting for 57% of the total value of all u.s. soybean exports that year .

with higher tariffs in place , china has been purchasing more soybeans from brazil and other countries to meet its demand .

consequently , u.s. soybean exports to china in 2018 declined to $3 billion ( figure 3 ) .

u.s. census bureau trade data indicate china was still the top foreign destination for u.s. soybeans in 2018 , followed by mexico , which imported $1.8 billion of u.s. soybeans .

reduced chinese import demand in 2018 contributed to declining farm prices for affected commodities and lower u.s. agricultural exports to china for several commodities , including sorghum , soybeans , cotton , and pork .

consequently , u.s. soybean prices reached 10-year lows during july - october 2018 ( figure 4 ) , weighing on prices of other agricultural commodities , such as corn , that compete with soybeans for acreage .

prices recovered some during the last quarter of 2018 , coincident with reported commitments by china to purchase a "very substantial amount of u.s. agricultural" goods .

however , chinese purchases failed to materialize and u.s. commodity prices resumed their downward trend through the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing .

as u.s. soybean prices declined in 2018 , brazilian soybean prices started to rise , indicative of a greater demand for brazilian soybeans from china ( figure 4 ) .

since 2007 , brazilian and u.s. soybean prices had tended to move together .

starting in april 2018 , u.s. soybean prices started to fall and brazilian soybean prices started to rise .

china's imposition of a 25% tariff on u.s. soybeans in july 2018 initially precipitated a widening of the gap between the two prices .

on october 23 , 2018 , u.s. soybean free on board ( fob ) prices were $86 per metric ton lower than brazilian ( paranaguã¡ ) fob prices .

the brazilian soybean price started to fall in late october in anticipation of a record - high south american soybean harvest .

u.s. soybean prices started to climb at the same time , partly due to farmers' willingness to hold stocks and in response to larger exports to non - chinese destinations .

anticipation of chinese purchases also contributed to rebounding of u.s. prices .

as chinese purchases did not materialize , brazilian and u.s. soybean prices started to diverge again in may 2019 .

although soybeans have been the agricultural commodity most affected by retaliatory tariffs ( largely due to china's dominant role in the global soybean market ) , nearly all u.s. agricultural exports to china declined in 2018 relative to 2017 ( see table 3 ) .

with retaliatory tariffs making u.s. agricultural products more expensive for chinese buyers , exports from other countries to china increased during 2018 .

some studies suggest that brazil could become china's primary soybean supplier .

another study concludes that u.s. - china tariff escalation would make suppliers in the rest of the world more competitive relative to u.s. and chinese suppliers .

russia also contends that it may become a major u.s. competitor for china's agricultural import market , although market watchers expect russia will need years to become a major agricultural supplier to china .

to explore these assertions , crs examined chinese import data to identify foreign sources that may have partially replaced some of the 2018 u.s. agricultural exports to china .

note that various factors can result in data differences between u.s. exports from the u.s. census bureau and imports from chinese customs data ( box 4 ) .

u.s. agriculture , as a whole , is subject to intense competition , in both domestic and international markets .

as a result , most commodity sectors operate with thin profit margins , making international sales an important component of revenue .

tariffs , by design , raise the cost of imported products ( see box 3 ) .

in general , an increase in import prices due to higher tariffs leads to a decrease in quantities purchased of the affected products as importers switch to other foreign suppliers or to alternate products within the domestic market .

thus , the trade impact of such a price increase will depend in large part on the number of available alternate foreign suppliers and the availability of substitutes within the domestic market .

furthermore , a decrease in exports will have an economy - wide effect as the supporting infrastructureâincluding farms , marketing cooperatives , warehousing and processing facilities , and transportation networks , for exampleâall lose business and revenues .

this loss ripples further through the general economy and can cause decreases in employment and local , state , and federal tax revenues .

this section of the report examines the short - term market impacts and selected economic analyses of longer - term impacts of the retaliatory tariffs .

in may 2019 , american farm bureau federation president zippy duvall stated that , "retaliatory tariffs are a drag on american farmers and ranchers at a time when they are suffering more economic difficulty than many can remember," and urged negotiators to continue their work toward reopening markets with the european union , china , and japan .

the president of the national farmers union ( nfu ) echoed the same sentiment , stating that the retaliatory tariffs "could not come at a worse time for family farmers and ranchers , who are already coping with depressed commodity prices , environmental disasters , and chronic oversupply. .

the nfu president further stated that although temporary relief is appreciated , "temporary solutions are not sufficient to address the permanent damage the trade war has inflicted on agricultural export markets. .

various u.s. agricultural commodity groups have voiced similar concerns .

for example , the american soybean association expressed "extreme disappointment" over ustr's escalating tariffs on china that led to retaliatory tariffs on soybeans .

the national pork producers council ( nppc ) stated that the retaliatory tariffs are "threatening the livelihoods of thousands of u.s. pig farmers. .

due to african swine fever ( asf ) , china normally would have turned to the united states to meet its pork demand .

with retaliatory tariffs in place , u.s. pork is more expensive than products from other sources in the chinese market .

nppc vice president nick giordano stated that from a u.s. farmer's perspective , china's increased demand for imported pork resulting from asf in chinese hogs would have been "the single greatest sales opportunity in our industry's history. .

according to a report in the south china morning post , iowa state university economist dermot hayes estimates that the trade dispute with china has cost american pig farmers $8 per animal , or $1 billion in total losses .

the u.s .

dairy export council , in turn , stated in 2018 that the retaliatory tariffs that china and mexico imposed could result in billions of dollars of lost sales for u.s. dairy producers .

a study released by the association of equipment manufacturers states that tariffs on steel and aluminum have increased cost of agricultural production due to rising prices of farm equipment and their parts .

in a comment filed with ustr , croplife america and a specialty chemical trade group , responsible industry for a sound environment ( rise ) , state that cost increases , resulting from escalating tariffs , "of pesticide products for crop and turf protection products ultimately will be passed on to american growers and businesses. .

dozens of stakeholder panels provided testimony to the ustr during hearings in june 2019 regarding a proposed notice to begin imposing additional tariffs of 25% to virtually all remaining imports from china .

hundreds of u.s. companies and industry groups , including some of the largest companies argued that , "both sides will lose" in a protracted trade war .

"tariffs are taxes paid directly by u.s. companies , including those listed belowânot china," stated a letter signed by more than 600 companies , including the association of equipment manufacturers , american bakers association , grocery manufacturers association , juice products association , distilled spirits council of the united states , and many other food retailers and associations related to the food industry .

on june 21 , 2019 , hundreds of domestic producers and four manufacturing and labor groups sent a letter to president trump urging him to maintain his hardline approach to china .

the letter was signed by the coalition for a prosperous america , which includes mainly nonagricultural manufacturing companies and some food - and agriculture - related small companies like the platt cattle company of arizona and johanna foods of new jersey .

to help alleviate the losses from the retaliatory tariffs , usda announced a second round of trade aid in 2019 .

most industry groups welcomed this package but indicated their preference for trade rather than aid .

american farm bureau federation president zippy duvall stated , "it is critically important to restore agricultural markets and mutually beneficial relationships with our trading partners around the world. .

similar sentiments were expressed by a number of other major agricultural trade associations , such as the national council of farmer cooperatives , the american soybean association , the national cotton council , the national milk producers federation , and the national pork producers council .

for its part , the national association of wheat growers stated that the trade - aid package "is a band - aid when we really need a long - term fix. .

in may 2019 , president trump proposed levying additional tariff increases on imports from china , but they were held in abeyance following a meeting between president trump and chinese president xi jinping at the g - 20 summit in june 2019 .

however , president trump stated on august 2019 that he would impose a tariff hike increase on all other chinese products currently not covered by section 301 tariffs .

china responded by asking its state - owned enterprises to halt purchases of u.s. agricultural goods .

on august 13 , 2019 , ustr released the remaining list of chinese products that would be levied a 10% section 301 tariff effective september 1 , 2019 , and another list of products that would be levied 10% section 301 tariffs effective december 15 , 2019 .

china in turn has retaliated by levying additional two sets of tariffs: 5% or 10% tariffs on u.s. imports , including 695 different u.s. agricultural tariff lines effective september 1 , 2019 ; and another 5% or 10% tariffs on u.s. imports including 184 different u.s. agricultural tariff lines effective december 15 , 2019 .

given the length of the trade dispute over section 232 and section 301 actions and the expanding list of u.s. exports affected by the retaliatory tariffs , the list of affected sectors is also expanding .

a june 2019 ustr hearing for section 301 tariffs included a diversity of witnesses across 55 panels over a seven - day period .

as such , an issue for congressional consideration may be whether compensation for the losses arising from the various trade disputes should extend beyond those producers of agricultural commodities identified in the administration's trade - aid initiative .

usda , using its authority under the ccc , is administering this assistance .

retaliatory tariffs have arguably affected businesses beyond the farm gate , including agricultural exporters , input suppliers , agricultural shippers , and others , potentially raising the question of whether these industries merit government compensation for tariff - related losses .

separately , some agricultural stakeholders have questioned the equity of the distribution of the 2018 trade aid payments .

once the formula became public , several commodity groups questioned the rationale for determining payments based on "trade damage" rather than the broader "market loss" measure .

similar questions have emerged about the 2019 trade - aid package .

these questions concern the methodology used to calculate the payment rates , commodity coverage of the direct payments , and the equity of payments across regions and commodity sectors .

the provision of trade aid has also raised questions regarding u.s. commitments under the wto and other international agreements .

several wto members , including the eu , canada , australia , new zealand , india , and ukraine , have asked for more details regarding usda's trade - aid package to ascertain whether it could be considered market - distorting under u.s. wto commitments .

given the growth of investments directed to increase agricultural productivity in many countries including russia , and the recent gains that russia , brazil , and other countries have made in china's import market for agricultural products , it may be of interest to congress to consider whether current policies are sufficient for u.s. agriculture to continue to expand its overseas markets .

as other countries expand their agricultural production to meet china's import demand , studies by environmental groups caution that this agricultural expansion may occur at the expense of tropical forest and fragile habitats that are essential to maintain global biodiversity .

the united states is one of the most efficient and lowest - cost producers of food and agricultural products .

congress may want to consider whether the current trade dispute could have long - term environmental costs as less productive or more environmentally vulnerable areas are cultivated for agricultural production in lieu of more efficient and less environmentally sensitive u.s. production .
