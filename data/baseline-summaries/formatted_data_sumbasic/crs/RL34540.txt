the 111 th congress passed economic stimulus and omnibus legislation providing funding for commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ( cjs ) for both fy2008 and fy2009 .

in the 110 th congress , neither the house nor senate considered the fy2009 spending measures reported by the appropriations committees .

congress passed two continuing resolutions that funded most cjs departments and agencies at their fy2008 enacted levels until work on a permanent fy2009 appropriations measure could be enacted .

the 111 th congress also passed legislation that provided cjs departments and agencies with fy2008 supplemental funding .

the origin of the department of commerce dates to 1903 with the establishment of the department of commerce and labor ( 32 stat .

825 ) .

the separate department of commerce was established on march 4 , 1913 ( 37 stat .

7365 ; 15 u.s.c .

1501 ) .

the department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied , but its activities center on five basic missions: ( 1 ) promoting the development of u.s. business and increasing foreign trade ; ( 2 ) improving the nation's technological competitiveness ; ( 3 ) encouraging economic development ; ( 4 ) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment ; and ( 5 ) compiling , analyzing , and disseminating statistical information on the u.s. economy and population .

the following agencies within the commerce department carry out these missions: international trade administration ( ita ) seeks to develop the export potential of u.s. firms and to improve the trade performance of u.s. industry ; bureau of industry and security ( bis ) , formerly the bureau of export administration , enforces u.s. export laws consistent with national security , foreign policy , and short - supply objectives ; economic development administration ( eda ) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions ; minority business development agency ( mbda ) seeks to promote private and public sector investment in minority businesses ; economic and statistics administration ( esa ) , excluding the census bureau , provides ( 1 ) timely information on the state of the economy through preparation , development , and interpretation of economic data ; and ( 2 ) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities .

much of this analysis is conducted by the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) ; united states census bureau , a component of esa , collects , compiles , and publishes a broad range of economic , demographic , and social data ; national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) advises the president on domestic and international communications policy , manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum , and performs research in telecommunications sciences ; united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) examines and approves applications for patents for claimed inventions and registration of trademarks ; national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality , modernize manufacturing processes , ensure product reliability , and facilitate rapid commercialization of products on the basis of new scientific discoveries ; and national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) provides scientific , technical , and management expertise to ( 1 ) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation ; ( 2 ) assess the health of coastal and marine resources ; ( 3 ) monitor and predict the coastal , ocean , and global environments ( including weather forecasting ) ; and ( 4 ) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources .

as table 3 shows , the original fy2009 requested appropriation amount of $8.217 billion was $558.0 million more than the fy2008 enacted amount of $7.659 billion ( p.l .

110-161 , p.l .

110-252 , and p.l .

110-329 ) for the department of commerce , a 7.3% increase .

the largest percentage increase for a single agency was 118.0% for the census bureau .

its request was increased on june 9 , 2008 , at the expense of other programs , as part of a revised budget request for the entire department of commerce .

the june 9 revision sought to reduce , cancel , or shift funding in several commerce programs , including some in the census bureau , to provide almost $546.0 million in additional funds for the 2010 census .

the june 9 revision would have reduced funding in the following department of commerce accounts: international trade administration , reduced $3.2 million ; bureau of industry and security , reduced $0.5 million ; economic development administration , reduced $9.2 million ; minority business development administration , reduced $0.4 million ; economics and statistics administration , reduced $0.5 million ; other programs in the census bureau , reduced $10.8 million ; national telecommunications and information administration , reduced $0.8 million ; national institute of standards and technology , reduced $2.0 million ; national oceanic and atmospheric administration , reduced $13.0 million ; and departmental management , reduced $0.5 million .

under general provisions , department of commerce , the administration also requested cancellation of $70.0 million in unobligated balances associated with the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-246 ) .

the discussions of each agency below reflect the original budget request , except when otherwise noted .

the house committee did not consider the june 9 revision timely and proceeded on the basis of the original budget submission .

for the commerce department , the house committee recommended $8.707 billion , which was 27.0% more than the fy2008 enacted amount and 6.0% more than the original fy2009 requested amount ( excluding supplemental appropriations ) .

although the senate committee , like its house counterpart , considered the revised commerce request untimely , it recommended an increase of $546.4 million over the original budget request for the census bureau's periodic censuses and programs account , which funds the 2010 census .

for commerce as a whole , the senate committee recommended $9.402 billion , which was 37.1% more the fy2008 enacted amount ( without supplemental appropriations ) and 14.4% more than the original fy2009 requested amount .

on march 11 , 2009 , president obama signed into law the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ) , which appropriated $9.268 billion for the department of commerce .

this amount was 12.8% greater than president bush's original fy2009 request of $8.217 billion .

noaa received 47.1% of the department of commerce funding , followed by the census bureau , which received 33.9% .

the national institute of standards and technology received 8.8% of the funding , with the remaining entities receiving 11.0% .

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) , included $7.916 billion for the department of commerce ( doc ) .

this amount is 85% of the $9.268 billion in the fy2009 regular appropriations for doc , resulting in a total appropriation of $17.184 billion for fy2009 .

a total of $5.350 billion , or 68% of the doc total in p.l .

111-5 , was appropriated for the national telecommunications and information administration for activities such as broadband deployment in the united states and the conversion from analog to digital television broadcasts .

for the 2010 census , the bureau of the census received $1.000 billion to hire and train additional personnel , increase targeted media purchases as part of the census communications program ( which includes paid advertising ) , and improve risk management .

up to $250.0 million of the $1.000 billion is to be used for partnership and outreach efforts to minorities and other hard - to - count groups .

the national oceanic and atmospheric administration received $830.0 million .

of this amount , $600.0 million is for facility and fleet construction and maintenance ; $230.0 million is for research , restoration , navigation , conservation , and management activities .

the national institute of standards and technology received $580.0 million for construction and research activities , plus $20.0 million transferred from the department of health and human services for a health information technology initiative .

the economic development administration received $150.0 million for economic development assistance programs , and the doc office of inspector general received $6.0 million .

table 4 provides a summary of doc funding under arra .

president bush's fy2009 budget request included $24.474 billion for science agencies , or $939 million over the enacted fy2008 amount of $23.535 billion , an increase of 4.0% ( see table 9 ) .

the fy2009 request included $396.8 million for the national science foundation's ( nsf ) participation in the national nanotechnology initiative .

the house - reported bill included $24.628 billion for science agencies , 4.6% above the fy2008 enacted level .

the senate - reported bill included $24.673 billion for science agencies , 4.8% above the fy2008 enacted level .

the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ) provided $24.278 billion for the science agencies in fy2009 , 3.2% above the fy2008 enacted level .

congress provided additional funding for research and development under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) , often referred to informally as "the stimulus bill. .

the act included approximately $22.7 billion for r&d , facilities , equipment and related activities across all agencies .

the act provided $4.004 billion for the cjs science agencies , including $1.002 billion for the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and $3.002 billion for nsf ( see table 10 ) .

a third cjs science agency , the white house office of science and technology policy , received no funding under the act .

as shown in table 13 , the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ; h.r .

1105 ) included $872.4 million for related agencies .

this amount is $63.6 million more than the fy2008 enacted level ( a 7.9% increase ) and $88.4 million more than the fy2009 request ( an 11.3% increase ) .

as did the house - and senate - reported bills , the omnibus included $390.0 million for the legal services corporation , an increase of 11.3% over the fy2008 enacted level .

for related agencies , the consolidated security , disaster assistance , and continuing appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

110-329 ; h.r .

2638 ) included an fy2009 continuing resolution ( cr ) that funded these agencies at their fy2008 levels through march 6 , 2009 .

congress later extended this cr through march 11 , 2009 ( p.l .

111-6 ; h.j.res .

38 ) .

earlier in the year , the house appropriations committee - approved bill included $883.1 million for related agencies , an increase of 9.2% over the fy2008 enacted level .

the senate - reported bill included $869.4 million for related agencies , an increase of 7.5% over the enacted fy2008 level .

the fy2009 request included $784.0 million , or nearly $24.8 million less than the enacted fy2008 level ( a 3.1% decrease ) for related agencies .

the legal services corporation would have absorbed the bulk of this decrease , as the fy2009 request only included $311.0 million for the corporation , a reduction of $39.5 million ( an 11.3% decrease ) , as compared to the corporation's enacted fy2008 level of funding .

established by the civil rights act of 1957 , the u.s. commission on civil rights ( the commission ) investigates allegations of citizens who may have been denied the right to vote based on color , race , religion , or national origin ; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws ; assesses federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights ; and submits reports on its findings to the president and congress when the commission or the president deems it appropriate .

during the 110 th congress , the political independence of the commission continued to be an issue .

in report language , the house appropriations committee expressed concern that 36 of the 51 state advisory committees were inoperative because their authorizing charters had expired .

the house committee directed the commission to give priority to reconstituting the state advisory committees and to make appointments that reflect a balance of viewpoints and a diversity in membership , especially in terms of gender , disability , party affiliation , and civil rights experience with affected communities .

further , the committee stated that no one should be denied an opportunity to serve on a state advisory committee because of race , age , sex , sexual orientation , religion , national origin , disability , or political persuasion .

the adequacy of funding for the agency was also a subject of debate , as appropriations for the commission have been less than $10.0 million for more than 10 fiscal years .

the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 provided $8.8 million for the commission .

the explanatory statement directed the commission to report within 60 days of enactment of the act to the house and senate committees on appropriations on ( 1 ) the fy2009 budget activities of the regional offices and the state advisory committees and ( 2 ) the procedures used to ensure transparency and the participation of all commissioners in the preparation and review of all reports and briefing papers .

for fy2009 , the bush administration requested $8.8 million for the u.s. commission on civil rights , the same amount requested for fy2008 and $300,000 above the fy2008 enacted level of $8.5 million for the commission .

the eeoc enforces laws banning employment discrimination based on race , color , national origin , sex , age , or disability .

in recent years , appropriators have been particularly concerned about the agency's implementation of a restructuring plan , beginning in 2005 , that included the national contact center ( ncc ) , field structure and staff realignment , and restructuring of headquarters operations .

the eeoc commissioners responded to the concerns by voting on december 20 , 2007 , to transfer receipt of customer calls from the ncc's contractor to in - house "information intake representatives" in its 53 field offices .

at the same time , they voted favorably on a one - year contract for an "interactive voice response system," the digital telephone technology system that currently handles customer calls .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act included $343.9 million for the eeoc , which is $2 million above the budget request and $14.6 million above the fy2008 enacted level of $329.3 million .

the act included $26.0 million for payments to state and local entities with which the agency has work - sharing agreements to address workplace discrimination within their jurisdictions ( i.e. , fair employment practices agencies , fepas , and tribal employment rights organizations , teros ) .

this reflected a decrease of $3.1 million from the fy2008 appropriation of $29.1 million .

the act provided the eeoc with $6.5 million to address and reduce the record backlog of discrimination cases .

within 60 days of enactment , the eeoc is directed to report to the house and senate appropriations committee on a comprehensive plan for backlog reduction including resource requirements and hiring needs .

to support ongoing efforts to transition from a contractor - operated to an in - house call center , the fy2009 act provided $3.6 million for call - processing personnel and information technology .

the house and senate appropriations committees directed the eeoc to report within 60 days on customer service data and a cost - benefit analysis of hiring higher credentialed employees for the call - intake center .

the eeoc is directed to notify the house and senate appropriations committees prior to any implementation of workforce repositioning , restructuring , or reorganization .

due to concern about the accuracy of workload projections ; the commission is requested to compare the projections with those published in the midyear annual review .

based on findings of the general accountability office ( gao ) , which found that the eeoc did not "strategically or systematically approach mission needs , customer expectations , workload or current workforce needs in its draft strategic workforce plan," congress directed the eeoc to implement the gao recommendations within 60 days after enactment .

the itc is an independent , quasi - judicial agency that advises the president and congress on the impact of u.s. foreign economic policies on u.s. industries and , along with the import administration unit of ita , is charged with administering various u.s. trade remedy laws .

its six commissioners are appointed by the president for nine - year terms .

as a matter of policy , its budget request is submitted to congress by the president without revision .

the fy2009 enacted appropriation for itc was $75.1 million , a $1.5 million increase over the budget request of $73.6 million for existing mandated investigative activity and related operations ; a mandatory pay increase ; and information technology projects .

the enacted amount was $6.7 million ( 9.8% ) more than the fy2008 funding level of $68.4 million .

the house - reported bill would have provided the same amount of funding as the enacted amount of $75.1 million , or 2.0% over the fy2009 request .

the senate - reported bill would have provided $75.0 million , 9.6% over the fy2008 enacted level and 1.9% over the fy2009 request .

the lsc is a private , non - profit , federally funded corporation that provides grants to local offices that , in turn , provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( non - criminal ) cases .

the lsc has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 .

there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake .

in annual appropriations bills , congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lsc - funded grantees , such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases .

current lsc funding remains below the lsc's highest funding level of $400.0 million in fy1994 and fy1995 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .

110-161 ) included $350.5 million for the lsc for fy2008 .

this amount is $1.9 million above the fy2007 appropriation ( $348.6 million ) for the lsc and $39.6 million above the administration's fy2008 budget request for the lsc .

the fy2008 appropriation for the lsc included $332.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $12.5 million for management and administration ; $2.1 million for client self - help and information technology ; $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $500 ,000 for loan repayment assistance ( for legal aid lawyers ) .

for fy2009 , the bush administration requested $311.0 million for the lsc .

the administration's budget request included $290.1 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $12.8 million for management and administration ; $5.0 million for client self - help and information technology ; and $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general .

for fy2009 , the house appropriations committee approved $390.0 million for the lsc .

the house - reported bill would have provided 11% more than the fy2008 lsc appropriation and 25% more than the fy2009 request for the lsc .

the house bill included $367.0 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $16.0 million for management and administration ; $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology ; $3.0 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance .

for fy2009 , the senate appropriations committee also approved $390.0 million for the lsc .

the senate committee - reported bill would have provided 11% more than the fy2008 lsc appropriation and 25% more than the fy2009 request for the lsc .

the senate bill would have provided the same amount as the house - reported bill .

the senate bill , however , included $369.0 million for basic field programs and required independent audits ; $13.0 million for management and administration ; $3.8 million for client self - help and information technology ; $3.2 million for the office of the inspector general ; and $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance .

the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ) , included $390.0 million for the lsc for fy2009 .

this amount was $39.5 million above the fy2008 appropriation ( $350.5 million ) for the lsc and $79.0 million above the bush administration's fy2009 budget request for the lsc .

the fy2009 appropriation for the lsc included $365.8 million for basic field programs and required independent audits , $16.0 million for management and administration , $3.0 million for client self - help and information technology , $4.2 million for the office of the inspector general , and $1.0 million for loan repayment assistance .

the marine mammal commission is an independent agency of the executive branch , established under title ii of the marine mammal protection act ( mmpa ; p.l .

92-522 ) .

the marine mammal commission ( mmc ) and its committee of scientific advisors on marine mammals provide oversight and recommend actions on domestic and international topics to advance policies and provisions of the marine mammal protection act .

as funding permits , the marine mammal commission supports research to further the purposes of the mmpa .

for fy2009 , the bush administration proposed $2.4 million for necessary expenses of the marine mammal commission , a decrease of $420 thousand ( - 14.9% ) from the fy2008 appropriation of $2.82 million for this independent agency .

the house committee on appropriations recommended $3.2 million , $380,000 ( 13.5% ) more than the fy2008 enacted level and $800,000 ( 33.3% ) more than the fy2009 request , stating: the number of issues reflecting marine mammal conservation has grown over the past three decades and the committee recognizes these increasing responsibilities of the commission .

.. .

the committee has provided this increase to allow the commission to address various challenges including the effects of and adaptation to climate change and the study of endangered species .

the senate committee on appropriations concurred with the bush administration's request , recommending $2.4 million ( s.rept .

110-397 ) .

the vbc was established under the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 ( p.l .

106-50 ) .

the corporation's mission is to foster entrepreneurship and business opportunities for veterans , including service - disabled veterans .

the vbc provides veterans with access to capital and business services , entrepreneurial education , surety bonding , insurance and prescription coverage , as well as a veterans business directory .

congress provided the corporation with $1.5 million in funding for each year , fy2006 and fy2007 .

the enacted fy2008 vbc appropriation was $1.4 million .

the administration's fy2009 budget request did not include any funding for vbc .

the house - reported included $3.2 million , an increase of 127% over the fy2008 enacted level .

like the senate - reported bill , the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l .

111-8 ) did not include any funding for the vbc .

ustr , located in the executive office of the president ( eop ) , is responsible for developing and coordinating u.s. international trade and direct investment policies .

the ustr is the president's chief negotiator for international trade agreements .

in 2006 and 2007 , the bush administration concluded ftas with peru , colombia , oman , panama , and south korea .

in 2006 and 2007 , ustr obtained congressional approval of ftas with peru , bahrain , the dominican republic , and central american countries .

in its fy2009 congressional budget submission , the ustr stated the following as its priorities for fy2009: •    concluding several bilateral agreements , •    completing the doha round of the world trade organization ( wto ) negotiations , •    pursuing china's compliance with its wto obligations , •    litigating enforcement actions in the wto , •    negotiating wto accession agreements for key countries , and •    launching new negotiations as necessary to further the trade agenda .

the fy2009 enacted appropriation for ustr is $47.3 million , a 7.3% increase over the fy2008 funding level of $44.1 million .

the enacted amount is $1 million ( 2.2% ) over the president's fy2009 request of $46.3 million and $3.2 million ( 7.3% ) over the fy2008 funding level of $44.1 million .

the house - reported bill would have provided $48.3 million , $1 million ( 2.1% ) over the fy2009 enacted level and $2 million ( 4.3% ) over the budget request .

the senate - reported bill would have provided $46.3 million , $1 million ( 2.1% ) less than the enacted fy2009 level and the same amount as the budget request .

the state justice institute ( sji ) is a nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts and funds research , technical assistance , and informational projects aimed at improving the quality of judicial administration in state courts across the united states .

it is governed by an 11-member board of directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate .

under the terms of its enabling legislation , sji is authorized to present its budget request directly to congress , apart from the president's budget .

the fy2009 omnibus appropriations act provided $4.1 million in funding for sji , 9% above the fy2008 enacted level of $3.8 million but 23.9% below the institute's fy2009 request of $5.39 million .

 ( the bush administration , as in its budgets for the previous six years , did not request any appropriated funds for the institute for fy2009. ) .

the $4.1 million appropriation for sji in fy2009 was the same funding amount as included in the house - reported bill .

the senate - reported bill included $5.0 million , 33% above the fy2008 enacted level but 7.2% less than sji's fy2009 request .

for the past several fiscal years , sji has been encouraged by congressional appropriators to obtain funds , at least in part , from sources other than congress .

in the fy2008 appropriations process , for instance , the house appropriations committee endorsed an approach of providing some directly appropriated funds to sji , but with the institute also seeking additional funding from department of justice ( doj ) grant programs .

the committee at the same time commended sji for its "recent successes in obtaining dollar - for - dollar matching funds for grants awarded. .
