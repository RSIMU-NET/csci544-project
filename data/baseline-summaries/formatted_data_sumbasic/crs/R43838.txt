world events in recent years have led observers , particularly since late 2013 , to conclude that the international security environment in recent years has undergone a shift from the post - cold war era that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s , also sometimes known as the unipolar moment ( with the united states as the unipolar power ) , to a new and different situation that features , among other things , renewed great power competition with china and russia and challenges by these two countries and others to elements of the u.s. - led international order that has operated since world war ii .

the issue for congress is how u.s. defense funding levels , strategy , plans , and programs should respond to the shift in the international security environment .

congress's decisions on these issues could have significant implications for u.s. defense capabilities and funding requirements .

this report focuses on defense - related issues and does not discuss potential implications of a shift in the international security environment for other policy areas , such as foreign policy and diplomacy , trade and finance , energy , and foreign assistance .

future crs reports may address the potential implications of a shift in the international security environment for these other policy areas .

a separate crs report discusses the current debate over the future u.s. role in the world and the implications of this debate for both defense and other policy areas , particularly in light of the shift in the international security environment discussed in this report .

potential policy and oversight issues for congress include the following: december 2017 nss and january 2018 nds .

do the december 2017 nss and the january 2018 nds correctly describe or diagnose the shift in the international security environment ? .

as strategy documents , do they lay out an appropriate u.s. national security strategy and national defense strategy for responding to the shift in the international security environment ? .

u.s. grand strategy .

should the united states continue to include , as a key element of u.s. grand strategy , a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of eurasia or another ? .

if not , what grand strategy should the united states pursue ? .

what is the trump administration's position on this issue ? .

defense funding levels .

in response to changes in the international security environment , should defense funding levels in coming years be increased , reduced , or maintained at about the current level ? .

should the budget control act ( bca ) of 2011 , as amended , be further amended or repealed ? .

nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence .

are current dod plans for modernizing u.s. strategic nuclear weapons , and for numbers and basing of nonstrategic ( i.e. , theater - range ) nuclear weapons , aligned with the needs of the new international security environment ? .

u.s. and nato military capabilities in europe .

are the united states and its nato allies taking appropriate and sufficient steps regarding u.s. and nato military capabilities and operations in europe ? .

what potential impacts would a strengthened u.s. military presence in europe have on total u.s. military force structure requirements ? .

what impact would it have on dod's ability to implement the military component of the u.s. strategic rebalancing toward the asia - pacific region ? .

capabilities for high - end conventional warfare .

are dod's plans for acquiring capabilities for high - end conventional warfare appropriate and sufficient ? .

in a situation of constraints on defense funding , how should trade - offs be made in balancing capabilities for high - end conventional warfare against other dod priorities ? .

maintaining technological superiority in conventional weapons .

are dod's steps for maintaining u.s. technological superiority in conventional weapons appropriate and sufficient ? .

what are the trump administration's intentions regarding the strategic capabilities office , the defense innovation initiative , the long - range research and development plan , and the third offset strategy ? .

speed in d efense acquisition policy .

to what degree should defense acquisition policy be adjusted to place greater emphasis on speed of development and deployment , and on experimentation , risk taking , and greater tolerance of failure during development ? .

are dod's steps for doing this appropriate ? .

what new legislative authorities , if any , might be required ( or what existing provisions , if any , might need to be amended or repealed ) to achieve greater speed in defense acquisition ? .

what implications might placing a greater emphasis on speed of acquisition have on familiar congressional paradigms for conducting oversight and judging the success of defense acquisition programs ? .

reliance on russian and chinese components and materials .

aside from the russian - made rd - 180 rocket engine , what russian or chinese components or materials are incorporated into dod equipment ? .

what are dod's plans regarding reliance on russian - or chinese - made components and materials for dod equipment ? .

hybrid warfare and gray - zone tactics .

do the united states and its allies and partners have adequate strategies for countering russia's so - called hybrid warfare in eastern ukraine , russia's information operations , and china's so - called salami - slicing tactics in the south and east china seas ? .

appendix d. congress and the previous shift this appendix provides additional background information on the role of congress in responding to the previous change in the international security environment — the shift in the late 1980s and early 1990s from the cold war to the post - cold war era .

as noted earlier , this shift prompted a broad reassessment by the department of defense ( dod ) and congress of defense funding levels , strategy , and missions that led to numerous changes in dod plans and programs .

many of these changes were articulated in the 1993 bottom - up review ( bur ) , a reassessment of u.s. defense plans and programs whose very name conveyed the fundamental nature of the reexamination that had occurred .

in general , the bur reshaped the u.s. military into a force that was smaller than the cold war u.s. military , and oriented toward a planning scenario being able to conduct two major regional contingencies ( mrcs ) rather than the cold war planning scenario of a nato - warsaw pact conflict .

through both committee activities and the efforts of individual members , congress played a significant role in the reassessment of defense funding levels , strategy , plans , and programs that was prompted by the end of the cold war .

in terms of committee activities , the question of how to change u.s. defense plans and programs in response to the end of the cold war was , for example , a major focus for the house and senate armed services committees in holding hearings and marking up annual national defense authorization acts in the early 1990s .

in terms of efforts by individual members , some members put forth their own proposals for how much to reduce defense spending from the levels of the final years of the cold war , while others put forth detailed proposals for future u.s. defense strategy , plans , programs , and spending .

senator john mccain , for example , issued a detailed , 32-page policy paper in november 1991 presenting his proposals for defense spending , missions , force structure , and weapon acquisition programs .

perhaps the most extensive individual effort by a member to participate in the reassessment of u.s. defense following the end of the cold war was the one carried out by representative les aspin , the chairman of the house armed services committee .

in early 1992 , aspin , supported by members of the committee's staff , devised a force - sizing construct and potential force levels and associated defense spending levels u.s. defense for the new post - cold war era .

a principal aim of aspin's effort was to create an alternative to the "base force" plan for u.s. defense in the post - cold war era that had been developed by the george h. w. bush administration .

aspin's effort included a series of policy papers in january and february 1992 that were augmented by press releases and speeches .

aspin's policy paper of february 25 , 1992 , served as the basis for his testimony that same day at a hearing on future defense spending before the house budget committee .

although dod and some other observers ( including some members of congress ) criticized aspin's analysis and proposals on various grounds , the effort arguably proved consequential the following year , when aspin became secretary of defense in the new clinton administration .

aspin's 1992 effort helped inform his participation in dod's 1993 bur .

the 1993 bur in turn created a precedent for the subsequent quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) process ( renamed defense strategy review in 2015 ) that remained in place until 2016 .
