on december 11 , 2013 , representative paul c. ryan and senator patty murray , chairs of the house and senate budget committees , respectively , and co - chairs of the group appointed to develop a budget compromise to avoid a sequester in mid - january 2014 , introduced the bipartisan budget act of 2013 , which raises defense and nondefense budget spending limits under the budget control act ( bca ) for fy2014 and fy2015 .

on december 12 , 2013 , the house passed the proposal as an amendment to h.j.res.59 , the continuing appropriations act of 2014 , by a vote of 332-94 .

the senate passed the bill on december 18 , 2013 , by a vote of 64-36 and president obama signed it into law on december 26 , 2013 .

for fy2014 , the bill raised the original bca budget limit for national defense ( budget function 050 ) by $22 billion to a total of $520 billion , or $2 billion above the level set in the continuing resolution ( cr ) of 2014 .

for the department of defense ( dod ) , the new fy2014 limit was set at $497 billion rather than the current limit of $476 billion , just above the cr .

if congress extended the current cr level for the full year at these new limits , then there would be no sequester in january 2014 .

for dod , the new limits would essentially be a nominal freeze , setting dod spending at $2 billion above the fy2013 post - sequester level .

the house and senate appropriations committees are drafting fy2014 funding bills for dod and other agencies that would conform to the newly revised budget caps .

for fy2015 , the new budget limit for national defense would be $523 billion , or $9 billion above the current $512 billion limit .

similarly , for dod , the new fy2015 limit would be $498 billion compared to $489 billion in current law , or $9 billion higher than the current limit , and $1 billion above the new limit for fy2014 .

in later years , budget limits would be the same as current levels .

altogether , over the fy2012-fy2021 decade , national defense spending would total $5.447 trillion , or $32 billion ( or 6% ) above the current limit .

dod spending would total $5.206 trillion rather than $5.176 trillion , a $30 billion or 6% increase over current limits .

in addition to these changes in budget limits , the bipartisan budget act also reduces the cost of living adjustments ( colas ) provided to military retirees under the age of 62 from the consumer price index ( cpi ) to the cpi less 1% while also increasing contributions to retirement by new federal retirees .

military retirees would receive a "catch - up" increase at age 62 that would raise their benefit level to an amount including full cpi adjustments for each year when they received reduced colas .

and then receive full cpi adjustments after that .

according to cbo , this change would save the department of defense $6.235 billion over the decade .

this cpi adjustment would apply to nearly all military retirees including those receiving military disability benefits and to people receiving survivor benefits .

 ( this provision would not affect "redux" military retirees who already receive reduced colas of the cpi minus 1% in return for receiving a $30,000 bonus at 15 years of service. ) .

some members have raised concerns about this reduction in retiree benefits .

if enacted , this proposal could be re - considered at a later date since it does not go into effect until december 1 , 2015 .

there are several potential scenarios that congress may face in january 2014 .

on january 15 , 2014 , the current cr ( p.l .

113-46 ) lapses so congress needs to either extend the current cr or pass individual or an omnibus appropriations act to avoid a government shutdown .

to avoid a sequester , congress needs to appropriate defense spending that complies with bca limits that are in effect .

if the new limits are adopted , and if congress provides defense spending at the current cr for the full year , then there would be no sequester because the new defense limit matches the cr .

according to press reports , the department of defense is currently spending at that level .

if congress adopts the new limits but provides defense appropriations that exceed bca limits , however , then omb would levy a sequester to ensure compliance with bca limits .

under current bca spending limits ( without assuming passage of the bipartisan budget act of 2013 ) , a sequester would reduce defense spending by $20 billion , about 3.8% overall in mid - january 2014 to bring appropriations into compliance with the bca .

 ( the percentage cut to affected accounts , excluding exempted military personnel , would be about 5.8%. ) .

this estimate reflects the amount by which the current cr exceeds the estimated $476 billion cap set in the budget control act .

if the new limits are adopted and matched by appropriations , the threat of a sequester would disappear .

in other words , to the extent that defense appropriations breach or exceed whatever bca limits are in effect , omb must levy a sequester of whatever size is necessary to ensure compliance with bca limits .

in action on the fy2014 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) , on december 12 , 2013 , the house , by a vote of 350 to 69 , passed h.res .

441 , which adopted h.r .

3304 , effectively a conference version of the fy2014 national defense authorization act .

the senate passed the bill on december 19 , 2013 , by a vote of 84-15 and the president signed it into law on december 26 , 2013 .

earlier , on october 17 , 2013 , the fy2014 continuing resolution ( cr , p.l .

113-46 ) appropriated funds allowing the dod and all other federal agencies to resume their normal operations through january 15 , 2014 , after a 16-day government shutdown went into effect because no fy2014 appropriations had been provided for the new fiscal year .

in general , the cr allows dod and other agencies to spend — during that period — at the rate at which each appropriations account was funded by p.l .

113-6 , the fy2013 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , taking into account the amount sequestered by the march 1 , 2013 , omb order mandated by the budget control act , enacted in 2011 ( p.l .

112-25 ) .

for dod , the current cr provides about $495 billion .

before passage of the cr , dod , like most other agencies , was subject to a lapse in appropriations during which agencies are generally required to shut down because congress had not acted on legislation to fund the federal government in fy2014 prior to the start of the fiscal year on october 1 , 2013 .

the office of management and budget ( omb ) , however , identified a number of exceptions to the requirement that agencies cease operations , including a blanket exception for activities that "provide for the national security. .

as a result , during the lapse in appropriations , some dod personnel were "excepted" from furloughs , including all uniformed military personnel and some civilians , while other civilian dod employees were furloughed and , thus , not permitted to work .

normally , "excepted" military and civilian personnel would continue to work but would not be paid until after appropriations are provided by law .

shortly before and during the shutdown , however , congress passed and the president signed into law two pieces of legislation that appropriated funds to pay all active - duty military and some dod civilian personnel costs in the absence of an enacted appropriation , and to provide death gratuities: the pay our military act ( p.l .

113-39 ; h.r .

3210 ) , signed by the president on september 30 , 2013 , provided funds to pay all active - duty military personnel , most dod civilians and possibly some private sector employees working for dod ; the honoring the families of fallen soldiers act , ( p.l .

113-44 ; h.j.res .

91 ) , signed by the president on october 10 , 2013 , provided funds to pay death gratuities to survivors of military personnel who die while on active duty .

for military activities of the department of defense that are covered by the fy2014 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) , the obama administration requested authorizations for discretionary budget authority ( ba ) totaling $632.7 billion , including the following: $526.6 billion for the so - called "base budget" — that is , for costs not associated with combat activities ; $80.7 million for war costs , officially designated overseas contingency operations ( oco ) ; $18.9 billion for defense - related nuclear energy programs conducted by the department of energy ; and $7.4 billion for other defense - related activities .

 ( see table 3 ) .

for dod's base budget , both the version of the fy2014 ndaa passed by the house ( h.r .

1960 ) and the version of the bill reported by the senate armed services committee on june 20 , 2013 , ( s. 1197 ) , differ from the president's overall request by less than $50 million .

the house bill , passed by a vote of 315-108 on june 14 , 2013 , would authorize hundreds of millions of dollars more than requested for various purposes , including a military pay raise , shipbuilding , and ballistic missile defense .

however , that gross increase was almost entirely offset by several reductions which , according to the house armed services committee , would have no adverse impact on dod programs because — in each of the affected accounts — previously appropriated funds could be used in lieu of the requested new budget authority .

for war costs — designated as oco — s. 1197 , reported by the senate committee on june 20 , 2013 , would make few changes to the administration's request .

the house - passed bill , on the other hand , would add $5.4 billion to the request .

on dec. 26 , 2013 , the president signed into law h.r .

3304 , a compromise version of the fy2014 ndaa , which authorized nearly the amount originally requested by the administration .

 ( see table 1 and table 9 ) for analysis of congressional action on the authorization bill , see the section of this report entitled " fy2014 national defense authorization act . .

for the fy2014 dod appropriations bill , which funds all discretionary dod military programs except military construction , the administration requested a total of about $589.5 billion for the base budget and oco , combined .

the version of the bill passed by the house on june 24 , 2013 , would make a net reduction of about $4.2 billion to the request while the version reported by the senate appropriations committee ( s. 1429 ) would make a net reduction of about $2.2 billion .

for analysis of congressional action the defense appropriations bill , see the section of this report entitled " fy2014 dod appropriations bill . .

the obama administration's fy2014 budget request , submitted to congress on april 10 , 2013 , includes $641.12 billion for national defense programs ( budget function 050 ) , including military operations of the department of defense , defense - related nuclear energy programs conducted by the department of energy , and other defense - related activities .

of that total , $625.15 billion is requested for programs falling within the scope of the annual national defense authorization act , with the remainder either permanently authorized or falling outside the jurisdiction of the house and senate armed services committees .

 ( see table 3 . ) .

the administration's budget includes $607.36 billion for discretionary dod budget authority , including $526.64 billion for "base" defense budget costs ( day - to - day operations other than war costs ) , and $80.72 billion for oco — largely in afghanistan .

the administration's initial fy2014 budget presentation included "placeholder" totals for oco funding .

the actual oco request for that year was submitted to congress as an addendum in may 2013 .

included in the dod discretionary budget is $6.68 billion for the annual accrual payment to the fund that underwrites payments from the so - called "tricare for life" program to medicare - eligible military retirees .

tricare is dod's medical insurance program .

also included in the $632.74 billion national defense discretionary total is $17.96 billion for defense - related programs of the energy department .

this includes funds for renovation of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile , environmental cleanup of past nuclear weapons work , and work related to the development and construction of nuclear powerplants for warships .

the remaining $7.41 billion of discretionary funding for national defense is requested for defense - related activities in other agencies , the largest share of which ( $4.80 billion ) is for fbi activity , including counterintelligence operations .

the administration's overall national defense budget for fy2014 also includes $8.40 billion in mandatory spending .

the lion's share of this amount — $7.13 billion — is the annual payment into the military retirement fund to cover payments to retirees who have become eligible for additional benefits in recent years as a result of legislation that has narrowed limitations on "concurrent receipt" of both military retired pay and disability annuity from the department of veterans affairs .

when president obama submitted his fy2011 budget request in february 2010 , he had projected requesting for dod's base budget a total of $6.26 trillion in discretionary budget authority over the 10-year period fy2011-fy2020 .

the administration reduced its dod funding projections in each of the three succeeding budgets .

 ( see figure 1 and table 4 . ) .

the 10-year plan accompanying dod's fy2012 budget request incorporated $178 billion of "efficiencies" that were to be realized in the first five years of that period .

enactment of the budget control act in 2011 , however , created a new frame of reference that has shaped much of the subsequent debate over dod budgets , with the fy2012 request serving as a baseline against which subsequent reductions have been measured .

for the 10-year period from fy2012 to fy2021 , the caps set by the bca would require a reduction in dod discretionary spending of $977 billion ( 15.9% ) from the total that was projected by the fy2012 dod 10-year plan ( assuming that dod accounts for the same percentage of the national defense budget function in each year as in the administration's projected budgets ) .

under the fy2013 dod budget plan , funding for the fy2012-fy2021 decade would total $5.65 trillion , a reduction of $487 billion ( or 7.9% ) compared with the fy2012 plan .

under dod's fy2014 budget plan , projected spending for that decade would decline by an additional $90 billion , bringing the cumulative total reduction ( compared with the fy2012 plan ) to $577 billion ( or 9.4% ) .

to realize the total reduction in dod spending for fy2012-fy2021 required by the bca caps , an additional reduction of $400 billion would be required .

based on dod's sorting of its spending between the base budget and oco , the base budget — measured in current dollars ( i.e. , not adjusting for the cost of inflation ) — increased at a relatively steady rate between the late 1990s and 2010 .

after reaching a high point in 2010 , the base budget declined in fy2012 and fy2013 because of bca budget limits .

unless the bca cap for fy2014 is modified , it would require a further reduction of national defense spending from the amount requested by the administration , with dod's share of the reduced amount estimated to reach $475 billion .

from fy2015 through fy2020 , the bca , the president's fy2014 budget projection , and the fy2014 budget resolutions passed by the house and senate all project a steady increase in dod funding .

allowing for the cost of inflation as estimated by omb , the administration's projection of discretionary dod budget authority thru fy2021 would provide a higher level of "real" purchasing power than the department's average annual budget ( in fy2014 dollars ) for the period since the end of the vietnam war ( fy1976-fy2012 ) .

in turn , the average dod budget for that 36-year period — which included the last 15 years of the cold war — is higher in real terms than was the department's average budget since the 1991 war with iraq ( fy1992-fy2012 ) .

 ( see figure 3 ) .

according to dod officials , the administration's $526.6 billion request for discretionary spending in dod's fy2014 base budget is intended both to sustain current u.s. strategy and continue down - sizing the army and marine corps as one element of that strategy .

it incorporates a range of cost - reduction initiatives and various efforts to restrain the growth of personnel costs .

however , the budget request would create relatively few major perturbations of planned weapons acquisition programs .

 ( see table 5 ) at the request of senate armed services committee chairman carl levin and senator james m. inhofe , the committee's ranking minority member , dod agreed to present a plan for cutting $52 billion ( about 10% ) from the fy2014 base budget request , to meet the legally binding bca spending cap .

in addition , secretary hagel launched in april a dod - wide strategic choices and management review ( scmr ) intended to develop three alternative dod budget plans for fy2015-fy2019: one based on the administration's current budget projection , a second based on annual funding levels that were 5% lower , and a third based on annual funding levels lower by 10% .

the administration's $79.44 billion request for war costs ( oco ) represents a reduction of about 3% from the amount appropriated by congress for war costs in fy2013 ( after sequestration ) .

 ( see table 7 . ) .

although the oco funding request for fy2014 would drop by 3% compared with the pre - sequester fy2013 appropriation , the number of u.s. personnel deployed in afghanistan would decline by 39% and the total number of personnel supported by the oco budget ( including forces outside afghanistan that support operations in that country , in the philippines and in the horn of africa ) would drop by about 20% .

 ( see figure 4 ) according to dod's functional breakdown of the fy2014 oco budget ( see table 8 ) , three components that , in sum , account for more than 80% of the total request would decline by less than 10% compared with the pre - sequester fy2013 appropriation: $25.7 billion for u.s. force operations ( including force protection ) ; $21.8 billion for activities outside afghanistan to support operations inside that country ; and $8.9 billion to purchase equipment to replace war losses ( including 4 apache attack helicopters and 11 chinook transport helicopters ) , replenish ammunition supplies , and refurbish equipment worn out by use in afghanistan and iraq .

according to dod , those costs are declining at a slower rate than u.s. troop levels in afghanistan because of expenses associated with closing bases in that country and returning thousands of cargo containers , vehicles , and other pieces of equipment to the united states and refurbishing the equipment as necessary .

afghanistan's army , projected to number 195,000 at the end of fy2013 , and its national police , projected to number 157,000 at the end of fy2013 , are expected to remain at those levels through fy2014 .

the oco budget request would increase u.s. support for those forces by 50% ( to $7.7 billion ) over the pre - sequester fy2013 appropriation .

according to dod , the increase is associated with the afghan forces' assumption of responsibility for security as well as continued efforts to improve their operational capabilities .

h.r .

3304 , the version of the fy2014 national defense authorization act signed into law by president obama on december 31 , 2013 , — like administration's budget request and earlier versions of the ndaa passed by the house ( h.r .

1960 ) and reported by the senate armed services committee ( s. 1197 ) — exceeded by more than $30 billion the cap on national defense spending in fy2014 that was established by the fy2014 continuing appropriations resolution ( h.j.res .

59 ) , which the president also signed into law on december 26 , 2013 .

for dod's fy2014 base budget , the totals authorized by the final version of the bill ( h.r .

3004 ) , the version passed by the house on june 14 , 2013 , ( h.r .

1960 ) , and the version reported by the senate armed services committee on june 20 , 2013 , ( s. 1197 ) , all come within $228 million of the $526.57 billion requested by the president .

 ( see table 9 ) for oco funding ( or "war costs" ) , h.r .

3304 , like the senate committee versions of the bill ( s. 1197 ) , makes few changes to the administration's $80.72 billion request .

the house - passed bill , on the other hand , would have authorized $5.04 billion more than was requested , including the following increases: $1.68 billion for depot maintenance ; $1.50 billion to "reset" ( i.e. , rehabilitate , reequip , and retrain ) army units after their deployment in afghanistan ; $535.9 million for higher than budgeted fuel costs ; $340.9 million to replace fy2013 oco funds that were reprogrammed to other oco uses ; and $400.0 million for equipment for national guard and reserve component units .

the enacted version of the bill , authorizing $2.0 million less than the oco request , dropped about two - thirds of the house - passed increases authorizing an additional $1.10 billion for army reset , $400.0 for national guard and reserve equipment ; and $130.0 million for depot maintenance .

because neither h.r .

1960 nor s. 1197 had been passed by both chambers , there was no basis for convening a house - senate conference to reconcile the house - passed and senate committee - reported versions of the fy2014 ndaa .

in lieu of a formal conference report , members of the house and senate armed services committees , meeting informally , negotiated a compromise version of the bill .

to expedite senate action on that final version of the bill , the negotiated text was passed by the house and senate as an amendment to a bill ( h.r .

3304 ) that already had been passed by each chamber , but on the specific language of which the house and senate had not yet come to agreement .

on december 12 , 2013 , the house voted 350-69 to adopt the negotiated ndaa text as an amendment to h.r .

3304 and to pass the amended bill .

on december 19 , 2013 , the senate concurred in the house action — in effect , passing the negotiated ndaa text — by a vote of 84-15 .

unlike the more inclusive national defense authorization act , the annual dod appropriation bill covers only dod military activities and excludes military construction , which is funded in the annual appropriations bill that also funds the department of veterans affairs and related agencies .

the house version of the fy2014 dod appropriations bill ( h.r .

2397 ) , passed on june 24 , 2013 , by a vote of 315 to 109 , would provide $585.1 billion for those activities — including both the base budget and oco costs — which is nearly $4.4 billion less than the administration requested .

the senate appropriations committee's version of the bill ( s. 1429 ) , reported on july 30 , 2013 , would provide $587.5 billion , which is nearly $2.2 billion less than the request .

 ( see table 16 . ) .

for the fy2014 base budget , h.r .

2397 would add $1.20 billion to the administration's request to offset what the house appropriations committee called the budget's "unrealistic" assumptions about the extent to which "efficiencies" would reduce the cost of building maintenance , depot overhauls of major weapons , and other routine operations .

the house bill also added to the amount requested $536 million in anticipation of higher - than - budgeted fuel costs and several billion dollars for various weapons and r&d programs , including increases of $950 million for a submarine , $923 million to modernize navy cruisers the budget would retire , and $667 million for medical r&d projects .

but those additions would be more than offset by reductions to the base budget request , many of which the house appropriations committee said would have no adverse impact on dod operations .

among these are: a total of $6.06 billion which the committee deemed to be either in excess of what was required for a particular program or else not adequately justified ; a total of $1.10 billion from programs that previously have requested and received more funds for a given year than they spend ; and a total of $3.04 billion that would be offset by rescinding the same amount appropriated in prior years , thus reducing the need for new budget authority .

the senate committee's version of the bill would make several relatively large cuts from the base budget , among which are: a total of $5.06 billion which the committee deemed to be either in excess of what was required for a particular program or else not adequately justified ; a total of $1.53 billion from programs that either have relatively large , unspent balances from prior appropriations or have a track record of requesting larger appropriations for a given year than they typically spend ; and a total of $578 million that would be offset by rescinding the same amount appropriated in prior years , thus reducing the need for new budget authority .

but the senate committee would largely offset those reductions by additions to the administration base budget request , including: a total of $4.19 billion to compensate for assumed efficiencies in the budget request that the senate committee deemed unrealistic ; and $1.16 billion to fund programs the administration had included in its budget request for oco funding .

for fy2014 war costs , the house - passed h.r .

2397 would appropriate $79.34 billion , which is $59.3 million more than the administration's request .

among the largest increases in the committee bill are: $1.50 billion for equipment for national guard and reserve units ; $1.30 billion to accelerate the "reset" process for army units that had been deployed in afghanistan ; and $1.07 billion for a transfer fund from which amounts could be transferred to regular appropriations accounts to cover unforeseen oco costs .

as reported by the house appropriations committee , the bill would have added $6.3 billion to the oco request , but amendments adopted by the house eliminated most of that overall increase: h.amdt .

392 ( representative mulvaney ) reduced the committee - reported oco amount by $3.5 billion , eliminating all additions to the administration's request except procurement funds for the national guard and reserve forces .

h.amdt .

366 ( representative terry ) reduced the amount appropriated for support of the afghan army and national policy by $2.6 billion ( from the $7.73 billion requested and approved by the committee ) and added $1 billion to operations and maintenance accounts to reduce the need to furlough dod civilian employees .

the senate committee's bill , s. 1429 , would provide $77.62 billion in new budget authority for oco , which is $1.66 billion less than the administration's request .

among the largest components of that net reduction are cuts of: $1.16 billion for programs the senate committee funded in the part of the bill that funds dod's base budget ; $782 million cut from the $7.73 billion request for the afghan security forces fund ; $284 million the committee deemed excess to need for army basic pay ; and $227 million for coast guard missions in support of the navy , which the senate committee said should be funded through the department of homeland security .

the senate committee - reported version of the fy2014 dod appropriations bill ( s. 1429 ) would fund , as requested , a 1% raise in military basic pay .

the house - passed version ( h.r .

2397 ) includes section 8126 , which would add to the amount requested $580 million to fund a 1.8% basic pay increase , as would be authorized by the house - passed version of the ndaa .

on other military personnel funding issues: both bills would cut the $4.03 billion requested for enlistment and reenlistment bonuses and special pays — the house bill by $145 million , the senate bill by $156 million — on grounds that , in the current civilian jobs market , it was easier than the budget assumed for the services to recruit and retain talented individuals ; both bills would reduce the $4.76 billion requested for "permanent change of station" funding — intended to cover the cost of transferring servicemembers and their dependents from one assignment to another — with the house bill cutting $151 million and the senate bill cutting $306 million ; and both bills also would add to the request $25 million to expand to all the services the air force's special victims' counsel program to provide victims of alleged sex - related offenses with independent legal representation , drawn from outside the military services ( see h.r .

2397 , section 8122 ; and s. 1429 , section 8115 ) .

the fy2014 dod appropriations bills passed by the house and reported by the senate appropriations committee each would add upwards of $500 million to the $33.1 billion requested in the base budget for dod's health care system , which serves 9.6 million beneficiaries ( active - duty and retired military personnel and their dependents ) .

nearly half the request ( $16 billion ) is for tricare , dod's insurance program , to fund contracts for private - sector medical care for active - duty and retired military personnel , their dependents , and their survivors .

both bills would reduce the tricare request on grounds that , in recent years , the program has requested more than it spent in a given year .

those reductions were more than offset by additions in each bill to compensate for rejection of proposed tricare fee hikes and to provide roughly $600 million for medical r&d projects .

the house bill also would add $225.0 million to the amount requested for maintenance and repair of medical facilities .

congressional action on authorization of funding for selected ground combat programs is summarized in appendix table a - 4 .

following are some highlights: in the reports on their respective versions of the fy2014 appropriations bill , the house and senate appropriations committees each took note of the planned downturn over the next few years in the army's purchases from the specialized industrial base that builds tanks and other heavily armored combat vehicles .

in s. 1429 , the senate committee added to the request $90.0 million to continue for one more year the conversion of existing m - 1 tanks to the m - 1a2 sep variant , with improved digital communications , night - vision equipment , armor , and transmission .

the house - passed bill included no additional funds for the tank upgrades but included an additional $75 million for m - 88 recovery vehicles — vehicles built on tank chassis that are intended to tow damaged tanks from the battlefield .

the house and senate bills each made some reductions in the set of r&d programs intended to develop a new generation of armored combat vehicles for the army and marine corps: for the army's ground combat vehicle , envisioned as a replacement for the bradley armored troop carrier , the house bill would provide $592.2 million , as requested , while the senate bill would cut $169.0 million ; for the armored multipurpose vehicle , a replacement for the 1970s - vintage m - 113 tracked vehicle which the army uses for jobs ranging from mobile command posts to battlefield ambulances , the senate bill would provide $116.3 million as requested , while the house bill would cut $30.0 million ; and both bills would cut $14.0 million from the marine corps request for $137.0 million to develop a new amphibious assault vehicle .

congressional action on appropriation of funds for selected naval programs is summarized in appendix table a - 6 .

following are some highlights .

historically , congress has insisted on full funding for major weapons programs , with limited exceptions for so - called long lead - time components , such as the nuclear power plants of submarines .

for aircraft carriers and helicopter carriers , with price tags of several billion dollars apiece , congress has allowed "incremental funding" — that is , spreading the cost of the ship across several budgets .

however , it has resisted proposals to use that approach for other types of ships .

in a similar vein , congress has rejected proposals to fund ships and air force satellites using "advance appropriations," that is , funding that congress appropriates in one year's appropriations bill but which will not become available for obligation until a subsequent fiscal year .

nevertheless , the administration is depending on advance appropriations to fund one of two virginia - class submarines in the fy2014 budget request .

of the projected $5.41 billion total cost of two subs: $1.53 billion was appropriated as "long lead - time" funding in prior budgets ; $2.93 billion is requested in fy2014 ; and $952.7 million is budgeted as an "advance appropriation. .

under dod's plan , one of the two subs would be "fully funded" by a combination of long lead - time funding from prior years and a portion of the funds requested in fy2014 .

the second sub would be funded by a combination of long lead - time money , the remainder of the fy2014 request and the fy2015 "advance appropriation" amount .

in its report on h.r .

2397 , the house appropriations committee dubbed the advance appropriation proposal a "funding gimmick" and added to the bill $950.0 million to fully fund the second fy2014 submarine .

as reported by the senate appropriations committee , s. 1429 would add to the amount requested $277.0 million , the purpose of which is to "maintain critical industrial base" associated with the virginia - class subs .

in addition , the senate bill would deny the $59.9 million requested to continue developing the virginia payload module , an additional hull section — reportedly about 94 feet in length — that would be incorporated into future virginia - class subs carrying four large - diameter , vertical launch tubes that could carry additional tomahawk cruise missiles or other payloads , such as unmanned underwater vehicles .

in its report , the committee objected that the modification would disrupt a smoothly functioning production line for the subs and that dod had not yet officially approved the change .

the house and senate bills each would approve the $1.62 billion requested for a ddg - 51-class destroyer .

in addition , the house bill would add $100 million to make up for part of a $304 million shortfall in the program's account as a result of the fy2013 sequestration .

both bills would deny a portion of the $240.1 million requested for the air and missile defense radar ( amdr ) program , intended to replace the current ddg - 51 radar on a projected new version of the ship with a radar better able to track long - range ballistic missiles and low - flying or stealthy cruise missiles and aircraft .

citing delays in the development program , the house bill would cut $79.8 million while the senate bill would cut $87.0 million .

congressional action on appropriation of funds for selected aircraft and long - range missile programs is summarized in appendix table a - 10 .

following are highlights .

the house and senate bills would make relatively minor reductions to the $5.45 billion requested for procurement of 29 f - 35 joint strike fighter , of which there are three versions used by the navy , marine corps , and air force , respectively .

the house bill would cut $323.4 million while the senate bill would cut $278.0 million , the reductions being justified , in each case , on grounds of efficiency and sound management .

while both bills thus would fund acquisition of 29 f - 35s in fy2014 , as requested , the senate bill also would cut $80.0 million from the $564.8 million requested for long lead - time components with the intention of slowing the planned increase in production for fy2015 .

in its report on s. 1429 , the senate appropriations committee observed that the dod budget assumed procurement in fy2014 of 42 f - 35s , an increase of 13 planes ( about 45% ) over the 29 f - 35s funded in the fy2014 budget request .

by reducing funding for long lead - time components , the senate bill is intended to reduce the number of f - 35s funded in the fy2015 budget request to 36 , which would be an increase of about 25% over the number requested in fy2014 .

both the house and senate bills also would add to the amount requested $75.0 million for long lead - time components that would support the purchase in fy2015 of 22 f / a - 18e / f navy fighters , the type of plane the f - 35 is slated eventually to replace on navy carriers .

in its report , the senate appropriations committee opposed dod's decision to end f / a - 18e / f production , noting that the plane would be the "backbone" of the navy's carrier air wings for the next 25 years .

keeping the f / a - 18e / f in production would maintain the u.s. fighter production base and would hedge against the risk that the f - 35 might be delayed , the committee said .

h.r .

2397 would make a net addition of $323.0 million to the missile defense agency's $7.68 billion fy2014 budget request while s. 1429 would give the agency a net increase over the request of $227.4 million .

each bill would add $173.0 million to the $95.8 million requested for continued development of three israeli anti - missile systems designed to intercept short - range and medium - range missiles ballistic missiles .

in addition , the house bill would add $177.2 million to the $1.03 billion requested for the ground - based midcourse defense ( gmd ) currently deployed in alaska and california , which is intended to protect u.s. territory against a small number of intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from north korea or iran .

of the additional funds , $107.0 million is intended to accelerate procurement of 14 additional gmd interceptor missiles and $70.2 million is to expedite consideration of deploying additional interceptors at a third site , located on the east coast .

the senate bill would appropriate a total of $1.03 billion for gmd , as requested .

however , within that total , it would shift $142.9 million from the r&d account to the operation and maintenance account .

for the israeli iron dome system , designed to intercept short - range rockets and artillery shells , both bills would provide $220.3 million , the amount requested .

the house bill would provide the $7.73 billion requested for the afghan security forces fund , which pays for training , equipping , and sustaining the afghan military and national police .

but the senate bill would cut from the request a total of $781.8 million intended to purchase aircraft for afghanistan's air force , including: $365.0 million to purchase russian - built mi - 17 helicopters from rosboronexport , a russian state - owned company that also has supplied arms to syrian president bashar al assad .

the bill also includes a general provision ( section 8113 ) that would bar dod from doing business with rosboronexport .

$416.8 million to purchase an additional 20 super turcano turboprops , ground - attack planes built by the brazilian firm embraer , 20 of which had been purchased with fy2012 funds .

in its report , the senate appropriations committee said dod had not identified a requirement for more than the 20 planes initially planned for .

following are selected amendments on which the senate took action during its consideration of h.r .
