this report provides an overview of the fy2019 budget request and appropriations for the international trade administration ( ita ) , the u.s. international trade commission ( usitc ) , and the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) .

these three trade - related agencies are funded through the annual commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ( cjs ) appropriations .

this report also provides a review of these trade agencies' programs .

when comparing the administration's fy2019 request with fy2018 funding , one may want to consider that the administration formulated its fy2019 budget request before full - year appropriations for fy2018 were enacted .

in this report , fy2018 funding levels reflect the amounts appropriated in the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-141 ) , enacted on march 23 , 2018 .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 , provided $482.0 million in direct funding for ita , $93.7 million for ustic , and a total of $72.6 million for ustr for fy2018 .

the fy2018 appropriation for the three cjs trade - related agencies totaled $648.3 million .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 , provided $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ita , $95.0 million in funding for usitc , and a total of $68.0 million for ustr .

the fy2019 appropriations for three cjs trade - related agencies totaled $647.0 million , a 0.2% decrease from fy2018 appropriations .

see the appendix for enacted budget authority for the trade - related agencies for fy2009-fy2019 .

the president submitted his fy2019 budget request to congress on february 12 , 2018 .

in it , the administration requested a total of $590.8 million for the three cjs trade - related agencies ( see table 1 ) .

this request represented an 8.9% decrease in funding from the fy2018 appropriated amount .

the request included reduced funding for all three trade agencies: $440.1 million in direct funding for ita ( an 8.7% decrease from the fy2018 appropriation ) , $87.6 million for usitc ( a 6.5% decrease ) , and $63.0 million for ustr ( a 13.2% decrease ) .

despite the proposed overall decrease in funding for cjs trade - related agencies , the administration proposed increasing some trade enforcement activities within ita and ustr .

for ita , the administration proposed increasing trade enforcement activities while reducing funding for certain export promotion activities .

for ustr , the administration requested funds to increase staffing ; however , the request did not include a request for funding to be drawn from the trade enforcement trust fund .

 ( for a description of the " trade enforcement trust fund ," see section below. ) .

the president's budget did not provide a rationale for requesting a decrease in funding for usitc .
