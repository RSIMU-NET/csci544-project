the house subcommittee mark proposed $1.0 million for an orderly shutdown of open world .

language in the full committee print , released prior to the markup of the fy2016 bill , stated , the committee believes given our current fiscal environment , and in light of both the lack of quantifiable results from the open world leadership center and its duplication of programs more appropriately offered by the state department , the program has long outlived its short - term intent .

the committee has provided an allocation to be used for the orderly shutdown during fiscal year 2016 of the open world leadership center .

an amendment offered by representative fortenberry at the full committee markup would add $4.7 million for open world , offset from funding for the "architect of the capitol , capitol power plant" budget .

both reports discussed the conflict in ukraine and open world's activities in the region .

the fy2015 act provided $5.7 million .

for fy2014 , the house subcommittee mark would have provided $1.0 million .

an amendment to restore funding for open world to the fy2013 post - sequester level was debated and withdrawn during the full committee markup .

the house committee report stated , for many years the committee has had concern with the placement of the open world leadership center ( owlc ) in the legislative branch .

the committee understands the program has some strong champions on the committee .

however , with further reductions being made to every program within the legislative branch , the committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the owlc .

the committee directs the executive director of the owlc to retain any necessary prior year funds in the trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill be utilized for the orderly shutdown .

the executive director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the legislative branch fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill .

the fy2013 house - reported bill would have provided $1.0 million , a decrease of $9.0 million ( - 90.0% ) , from the $10.0 million provided in fy2012 and requested for fy2013 .

the house report stated that this funding level would "cover the cost associated with the shutdown" and directed that "the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the legislative branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill. .

h.amdt .

1281 , agreed to by recorded vote ( 204-203 , roll no .

373 ) , eliminated this funding .

at the senate fy2013 budget request hearing on march 1 , 2012 , the subcommittee discussed potential options for increasing private funding , including the hire of a development professional .

the fy2013 act provided $8.0 million , not including sequestration or the across - the - board rescission .

the house - passed fy2012 bill ( h.r .

2551 ) would have provided $1.0 million , a decrease of 91.2% from fy2011 .

the house report stated , "the program has some strong champions on the committee , but with reductions being made to most every program within the federal budget the committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses. .

the senate - reported bill , in contrast , would have provided $10.0 million ( - 12.1% ) .

the senate report stated that "despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule. .

additionally , the fy2010 house appropriations committee report stated that "the legislative branch subcommittee has been clear that it expects the open world program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible. .

this sentiment was also expressed in the conference report , which stated , the conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the open world center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the legislative branch appropriations bill in future years .

the committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request .

the fy2009 level of $13.9 million was a $4.92 million increase ( +54.8% ) from fy2008 .

the location within the legislative branch was discussed during a hearing on the fy2009 budget .

ambassador john o'keefe , the executive director of open world , testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the library of congress , which may be seen as more neutral and nonpartisan .
