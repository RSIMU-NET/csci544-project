tables 3-10 provide budget details for title i ( corps of engineers ) , title ii ( department of the interior ) , title iii ( department of energy ) , and title iv ( independent agencies ) for fy2003-fy2004 .

the president's request for fy2004 for the civil works program of the u.s.army corps of engineers was $4.19 billion , a decrease of $445 million from theoriginally enacted appropriation for fy2003 .

p.l .

108-137 provided totalappropriations for the corps of $4.57 billion .

the final amount represents anincrease in construction funding from the house and senate versions of the bill .

theconference committee requested removing all funding for the flood control andcoastal emergencies account in h.r .

2754 because the depleted accountwas recently replenished with $60 million through the legislative branchappropriations act for fy2004 , p.l .

108-83 .

the omnibus fy2004 consolidatedappropriations bill , h.r .

2673 ( p.l .

table 3 .

energy and water development appropriations title i: corps of engineers ( $ millions ) a includes $39 million appropriated in emergency wartime supplementalappropriations act , 2003 , p. l. 108-11. b "formerly utilized sites remedial action program" c includes $60 million of appropriations provided in the legislative branchappropriations for fy2004 , title iii , chapter 2 of p.l .

108-83 , enacted onseptember 30 , 2003 .

the president's budget request for fy2004 limited funding for the planning and design of new projects ; however , it fully fund all projects whose construction couldbe completed in fy2004 , and provided substantial funding for eight projectsconsidered by the administration to be priorities .

the administration's budget wouldhave provided some support for 140 other projects , but construction would haveproceeded more slowly than originally planned by the corps because these projectswould not have been fully funded .

 ( 1 ) theadministration's request includes fundingto complete design of 22 proposed projects , while deferring work on all other designefforts .

p.l .

108-137 provided less than the requested amount for seven of the eightpriority projects .

the final legislation spread the construction appropriations acrossa broader set of construction activities than the president's request .

the president's request would have provided no funds for studies and "environmental infrastructure" projects in the following non - traditional missionareas: wastewater treatment , irrigation water supply , and municipal and industrialwater supply treatment and distribution .

by not seeking funding for these activities,the administration was reinforcing its interest in focusing available federal fundingon navigation , flood control , storm damage reduction , and ecosystem restorationprojects .

the final legislation provided funding for several environmentalinfrastructure projects .

the administration's $70 million request for the flood control and coastal emergencies account was significantly higher than the fy2003 appropriation of $15million and the fy2003 request for $20 million .

the actual expenditure for activitiesunder this account in previous years has averaged $70 million , with much of thefunding being provided through supplemental appropriations .

this account financesresponse and recovery activities for flood and storm events , preparedness for theseevents , and the corps' support of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) through the federal response plan .

because this is an emergencymanagement program , annual costs vary significantly based on actual events and / orchanging missions .

p.l .

108-137 contained no funding for this account ; theconference report language ( h.rept .

108-357 ) cited the recent replenishment of thedepleted account with $60 million through p.l .

108-83 as the reason .

theconference report also directed the secretary of the army to consider changes to themanagement of the account and to report to the appropriations committees of thehouse and senate within 180 days of enactment .

for the department of the interior , the energy and water development billprovides funding for the bureau of reclamation ( bor ) and the central utah projectcompletion account .
