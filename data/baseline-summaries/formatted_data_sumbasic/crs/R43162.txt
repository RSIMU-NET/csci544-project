a variety of approaches may be used to consider the financial condition of a firm .

here , the usps's financial condition is examined by the metrics of profitability , revenues , expenses , and debt and liquidity .

the usps issues both quarterly ( 10-qs ) and annual financial statements ( 10-ks and annual reports ) .

the data below were drawn exclusively from these usps sources .

the financial figures have not been adjusted to reflect inflation .

congress designed the usps to be financially self - supporting .

the agency's ability to remain financially self - sustaining over the long term is questionable .

in fy2013 , the usps's revenues began to rise after falling for four consecutive years ( figure 3 ) .

however , expenses have not fallen quickly enough to allow the postal service to meet its statutory prefunding commitments to the rhbf and place the agency on a more sustainable financial course ( figure 5 ) .

despite the revenue growth in fy2013 and fy2014 , the usps's annual revenue remained lower than its revenue 10 years earlier .

additionally , the revenue trend depicted in figure 3 may indicate a long - term weakening of the demand for the usps's current products and services .

the weak cash position of the usps has led the agency to take a number of actions to address their financial position .

these include changes to both operations and personnel .

in 2013 , the postal service implemented a realignment of its operations to further reduce costs and strengthen its finances .

these operational realignments included reductions in the number of mail processing operations , realignment of retail office hours to match demand , reductions in the number of delivery routes and consolidations of delivery offices .

in june 2014 , the postal service announced that a second phase of mail processing realignments would begin in january 2015 , culminating in a consolidation impacting up to 82 more processing operations .

additionally , the postal service continues to leverage employee attrition , voluntary early retirement ( ver ) and utilization of non - career employees to the maximum extent permitted by its labor contracts .

in july 2014 , the postal service offered a ver to approximately 3,000 postmasters who were impacted by reductions in retail hours at certain postal facilities which was accepted by 1,380 postmasters .

despite these organizational actions and the increase in revenue for the usps in fy2013 , the postal service projects that legislative change will be necessary to improve liquidity moving forward .

with no further borrowing authority the usps could find itself with insufficient funds to continue operations , leading to a need for payment prioritization and the continued deferral of capital and infrastructure expenditures .

it goes beyond the scope of this report to assess which operational or policy changes could improve the usps's financial condition sufficiently to enable it to continue as a self - funding government agency .

the above financial data , however , suggest that for any reforms to be successful they would need to contend with the usps's short - term liquidity problem ; be of sufficient magnitude to make appreciable changes to the usps's annual operating revenue ( currently $67 billion ) or operating costs ( currently $70+ billion ) ; enable the usps to sufficiently fund its retiree health benefits ; help the usps reduce its debt ( currently $15 billion ) ; and place the usps on a long - term trajectory where the agency's revenues could be expected to meet or exceed expenses .
