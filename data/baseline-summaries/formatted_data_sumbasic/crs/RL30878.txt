beginning with the clean air act of 1970 , and with substantive additional measures enacted in amendments of 1977 and 1990 , electric utilities have been subjected to a multilayered patchwork of air pollution emission requirements .

fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities are major emitters of gases ( see table 1 ) , with clean air controls currently directed at three pollutants: sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) , nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , and particulates ( pm ) .

sulfur oxides have health effects and are a major contributor to acid rain and visibility impairment .

nitrogen oxides have direct health effects , contribute to acid rain and visibility impairment , and are a precursor to ozone , a primary constituent of smog .

particulates have health effects , with the smallest particles now thought to be the most serious causative agents ; current regulations focus on particles 10 microns in size or smaller ( pm 10 ) and new regulations would control particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter ( pm 2.5 ) .

emissions of so 2 and of nox contribute to the formation of these very fine particles .

in 1998 , electric utilities accounted for approximately 67% of u.s. emissions of so 2 , 25% of nox , and 11% of pm 10 .

the evolution of air pollution controls over time and as a result of developing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts has led to the multilayered and interlocking patchwork of controls , which are outlined in more detail below .

moreover , additional controls are in the process of development , in particular with respect to nox as a precursor to ozone , and to both nox and so 2 as contributors to pm 2.5 .

in addition , fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities produce two other gases of environmental and health concern: mercury ( hg ) and carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) .

while some sources of mercury are currently regulated , emissions from electric utilities are not .

however the clean air act amendments of 1990 designated hg as a hazardous air pollutant subject to a regulatory regime spelled out in â§112 .

epa was also required to study hazards to public health from hazardous air pollutant emissions of electric utility steam generating units in general ; and , separately , to report to congress on mercury emissions from major sources , including electric utility steam generating units .

this study , completed in 1997 , concluded mercury is a hazard to public health ; and it found that electric utility steam generating units account for about one - third of the nation's mercury emissions .

on december 14 , 2000 , epa announced its intention to regulate utility hg emissions in 2004 , with an effective date of 2007 or 2008 .

carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas , and fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities account for about 36% of u.s. emissions .

while co 2 emissions are not currently regulated , the united states is a signatory of the united nation framework convention on climate change , which involves a voluntary commitment to hold greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels .

at present , u.s. emissions of co 2 are running some 10% over that goal .

further , the u.s. has signed the kyoto protocol , under which the u.s. would be legally committed to reduce emissions in the 2008-2012 period by 7% from a baseline that includes 1990 co 2 levels ; however , that protocol has not yet been submitted to the senate for advice and consent and is not in force .

but it remains possible that , beyond the already existing voluntary goal , utilities will be subjected to emissions limits on co 2 at some time in the future .

as described below , this patchwork of existing and potential emissions requirements applicable to fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities has a direct impact on strategic decisions concerning investment in new facilities as well as operational decisions with respect to the timing of maintenance and scheduling of operation .

at the same time , the electric utility industry is undergoing major restructuring changes .

proponents of change argue that the air quality requirements add confusion and uncertainty to a utility decisionmaking environment already challenged by new generating technology and new policies concerning competition and economic regulation .

a restructured electricity generating sector may have consequences for emissions: current electricity generating economics favor the continued operation of older , more polluting coal - fired facilities , at the expense of building newer , cleaner , natural gas - fired facilities .

previous crs analysis suggests that the environmental effects of restructuring depend on how well the existing regulatory regimen will work as the industry structure changes .

it appears that pollutants controlled under emissions caps , such as so 2 under the acid rain title of the 1990 caa amendments , would retain their efficacy regardless of the industry's structure .

the robustness of emissions caps and the possible cost savings that tradeable emissions credits provide are seen by some as a better fit for a restructured industry than the current regulatory system .

for many years the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for a simplified approach .

now , with the potential both for additional control programs on so 2 and nox and for new controls directed at hg and co 2 intersecting with the technological and policy changes affecting the electric utility industry , such observers have become more numerous and are pushing more strongly for a simplified approach .

several simplifying approaches have been proposed , ranging from repeal of various components of the air pollution regulatory system , to comprehensive replacement of the "command and control" regulatory approach with some economic mechanism , which is often touted as more efficient and transparent .

in the mid - 1990s , epa began investigating the merits of a comprehensive approach to utility emissions control .

called the "clean air power initiative," the purpose was "to develop , in consultation with stakeholders , an integrated regulatory strategy for pollutants emitted from electric powerplants: sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , and , potentially , mercury. .

it was "a collaborative effort to seek new approaches to future pollution control that cost less , rely on market mechanisms , and reduce the number and complexity of requirements...." as the effort evolved , a "multi - pollutant"or "four pollutants" approach has come to the fore .

this approach involves a mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutantsâso 2 , nox , hg , and co 2 .

the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of effective controls across these pollutants with the industry goal of a stable regulatory regime for a period of years .

during the 106 th congress , ten bills were introduced to increase pollution controls on electric generating facilities .

the pollutants targeted under these bills included so 2 , nox , hg , and co 2 .

all of these bills involved some form of emissions caps , and most included a tradeable credit program to implement that cap .

with president bush endorsing a four pollutant emissions cap with tradeable permits program during the campaign , attempts to address the issue are possible in the 107 th congress .

this report proceeds by ( 1 ) laying out the existing regulatory framework , with emphasis on how it can affect strategic and operational decisions in the utility industry ; ( 2 ) identifying the "drivers" for rethinking the way air pollution controls are imposed on the industry ; ( 3 ) describing the elements of a "four pollutants" approach ; and ( 4 ) discussing the ways that this approach would affect the control of emissions and the industry's decisonmaking .

it concludes with a brief outline of legislative options for achieving the goal of balancing environmental and industry objectives .

to understand the interest in an integrated approach to controlling utilities emissions of air pollutants , it is necessary to recognize the diverse requirements imposed by the caa .

within the general regulatory structure , several distinctions arise that affect utility planning and operations ( eg , whether the facility is located in clean or dirty air areas , whether a facility is existing or new , and what fuel it burns ) .

and while the underlying regulatory structure generally applies to so 2 , nox , and pm , the specific requirements for each differ .

the preceding section outlined the air quality controls that have directly affected fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities .

continuing developments in understanding of the effects of different pollutants , especially of so 2 and nox , both individually and in combination , are heightening concerns about the adequacy of existing controls .

issues include continuing difficulties in meeting the ozone naaqs , health effects of fine particulates , impaired visibility , and global warming .

these concerns are driving new initiatives to increase controls at existing sources of these pollutants .

as a result , more air quality controls on utilities are pending or prospective .

at the same time , the increasingly complex and interactive structure of the air quality control regime is raising questions about the effectiveness and economic efficiency of the individual initiatives .

with the prospect of new layers of complexity being added to air pollution controls and with electricity restructuring putting a premium on economic efficiency , it is not surprising that interest in finding mechanisms to achieve these new health and environmental goals in simpler , more cost - effective ways has been on the rise .

taking the acid rain programâwidely viewed as highly successful both in controlling emissions and in economic efficiencyâas a model , the proposed "multi - pollutant" approach would establish a consistent framework of emissions caps , implemented through emissions trading .

just how the proposed approach would fit with the current ( and proposed ) diverse regulatory regimes remains to be worked out ; they might be replaced to the greatest extent feasible , or they might be overlaid by the framework of emissions caps .

the key assumption of this approach is that the current process of addressing pollution problems on a sequential , pollutant - by - pollutant basis can be superceded with a coordinated and integrated national program that would stabilize requirements for a number of years .

such an approach to powerplant emissions would have several tradeoffs .

overall , the primary tradeoff is exchanging regulatory and economic uncertainty for short to mid - term certainty .

the environmental advantage of this approach is the probability that emission reductions would occur earlier than under the current regulatory process .

if the current acid rain program is any indication , a legislated cap and trade program could result in earlier emission reductions than the current , often adversarial regulatory process .

challenges to the system , and resulting delays , might be reduced under a cap and trade system .

the potential environmental disadvantage would be that any reduction target agreed to might be frozen for a specific period of time .

arguably , however , it could be easier ( administratively or statutorily ) to reduce an emissions cap in the future after the agreed upon time has expired than to develop a new , potentially overlapping regulatory scheme as would be currently the case .

for example , many proposals to further reduce so 2 emissions simply call for a reduction in the current title iv cap , rather than the development of new control structures .

economic analysis projects that implementing emission caps through emission trading would reduce costs by a significant amount , although the actual savings that might be realized is debatable .

for industry , a cap and trade system could not only save costs directly , but would likely reduce uncertainties with respect to utility responsibilities and potential penalties , thus allowing the industry to plan for the future in the context of a more coherent regulatory regime .

finally , a flexible cap and trade program might open the door for reforming or replacing the current , sometimes burdensome , nsr / psd permitting process .

specifically , the cap and trade programs might be coupled with a streamlined permitting process along the line of the title v permit program .

a disadvantage of emissions caps would be the possibility that unnecessary emission reductions could be required .

emission caps could overshoot the mark , resulting in unnecessary costs .

also , the certainty of reductions could also result in costs being incurred earlier than would be the case under the current system .

finally , most proposals for a cap and trade system do not eliminate the requirement to protect local air quality , so mechanisms to ensure naaqs would not be exceeded locallyâsuch as some sort of trading restrictionsâmight be imposed .

although the four pollutant approach calls for a coordinated cap and trade system to supplement , and , in some cases , replace the existing structure , the resulting caps would not necessarily be the same .

each pollutant presents unique issues with respect to baselines , allocation schemes , reduction targets , and compliance measures .

the integrative effects of a multi - pollutant strategy are environmental , economic , and regulatory .

one thing is clear: a multi - pollutant approach would require legislation .

as it stands , the caa leads epa to identify and assess the effects of pollutants one by one ; and it directs epa and the states to evaluate and mandate controls on most sources individually or by subdivided category ( existing or new ; large or small , etc. ) .

with only a few exceptions , mainly involving mobile sources , the act does not provide for integrating regulatory decisions , even when pollutants interact or have similar effects or are emitted by separate but similar sources .

epa therefore has little authority to develop and implement a regulatory approach that would embrace the collective emissions of a group of sources , even if it would achieve more cost - effective reductions and more efficient compliance by sources .

at best , as in the nox sip call , epa can ask states to cleave voluntarily to such a systemâin this case a nox cap and trade one .

the clean air act has evolved over time in response to a developing understanding of the environment , new technologies , and changes in the nation's transportation , energy , and industrial sectors .

the result has been a patchwork of requirements that are not always consistentâand may even be incompatibleâat any given moment .

moreover , these requirements change and are added to over time .

although the resulting development of the act has resulted in a structure that some consider unwieldy , emissions of most air pollutants have substantially declined , and the number of persons living in areas where pollution exceeds standards has diminished .

arguably , the act's success puts the burden of proof for revising the existing structure on those favoring change .

the multi - pollutant proposals seek to bring more consistency and stability to the diverse elements of the act , with the focus being on pollutants emitted by utilities , one of the largest emitting sectors .

in a way , "multi - pollutant" may be misleading , as the proposals would not combine regulations or controls on several pollutants ; rather , the proposals typically do several things: they would align pollution control processes and procedures for several currently regulated pollutants ( so 2 and nox , and , indirectly , pm and ozone ) so that both regulators and utility managers could anticipate requirements and integrate their decisions about how to control emissions ; they would adopt the efficiency of economic mechanismsâmost notably "cap and trade"âinto the control of most or all of the pollutants ; they would stabilize requirements over time ; and they would anticipate incorporating potential future control requirements for other emitted gases ( eg , hg , co 2 ) into this more stable scheme .

for regulators , the advantages of this approach could be to reduce complaints about the costs and inefficiencies of the current system , and possibly to forestall litigation .

for utility managers , the advantages of this approach could be to provide a certainty about environmental requirements over a several - year planning horizon ( that must cope with restructuring changes and volatile energy prices ) , and to expand an existing method designed to achieve more cost - effective compliance .

for environmental and health interests , the advantages of this approach could be to speed up reductions in emissions and , especially , to advance the controls on hg and co 2 .

there are potential disadvantages , as well , depending on how the old ( existing ) system is adapted when and if a new , multi - media approach is enacted .

regulators and utility managers could find that the new approach merely adds more requirements , compounding the current complaints of regulatory overload .

utility managers could face having to control emissions ( hg and co 2 ) not now regulated .

environmental and health interests might find that some existing protections would be removed , with the risk of local "hot spots" emerging where emissions threaten or even exceed current health standards or visibility requirements .

for legislators , then , the multi - pollutant approach represents an interlocking series of tradeoffs among numerous stakeholders .

achieving balance may be difficult , but the potential for all parties to find advantages could give impetus to the proposals .
