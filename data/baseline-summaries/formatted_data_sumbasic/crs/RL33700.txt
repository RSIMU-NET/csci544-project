on december 22 , 2010 , president barack obama signed h.r .

3082 , amending the continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

111-242 ) , to replace december 3 , 2010 , in section 106 ( 3 ) , with march 4 , 2011 .

in effect , spending levels would be "at a rate for operations as provided in the applicable appropriations acts for fiscal year 2010 and under the authority and conditions provided in such acts" ( p.l .

111-242 , sec .

101 ) .

on february 1 , 2010 , the president , in his budget for fy2011 , had requested $2,182,300,000 for u.s. contributions to u.n. peacekeeping operation assessed accounts in the contributions to international peacekeeping activities ( cipa ) account , department of state .

that compares with $2,125,000,000 enacted for fy2010 .

the request also included language amending the assessment cap on u.s. contributions to u.n. peacekeeping operations made during calendar year 2011 to 27.5% .

on june 30 , 2010 , the house subcommittee on state , foreign operations , and related programs reported its recommendations to the full house appropriations committee .

they included $2,126,382,000 for the cipa account .

the full committee did not report a bill .

on july 29 , 20010 , the senate appropriations committee reported s. 3676 , the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations bill , 2011 , recommending $2,126,382,000 for the cipa account .

the president's march 24 , 2010 , fy2010 supplemental request for funding costs associated with relief and reconstruction support for haiti following the january 12 , 2010 , earthquake included $96,500,000 to finance additional u.s. assessed contributions to the u.n. stabilization mission in haiti ( minustah ) , the u.n. peacekeeping operation in haiti , through the cipa account .

on july 29 , 2010 , the president signed h.r .

4899 , supplemental appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l .

111-212 ) , with the funding for u.s. assessed contributions to minustah intact .

the role of the united nations in facilitating dispute settlement and establishing peacekeeping operations to monitor cease - fires and participate in other duties as assigned by the u.n. security council increased markedly in the 1990s .

between april 1988 and april 1994 , a total of 20 peacekeeping operations were set up , involving 16 different situations .

since may 1994 , however , the pace of council creation of new u.n. controlled peacekeeping operations dropped noticeably .

this reduction resulted , in part , from the u.s. decision , in presidential decision directive 25 ( pdd 25 ) , signed may 1994 , to follow strict criteria for determining its support for an operation .

this u.s. decision was accompanied by a security council statement adopting similar criteria .

if the trends between 1978 and 2010 ( see appendix c ) and situations at the start of 1988 and in more recent years are compared , the following trends emerge: numbers of operations : as of the end of 1978 , six u.n. peacekeeping operations existed .

no operations were created between the start of unifil in march 1978 and april 1988 .

the number of operations increased from 8 in 1970 to 17 in 1993 and 1994 , 16 in 1995 and 1996 , and 17 again in 1999 .

since 2000 , the number of operations as of the end of the year has generally fluctuated between 15 and 16 .

as of december 31 , 2010 , there were 15 u.n. peacekeeping operations .

five of the six operations in existence in 1978 still exist .

u.n. costs : for calendar year 1978 , u.n. peacekeeping expenditures totaled $202 million and were up to $635 million for 1989 .

this went up to $1.7 billion for 1992 and to $3 billion annually for 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 .

the total for 1996 went down to $1.4 billion and below $1 billion for 1998 .

since 2000 , u.n. peacekeeping costs were , annually , over $2 billion , reaching $3.6 billion in 2004 and $4.7 billion for 2005 .

u.n .

personnel : as of december 31 , 1978 , personnel in u.n. peacekeeping operations totaled 16,700 .

the highest number during 1993 was 78,500 , but the total was down to 68,900 in 1995 .

in 1996 , the highest number was down to 29,100 and 14,600 in 1998 .

for 2000 , the highest number was 38,500 and climbing .

for 2004 , 64,700 was the highest number and at the end of 2007 , the number in u.n. peacekeeping operations totaled 84,309 .

as of december 31 , 2010 , the number of uniformed personnel in u.n. peacekeeping operations totaled 98,638 , down from 100,645 , as of june 30 , 2010 .

u.s. contributions for assessed peacekeeping accounts : for cy1988 , u.s. assessed contributions totaled $36.7 million .

cy1994 u.s. payments to u.n. peacekeeping accounts were $991.4 million ; and $359 million in cy1996 .

u.s. assessed contributions totaled $518.6 million in cy2000 but were up to $1.3 billion , including arrears payments , in cy2001 .

u.s. contributions were $1.1 billion in cy2005 , $1.1 billion in cy2006 , and $2.26 billion in cy2008 .

u.s .

personnel in u.n. peacekeeping : when 1988 started , the u.s. military participated , as observers , in one u.n. operation , the u.n .

truce supervision organization in palestine ( 36 officers ) .

as of december 31 , 1995 , a total of 2,851 u.s. military personnel served under u.n. control in seven operations .

as of december 31 , 2003 , 518 u.s. personnel served in seven operations and as of the end of 2007 , 316 u.s. personnel served in seven operations .

by december 31 , 2010 , the number of u.s. personnel serving in six operations had dropped to 87 .

united nations peacekeeping might be defined as the placement of military personnel or forces in a country or countries to perform basically non - military functions in an impartial manner .

these functions might include supervision of a cessation of hostilities agreement or truce , observation or presence , interposition between opposing forces as a buffer force , maintenance and patrol of a border , or removal of arms from the area .

the u.n. charter did not specifically provide for "peacekeeping operations. .

this term was devised in 1956 , with the creation of the u.n .

emergency force as an interposition force between israel and egypt .

the u.n. security council normally establishes peacekeeping operations in keeping with certain basic principles , which include agreement and continuing support by the security council ; agreement by the parties to the conflict and consent of the host government ( s ) ; unrestricted access and freedom of movement by the operation within the countries of operation and within the parameters of its mandate ; provision of personnel on a voluntary basis by u.n. members ; and noninterference by the operation and its participants in the internal affairs of the host government .

the conditions under which armed force may be used to carry out the mandate or for other purposes is set forth in the council resolution or in council approval of the rules of engagement or concept of operations .

u.n. peacekeeping operations may take the form of either peacekeeping forces , such as the u.n. force in cyprus ( unficyp ) , the u.n. operation in the congo [in the 1960s] , or the u.n. interim force in lebanon ( unifil ) , or observer missions , such as the u.n. iran - iraq military observer mission ( uniimog ) , the u.n. observer group in central america ( onuca ) , or the u.n .

truce supervision organization in palestine ( untso ) .

the distinctions between observer missions and peacekeeping forces are found in the mandate or function of the operation , the numbers and types of personnel used , and whether the personnel are armed .

usually , peacekeeping forces are larger in the numbers of personnel , equipment , and cost than observer missions and are lightly armed rather than unarmed , as are observers .

when the u.n. security council establishes a u.n. - conducted peacekeeping operation , its resolution also specifies how the operation will be funded .

in most instances , this is by a special assessed account to be created by the u.n. general assembly .

under the u.n. charter , the general assembly approves the budget and expenses of the organization ; this includes u.n. peacekeeping operations .

each operation has a separate budget that is financed from a separate assessed account .

in 1994 , the assembly decided that the financial period for each operation would be changed from january through december to july 1 to june 30 , effective not later than july 1 , 1996 .

as u.n. peacekeeping operations grew in number and complexity , the assembly found it required a longer period of time to consider the budgets of each operation and other agenda items associated with united nations peacekeeping .

since 1948 , the united nations has established 65 peacekeeping operations , 14 of which are currently active .

a review of the data in appendix b , "u.n. peacekeeping operations: numbers created annually , 1948-2010," shows a pattern of increase in the creation of operations that escalated during the mid - 1990s .

this increase placed a strain on the then - not - well - developed capacities of the u.n. secretariat to support larger numbers of operations and personnel and also led to what some have called "donor fatigue" on the part of actual and potential troop contributing countries .

the resulting hesitation or reluctance to rapidly provide personnel for u.n. peacekeeping operations created by the u.n. security council continues today .

current united nations statistics on u.n. peacekeeping often refer to higher numbers of operations and personnel than are provided in the paragraph above .

for example , the february 2007 report of the secretary - general on implementation of recommendations of the special committee on peacekeeping operations , in referring to a "surge in united nations peacekeeping," noted that â€” as 2006 drew to a close , almost 100,000 men and women were deployed in 18 peace operations around the world , of which approximately 82,000 were troops , police , and military observers provided by contributing countries .

those figures are set to increase further in 2007 , with the completion of deployments currently under way ... and the prospect of new united nations peace operations being established , whether united nations peacekeeping missions or special political missions .

in parallel , the department of peacekeeping operations has increased its administrative and logistics support to special political missions managed by the department of political affairs , and is currently supporting 15 such field offices .

more recently , it has become increasingly engaged in assisting regional actors to develop their peacekeeping capabilities , in particular providing substantial support to the african union mission in the sudan ( amis ) .

the use of the term "peace operations" in this context can be tracked back to the brahimi panel report ( see " brahimi panel report ( 2000 ) ," below ) .

peace operations might be seen and identified within the overall context of the charter role of the u.n. security council in the maintenance of international peace and security ( see article 24 of the charter ) , with u.n. peacekeeping being only one element or component of the array of responses the council might employ .

u.n. peace operations , as defined in the brahimi report , "entail three principal activities: conflict prevention and peacemaking ; peacekeeping ; and peace - building. .

the numbers used when referring to the numbers of personnel involved in peace operations as compared with the numbers of personnel involved in u.n. peacekeeping operations can derive from two different aspects: ( 1 ) u.n. peacekeeping operations data generally tracks the numbers of uniformed personnel provided by u.n. member states and does not include the numbers of civilians in those operations , either recruited locally or those internationally recruited .

these increasingly larger numbers of civilians are included in data tracking the numbers of personnel in peace operations .

 ( 2 ) as reflected in the data , the number of currently deployed peacekeeping operations , 15 , as of december 31 , 2010 , differs from the number of peace operations , 16 , which includes one peace operation â€” unami , in iraq .

the clinton administration initially supported collective security through the united nations as a centerpiece of its foreign policy .

later , president clinton , in a september 1993 speech to the u.n. general assembly , called on the security council to review closely each proposal for an operation before determining whether to establish it , saying that "the united nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world's conflicts. .

he supported "creation of a genuine u.n. peacekeeping headquarters with a planning staff , with access to timely intelligence , with a logistics unit that can be deployed on a moment's notice , and a modern operations center with global communications. .

clinton urged that u.n. operations be adequately and fairly funded , saying he was "committed to work with the united nations" in reducing the u.s. assessment for peacekeeping .

in may 1994 , clinton signed presidential decision directive 25 on reforming peace operations .

the policy recommended 11 steps to strengthen u.n. management of peacekeeping operations and offered u.s. support for strengthening the planning , logistics , information , and command and control capabilities of the united nations .

the policy also supported reducing the u.s. peacekeeping assessment from 31.7% to 25% .

in a may 16 , 2000 statement to a u.n. general assembly committee , u.s .

ambassador richard holbrooke presented reform proposals aimed at strengthening u.n. capacities for u.n. peacekeeping and at changing the basis for financing u.n. peacekeeping .

on august 24 , 2000 , a statement by the state department spokesman "commended" the work of the u.n. panel on peace operations [the brahimi panel] , noting that "the united states has been one of the earliest and most insistent voices calling for improvement in planning , the pace of deployment , and overall effectiveness in peacekeeping. .

in december 2004 , congress mandated the establishment of a bipartisan task force on the united nations , to be organized by the u.s. institute of peace .

the task force was to report to congress within six months on how to make the united nations more effective in realizing the goals of its charter .

it was chaired by newt gingrich , former speaker of the house of representatives and by george j. mitchell , former majority leader of the senate .

the report , american interests and u.n. reform , was issued on march 24 , 2005 .

the task force offered a wide variety of comments and recommendations relating to united nations peacekeeping .

they included the following: the key question for the task force in the area of un peacekeeping is whether we are prepared to endorse the current practice of the united states and other members of the security council in demanding that peacekeepers regularly engage in a broad range of robust security activities .

if so , then the united states and other governments must do much more to enhance capacities if we wish to ensure substantial success .

the task force believes that the practical alternatives â€” to consign the united nations to future failures , or to dramatically reduce the united nations' role in efforts to manage conflict and build stable societies â€” are unacceptable .

[p. 90-91] member states "must substantially increase the availability of capable , designated forces , properly trained and equipped , for rapid deployment to peace operations on a voluntary basis .

the secretariat should enhance its capacity to coordinate increases in member state contributions to the stand - by arrangements system. .

[p. 97] the task force noted that while "the united states formally participates in the united nations stand - by arrangements system , its participation is of only limited operational value to the united nations â€” as it provides only a very general list of u.s. capabilities.... [t]he united states should consider upgrading its participation in this voluntary program" by providing more detailed information about the support it might consider .

[p. 97] the united states should support ( 1 ) creation of a senior police force management unit to conduct assessments and assist in the establishment of new peace operations ; ( 2 ) assessed funding for first - year , quick - impact projects in peace operations , as well as the full range of early disarmament , demobilization , and reintegration assistance when those have been identified in premission assessments as critical for success ; and ( 3 ) the adoption of two - year budgets for support of peacekeeping to ensure greater stability , permit more careful planning , and reduce administrative burdens .

[p. 97-98] concerned over reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by deployed u.n. peacekeepers and drawing on the findings by prince zeid , in his comprehensive strategy report , the task force urged that the united states strongly support implementation of reform measures designed to ensure uniform standards for all civilian and military participants in peace operations ; improve training programs relating to sexual exploitation and abuse ; increase deployment of women in peacekeeping operations ; encourage deployment of established ( rather than 'patched together' ) units to peacekeeping operations ; impose accountability of senior managers ; support effective data collection and management ; provide victims assistance ; increase staff to enhance supervision ; and organize recreational activities for peacekeepers .

finally , states that prove unwilling or unable to ensure discipline among their troops should not be permitted to provide troops to peacekeeping missions .

[p. 96 .

congress has , over the years , used authorizations and especially appropriations bills to express its views and enhance its oversight of u.s. executive branch actions and uses of united nations peacekeeping operations .

this has ranged from diminishing to increasing u.s. assessed contributions and linking release of u.s. contributions to reports on actions taken to improve u.n. peacekeeping reform or other actions , not related to peacekeeping , by the united nations .

it has requested to be kept informed on a monthly , an ad hoc , and annual basis of u.s. efforts taken in the u.n. security council to create or to expand u.n. peacekeeping .

it has tried to ensure that u.s. companies engaged in activities that would be useful to the united nations have equal access to u.n. procurement efforts .

congress provided initial u.s. contributions for the u.n. iraq - kuwait observation mission in 1991 ( p.l .

102-55 ) .

funds for u.s. contributions for u.n. peacekeeping operations and also for the portion of u.s. arrearages to be paid from fy1992 money were authorized and appropriated in 1991 ( p.l .

102-138 ; p.l .

102-140 ) and additional funds were made available in 1992 for the rapidly increasing number of peacekeeping operations ( p.l .

102-266 ; p.l .

102-311 ; p.l .

102-368 ; and p.l .

102-395 ) .

this funding was important as demands for new u.n. actions worldwide increased .

during 1992 , some in congress focused on finding new sources of funding for u.s. contributions to u.n. peacekeeping obligations while others explored new directions for the united nations in the area of peace and security .

senator paul simon introduced a bill , for example , suggesting that the united states finance its peacekeeping contributions from the defense budget function , as a larger and more reliable source .

proponents of this proposal pointed to the extent to which u.n. peacekeeping advances u.s. national security interests .

section 1342 of the defense authorization act , p.l .

102-484 , authorized the secretary of defense to obligate up to $300 million from defense appropriations to , among other things , fund u.s. peacekeeping contributions if the funding is not available from the state department's cipa account .

congress , in p.l .

102-484 , asked the president for a report on the proposals made in "an agenda for peace. .

president george bush sent that report to congress on january 19 , 1993 .

in 1993 , in contrast , congress did not provide all the funding requested by the president for financing u.s. contributions to u.n. peacekeeping .

congress appropriated $401.6 million of the $619.7 million requested in the cipa account in the state department appropriations act , fy1994 ( p.l .

103-121 , october 27 , 1993 ) .

the foreign operations act included $75,623,000 of the $77,166,000 requested for peacekeeping operations under the military assistance account ( p.l .

103-87 , september 3 , 1993 ) .

finally , congress did not appropriate the $300 million requested in the department of defense budget for dod peacekeeping support .

further , congress's concerns in this area were expressed in a series of requirements included in the conference report on state department appropriations .

they included: recommending that the administration review thoroughly the current process of committing to peacekeeping operations .

expecting the administration to notify the united nations that the united states will not accept an assessment greater than 25% for any new or expanded peacekeeping commitments after the date of enactment of this act .

expecting the state department in its fy1995 budget submission to include an annual three - year projection of u.s. peacekeeping costs and submit a detailed plan identifying u.s. actions needed to correct policy and structural deficiencies in u.s. involvement with u.n. peacekeeping activities .

expecting the secretary of state to notify both appropriations committees 15 days in advance , where practicable , of a vote by the u.n. security council to establish any new or expanded peacekeeping operation .

expecting the notification to include the total estimated cost , the u.s. share , the mission and objectives , duration and estimated termination date , and the source of funding for the u.s. share .

similar concerns and requirements were placed in statutory language in the defense appropriations act , fy1994 ( section 8153 , p.l .

103-139 , november 11 , 1993 ) and the national defense authorization act , fy1994 ( title xi , p.l .

103-160 , november 30 , 1993 ) .

in 1994 , the state department appropriations bill ( p.l .

103-317 , august 26 , 1994 ) included the requested $533.3 million in the fy1995 cipa account and $670 million for the fy1994 cipa supplemental appropriations .

the foreign operations appropriations legislation ( p.l .

103-306 , august 23 , 1994 ) also contained the requested $75 million for peacekeeping and peace support and a provision allowing a transfer of $850,000 to imet for training of other countries' troops for u.n. peacekeeping duty .

the fy1995 national defense authorization bill ( h.r .

4301 ) and the fy1995 dod appropriations bill ( h.r .

4650 ) were enacted without the $300 million requested to finance u.s. - assessed contributions to three u.n. operations .

congress , in early 1996 , responded to the president's february 1995 request by appropriating $359 million ( $445 million requested ) for fy1996 cipa funding ( p.l .

104-134 , april 26 , 1996 ) and $70 million ( $100 million requested ) for the pko account ( p.l .

104-107 , february 12 , 1996 ) .

congress rejected the president's request for $672 million in fy1995 emergency supplemental funding in the cipa account .

congress also rejected the administration's proposal that part ( $65 million ) of the u.s. assessed contributions to two u.n. peacekeeping operations in which u.s. military personnel participated , haiti ( unmih ) and macedonia ( unpredep ) , be funded from defense department appropriations .

congress , in 1996 , provided $352.4 million for u.s. assessments to u.n. peacekeeping accounts in the omnibus consolidated appropriations act , fy1997 ( p.l .

104-208 ) .

this included $50 million for u.s. peacekeeping arrears accumulated in 1995 .

release of the arrears funding depended on an administration certification that two of three u.n. non - peacekeeping - related actions occur: ( 1 ) savings of $100 million in biennial expenses of five u.n. secretariat divisions ; ( 2 ) reduction in the number of u.n. staff by december 31 , 1997 , by at least 10% of the number employed on january 1 , 1996 ; and ( 3 ) adoption of a budget outline for 1998-1999 lower than the current budget level of $2.608 billion .

in addition , conferees expected that up to $20 million in the account would be available for contingencies related to african crises .

use of these funds was subject to committee review procedures .

furthermore , congress stipulated that none of the funds in the cipa account shall be spent for any new or expanded u.n. peacekeeping mission unless the appropriate committees are notified , at least 15 days before a u.n. security council vote .

the notification should provide the estimated cost , length of mission , and planned exit strategy .

a reprogramming of funds is to be submitted , including the source of funds for the mission and a certification that american manufacturers and suppliers are given opportunities equal to those given to foreign sources to provide equipment , services , and materials for u.n. peacekeeping activities .

congress appropriated $65 million for the pko account , but stipulated that none of the funds shall be obligated or expended , except as provided through regular notification procedures of the appropriations committees .

in 1997 , congress appropriated $256 million ( $286 million requested ) for the fy1998 cipa ( including $46 million for prior year payments / arrears ) and $77.5 million ( $90 million requested ) for the fy1998 pko account .

release of $46 million for arrears payments was contingent on passage of an authorization package linking arrears payments to specific u.n. reforms .

release of part of the pko funds , for the multilateral force and observers ( mfo ) , was contingent on the secretary of state filing a report on the status of efforts to replace the director - general of the mfo ( letter sent to congress , march 18 , 1998 ) .

in 1998 , congress appropriated the requested $231 million for u.s. assessed contributions to u.n. peacekeeping operations ( cipa ) and $76.5 million ( $83 million requested ) for international peacekeeping activities ( pko ) .

congress , however , did not include funds ( $921 million ) sought in an fy1998 supplemental to pay u.n. and international organization arrears in fy1999 ( $475 million ) and fy2000 ( $446 million ) .

in 1999 , congress appropriated $500 million for payment of u.s. assessed contributions to u.n. peacekeeping accounts in the state department appropriations act and $153 million for voluntary contributions to international peacekeeping activities in the foreign operations appropriations act , both of which were incorporated by reference into the omnibus consolidated appropriations act , 2000 , p.l .

106-113 .

congress also sent the president h.r .

3194 ( 106 th congress ) , the state department authorization act for fy2000-fy2001 ( h.r .

3427 ) , which authorized $500 million for the cipa account for fy2000 and "such sums as may be necessary for fy2001" and contained a number of peacekeeping - related provisions .

one provision required an annual report to the united nations on all u.s. costs ( "assessed , voluntary , and incremental" ) incurred in support of all u.n. security council passed peace activities and required the president to request the united nations to compile and publish a report on the costs incurred by all u.n. members in support of u.n. peacekeeping activities .

another provision amended the u.n .

participation act requiring the president to obtain timely u.n. reimbursement for u.s. goods and services valued at over $3 million per fiscal year , per operation , provided to the united nations .

another section codified in the u.n .

participation act language previously enacted on consultations and reports on united nations peacekeeping operations .

lastly , this legislation provided for u.s. arrears payments of $819 million to the united nations for regular budget and peacekeeping accounts for fy1998 , fy1999 , and fy2000 .

in addition , section 913 provided for the forgiveness of $107 million in amounts owed by the united nations to the united states in reimbursements for peacekeeping troops .

the primary benchmarks relating to peacekeeping included a 25% ceiling on peacekeeping assessments and no funding for or development of a u.n. standing army .

in 2000 , congress appropriated $846 million for the fy2001 cipa account , in response to the president's request of $738.6 million for fy2001 and an fy2000 supplemental of $107 million .

congress did not approve the supplemental for fy2000 .

in june 2000 , the house appropriations committee , in recommending a smaller appropriation , expressed its "gravest concern" over what it called "the administration's tendency to ... extend moribund missions and to establish and expand missions irrespective of congressional input or the availability of funding to pay for them. .

the $134 million requested for the fy2001 pko account was reduced in the foreign operations appropriations bill to $127 million ( p.l .

106-429 ) .

on october 5 , 2001 , president bush signed legislation amending the foreign relations authorization act , fiscal years 2000-2001 ( p.l .

107-46 ) .

this bill revised a condition prohibiting the obligation of appropriated funds for payment of u.s. arrearages for assessed contributions to the united nations until the share of the budget for each assessed u.n. peacekeeping operation does not exceed 28.15% for any single u.n. member .

on november 28 , 2001 , the president signed h.r .

2500 , appropriating funds for the state department , including the amount requested for the fy2002 cipa account ( p.l .

107-77 ) .

the law includes a provision requiring that 15% ( $126,620,850 ) of the $844,139,000 appropriated for cipa remain available until september 30 , 2003 .

on january 10 , 2002 , the president signed h.r .

2506 , providing $135 million ( $150 million requested ) in voluntary contributions for the fy2002 pko account under the foreign operations act .

on march 21 , 2002 , president bush , in his emergency fy2002 supplemental appropriations request ( h.doc .

107-195 ) , included $43 million for the cipa account , "to meet projected increased costs for u.n. peacekeeping operations .

the united states has a clear national interest in resolving multi - state conflicts and encouraging the evolution of stable democracies in countries in which u.n. peacekeeping missions are operational. .

congress provided $23,034,000 for "increased assessments" for the u.n. operation in the congo in h.r .

4775 , which was signed on august 2 , 2002 ( p.l .

107-206 ) .

on september 30 , 2002 , the president signed the foreign relations authorization act , fiscal years 2002-2003 ( p.l .

107-228 ) , in which congress authorized $844 million for u.s. assessed contributions in cipa and amended provisions relating to the 25% assessment level condition and cap on payment of u.s. assessed contributions to u.n. peacekeeping operations .

on february 20 , 2003 , the president signed the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution ( p.l .

108-7 ) , which provided $673,710,000 for the cipa account ( $725.9 million requested ) and $120,250,000 for the pko account ( $108.8 million requested ) .

the conferees provided that , as requested by the president , 15% of the amount in the cipa account ( approx .
