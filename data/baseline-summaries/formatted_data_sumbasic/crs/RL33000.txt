congressman christopher h. smith introduced h.r .

2601 on may 24 , 2005 .

the subcommittee on africa , global human rights and international relations held a markupsession on may 26 and forwarded the bill on to the full committee the same day .

the houseinternational relations committee held markup sessions on june 8 and 9 .

the house internationalrelations committee completed its full committee markup on june 9 , 2005 .

the bill was reportedon july 13 ( h.rept .

109-168 ) .

house floor debate occurred the week of july 18 , 2005 .

earlier in 2005 , senator lugar introduced a senate version of the foreign relationsauthorization legislation ( s. 600 ) on march 10 .

the measure was reported to the senatethe same day ( s.rept .

109-35 ) .

on april 5 and 6 , the senate debated the bill at which time thecombination of numerous amendments on the bill , world events ( the death of the pope ) ,nominations , and filibusters on judges put off action on the measure .

congress is required by law to authorize the spending of appropriations for the statedepartment and foreign policy activities every two years .

the authorization acts as a ceiling for theappropriations .

the foreign relations authorization process dovetails with the annual appropriationprocess for the department of state ( within the science , state , justice , commerce and relatedagency appropriation in the house and the state - foreign operations appropriation in the senate ) and foreign assistance activities ( within the foreign operations appropriation in both house andsenate ) .

in the past 10 years , congress has had an inconsistent record on getting a stand - alone foreignrelations authorization bill passed and signed into law .

during the two decades prior to thegovernment shutdown of november 1995 , virtually every congress enacted stand - alone foreignrelations authorization laws .

since 1995 , however , congress has waived the requirement to provideauthorization prior to expenditures more times than it has met the requirement .

the mostrecently - enacted stand - alone authorization act was for fy2003 ( p.l .

107-228 / h.r .

1646 ) signed september 30 , 2002 .

 ( see appendix ii for foreign relations authorization history. ) .

since foreign relations authorization legislation is typically passed the first session of eachcongress , the senate foreign relation committee and the house international relations committeeof the 109th congress began working on their bills early in 2005 .

the foreign relations authorizationlegislation typically provides authority for state department spending for such activities as salariesand other operating expenses , passport and visa processing , embassy and foreign service activities,as well as public diplomacy and international broadcasting .

in addition , the legislation oftenbecomes a convenient vehicle for numerous foreign policy - related issues , such as nonproliferation,human rights , international family planning policy , and international health and environment issues .

congress can influence u.s. foreign policy regarding specific regions or countries via this biannuallegislation , as well .

the foreign relations authorization bills introduced in the 109th congress house and senatediffer significantly .

both contain similar provisions for the state department spending levels , theoperation , organization and personnel of state .

s. 600 goes beyond that to include titleson: 1 ) authorizing foreign assistance programs , 2 ) radiological terrorism security , 3 ) global pathogensurveillance , 4 ) safe water , 5 ) protection of vulnerable populations during humanitarian emergencies,and 6 ) reconstruction and stabilization issues .

h.r .

2601 includes measures on: 1 ) democracy promotion , 2 ) u.n. reform , 3 ) export controls and security assistance , and 4 ) nonproliferation .

because of congress' inability to get an authorization bill to the president's deskin some congresses , some members in both house and senate committees are determined toproduce foreign policy authorization legislation this year , since they see it as one of their primaryresponsibilities .

titles in both bills include state department authorizations of appropriations ; statedepartment authorities and activities ; organization and personnel of the department of state,international organizations ; and international broadcasting ( board of governors ) .

the two billshave no foreign assistance measures in common , as there are no substantive foreign assistanceprovisions in the h.r .

2601 .

s. 600 contains a number of measures in addition to those authorizing statedepartment appropriations , organization measures , and broadcasting .

included in s. 600are provisions that would authorize foreign assistance programs , radiological terrorism security,global pathogen surveillance , safe water , protection of vulnerable populations during humanitarianemergencies , and conventional arms disarmament .

authorization of state department appropriations are required by law every two years .

typically , the authorization is passed in the first year of a new congress for the following even / oddyear authority .
