the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , part of the department of commerce , conducts scientific research in areas such as marine and coastal ecosystems , climate , and weather ; supplies information on the oceans and atmosphere ; and provides stewardship of coastal and marine species and environments .

noaa was created in 1970 by president nixon's reorganization plan no .

4 .

the reorganization plan was designed to unify the nation's environmental activities and to provide a systematic approach for monitoring , analyzing , and protecting the environment .

noaa's administrative structure has evolved into five line offices that reflect its diverse mission , including the national ocean service ( nos ) , the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) , the national environmental satellite , data , and information service ( nesdis ) , the national weather service ( nws ) , and the office of oceanic and atmospheric research ( oar ) .

in addition to noaa's five line offices , program support ( ps ) , a cross - cutting budget activity , supports the noaa education program , corporate services , facilities , and the office of marine and aviation services .

the fy2010 noaa budget request of $4.474 billion accounted for nearly 33% of the department of commerce's total request of $13.779 billion .

the request was $108.6 million ( 2.5% ) more than the fy2009-enacted noaa budget of $4.365 billion .

the fy2010 budget included $3.091 billion for the operations , research , and facilities ( orf ) account , $1.391 billion for the procurement , acquisition , and construction ( pac ) account , and a net total of - $8.0 million for noaa's other accounts .

table 1 provides fy2009 enacted , fy2010 administration request , fy2010 house - passed , fy2010 senate - passed , and fy2010 enacted funding levels for noaa .

in most years , orf and pac accounts provide more than 98% of noaa's budget request .

except for nesdis , orf provides the bulk of funding for noaa line offices .

noaa's other accounts usually include an internal transfer from the coastal zone management fund to orf , the fisheries finance program , and the pacific coastal salmon recovery fund .

the administration did not request funding for the pacific coastal salmon recovery fund , but instead requested $60 million to establish a species recovery grant program that would include pacific salmon .

the house recommended funding of $4.603 billion for noaa .

this provided an increase of 5.5% compared with the fy2009-enacted funding level and a 2.9% increase over the administration's request .

of the $4.603 billion recommended by the house , $3.202 billion was for orf , $1.409 billion for pac , and a net total of - $8.0 million for noaa's other accounts .

the house - passed version of h.r .

2847 added $500,000 to the appropriations committee's recommendation to support special fishery demonstration projects in the western pacific .

the senate recommended funding of $4.773 billion for noaa .

this represented an increase of 9.3% compared with the fy2009-enacted level and an increase of 6.7% over the administration's request .

of the $4.773 billion passed by the senate , $3.304 billion funded orf , $1.398 billion funded pac , and a net total of $71.0 million funded noaa's other accounts .

on december 16 , 2009 , the president signed the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l .

111-117 ) , which provides noaa with $4.737 billion for fy2010 .

this represents an increase of 8.5% compared to the fy2009 enacted level and an increase of 5.9% over the administration's request .

noaa's r&d efforts focus on three areas: climate ; weather and air quality ; and ocean , coastal and great lakes resources .

for fy2010 , president obama requested $568 million in r&d funding for noaa .

this was a 7% decrease from the fy2009 appropriation level of $611 million .

r&d was nearly 13% of noaa's total discretionary budget request of $4.474 billion .

the r&d request consisted of approximately 93% research funding and 7% development funding .

about 73% of the r&d request would fund intramural programs and 27% would fund extramural programs .

the oar request of $305.9 million was nearly the same as the fy2009 oar appropriation of $307.1 million and 53.9% of the total noaa fy2010 r&d request .

the president's budget also included $60.4 million for nos r&d , a decrease of $2.1 million ( 3.4% ) from the fy2009 level .

nesdis r&d decreased by $0.8 million ( 2.8% ) to $27.6 million .

nws r&d funding decreased by $9.4 million ( 39.6% ) to $14.3 million and omao funding fell to $104.0 million , a decrease of $35.0 million ( 25.1% ) .

the administration request expanded r&d funding for nmfs , proposing $55.4 million , an increase of $4.9 million ( 9.7% ) .

the noaa fy2010 budget summary also broke down r&d funding according to ecosystems ( 32% ) climate ( 31% ) , weather and water ( 14% ) , commerce and transportation ( 1% ) , and mission support ( 22% ) .

r&d accomplishments highlighted by noaa include upgrading the noaa operation prediction system , developing fishery bycatch reduction devices , predicting harmful algal blooms in the great lakes , integrating radar data to enhance weather forecasts and warnings , and implementing the soil moisture observational network .

on february 13 , 2009 , the 111 th congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) of 2009 ( p.l .

111-5 ) , also referred to as the stimulus package .

arra provided $830 million to noaa that will be used during fy2009 and fy2010 .

only $500,000 of this funding ( provided to nws ) was classified as r&d .

the orf account was funded at $230.0 million .

proposed orf activities include reducing the hydrographic survey backlog , restoring marine and coastal habitat , and repairing and maintaining noaa research vessels .

the pac account was funded at $600.0 million .

proposed pac activities include constructing and maintaining facilities , ships , and equipment ; improving weather forecasts ; developing and deploying satellites ; and enhancing climate models .
