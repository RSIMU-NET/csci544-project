the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks called attention to the fact that the u.s. governmentis unaware of the addresses and whereabouts of many foreign nationals ( 1 ) in the united states .

in theaftermath of the attacks , congress sought to improve the tracking of one subgroup of foreignnationals: temporary legal residents .

to better track these temporary residents , also known asnonimmigrants , the 107th congress revived efforts to implement an entry - exit control system and asystem for monitoring foreign students .

 ( 2 ) in addition,the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is using the registration provisions of the immigration and nationality act to track foreign nationalsin the united states .

 ( 3 ) as detailed below , that actrequires that most aliens in the united states for30 days or longer be registered and provide notification of each change of address .

the alienregistration issue has also been considered to a limited extent in the 107th and 108thcongresses .

alien registration requirements , which date to the alien registration act of 1940 , wereincorporated into the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) of 1952 .

 ( 4 ) they generally do not applyto , or can be waived in , the case of nonimmigrants entering under ina ï¿½101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( a ) ( ambassadorsand diplomats ) or ina ï¿½101 ( a ) ( 15 ) ( g ) ( representatives to , and officials and employees of,international organizations ) .

in their current form , these requirements include the following: ( 5 ) no visa can be issued to an alien unless the alien has been registered in connection with the visa application .

 ( 6 ) every alien who is age 14 or older , remains in the united states for 30 daysor longer , and has not been registered must apply for registration and be fingerprinted before day 30 .

the attorney general may waive the fingerprinting requirement in the case of anynonimmigrant .

 ( 7 ) the attorney general is authorized to prescribe special regulations and formsfor the registration and fingerprinting of certain enumerated groups , including aliens of any classwho are not legal permanent residents ( lprs ) of the united states .

 ( 8 ) the attorney general and the secretary of state are authorized to prepareforms for the registration of aliens .

these forms are to contain questions about the date and placeof the alien's entry into the united states ; activities in which the alien has been and intends to beengaged ; expected length of stay ; any police or criminal record ; and any additionalmatters .

 ( 9 ) aliens required to be registered must notify the attorney general in writingof each change of address within 10 days of the change and provide such additional information asthe attorney general may require .

similarly , the attorney general , upon 10 days notice , may requirethe natives of any foreign state who are required to be registered to provide notification of theircurrent addresses and such additional information as the attorney general mayrequire .

 ( 10 ) an alien required to apply for registration and to be fingerprinted who willfullyfails to do so is guilty of a misdemeanor , and upon conviction , may be fined up to $1,000 orimprisoned for up to 6 months , or both .

an alien who fails to notify the attorney general of achange of address is guilty of a misdemeanor , and upon conviction , may be fined up to $200 orimprisoned for up to 30 days , or both .

regardless of whether such an alien is convicted or punishedfor failing to provide the address notification , the alien will be taken into custody and removed fromthe country unless the alien satisfies the attorney general that "such failure was reasonablyexcusable or was not willful. .

 ( 11 ) .

at various times in the past , the attorney general used the authority granted by the ina toprescribe special regulations and forms for the registration and fingerprinting of certain groups ofaliens .

until its abolition in march 2003 , the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) administered alien registration .

in january 1991 , on the eve of the persian gulf war , inspromulgated a rule requiring all nonimmigrants carrying iraqi or kuwaiti travel documents whoapplied for admission to the united states , except for those entering as diplomats or officials ofinternational organizations , to be registered , photographed , and fingerprinted at the port of entry .

according to the summary of the rule in the federal register : "this action is necessary to protectand safeguard the interests and security of the united states as a precaution against reprisals ..." ( 12 ) in december 1993 , ins published an interim rule that removed these special registration requirements for iraqis and kuwaitis .

the rule also added a new provision to the ins regulationson registration .

 ( 13 ) that provision stated that theattorney general may require , by public notice inthe federal register , that certain nonimmigrants of specific countries be registered and fingerprintedupon arrival in the united states .

the supplementary information accompanying the rule describedthe provision as "a procedural change which affords the attorney general more flexibility inresponding to specific political situations than was formerly available [when changes in regulationwere required]. .

 ( 14 ) under the authority of theprovision , ins published a separate notice in the sameissue of the federal register requiring all nonimmigrants bearing iraqi or sudanese traveldocuments who applied for admission to the united states , except for those entering as diplomatsor officials of international organizations , to be registered , photographed , and fingerprinted at theport of entry .

the notice indicated that such measures were necessary in light of "recent terroristactivities perpetrated on united states soil and the discovery of terrorist plots. .

 ( 15 ) in september 1996,ins published a federal register notice similarly providing for the registration , photographing , andfingerprinting of nonimmigrants holding iranian or libyan travel documents .

 ( 16 ) in july 1998 , inspublished a notice consolidating and replacing these two notices covering nonimmigrants holdingiranian , iraqi , libyan , or sudanese travel documents .

 ( 17 ) .

according to the department of justice ( doj ) , the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attackshighlighted weaknesses in the u.s. immigration system .

under the system in place at that time , dojmaintained , it was difficult to know whether nonimmigrants in the country were following theirstated plans , whether they remained beyond their authorized period of stay , and how to locate them,if necessary .

to address these and other concerns , ins proposed two rules in 2002 that drew on theina's registration provisions and other authority .

alien registration and reporting provisions were included in legislation in the 107th congress .

the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 , as enacted by the 107thcongress , directs the general accounting office to conduct a study of the feasibility and utility ofrequiring nonimmigrants in the united states to submit a current address and , where applicable , thename and address of an employer every year .

the study is due by may 2003 .

 ( 43 ) as discussed above,a similar address reporting requirement existed until 1981 .

an immigration reform measure , the "securing america's future through enforcement reform act of 2002" ( h.r .

5013 ) , would have amended the ina to expand existing registrationrequirements .

 ( 44 ) in addition to the currentrequirement that aliens who are in the united states for30 days or longer and are unregistered apply for registration and be fingerprinted by day 30 , it wouldhave required subsequent registrations on the part of lprs every year and on the part of other aliensevery 3 months .

with respect to address reporting , the bill would have retained the currentrequirement that aliens notify the attorney general of a change of address within 10 days and wouldhave preserved the attorney general's authority to require , upon 10 days notice , that the natives ofany foreign state report their current addresses .

among its other registration - related provisions , h.r .

5013 would have directed the attorney general to establish an informationtechnology system for the collection , compilation , and maintenance of registration information .

h.r .

5013 was referred to the house judiciary committee and its subcommittee onimmigration , border security , and claims , but saw no further action .

in the 108th congress , the senate agreed to an alien registration - related amendment ( s.amdt .

54 ) by unanimous consent during its consideration of the fy2003consolidated appropriations resolution ( h.j.res .

2 ) .

s.amdt .

54 , whichwas sponsored by senator jon kyl with bipartisan cosponsorship , sought to make funding availablefor an entry - exit system .

it also provided that no funds appropriated by the act would be availablefor any expenses related to nseers and directed the attorney general to provide theappropriations committees with nseers - related documents and materials .

the senate passed anamended version of h.j.res .

2 , which included s.amdt .

54 , on january23 , 2003 .

 ( 45 ) the version of h.j.res .

2 passed by the house on january 8 , 2003 , did notinclude language on nseers .

the final version of h.j.res .

2 , signed into law onfebruary 20 , 2003 as p.l .

108-7 , did not eliminate funding for nseers .

it did , however , includelanguage requiring the attorney general , in consultation with the secretary of dhs , to provide theappropriations committees by march 1 , 2003 , with the nseers - related documents and materialsdescribed in the senate amendment .
