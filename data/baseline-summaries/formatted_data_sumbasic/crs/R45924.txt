the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .

it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .

in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .

the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .

as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .

annual u.s. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period .

when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .

in the second of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2019 ( see shaded box below ) , ers projects that u.s. net farm income will rise 4.8% in 2019 to $88.0 billion , up $4.0 billion from last year .

net cash income ( calculated on a cash - flow basis ) is also projected higher in 2019 ( +7.2% ) to $112.6 billion .

the august 2019 net farm income forecast represents an increase from usda's preliminary february 2019 forecast of $69.4 billion .

an increase in government support in 2019 , projected at $19.5 billion and up 42.5% from 2018 , is the principal driver behind the rise in net farm income .

support from traditional farm programs is expected to be bolstered by large direct government payments in response to trade retaliation under the escalating trade war with china .

at a projected $19.5 billion in calendar 2019 , direct government payments would represent 22.2% of net farm incomeâthe largest share since 2006 when federal subsidies represented a 27.6% share .

the august forecast of $88 billion is just above ( +0.9% ) the 10-year average of $87.3 billion and represents continued agriculture - sector economic weakness since 2013's record high of $123.7 billion .

u.s. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income , especially since 2005 .

as a result , the financial success of the u.s. agricultural sector is strongly linked to international demand for u.s. products .

because of this strong linkage , the downturn in u.s. agricultural exports that started in 2015 ( figure 20 ) deepened the downturn in farm income that ran from 2013 through 2016 ( figure 1 ) .

since 2018 , the u.s. agricultural sector's trade outlook has been vulnerable to several international trade disputes , particularly the ongoing dispute between the united states and china .

a return to market - based farm income growth for the u.s. agricultural sector will likely necessitate improved international trade prospects .

the u.s. farm income and asset - value situation and outlook suggest a relatively stable financial position heading into 2019 for the agriculture sector as a wholeâbut with considerable uncertainty regarding the downward outlook for prices and market conditions for the sector and an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses and on federal support to offset lost trade opportunities due to ongoing trade disputes .

farm asset valuesâwhich reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investmentsâare projected to be up 2.0% in 2019 to a nominal $3.1 trillion ( table a - 3 ) .

in inflation - adjusted terms ( using 2018 dollars ) , farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( figure 24 ) .

nominally higher farm asset values are expected in 2019 due to increases in both real estate values ( +2.0% ) and nonreal - estate values ( +2.1% ) .

real estate is projected to account for 83% of total farm sector asset value .

crop land values are closely linked to commodity prices .

the leveling off of crop land values since 2015 reflects stagnant commodity prices ( figure 25 ) .

for 2019 , usda forecasts that prices for most major commodities will decline from 2018âwheat , barley , soybeans , cotton , choice steers , broilers , and eggs lower ; sorghum , oats , rice , and pork products higher ( table a - 4 ) .

however , these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty associated with international commodity markets .

total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $415.7 billion in 2019 ( +3.4% ) ( table a - 3 ) .

farm equityâor net worth , defined as asset value minus debtâis projected to be up slightly ( +1.8% ) at $2.7 trillion in 2019 ( table a - 3 ) .

the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.5% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 26 ) .

a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt .

thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy .

average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $116,060 in 2019 ( table a - 2 ) , up 4.7% from 2018 but 13.5% below the record of $134,165 in 2014 .

about 17% ( $20,075 ) of total farm household income is from farm production activities , and the remaining 83% ( $95,985 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) .

the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 27 ) .

since 2014 , over half of u.s. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations .

since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 28 ) .

in 2017 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $111,744 was about 30% higher than the average u.s. household income of $86,220 ( table a - 2 ) .

 figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 present usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commoditiesâcorn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens .

the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons .

usda farm income data tables table a - 1 to table a - 3 present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of u.s. agriculture .

in addition , table a - 4 presents the annual average farm price received for several major commodities , including the usda forecast for the 2018-2019 marketing year .
