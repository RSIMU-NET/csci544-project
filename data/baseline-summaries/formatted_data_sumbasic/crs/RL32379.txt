saddam hussein's regime had been considered a threat to u.s. interests since its august 2 , 1990 invasion of kuwait , although there had been disagreements within the u.s. government over whether that threat could be managed through containment .

the administration of george w. bush asserted the threat could not be contained and needed to be removed militarily in an operation to change iraq's regime and replace it with a democratic government .

in response to iraq's invasion of kuwait , u.n. security council resolution 678 ( november 29 , 1990 ) authorized the use of force to expel iraq from kuwait .

the united states put together a coalition consisting of about 500,000 u.s. personnel and 225,000 non - u.s. personnel from 35 nations , of which about 100,000 were from arab / islamic nations .

the united states incurred about $61.1 billion in incremental costs of "operation desert storm" ( january 16 - february 28 , 1991 ) , which liberated kuwait , but foreign contributors offset almost about $54 billion of the u.s. costs .

saudi arabia , kuwait , and the united arab emirates contributed about $37 billion of that figure .

in the 2003 war to overthrow saddam hussein ( operation iraqi freedom , oif ) , u.s. personnel in the invasion force were about 230,000 , joined by over 20,000 forces from 34 other nations .

no foreign nations reimbursed u.s. incremental costs of oif .

after the 1991 war , a cease - fire was declared in security council resolution 686 ( march 2 , 1991 ) .

a more permanent cease - fire resolution was security council resolution 687 ( april 3 , 1991 ) , which required iraq — in return for a graduated easing of sanctions — to end its weapons of mass destruction programs , recognize kuwait , account for missing kuwaitis , return kuwaiti property , cooperate with the demarcation of the iraq - kuwait border , and end support for terrorism .

iraq accepted the resolution .

iraq was required by resolution 688 ( april 5 , 1991 ) to end repression of its people .

in forty reviews ( at 60-day intervals ) of iraqi compliance from the end of the gulf war in 1991 until august 20 , 1998 , the u.n. security council maintained the comprehensive international sanctions on iraq's imports and exports imposed by security council resolution 661 ( august 6 , 1990 ) .

after the breakdown of the original weapons inspections regime in december 1998 , two additional major resolutions ( 1284 of december 17 , 1999 and 1441 of november 8 , 2002 ) were adopted in an effort to resume u.n. disarmament efforts .

including resolution 1441 , a total of 17 u.n. resolutions required iraq's complete dismantlement of its wmd programs .

this report discusses those resolutions and provisions that are still active , and those whose application to iraq have been terminated both before and since the fall of saddam hussein's regime .

from april 1991 until december 1998 , a u.n. special commission ( unscom ) and the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) attempted to verify that iraq had ended all its prohibited wmd programs and to establish a long - term monitoring program of wmd facilities ( resolution 715 , october 11 , 1991 ) .

the monitoring program , accepted by iraq in november 1993 , consisted of visitations and technical surveillance of about 300 sites .

under resolution 1051 ( march 27 , 1996 ) , u.n. weapons inspectors monitored , at point of entry and at end - use destination , iraq's imports of any dual use items .

confrontations over access to suspected wmd sites began almost as soon as unscom began operations in april 1991 , prompting adoption of resolution 707 ( august 15 , 1991 ) requiring unfettered access to all sites and disclosure by iraq of all its wmd suppliers .

during march 1996 - october 1997 , iraq impeded inspectors from entering iraqi security service and military facilities , and it interfered with some unscom flights .

these actions , which were not resolved by a march 1996 side agreement between unscom and iraq governing pre - notification of inspections of defense and security sites , prompted resolution 1060 ( june 12 , 1996 ) and other council statements ( such as on june 13 , 1997 ) demanding iraqi cooperation .

resolution 1115 ( june 21 , 1997 ) threatened travel restrictions against iraqi officials committing the infractions , and resolution 1134 ( october 23 , 1997 ) again threatened a travel ban and suspended sanctions reviews until april 1998 .

resolution 688 ( april 5 , 1991 ) requires iraq to cease repressing its own people .

iraq now has a different regime than the one addressed by this resolution ( which was not technically a "chapter 7" resolution ) , and it is not clear whether this resolution still applies .

u.s. and u.n. human rights reports after the 1991 gulf war repeatedly described saddam hussein's regime as a gross violator of human rights .

international organizations estimate that more than 400,000 iraqis were killed by regime security forces during saddam's rule , but some estimates are as high as 1 million .

in 1994 , the clinton administration said it was considering presenting a case against iraq to the international court of justice under the 1948 genocide convention .

then u.n. rapporteur for iraq max van der stoel's february 1994 report said that convention might have been violated by iraq's abuses against the shiite "marsh arabs" in southern iraq , including drainage of the marshes where they live .

in february 2002 , iraq allowed the u.n. human rights rapporteur for iraq , andreas mavromatis of cyprus , to visit iraq , the first such visit since 1992 .

on october 20 , 2002 , sensing the united states was trying to build a case to oust him from power militarily , saddam hussein granted an amnesty and released virtually all prisoners in iraq .

he called the move gratitude for his purported "100%" victory in a referendum ( no opponent ) on his leadership on october 15 , 2002 .

some in the bush administration have blamed some of the post - war unrest in iraq on criminals released by saddam during this amnesty .

u.s. state department documents also discuss reports of women who were raped by iraqi personnel while in custody , in an effort to extract information and force confessions from their family members .

some human rights groups , such as amnesty international , have reported that the former regime beheaded over 200 women accused of prostitution .

detainees , both male or female , were routinely and systematically tortured , including by electric shock and burnings , according to administration documents .

u.s. and other accounts say the former regime conducted a decades - long campaign of murder , execution , and arrest of shiite religious leaders , and that the families of supporters of shiite islamic political parties were often denied food ration cards .

shiite religious commemorations , broadcasts , and publications were banned .

it was widely alleged that saddam's elder son , uday , who served as a sports official , threatened or beat athletes following soccer game defeats and that he dismissed hundreds of members of the iraqi union of journalists for not praising the regime sufficiently .

resolution 687 required iraq to end support for international terrorism , and iraq made a declaration that it would do so in 1991 .

despite that declaration , some known terrorists lived in iraq up until the time of the 2003 war .

palestine liberation front leader abu abbas , whose organization committed the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship achille lauro , was arrested by u.s. forces in iraq on april 15 , 2003 , during the war .

he died in u.s. custody , apparently of natural causes , in early march 2004 .

in august 2002 aging terrorist organization leader abu nidal died ( committed suicide or was killed ) as iraqi police went to arrest him for alleged contacts with foreign governments opposed to baghdad .

during 2000 - 2003 , iraq was paying the families of palestinian suicide bombers $25,000 , and iraq reportedly invited arab volunteers to fight against the united states in the course of operation iraqi freedom .

resolution 1284 required reports on the issues discussed below but , unlike resolution 687 , did not link the easing of any sanctions to iraqi compliance on kuwait - related issues .

resolution 1441 did not impose any new kuwait - related requirements on iraq .

it is on these issues that the current iraqi government most wants to achieve closure , in large part to end the financial deductions to pay the compensation to kuwait discussed below .

the united states , most recently during the july 2009 visit of prime minister maliki , has reiterated the thrust of article 25 of the u.s. - iraq security agreement , requiring the united states to try to help iraq close out chapter 7 resolutions .

however , the united states also is allied with kuwait , which wants the relevant issues completely cleared up before the chapter 7 files are closed out .

the and the united states has not firmly sided with iraq that the applicable u.n. resolutions be closed before the inherent provisions have been completely resolved .

a u.n. secretary general report on what is needed to close these resolutions , required by paragraph 5 of u.n. security council resolution 1859 ( december 22 , 2008 ) , is due later in 2009 .

resolution 687 required iraq to annul its annexation of kuwait , directed the u.n. secretary - general to demarcate the iraq - kuwait border , and established a demilitarized zone ( abolished after the 2003 war ) 10 kilometers into iraq and 5 kilometers into kuwait .

resolution 773 ( august 26 , 1992 ) endorsed border decisions taken by the iraq - kuwait boundary demarcation commission ( established may 2 , 1991 ) that , in november 1992 , finished demarcating the iraq - kuwait border as described in an october 1963 agreement between iraq and kuwait .

the border took effect on january 15 , 1993 .

the new line deprived iraq of part of umm qasr port and a strip of the rumaylah oil field , which straddles the border .

on march 18 , 1993 , the commission determined the sea border , allowing both countries access to the gulf .

resolution 833 ( may 27 , 1993 ) demanded that iraq and kuwait accept the final border demarcation .

on november 10 , 1994 , iraq formally recognized kuwait in a motion signed by saddam hussein .

at the arab summit in beirut ( march 27-29 , 2002 ) , iraq reaffirmed its commitment to kuwait's territorial integrity and pledged to cooperate to determine the fate of missing kuwaitis ( see below ) .

on december 7 , 2002 , saddam hussein issued an "apology" to kuwait for the invasion , but kuwait rejected it as insincere .

until it ended operations just after the launch of operation iraqi freedom , the 32-nation u.n. iraq - kuwait observer mission ( unikom ) , established by resolutions 687 and 689 april 9 , 1991 , monitored border violations .

the united states contributed 11 personnel to the mission , which was considered a u.n. peacekeeping operation .

under resolution 806 ( february 5 , 1993 ) , passed after iraqi incursions into the demilitarized zone in january 1993 ( and other incidents ) , a 908-member bengali troop contingent supplemented the 197 observers .

kuwait furnished two - thirds of unikom's $51 million annual budget .

the united states contributed about $4.5 million per year to unikom .

resolution 1490 set a date of october 6 , 2003 for the disbanding of unikom and the termination of the demilitarized zone .

however , contention remains over border pillars .

between 1991 and 1994 , 106 boundary pillars and 28 border markers were put in place .

the demarcation commission recommended annual inspections of the pillars and that iraq and kuwait share the maintenance costs .

the u.n. secretary - general proposed that maintenance be administered through a joint iraqi - kuwaiti trust fund .

the u.n. department of peacekeeping operations ( dpko ) took over maintenance of the pillars from unikom in march 2003 , with a january 15 , 2008 deadline for turnover to iraq and kuwait .

however , a small iraqi building which protruded into kuwait territory and road construction parallel to the pillars on the iraqi side delayed the transition .

the iraqi government has approved an alternative transition schedule of september 2009 , has removed the building , and has begun work on the road , but maintains that it has fulfilled its financial obligations towards the maintenance trust fund .

security council resolutions 686 and 687 required iraq to account for kuwaiti and other nationals detained in iraq during the persian gulf crisis .

after that 1991 war , 605 kuwaitis and other country nationals were missing .

after january 1995 , iraq and kuwait had met monthly on the iraq - kuwait border , along with u.s. , british , french , and saudi representatives , but iraq boycotted the meetings after operation desert fox .

in february 2000 , retired russian diplomat yuli vorontsov was appointed to a new post ( created by resolution 1284 ) of u.n. coordinator on the kuwait - related issues .

the saddam regime did not allow him to visit iraq , and the u.n. security council issued several statements of concern about the lack of progress .

on december 12 , 2002 , iraq invited vorontsov to visit , but no visit occurred .

in january 2003 , in an attempt to appear cooperative and thereby head off the u.s. invasion , saddam regime representatives held a few meetings with kuwait and saudi arabia on the issue , pledging to bring forward new information on the fate of the missing , but no outstanding cases were resolved .

resolution 1483 , adopted on may 22 , 2003 , just after the fall of saddam hussein , directed vorontsov to attempt to clear up the issue of missing kuwaitis and kuwait property .

u.n. security council resolutions 686 and 687 required iraq to return all property seized from kuwait , including the kuwaiti national archives .

in the first few years after the cease - fire , iraq returned some kuwaiti civilian and military equipment , including u.s. - made improved hawk air defense missiles , and u.n. reports and statements in june 2000 noted that iraq had returned "a substantial amount of property. .

however , in 1994 , u.s. officials accused iraq of returning to kuwait some captured iranian equipment that was never part of kuwait's arsenal and of using kuwaiti missiles and armored personnel carriers during iraq's october 1994 troop move toward the kuwait border .

the united nations and kuwait said saddam hussein's iraq did not return extensive kuwaiti state archives and museum pieces , as well as military equipment including eight mirage f - 1 aircraft , 245 russian - made fighting vehicles , 90 m113 armored personnel carriers , one hawk battery , 3,750 tow anti - tank missiles , and 675 russian - made surface - to - air missile batteries .

iraq claimed the materiel was left behind or destroyed when iraq evacuated kuwait .

in july 2002 , an agreement was reached on a "mechanism" for iraq to return kuwait's state archives ( six truckloads of documents ) to kuwait .

saddam's regime began the return of tons of documents on october 20 , 2002 , although kuwait said key archives were not returned .

iraq returned some additional property in early february 2003 , in part to try to head off the u.s. invasion by appearing cooperative .

in july 2004 , iraq and kuwait restored diplomatic relations during a visit to kuwait by interim iraqi prime minister iyad al - allawi .

kuwait has since appointed an ambassador in iraq .

through a humanitarian operations center , kuwait has provided substantial humanitarian aid to iraqis , primarily in the shiite south , as part of the reconciliation process and as an attempt by kuwait to promote stability in iraq .

on april 24 , 2008 , ambassador gennady tarasov of the russian federation replaced yuli vorontsov as high - level coordinator .

after five years of u.s. and icrc - led searching , there remain 369 missing kuwaiti and third - country nationals ( out of a total of 605 ) .

they were mostly found in graves just north of kuwait's border with iraq .

since april 2008 , only one additional person had been identified ( bringing the total number of remains identified to 236 ) .

to close the files of the 369 missing persons , the remains would need to be found , exhumed , transported , and identified .

this task will be difficult considering that 20 years have passed and the iraqi ministry of human rights responsible for the job lacks sufficient capacity .

kuwaiti teams have been unable to carry out exhumation work at burial sites in iraq due to the unsafe security situation .

on the case of missing ( 1991 ) gulf war u.s. navy pilot michael speicher , u.s. investigators reportedly have determined that he is dead , but his remains have not been found to date .

the kuwaiti national archives are still missing and no credible information on their whereabouts exists .

a january 21 , 2009 request from tarasov to 12 governments and the secretaries general of the gcc , league of arab states , and oic provided no information .

in april 2009 , the security council indicated limited progress on human remains and the return of kuwaiti property , but welcomed the return by the iraqi government of audio and video tape recordings of the kuwaiti ministry of information and positive efforts on the return of kuwaiti airways spare parts .

the security council also welcomed positive intentions from iraq and kuwait regarding confidence - building measures and extended the funding for the high - level coordinator for another six months .

the iraq - kuwait issue remains a sensitive once for the security council .

reparation payments are another legacy of the former regime resulting from the 1991 gulf war – and perhaps at the heart of iraqi initiatives to end the chapter 7 process .

after that war , the u.n. security council set up a mechanism for compensating the victims of iraq's invasion of kuwait ( individuals , governments , and corporations ) , using 25% ( reduced from 30% in december 2000 ) of the proceeds from iraqi oil sales .

that figure was reduced to 5% of iraq's revenues by resolution 1483 of may 22 , 2003 .

at current rates of oil exports and at current prices , about $800 million was deducted from iraqi oil earnings in the first half of 2009 to fund the reparations process .

this is a substantial sum of money that iraq says is needed to continue to improve security and recover from nearly 30 years of constant warfare .

in its seventeen years of operations to date , the u.n .

compensation commission ( uncc ) awarded approximately $52.4 billion as compensation .

as of july 2009 approximately $27.6 billion worth of compensation payments had been paid and $24.8 billion in unpaid awards remained .

that is approximately the amount that kuwait says its firms are still owed from uncc awards made to date .

awards to u.s. claimants thus far total over $700 million , of which $552 million has been paid .

of the amounts awarded , over $600 million has been to u.s. companies and $13 million to the u.s. government f or damage to the u.s. embassy in kuwait and other claims .

the iraqi foreign minister indicated in march 2009 that the iraqi position on compensation is to annul all remaining claims ( and end the 5% revenue deductions ) because iraq has paid a high proportion of the compensation claims during the years between the second gulf war and present day .

kuwait has adamantly opposed ending the process .

iraq subsequently has floated compromise proposals to reduce the deduction to 2.5% or even 1% to continue the reparations process but at a slower pace , but kuwait has not agreed , to date .

while council members are sympathetic to kuwait's position on the matter , the uncc governing council in 2004 and 2006 recommended the need for a principled phase - out strategy .

the uncc's main ongoing activities include paying out successful claims and overseeing the follow - up programme for environmental awards ( established in december 2005 to monitor the technical and financial implementation of $4.3 billion in environmental remediation and restoration projects ) .

in january 2009 , $460 million was made available to two governments for distribution to twelve claimants ; and in april and july 2009 , a total of $730 million was given to the government of kuwait for distribution to ten claimants .

payments to individuals of all nationalities have been completed .

the next regular session of the governing council is scheduled for november , 2009 .

several legislative proposals ( "iraq claims act" ) to distribute iraq's frozen assets ( about $2.4 billion ) in the united states ( separate from the u.n. compensation process ) were not enacted , because of differences over categories of claimants that should receive priority .

on march 20 , 2003 , president bush issued an executive order for the u.s. government to confiscate approximately $2.4 billion in frozen iraqi assets , for use in post - war reconstruction .

 ( see crs report 98-240 , iraq: compensation and assets issues ( pdf ) . ) .

resolution 1483 ( 2003 ) formally ended the u.n. embargo on trade with iraq that was set up in resolution 661 .

however , iraq's funds remained somewhat encumbered .

resolution 1483 directed that all export sales of petroleum , petroleum products , and natural gas be deposited ( net of the 5% deduction for compensation , discussed above ) into a development fund for iraq ( dfi ) until an internationally - recognized , representative government is constituted .

it also directed that all assets of the previous regime be frozen and transferred into the fund .

resolution 1483 directed that the dfi be audited by an international advisory and monitoring board ( iamb ) .

these processes were reaffirmed by resolution 1546 .

successive resolutions , most recently resolution 1859 ( december 22 , 2008 ) , extended the depositing and iamb monitoring arrangements until the end of 2009 .

although the u.n. "sanctions committee" ( or "661 committee" ) that oversaw implementation of saddam - era u.n. sanctions was abolished by resolution 1483 , resolution 1518 ( november 24 , 2003 ) established a "1518 committee" to take over the 661 committee's work to identify individuals with funds , assets , or economic resources belonging to the saddam hussein regime in order to transfer these resources to the dfi .

the iraqi government has also , in accordance with resolution 1483 , closed out the saddam - era "oil for food program. .

during the 1990s , as international concerns for the plight of the iraqi people grew , the united states had increasing difficulty maintaining support for international sanctions .

the oil - for - food program , established by resolution 986 ( april 15 , 1995 ) and in operation since december 1996 , was progressively modified to improve iraq's living standards , and the united states eased its own sanctions to align them with the program .

the operations of the program ended november 22 , 2003 , as mandated by resolution 1483 , but resolution 1546 ( 2004 ) empowered the iraqi government to wind down residual contracts under the program .

 ( see crs report rl30472 , iraq: oil - for - food program , illicit trade , and investigations . ) .

several u.n. resolutions assign a role for the united nations in post - saddam reconstruction and governance .

resolution 1483 ( cited above ) provided for a u.n. special representative to iraq , and "called on" governments to contribute forces for stabilization .

resolution 1500 ( august 14 , 2003 ) established u.n. assistance mission for iraq ( unami ) , the mandate of which has been regularly extended since .

iraqi leaders do not criticize unami's humanitarian coordinating and other work , per se .

however , unami represents the continuing u.n. role in iraq and many of the most nationalistic iraqi factions believe that iraq can and should manage all of its own affairs without u.n. interference .

from the end of the 1991 war until the 2003 war , u.s. military deployments in the gulf region , approximately 20,000 personnel , focused on containing iraq .

numbers of personnel sometimes increased at times of crisis with saddam's regime primarily over u.n. wmd inspections .

the united states and britain enforced two "no fly zones" to protect iraq's kurdish minority ( operation northern watch , onw ) and its shiite population ( operation southern watch , osw ) , as well as to monitor iraqi forces .

france was originally a part of the enforcement operations but dropped out in 1997 and 1998 due to opposition to what it considered an overly punitive policy toward saddam hussein's regime .

onw , established in april 1991 , extended north of the 36 th parallel .

turkey provided basing rights at incirlik air base for the 24 american aircraft and about 1,300 u.s. forces ( plus allied forces ) that policed the northern zone .

however , turkey feared that onw protected the anti - turkish kurdistan workers' party ( pkk ) , which takes refuge in parts of northern iraq , and turkey made repeated attacks against the pkk after may 1997 .

osw , established on august 26 , 1992 to protect the shiites , extended south of the 32 nd parallel .

the united states and the united kingdom expanded that zone to the 33 rd parallel on september 4 , 1996 , after baghdad's move into northern iraq .

to enforce the no - fly zones , the two allies invoked u.n .

resolution 678 ( november 29 , 1990 , authorizing use of force to expel iraq from kuwait ) , 687 ( the main ceasefire resolution ) , 688 ( human rights ) , the safwan accords ( the march 3 , 1991 cease - fire agreements between iraq and the coalition forces that banned iraqi interference with allied air operations ) , and p.l .

102 - 1 of january 12 , 1991 , the congressional resolution authorizing u.s. military action to expel iraq from kuwait after its 1990 invasion .

resolutions 678 and 687 were written under chapter vii of the u.n. charter ( peace and security issues ) — interpreted as allowing military action for enforcement .

resolution 688 was not written under chapter vii ; neither that or any other resolution specifically established no fly zones .

in response to iraq's movement of troops toward kuwait in october 1994 , security council resolution 949 ( october 15 , 1994 ) demanded iraq not deploy forces to threaten its neighbors .

the united states and britain interpreted this as authorizing military action if iraq enhanced ( numbers or quality of armament ) its forces below the 32 nd parallel , including any movement of air defense equipment into the zones .

the several years prior to the 2003 war were characterized by occasional u.s. strikes on iraqi military emplacements .

during march 2000-march 2001 , iraqi air defenses fired at or targeted allied aircraft enforcing both zones on 500 occasions , in many cases provoking u.s. strikes on the activated missile batteries .

on february 16 , 2001 , the united states and britain struck parts of that network north of the southern no fly zone , although the striking aircraft did not go beyond the zone .

during 2002 , iraqi air defenses and related infrastructure were bombed about 60 times in response to about 200 provocations .

during the run - up to the war , the target list was expanded to include systems , such as surface - to - surface missiles , that could be used against u.s. forces .

with saddam hussein's regime overthrown , u.s. officials said in mid - april 2003 that no fly zone enforcement had ended and many of the u.s. aircraft involved in those operations have now been redeployed .

the defense department announced in september 2003 that the united states has drawn down its personnel in saudi arabia , estimated at about 6,000 before the war , to the few hundred that were there prior to the 1990 invasion of kuwait .

those forces had been a source of some strain in light of the resentment of saudi citizens to the presence of non - muslim forces in the kingdom .

many of those forces were redeployed to a new u.s. air command center in qatar .

for more information on the u.s. military posture in the gulf , see crs report rl31533 , the persian gulf states: issues for u.s. policy , 2006 .

in the post - saddam period , u.s. military teams secured iraq's conventional military infrastructure , including an estimated 130 ammunition storage sites in iraq , some of which exceeded 50 square miles in size and hold more than 600,000 tons of artillery shells , rockets , bombs , and other explosive ordnance .

some of these sites were not secured immediately after the regime fell and some remain unsecure , leading to speculation that the iraqi resistance obtains its explosives from these sites .

there is also uncertainty as to the location , and even the total number , of all such storage sites .

in anbar province , which contains the restive sunni muslim cities of fallujah and ramadi , there are 103 known former regime ammunition storage sites , of which 35 have been declared completely clear of both unexploded munitions and captured ammunition , as of july 2004 .

u.s. forces reportedly did not locate a large number of shoulder - fired anti - aircraft missiles once part of saddam hussein's arsenals .

u.s. forces did locate a number of combat aircraft buried under sand dunes by the former regime prior to the war ; it is not known whether they might be made operational for a future iraqi air force .

another unresolved issue is that of 22 combat aircraft iraq flew to iran at the beginning of the 1991 gulf war , to protect them from u.s. air strikes in that war .

iraq's interim government is demanding that iran return the planes .

as of july 2009 , there are about 125,000 u.s. troops in iraq helping iraq maintain security , in accordance with the u.s. - iraq security agreement .

virtually all non - u.s. forces have departed iraq .

under the obama administration withdrawal plan announced february 2009 , there are to be only about 35,000-50,000 u.s. forces in iraq by august 2010 , in advisory and support roles , and all u.s. troops are to leave by the end of 2011 .

however , there are concerns in u.s. command circles that iraqi forces might still need advice and mentoring , as well as combat air support , after that time , according to numerous news accounts and public statements of u.s. and iraqi officials .

from the end of the 1991 gulf war until the start of the 2003 war , the defense department incurred about $12 billion in costs to contain iraq and provide humanitarian aid to the kurds .

about $1.2 billion was spent in fy2002 .

the department of defense assisted unscom by providing u - 2 surveillance flights , intelligence , personnel , equipment , and logistical support , at a cost of about $15 million per year .
