as of march 26 , 2007 , a total of 25,320 military personnel had been classified as wounded in action ( wia ) in operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) and operation enduring freedom ( oef ) .

of these , 13,870 ( 54.8% ) were treated locally and returned to their military duties within 72 hours .

the remaining 11,450 ( 45.2% ) required longer treatment in the area of conflict or were evacuated to regional military hospital facilities in kuwait , spain , or germany .

if treatment , recovery and rehabilitation required more than 30 days , the wounded soldiers were further evacuated to the united states , initially to the army's walter reed medical center , the national naval medical center , or to brooke army medical center .

when operating in a combat environment and a service member is seriously injured or wounded , immediate life - saving care is provided by medically trained individuals assigned to the unit ( not physicians ) to stabilize and evacuate the casualty to a forward surgical team ( fst ) .

these fsts , each with four surgeons , have been deployed further forward than in past conflicts in order to directly support combat forces and to provide emergency surgical intervention and evacuation to a combat support hospital ( csh ) .

two cshs with four sites now exist in iraq .

these are 248-bed hospitals with six operating tables , some specialty surgery services , and radiology and laboratory facilities .

after three days at a csh , patients may be evacuated to one of three regional military hospitals in kuwait , spain , or germany .

those requiring more than 30 days of treatment will be initially evacuated to major medical centers in the united states .

typically , seriously injured military personnel are evacuated to the army's walter reed medical center in washington , dc , the national naval medical center in bethesda , md , or to brooke army medical center in san antonio , tx , which specializes in burn treatment .

these centers offer a full range of medical specialization , follow - on surgery , and rehabilitative support programs .

upon arrival in the united states , the recently established service programs to support the traumatically injured and severely disabled begin to assist .

the department of defense ( dod ) established the military severely injured ( msi ) center on february 1 , 2005 .

the center , located in arlington , va , operates under the direction of dod's office of military community and family policy and is intended to augment , not oversee , the service specific programs that are described below .

although the center will attempt to provide some degree of assistance to any severely injured service member who contacts them , the primary focus is on those returning from oef and oif with brain injuries , paralysis , amputation , severe burns or blindness .

the msi center is available 24 hours a day , 7 days a week for service members and their families .

it provides a "safety net" for information referral and tracking , advocacy for financial problems , education and training , job placement , accommodations , and personal / family counseling .

the center is currently staffed with approximately 10 "care managers" who are registered nurses , licensed clinical social workers , or other master's level health care specialists , all with experience in issues relating to disabled personnel .

this core staff is augmented with representatives from the military services , veterans administration , department of labor and the transportation security administration .

an additional 19 "counselor - advocates" are available regionally at or near military medical treatment facilities and military installations to provide local support by helping connect families to resources in the hospital or the surrounding community .

it is anticipated that final staffing will include 16 case managers and nearly 40 counselor - advocates with a ratio of one staff member per 30 disabled service members .

the center staff is currently working with nearly 1,200 service members and their families .

the msi center has established an employment career center online at http: / / www.military.com / support to provide customized job counseling that will lead to education , training , or job placement for service members and their family members .

the msi center has also hosted job fairs under the "hire a hero" program .

additionally , the center has established a "heroes to hometowns" program to advise local communities on reintegrating disabled service members into their hometowns .

the military severely injured center can be contacted ( 24 hours a day / 7 days a week ) at 1-888-774-1361 and maintains a website at http: / / www.militaryhomefront.dod.mil / troops / injuredsupport .

on april 30 , 2004 , the army , at the direction of the acting secretary of the army , introduced the disabled soldier support system , colloquially called "ds3" and later renamed it the u.s. army wounded warrior or aw2 , to serve as a program advocate for severely disabled soldiers and their families .

aw2 is available to all active and reserve component soldiers who have been classified as a special category as a result of war - related injuries or illness incurred after september 10 , 2001 , and who have been awarded an army disability rating of 30% or greater .

the aw2 program office in alexandria , va , is staffed by specialists who each support up to 30 soldiers , advocating their interests within the army and with local , state , and other federal agencies and organizations .

these advocates include several regional aw2 coordinators having expert knowledge of benefits , potential problem areas ( pay , promotion , family travel ) , the medical evaluation board ( meb ) and physical evaluation board ( peb ) processes as well as of necessary contacts in the department of veterans affairs , the department of labor and veteran's service organizations .

aw2 also provides transition assistance through the army career and alumni program , to include options for continuation on active duty .

aw2 is designed to track , monitor , and support soldiers and their families for at least five years following medical retirement .

there are currently 748 soldiers enrolled in this program .

the aw2 office can be contacted at 1-800-833-6622 ( 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , monday through friday ) or via e - mail at [ [email address scrubbed] ] .

in addition , the army has established a wounded soldier and family hotline at 1-800-984-8523 which is available from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. , monday through friday .

the marine for life program began several years ago with an original focus on transition assistance for retiring and separating marines .

the additional requirement to support traumatically injured and disabled marines was directed by the commandant of the marine corps in late 2004 .

as a result , the m4l - is program was established in early 2005 and located in quantico , va .

it is currently staffed with mobilized marine corps reserve personnel .

as the program matures , staffing will include approximately 28 active duty marines and several civilian employees .

the program staff , similar to the other service programs , is responsible for coordinating and facilitating the full range of benefits , support , and transition assistance for marines and their families .

to date , the m4l - is office has contacted over 1,000 previously separated or medically retired marines and is providing ongoing support to over 300 of them .

the m4l - is staff also makes frequent visits to the walter reed medical center in washington , dc , and the national naval medical center in bethesda , md .

these visits have extended support to over 600 wounded or injured marines and follow - on support to over 200 is continuing .

m4l - is is augmented by a telephone hotline and regional outreach support that is provided by the military severely injured ( msi ) center .

the marine for life - injured support office can be contacted at 1-866-645-8762 ( 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , monday through friday ) and maintains a website at https: / / www.m4l.usmc.mil .

the air force's palace hart ( helping airmen recover together ) program is an extension of an existing program to include support and advocacy for those returning from oef / oif with traumatic injures or severe illnesses .

the air force uses family liaison officers ( flo ) , generally active duty airmen in medical treatment facilities or u.s. - based squadrons , for initial contact and support .

these flos receive "just in time" training on processes , procedures , and support methodology .

as the disabled airmen continue to progress medically , they are assigned to a case management team that will guide them through the meb / peb process .

if medically retired or separated , follow - on services will be provided by the air force personnel center at randolf afb , tx .

the center tracks the service members for a minimum of five years via twice monthly phone calls .

the air force program emphasizes retention on active duty .

as of march 2005 , 172 airmen had been wounded in action: 165 of them have been returned to active duty ; two were placed on the temporary disability retired list ( tdrl ) , and five were receiving ongoing medical care .

for program support , injured airmen or their families should call 1-800-616-3775 ( 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , monday through friday ) or contact the military severely injured center at 1-888-774-1361 ( 24 hours a day / 7 days a week ) .

there is currently no website dedicated to this program .

the navy's safe harbor ( sailors and families are extended a hand and assisted in recovery , benefits , opportunity and readjustment ) program was officially started in august 2005 at the navy annex , washington , dc .

the program provides one - on - one support and advocacy for disabled sailors , marines , and their family members .

a database has been established of more than 160 personnel who have been medically separated or retired since the start of oif / oef .

to date , nearly all have been contacted and offered assistance ; additional support is ongoing for nearly 30 of these .

the program is closely coordinated with the national naval medical center in bethesda , md , and with the casualty assistance officers .

safe harbor can be contacted at [phone number scrubbed] ( 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , monday through friday ) or through the military severely injured center at 1-888-774-1361 ( 24 hours a day / 7 days a week ) .

there is currently no website dedicated to this program .

dod and individual military service support programs provide a focal point for disabled service members and their families to resolve pay and promotion problems ; receive assistance through the medical evaluation and retirement process ; and aid in the seamless transition to the department of veterans affairs .

the fy2006 national defense authorization act further requires dod to prescribe comprehensive policies and procedures for these programs that will be uniform across the services to the extent practicable .

although each program appears successful , there may be some aspects of these programs that could benefit from further refinement .

these support programs appear to be a reflection of the genuine concern by civilian and military leaders who place high priority on caring for wounded military personnel .

however , these programs were established independently , by different authorities , and at different times during 2004 and 2005 .

there is no dod - coordinated directive or instruction that established complementary service roles , delineated responsibilities , set eligibility criteria , or mandated standardized metrics for program evaluation .

this lack of coordinated guidance could result in inefficient or inequitable care among the various services .

dod and each of the services established their own program eligibility criteria so there is little consistency across the programs .

for example , dod's msi program will assist anyone who contacts them , while the army is relatively rigid and requires participants to be classified as "special category" and hold a 30% army disability rating to be eligible .

a potential duplication of effort also exists because the dod program will assist any service member , while the other programs are service - specific .

standardized program metrics to measure effectiveness have not been established across all programs , but there has been an effort to establish databases .

this may make it difficult to identify strengths , weaknesses , and potential new directions as these programs mature and become permanent .

the fy2006 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) requires the secretary of defense , by june 1 , 2006 , to prescribe a comprehensive policy on the provision of assistance to members of the armed forces who incur severe wounds or injuries in the line of duty .

to the extent practicable , these procedures and standards should be uniform across the services and integrated into service regulations by september 1 , 2006 .

while not required by the ndaa , dod might report to congress on its efforts to implement this legislation .

 ( at the time this report was updated , dod had not finalized the submitted the required comprehensive policy. ) .
