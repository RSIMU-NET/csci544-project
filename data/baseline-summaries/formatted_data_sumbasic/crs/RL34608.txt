historically , the value of tax benefits for charitable contributions and organizations was estimated to be around $100 billion per year .

this figure fell in recent years due to the economic recession and slow recovery .

although revisions to the treatment of charitable contributions and tax - exempt organizations that receive these contributions have been made in recent years , a number of issues remain unresolved .

a number of provisions related to charitable contributions have been enacted on a temporary basis as part of the "tax extenders," including an individual retirement account ( ira ) rollover , liberalized treatment of certain gifts of inventory , and some other provisions .

the tax relief , unemployment reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) extended these provisions through 2011 .

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 ) extended most , but not all , of these provisions through 2013 .

the future of various charitable tax provisions beyond 2013 is uncertain .

this report also addresses a number of current policy issues relevant for various types of charitable organizations .

issues relating to donor - advised funds and supporting organizations , such as distribution requirements , remain relevant .

similar concerns about whether funds were being paid out at a high enough rate have also been directed at university and college endowments , where a combination of high returns and relatively low payout rates has led to rapid growth .

issues have also been raised about whether nonprofit hospitals provide enough charity care .

the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ; p.l .

111-148 ) attempted to address some of these concerns by imposing new requirements on nonprofit hospitals while requiring the secretary of the treasury in conjunction with the secretary of health and human services to report to congress on charity care provided by tax - exempt hospitals .

the president's budgets proposed limiting the value of itemized deductions ( which would include charitable contributions ) to 28% of each dollar .

the final report of the fiscal commission also recommended limiting the value of tax benefits associated with charitable contributions .

a number of other proposals for caps or floors have also been made as a part of tax reform .

in addition to addressing the issues mentioned above , this report discusses the current tax benefits for tax - exempt and charitable organizations , reviews legislative changes that have taken place in recent years , and discusses potential future legislative issues .

it focuses on deductions for charitable contributions , and on institutions that are generally eligible for deductible charitable contributions , such as social welfare organizations , educational institutions , nonprofit hospitals , and churches , along with conduits to those institutions such as private foundations , donor - advised funds , and supporting organizations .

the tax system provides a series of benefits for tax - exempt and charitable organizations .

the most widely estimated and discussed is the deduction for charitable contributions , which is estimated in fy2014 to reduce federal revenue by $46.4 billion .

this amount has declined compared with previous projects when most of the 2001 tax rates were made permanent .

another important benefit is the exemption of earnings on assets from the income tax .

as discussed below , although this benefit is difficult to estimate , it appears to be as large , and historically has been in the neighborhood of $50 billion per year .

for universities and colleges , these benefits are several times as large as the savings by donors from deducting charitable contributions .

the value , however , fell temporarily given the reduction in earnings yields during the recent economic slowdown , had largely recovered , but fell again in 2012 .

although numerous legislative proposals have been introduced since 2001 directly relevant to the charitable sector , few of these proposals have become public law .

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-24 ) was the latest to continue most of the charitable extenders ( through 2013 ) .

the 111 th congress extended through 2021 these charitable provisions that had been allowed to expire as part of the extenders package in the tax relief , unemployment reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-312 ) .

the charitable extenders , which had been allowed to expire at the end of 2009 , had last been extended by the 110 th congress as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l .

110-343 ) .

the 111 th congress also enacted legislation to accelerate tax deductions for charitable contributions made to haiti's earthquake victims .

the 109 th congress enacted a number of pieces of legislation with provisions to promote charitable giving .

much of this legislation was aimed at disaster relief .

the pension protection act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-280 ) contained a number of provisions that restricted charitable giving , including new reporting requirements for tax - exempt organizations ; new requirements on donor - advised funds , supporting organizations , and credit counseling organizations ; and enhanced incentives for charitable giving , such as the tax - free distributions from ira accounts for charitable purposes .

this section summarizes the tax proposals liberalizing charitable contributions and briefly reviews the issues in most cases .

it is followed by a section summarizing the tax proposals restricting charitable contributions and organizations .

each proposal considered in this section is identified as not adopted , temporary ( adopted as a temporary provision without expectation of extension ) , extender ( adopted with an expiration date as part of the extenders proposals ) , or permanent .

note that further details of provisions enacted are contained in the joint tax committee's "blue books," that summarize legislation .

congress has considered many provisions in recent years aimed at preventing potential abuse , with many problematic areas identified by the internal revenue service .

the senate finance committee has investigated many compliance issues .

in 2004 and 2005 , the senate finance committee held hearings on the subject .

also , early in 2005 , the joint committee on taxation published a study on options to improve tax compliance that included a number of provisions relating to charitable contributions and tax - exempt organizations .

the concerns expressed in these hearings and studies focused on potential abuses of charitable organizations , on the valuation of gifts of property , and on certain types of organizations , including donor - advised funds and supporting organizations .

these two types of organizations , like private foundations , permit contributions to build up an account without necessarily making a contribution .

private foundations , however , are subject to a 5% payout requirement and a number of special restrictions to prevent funds from being used for the benefit of the donor .

donor - advised funds are funds where the donor contributes to an account in an institution and the institution subsequently makes contributions , advised by the donor .

supporting organizations do not have a direct charitable purpose , but support organizations that do .

more broad ranging proposals to make the charitable contributions deduction more effective and less subject to claims of small undocumented deductions would have introduced a floor .

earlier proposals associated with expansions of the deductions to non - itemizers proposed dollar floors , but these proposals tended to focus on floors as a percent of income .

as noted above , the deficit commission's proposal would create a charitable credit available to all taxpayers , subject to a floor of 2% of income .

the 2005 president's advisory panel on tax reform proposed a floor equal to 1% of income .

the congressional budget office included a budget option for a floor of 2% .

some changes were enacted in 2003 and 2004 , but most of the restrictive provisions that were adjusted were part of the pension protection act of 2006 .

there are a number of tax issues regarding charitable deductions and tax - exempt organizations that may be of interest in the 113 th congress .

the charitable extenders discussed above are set to expire at the end of 2013 .

the president's fiscal commission suggested modifying the charitable deduction as part of comprehensive tax reform to address the deficit and fiscal sustainability .

president's obama's budgets have proposed to limit the value of itemized deductions , including charitable contributions , to 28% .

limits on itemized deductions may be considered as part of income tax reforms .

in addition , there has been interest , as indicated by hearings and by activities of the senate finance committee in the tax - exempt status of nonprofit hospitals and in university endowments .

the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ; p.l .

111-148 ) imposed a number of new requirements on 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - exempt hospitals .

the finance committee has also shown interest in specific tax - exempt organizations , such as media related ministries .

provisions enacted under the pension protection act continue to raise issues of interest to the tax - exempt sector .

the findings of treasury studies on donor - advised funds and supporting organizations may have broader implications for the charitable sector generally .

in 2010 , a number of small tax - exempt organizations had their tax - exempt status revoked after failing to meet information reporting requirements enacted as part of the pension protection act .

these issues are discussed in greater detail in the sections below .

 table 1 reports the expected revenue cost of extending each of the charitable provisions contained in the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 ) there are two issues associated with these charitable benefits "extenders": whether they are effective or appropriate provisions , and , if so , whether they should be temporary when most of the provisions of the tax code are permanent .

the specific issues associated with each of these provisions were discussed earlier .

one criticism that could be made of using temporary provisions for charitable purposes is that although the budgetary cost is smaller for a provision extended only a year at a time , the intention is to continue the provision .

this practice causes the official projected budget deficits to be smaller than they will likely be , takes up the time of the congress with considering the extenders , and creates some uncertainty for taxpayers .

on the other hand , an argument that could be made in favor of temporary provisions is that a temporary provision makes reconsideration of the merits and design of the provisions more likely .

evidence suggests , however , that relatively few temporary provisions have been revised .

one exception is the r&d tax credit , which has been the subject of some major revisions .

nevertheless , it could be argued that the temporary nature of these provisions is conducive to better tax policy because provisions are reconsidered even though they are rarely revised .

various proposals have been put forth that would limit the tax benefits associated with charitable contributions .

the fiscal commission recommended replacing the charitable deduction with a 12% nonrefundable tax credit , available only for contributions above 2% of income .

president obama's budgets have proposed limiting the value of itemized deductions ( which would include charitable contributions ) to 28% of each dollar .

thus , under the proposal , taxpayers in the top brackets ( 33% , 35% , and 39.6% ) would have each dollar of deductions reduced by 28 cents on the dollar rather than a reduction based on their marginal tax rate ( for example , 33 cents ) .

although there has been concern expressed about the effect on charitable giving , especially during difficult economic times , the provision would not affect giving today if it does not go into effect immediately .

in fact , enactment today of a future change would be expected to increase contributions as taxpayers seek to make contributions before the cap is imposed .

estimates of permanent effects on charitable giving from the 28% limitation suggest the effects would be relatively small , generally around 1% .

the itemized deduction cap overall was projected to raise $584 billion over 10 years ( fy2013-fy2022 ) .

this estimate assumed that 33% would rise to 36% and the 35% tax rate would rise to 39.6% whereas the permanent rates adopted in the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l .

112-240 ) only changed part of the 35% rate to 39.6% , so the gain would be smaller .

internal revenue service statistics suggest that charitable contributions account for about a quarter of itemized deductions at higher income levels .

other potential limits on total itemized deductions or other tax expenditures that could become a part of tax reform , such as a dollar cap or a percentage of income cap .

in general , if the desire is to encourage charitable contributions , a floor would retain much of the incentive effect while a cap would eliminate it .

the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ; p.l .

111-148 ) imposed a number of new requirements on 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - exempt hospitals .

prior to the enactment of ppaca , the tax writing committees , and especially senator grassley , had shown interest in nonprofit hospitals .

a major concern was the degree of charity care and whether nonprofit hospitals are providing benefits that justify their charitable and tax - exempt status .

the congressional budget office released a study in 2006 that found that nonprofit hospitals overall provided only slightly more charity care than for profit hospitals .

the senate finance committee held hearings on the topic "taking the pulse of charitable care and community benefits at non - profit hospitals," on september 13 , 2006 , and the house ways and means committee held hearings on "the tax exempt hospital sector," on may 26 , 2005 .

in a staff discussion draft released july 18 , 2007 , by senator grassley , the following concerns were raised about nonprofit hospitals: establishing and publicizing charity care , the amount of charity care and community benefits provided , conversion of nonprofit assets for use by for - profits , ensuring an exempt purpose for joint ventures with for - profits , governance , and billing and collection practices .

subsequently , on october 24 , 2007 , senator grassley authorized a round - table to discuss the draft .

also in july 2007 , the irs released an interim report on nonprofit hospitals , where they found that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9% and almost half of hospitals spent 3% or less .

the average was 7.4% .

under ppaca , tax - exempt hospitals are subject to four new requirements .

first , hospitals will be required to conduct a "community health needs assessment" and adopt an implementation strategy to meet those needs .

second , hospitals are required to written financial assistance and emergency care policies .

third , hospitals may not charge individuals eligible under the financial assistance policy more than the lowest amount charged to those with insurance coverage .

finally , hospitals are required to make reasonable efforts to determine if an individual is eligible for financial assistance before beginning extraordinary collections actions .

ppaca also requires the treasury secretary to review the community benefit activities of tax - exempt hospitals .

additionally , the treasury secretary , in consultation with the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) will be required to report annually to congress information on charity care , bad debt expenses , unreimbursed costs for services , and community benefit activities .

universities and colleges are classified as charitable organizations eligible to receive deductible contributions , and , also , as tax - exempt entities , do not pay tax on their investments .

as indicated above , prior to the financial crises and subsequent recession , the benefit of exempting endowment income of colleges and universities from taxes was estimated at around $25 billion .

at $25 billion , this exemption was worth more than three times the benefit of charitable deductions to all educational institutions .

historically , these high yields were coupled with relatively low payout rates .

for the fiscal year that ended june 2007 , endowments were $411 billion and the average rate of return was 21.5% .

the payout rate was 4.6% .

as a result of those relationships along with contributions , endowments grew 18.4% between fy2006 and fy2007 ( about thee and a half times the growth rate of the economy ) , continuing an ongoing trend from recent years .

the losses in college and university endowment funds experienced during the recession have raised new issues of concern .

in fy2009 , losses were 18.7% on average .

prior to the onset of the recession , senator grassley , ranking member of the finance committee , discussed concern that colleges were not using enough of their endowments funds to provide an affordable education .

tuition rates remain an issue of interest .

in 2010 , following the release of data on college and university endowment losses , senator grassley noted: i hope colleges won't rely on double - digit losses as a reason to raise tuition or freeze student aid .

many of them relied on some risky investments , like hedge funds , to get big gains in recent years , and now those strategies are causing losses .

… pay - out rates over the last decade rarely topped 5 percent , even when investment returns were in double digits .

the two basic issues associated with donor - advised funds and supporting organizations were possibilities of receiving private benefit by donors and payout rates .

as noted above , while some changes were enacted , others remain possible .

although payout requirements are planned ( administratively ) for type iii supporting organizations , there are no payout requirements for donor - advised funds and for other supporting organizations .

these issues might be revisited when treasury completes its studies .

the treasury was directed to study specific issues: whether deductions for contributions to donor - advised funds and supporting organizations are appropriate given the use of the assets or benefits to the donor , whether donor - advised funds should have a distribution requirement , whether the retention of rights by donors means that the gift is not completed , and whether these issues apply to other charities or charitable donors .

this treasury study provided considerable data but it is not clear what policy implications should be .

a crs report that reviewed the study and updated the data in the case of donor - advised funds indicated that aggregate payout requirements for the overall fund would not have much effect , and that an effective payout requirement would need to be applied to each individual account .

it also suggested , although the data are limited , that many accounts do not pay out contributions .

the pension protection act of 2006 implemented new reporting requirements for tax - exempt organizations with revenues of less than $25,000 .

entities failing to file required information returns ( form 990-n , also known as the e - postcard ) with the irs for three consecutive years will have their tax - exempt status revoked .

thus , revocations took place for the first time in 2010 .

there are more than 714,000 tax - exempt organizations registered with the irs that would be subject to new reporting requirements .

as of july 2010 , 41% of these organizations had yet to file .

there are various reasons why registered tax - exempt organizations may not file the required information returns .

some of these organizations may no longer exist .

the required filings will help the irs determine which organizations remain active .

on the other hand , active organizations may not file if they are not aware of the new filing requirements .

the irs extended the filing deadline to october 15 , 2010 to give charities that would have been required to file earlier in the year more time to comply with this new law .

further , the irs has posted a list of organizations in danger of losing their tax - exempt status on their website .

over a period of time the senate finance committee has examined specific charitable organizations or groups as well as specific charitable donation practices .

some of these investigations were spurred by media reports and some by irs studies ; they have led to both legislation and self - correction by entities involved .

in 2007 , senator grassley sent inquiries to several media - based ministries for information on their finances .

religious organizations do not have to file the information ( 990 ) forms that other tax - exempt organizations have to file , so generally it is difficult to obtain information on the activities of these tax - exempt entities .

the results of this inquiry were announced on january 6 , 2011 .

while not all ministries provided the requested information , enough information was gathered for senator grassley to determine that internal reforms were taking place .
