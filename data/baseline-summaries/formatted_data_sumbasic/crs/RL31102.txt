congress has authorized student loan repayments for highly qualified general schedule ( gs ) and non - gs ( including foreign service ) employees in the executive branch .

repayments also are authorized for employees in the house of representatives , the senate , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , the government accountability office ( gao ) , the government printing office ( gpo ) , the library of congress , and the u.s. capitol police .

in the executive branch , and in gao , gpo , and the library of congress , the repayments may be up to $10,000 annually and up to $60,000 in the aggregate .

in the legislative branch , the annual and aggregate limitations vary .

the house and senate each authorize repayments up to $500 a month , and $40,000 in the aggregate .

repayments to the u.s. capitol police may be up to $10,000 annually , and $40,000 in aggregate .

cbo's repayments may be up to $6,000 annually , and $40,000 in aggregate .

a service agreement of at least three years is required in the executive branch , while in the legislative branch , the service agreement varies from one to three years .

enactment of the executive branch statute followed a recommendation of the national commission on the public service ( commonly referred to as the volcker commission , after its chairman , paul volcker ) that a federal service loan forgiveness program be established for federal service .

in april 1989 , after an 18-month study , the commission issued its report on rebuilding the federal civil service .

formed in response to "concern[s] that the federal workforce may be ill - prepared to serve the nation in the 21 st century," the commission dedicated itself to "placing high on the national agenda the need to strengthen the effectiveness of the career services in government. .

a commission task force on recruitment and retention found that inadequate compensation and the unattractiveness of government employment to recent college graduates were among the reasons for the federal government's serious problems in recruiting and retaining a quality workforce .

at the time that student loan repayments were authorized by congress , the issues of the attractiveness of government service to and the large amount of student loan indebtedness of new graduates were of particular interest .

more recently , the possibility of a significant number of retirements from the federal government in the next several years has joined these issues as a reason underlying student loan repayment programs in the federal government .

authorization of repayments in the legislative branch resulted from similar concerns about these recruitment and retention issues .

the legislative history , statutory authority , status of executive and legislative branch implementation , issues for consideration , and oversight of student loan repayments are examined in the next sections of the report .

authority for the student loan repayment program is codified at 5 u.s.c .

§5379 .

the statute covers executive agencies , independent establishments , government corporations under 31 u.s.c .

chapter 91 , as well as gao , gpo , and the library of congress .

federal employees covered by the law are as follows: permanent employees ; temporary employees who are serving on appointments which can be converted to term or permanent appointments ; term employees with at least three years left on their appointments ; and employees serving on excepted appointments which can be converted to term , career , or career conditional appointments ( including , but not limited to , career intern or presidential management intern appointments ) .

schedule c appointees — employees in confidential , policy - determining , policy - making , or policy advocating positions — are not eligible for the repayments .

as amended by p.l .

108-123 and p.l .

108-136 , an employee may currently receive a repayment of up to $10,000 annually and $60,000 in the aggregate from an agency .

regulations to implement the current repayment amount were published in the federal register by opm on april 20 , 2004 .

agencies may use the student loan repayment benefit in conjunction with other recruitment and retention incentives available under title 5 of the united states code .

student loan repayments are not subject to the title 5 provision that limits the aggregate amount of pay an employee can receive to executive level i , or $183,500 ( as of january 2006 ) , but it is unlikely that this would ever be an issue of concern .

executive branch agencies have considerable flexibility to implement student loan repayment programs .

two sample student loan repayment plans have been published by opm as guidance to the agencies .

opm also includes a summary of agency best practices and lessons learned on its internet website .

among the best practices listed are developing an online application system , using standard application and justification forms , verifying loan information , confirming that lenders are properly crediting payments , and developing internal controls .

in may 2006 , opm submitted its report to congress on the fy2005 student loan repayments .

the opm document is based on reports from the individual agencies on their repayment programs .

 ( given that the individual agency reports are not publicly available , crs is unable to independently evaluate agency results. ) .

according to opm , 28 executive branch agencies made repayments to 4,171 employees at a total cost of $26,663,897 in fy2005 .

this compares with 26 executive branch agencies making repayments to 2,680 employees at a total cost of $15,028,432 in fy2004 .

from fy2004 to fy2005 , the number of recipients increased by 55.6% and the cost of repayments increased by 77.4% in the executive branch .

with the addition of the departments of commerce and homeland security in fy2005 , all 15 cabinet agencies have now implemented repayment programs .

the cabinet agencies made 3,504 repayments in fy2005 and the non - cabinet agencies made 667 repayments .

the average payment was $6,009 ( cabinet agencies ) and $8,405 ( non - cabinet agencies ) .

as shown in figures 1 and 2 , the number of employees receiving student loan repayments and the cost of the repayments in the executive branch have grown significantly .

for fy2001 , opm reported that one student loan repayment had been made ; the department of health and human services made a repayment of $6,000 for one employee .

in fy2002 , 15 executive branch agencies made repayments to 521 employees at a total cost of $2,561,328 and by fy2003 , 22 executive branch agencies made repayments to 1,802 employees at a total cost of $7,984,207 .

table a - 1 in the appendix provides data on repayments in executive and legislative branch agencies .

table a - 2 lists the number of recipients and the cost of repayments for each of the executive branch agencies for fy2002 , fy2003 , fy2004 , and fy2005 .

the top four agencies in terms of the number of employees receiving repayments in fy2005 were the department of justice ( 1,092 employees , up from 331 in fy2004 and 160 in fy2003 ) ; the department of defense ( 1,077 employees , up from 702 in fy2004 and 469 in fy2003 ) ; the department of state ( 809 employees , up from 734 in fy2004 and 660 in fy2003 ) ; and the securities and exchange commission ( 414 employees , up from 384 in fy2004 and 257 in fy2003 ) .

of the four agencies , the department of justice , at 230% , had the greatest increase in the number of recipients from fy2004 to fy2005 , followed by the departments of defense ( 53.4% ) and state ( 10.2% ) and the securities and exchange commission ( 7.8% ) .

other executive branch agencies with more than 50 employees receiving repayments in fy2005 were the department of housing and urban development ( 180 employees , up from 81 in fy2004 ) , the federal energy regulatory commission ( 87 employees , up from 78 in fy2004 ) , the department of veterans affairs ( 82 employees , up from 53 in fy2004 ) , and the department of health and human services ( 51 employees , down from 55 in fy2004 ) .

among these agencies , the departments of housing and urban development , at 122.2% , and veterans affairs , at 54.7% , had the greatest increase in the number of recipients from fy2004 to fy2005 .

eight agencies were repaying student loans for under 10 employees each .

the departments of justice , defense , and state , and the securities and exchange commission also are the top four agencies in terms of the cost of repayments .

for fy2005 , these costs ( rounded ) were $10.064 million ( justice ) , $4.818 million ( defense ) , $3.860 million ( state ) , and $3.690 million ( securities and exchange commission ) .

from fy2004 to fy2005 , the cost of repayments increased 424.3% at justice , 56.5% at defense , 6.9% at state , and 12% at the securities and exchange commission .

according to opm , some 21% of recipients work as attorneys or criminal investigators .

the opm report also provides information on the occupations of the recipients at the agencies with the largest participation in the student loan repayment program as follows .

at the department of justice , the majority of repayments were provided to special agents ( 424 ) , intelligence analysts ( 182 ) , trial attorneys ( 84 ) , investigative specialists ( 83 ) , and support service clerks / technicians ( 55 ) .

the special agents , intelligence analysts , and investigative specialists are among the 988 fbi employees receiving repayments .

fbi recipients represent 90.5% of the department's total of 1,092 recipients .

at the department of defense , employees in some 105 different occupations received repayments , but most of them were provided to mechanical engineers ( 135 ) , contract specialists ( 70 ) , nuclear engineers ( 69 ) , information technology specialists ( 65 ) , and electrical and electronics engineers ( 53 each ) .

at the department of state , 599 recipients were members of the foreign service ( up from 547 in fy2004 and 472 in fy2003 ) and 210 recipients were general schedule ( gs ) civil service employees ( up from 187 in fy2004 and 188 in fy2003 ) .

employees in some 44 different occupations received repayments , but the greatest number of recipients were in the foreign service positions of political affairs officer ( 121 ) , economics officer ( 104 ) , public diplomacy officer ( 97 ) , administrative management ( 79 ) , and consular officer ( 64 ) .

as for the gs positions , most of the recipients were in general management or passport / visa examiners ( 38 each ) and foreign affairs officers ( 34 ) .

at the securities and exchange commission , repayments were used primarily to recruit and retain attorney - advisers ( 242 ) , staff accountants ( 78 ) , and securities compliance examiners ( 48 ) .

approximately 77% of the repayments made by the sec were at the annual maximum amount of $10,000 .

of those executive branch agencies which have not made student loan repayments , five reported that they have established a repayment plan and seven said they are in the process of developing such a plan .

agencies not offering repayments reported that among their reasons for not doing so are that higher - graded specialist positions are typically filled with individuals whose student loan debts have been paid off , recruitment or retention is not problematic , and hiring targets can be met .

there is considerable interest in student loan repayment in the legislative branch , but no single policy for , or approach to , repayments currently applies evenly across the entire legislative branch .

the 1990 student loan repayment statute ( p.l .

101-510 ) provided authority to gao , gpo , and the library of congress to establish student loan repayment programs .

the fy2002 legislative branch appropriations act ( p.l .

107-68 , h.r .

2647 ) provided the senate and cbo with authority to establish student loan repayment programs .

the fy2002 department of defense appropriations act ( p.l .

107-117 , h.r .

3338 ) extended similar authority to the u.s. capitol police .

as noted earlier , the house tried unsuccessfully in the 107 th congress to establishment a repayment program for its employees .

a house bill ( h.r .

2555 ) , referred to two house committees , proposed that a student loan repayment program be authorized for the entire legislative branch .

no further action was taken on this bill .

early in the 108 th congress , however , congress passed legislation authorizing a program for house employees under p.l .

108-7 , the consolidated appropriations resolution , 2003 .

conferees to the fy2002 legislative branch appropriations bill directed the legislative branch financial managers council ( lbfmc ) to "develop , in consultation with all legislative branch entities the controls and criteria that will govern [student loan repayment] program implementation. .

the lbfmc was directed to perform a comparative analysis between entity implementing regulations and governing controls and criteria .

the lbfmc consulted with each legislative branch entity , completed a comparative analysis , and developed governing controls and criteria recommendations for the repayment programs in the legislative branch .

the lbfmc reported the results of the analysis and recommendations to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on the legislative branch on february 27 , 2002 .

these recommendations included guidelines for the purpose of the repayments ; designation of authorizing officials ; service agreement criteria and duration ; amount and size of repayments ; eligibility for repayments ; eligible loans ; repayment exceptions and waivers ; records and reports ; and review of the program .

the recommendations would provide for consistent application of the program , yet at the same time permit some flexibility .

for instance , the duration of the service agreement would necessarily be different for the house and the senate due to the congressional election cycles .

in general , the legislative branch agencies have modeled their programs on the recommended guidelines .

seeking to be competitive with other employers , congress and several legislative branch entities have established or continue to consider the loan repayment programs as a possible tool to recruit highly qualified and talented individuals , as part of benefits packages .

service agreements in the legislative branch agencies vary from one to three years .

for the house and senate , the requirement for a shorter service agreement than the executive branch ( one - year agreement ) is attributed to the impact that election cycles and possible changes in congress' majority / minority composition may have on the individual members' offices , committees , and administrative support offices .

table a - 1 includes data on repayment programs in the legislative branch for fy2004 .

the administrative office of the u.s. courts administers personnel policies for the judicial branch .

according to the office , consistent with judicial conference of the united states policy , statutory language was included in courts improvement legislation in the 108 th congress ( h.r .

1302 and s. 2396 ) that would have authorized judicial law clerks working full - time to defer payment of principal and interest on federally insured student loans for up to three years ( typically the term law clerks serve ) .

a similar legislative proposal was submitted to the 109 th  congress in march 2005 , but has not been introduced .

the authority is sought to enable federal judges to be more competitive with law firms in hiring new attorneys as clerks .

unlike executive branch agencies , the judiciary has not sought statutory authorization to use its appropriated funds to repay student loans as a recruitment or retention incentive for prospective or current employees .

agencies may consider several issues as they implement student loan repayment programs or determine whether the establishment of such programs is desirable or feasible .

among these issues are how the program will be funded , the length of the service agreement between the agency and the employee , the criteria for eligibility , and the kinds of program data to be collected .

each is discussed below .

in order to enhance the oversight of student loan repayment programs , opm may want to expand the information provided in its annual report to congress .

additional data that could be reported might include the following: the costs of administering such programs ; the number of individuals who leave government service after receiving repayments and completing the minimum required service period , the number of individuals who have been granted waivers from repaying the benefit if they do not fulfill the service agreement ( an agency head may waive the repayment for reasons of equity or public interest ) , and the attrition rates of employees both receiving and not receiving repayments .

other information that could be included in the opm report might be the composition as to sex and race of recipients , to determine whether the program is being administered in an equitable manner , and details on the written determination document that recipients sign to attest that they would leave federal service in the absence of the student loan repayment .

congress , opm , and the agencies themselves also may wish to examine whether the intent of congress that repayments be used sparingly and with great discretion is being fulfilled , particularly since the number of repayments has increased so significantly between fy2004 and fy2005 .

individual executive agency reports on student loan repayments are not available publicly .

perhaps agencies would consider posting these reports on their internet websites .

oversight of the repayment programs may be strengthened by evaluations conducted by agency inspectors general or the national academy of public administration .

currently , several agencies have anecdotal evidence on the effectiveness of their student loan repayment programs .

some agencies are into their fourth year of using the incentive while others have one to three years of experience with the program .

in order to further assess the impact of repayments , agencies may institute systematic entrance and exit interviews that query their employees on the importance of receiving student loan repayments compared to other available recruitment and retention incentives .

in addition , the recruitment and retention results for new hires who received and did not receive the repayments could be compared to determine the effectiveness of the repayments .

information on the specific recruitment and retention challenges that agencies are trying to mitigate through the use of repayments also would illuminate whether they are primarily competing with other agencies or with the private sector for staff .

three executive branch agencies — the departments of justice and defense and the securities and exchange commission — have been in the forefront of student loan repayment programs since fy2003 .

the department of state has been so since fy2002 .

together , these four agencies account for 81.3% ( 3,392 ) of recipients of repayments and 84.1% ( $22,432,654 ) of the total cost of repayments in the executive branch in fy2005 .

opm's annual report could provide congress with a more complete measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of repayment programs if it included detailed information on the administrative practices and costs and the outcomes of the programs at these four agencies .
