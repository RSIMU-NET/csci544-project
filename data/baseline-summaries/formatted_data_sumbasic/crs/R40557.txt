foreign assistance law requires congress to authorize funding for programs before appropriated funds are spent .

through 1985 , congress regularly enacted new authorization legislation or amended the foreign assistance act of 1961 , the foundation of u.s. foreign aid policy , to update authorization time frames , and to incorporate newer programs and authorities .

after 1986 , however , congress turned more frequently to enacting freestanding authorities that did not amend the 1961 act , and waived the requirement to authorize funds before making them available in appropriations .

the annual foreign operations appropriations bill funds foreign aid programs as they are defined and authorized in the foreign assistance act of 1961 , the arms export control act , and other related acts .

these annual measures , like all appropriations bills that fund executive branch programs and operations , include general provisions to guide how funds may be spent .

over time , as enactment of foreign aid reauthorizations waned , the general provisions of foreign operations appropriations measures increasingly have become a legislative option for congress to assert its views on the role and use of u.s. foreign aid policy , put limits or conditions on assistance , or even authorize new programs .

as a result , some contend , general provisions have become more important .

the greater likelihood — relative to authorization proposals , at least — that appropriations measures will be considered in committee , on the floor , in both chambers , and in conference also impacts the attractiveness of serving on an appropriations or authorization committee , and affects the relationship between authorizers and appropriators .

this report identifies the legislative origins of general provisions that pertain to foreign aid in current foreign operations appropriations: department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations act , 2010 ( division f of the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ; p.l .

111-117 ; 123 stat .

3034 at 3312 ) , as continued for fiscal year 2011 by the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .

112-10 ; 125 stat .

38 ; of which sec .

1101 ( a ) ( 6 ) continues appropriations enacted in p.l .

111-117 , and division b , title xi , which provides further instruction for fy2011 foreign operations expenditures ) .

the left column shows the general provision section and heading , taken from p.l .

111-117 .

the right column , in most instances , has two paragraphs per section .

the first paragraph identifies in which section the intent or language of the general provision first appeared , and is taken from annotations the congressional research service prepares for the house committee on foreign affairs and senate committee on foreign relations for their joint committee print , legislation on foreign relations .

the second paragraph establishes the more detailed legislative history of each provision — where and how it first appears that first year ( reported out of committee , floor sponsor , or conference committee ) .

where available , report numbers are included .

in some years , detailed information about sponsorship is not available: there is nearly no legislative history trail for new general provisions introduced in fy2009 , for example .

very few of the general provisions are codified as notes in the u.s. code .

very few of the general provisions correspond with sections in the foreign assistance act of 1961 .

when either condition occurs , it is noted in the right column .

most of the sections have changed over the years .

the legislative histories in the right column document the introduction of the concept or intent of the general provision , not the subsequent changes to that initial idea .

thus , an idea may be introduced and the right column identifies the committee or member who brought the idea forward , but legislative maps of subsequent alterations , additions , changes in applicability , are not tracked .

on occasion , an idea initially stated in a general provision migrates and is incorporated into the funding titles: requirements of the chief executive officer of the millennium challenge corporation , for example , were first stated in general provisions but in fy2010 appropriations those requirements were folded into the title iii paragraph pertaining to that entity .

the goal is solely to identify the emergence of the idea .

frequently , once enacted , a general provision is continued annually in subsequent foreign operations appropriations measures .

if some portion of a section is not carried forward annually , it is noted in the right column .

the short titles or popular names of annual foreign operations appropriations have changed over time .

in keeping with current jargon , the table refers to each annual measure as a "foreign operations appropriations" with the fiscal year to which it applies .

an appendix follows the table , which provides true short titles and popular names along with public law numbers .
