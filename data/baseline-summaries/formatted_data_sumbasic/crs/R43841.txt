during its first session , the 114 th congress faced numerous international trade and finance policy issues .

these issues included legislation granting time - limited u.s. trade promotion authority ( tpa ) to the president .

tpa provides expedited congressional procedures for considering legislation to implement u.s. trad e agreements that advance u.s. trade negotiating objectives and meet specific notification and consultative requirements .

congress also considered legislation to reauthorize the export - import bank ( ex - im bank ) , trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) , certain u.s. trade preference programs , and the commercial operations of u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , as well as legislation to approve governance reforms at the international monetary fund ( imf ) .

additionally , congress continued oversight of ongoing u.s. trade agreements and negotiations , and of u.s. economic sanctions against iran , cuba , north korea , russia , and other countries .

u.s. trade policy and international economic issues are likely to remain active areas of interest for the second session of the 114 th congress .

with the recent conclusion of the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) negotiations among the united states and 11 other asia - pacific nations , congressional attention may shift to possible consideration of legislation to implement the proposed tpp .

other trade negotiations underway of likely congressional oversight interest include multilateral and plurilateral negotiations at the world trade organization ( wto ) , negotiations on international trade in services ( taking place outside of the wto ) , and free trade agreement ( fta ) negotiations between the united states and the european union ( eu ) .

international trade and finance issues are important to congress because they can affect the health of the u.s. economy , the success of u.s. businesses and their workers , and the standard of living of americans .

they also have implications for u.s. geopolitical interests .

conversely , geopolitical tensions , risks , and opportunities can have major impacts on international trade and finance .

these issues are complex and at times controversial , and developments in the global economy often make policy deliberation more challenging .

congress is in a unique position to address these issues , particularly given its constitutional authority for legislating and overseeing international trade and financial policy .

this report provides a brief overview of some of the trade and finance issues that may come before the second session of the 114th congress .

appendix a provides a list of crs products covering these issues in greater detail .

the u.s. constitution assigns express authority over foreign trade to congress .

article i , section 8 , of the constitution gives congress the power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations" and to "lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises. .

for roughly the first 150 years of the united states , congress exercised its power to regulate foreign trade by setting tariff rates on all imported products .

congressional trade debates in the 19 th century often pitted members from northern manufacturing regions , who benefitted from high tariffs , against those from largely southern raw material exporting regions , who gained from and advocated for low tariffs .

a major shift in u.s. trade policy occurred after congress passed the highly protective "smoot - hawley" tariff act of 1930 , which , by raising u.s. tariff rates to an all - time high level , led u.s. trading partners to respond in kind .

as a result , world trade declined rapidly , exacerbating the impact of the great depression .

since the passage of the tariff act of 1930 , congress has delegated certain trade authority to the executive branch .

first , congress enacted the reciprocal trade agreements act of 1934 , which authorized the president to enter into reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs within congressionally pre - approved levels , and to implement the new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation .

congress renewed this authority periodically until the 1960s .

second , congress enacted the trade act of 1974 , aimed at opening markets and establishing nondiscriminatory international trade for nontariff barriers as well .

because changes in nontariff barriers in reciprocal bilateral , regional , and multilateral trade agreements usually involve amending u.s. law , the agreements require congressional approval and implementing legislation .

congress has renewed and amended the 1974 act five times , which includes granting "fast - track" trade negotiating authority .

since 2002 , "fast track" has been known as trade promotion authority ( tpa ) .

congress also exercises trade policy authority through the enactment of laws authorizing trade programs and governing trade policy generally , as well as oversight of the implementation of trade policies , programs , and agreements .

these include such areas as u.s. trade agreement negotiations , tariffs and nontariff barriers , trade remedy laws , import and export policies , economic sanctions , and the trade policy functions of the federal government .

additionally , congress has an important role in international investment and finance policy .

it has authority over bilateral investment treaties ( bits ) and the level of u.s. financial commitments to the multilateral development banks ( mdbs ) , including the world bank , and to the international monetary fund ( imf ) .

it also authorizes the activities of such agencies as the export - import bank ( ex - im bank ) and the overseas private investment corporation ( opic ) .

congress has oversight responsibilities over these institutions , as well as the federal reserve and the department of the treasury , whose activities affect international capital flows .

congress also closely monitors developments in international financial markets that could affect the u.s. economy .

members of congress can exert significant influence over the course of u.s. trade policy and its implementation through their legislative , appropriations , and oversight roles .

u.s. trade policy and international economic issues are likely to remain active areas of interest for the second session of the 114 th congress .

in engaging on these issues , congress may wish to: consider potential implementing legislation for the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) , which could prompt a vigorous debate on a number of trade issues encompassed in the proposed agreement ; conduct oversight of ongoing u.s. trade negotiations , including on a potential transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) with the european union ( eu ) , a potential international plurilateral trade in services agreement ( tisa ) , and world trade organization ( wto ) negotiations ; conduct oversight and take possible legislative action concerning a range of other trade issues , including u.s. trade relations with china and other major economies as well as u.s. export and import policies and programs ; and monitor the remaining implications of the eurozone and greek debt crisis , the financial markets , international financial institutions and u.s. funding levels , and other countries' exchange rate policies , among other international finance issues .

u.s. trade and economic policy affects the interest of all members of congress and their constituents .

congressional actions on these issues can impact the health of the u.s. economy , the success of u.s. businesses and their workers , the standard of living of americans , and u.s. geopolitical interests .

some of these issues may be highly contested , as members of congress and affected stakeholders have differing views on the benefits , costs , and role of u.s. trade policy .

the dynamic nature of the global economy — including the increasingly interconnected nature of the global market , the growing influence of emerging markets , and the growing role of digital trade , among other factors — provide the backdrop for a robust and complex debate in the second session of the 114th congress over a range of trade and finance issues .
