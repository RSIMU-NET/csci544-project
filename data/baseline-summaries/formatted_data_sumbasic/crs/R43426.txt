this section provides statistics and information related to select demographic characteristics and professional experiences of active u.s. district court judges .

as of june 1 , 2017 , a total of 194 women were serving as u.s. district court judges , representing 34% of all active district court judges ( men comprised 66% ) .

as of june 1 , 2017 , there were active female judges serving on 80 , or 88% , of the nation's 91 u.s. district courts , with the greatest number of women serving as judges for the southern district of new york ( 10 , or 38% , of 26 active judges ) and the eastern district of new york ( 8 , or 73% , of 11 active judges ) , and a single woman serving as an active judge on 37 u.s. district courts ( representing 29% of the 129 active judges serving on the 37 district courts ) .

figure 9 shows the number of active female u.s. district court judges serving on the bench during each calendar year from 1977 to 2017 .

overall , during this period , the number of female district court judges increased from 5 to 194 .

the number of female district court judges serving , thus far , in 2017 ( 194 judges ) is lower than the all - time high number of female judges ( 219 ) that were serving in 2014 ( also shown in figure 9 ) , during the sixth year of the obama presidency .

of the 570 active u.s. district court judges serving on june 1 , 2017 , 406 ( 71% ) were white , 81 ( 14% ) were african american , 58 ( 10% ) were hispanic , 16 ( 3% ) were asian american , 1 ( 0.2% ) was american indian , and 8 ( 1.4% ) were multiracial .

as shown by figure 10 , as of june 1 , 2017 , there were african american judges serving on 44 , or 48% , of the nation's 91 u.s. district courts ; hispanic judges serving on 24 ( 26% ) of the courts ; and asian american judges serving on 12 ( 13% ) of the courts .

as of june 1 , 2017 , there were 7 u.s. district courts with at least one active judge from each of the three groups ( i.e. , there was as at least one active african american , hispanic , and asian american judge serving on the court ) : the northern district of california ; eastern district of california ; southern district of california ; northern district of illinois ; district of nevada ; eastern district of new york ; and southern district of new york .

as of june 1 , 2017 , of the 44 district courts with active african american judges , 21 ( 48% ) had more than one active african american judge ( with the greatest number serving on u.s. district courts for the district of columbia , eastern district of michigan , eastern district of missouri , and southern district of new york , each with 4 judges ) .

each of the remaining 23 district courts had a single active african american judge .

as calculated previously by crs , of the 10 judicial districts with the greatest percentage of population that is african american ( each with an african american population that is over 33% ) , there are no african americans currently serving as active u.s. district court judges in 4 of the districts: the southern district of alabama ; middle district of alabama ; southern district of georgia ; and the western district of louisiana .

as of june 1 , 2017 , of the 24 district courts with active hispanic judges , 13 ( 54% ) had more than one active hispanic judge ( with the greatest number serving on u.s. district courts for the southern district of texas and western district of texas , each with 7 judges ) .

altogether , 40 ( 69% ) of the 58 active hispanic judges were serving , as of june 1 , 2017 , on u.s. district courts in california ( 10 judges ) , florida ( 6 ) , new mexico ( 4 ) , texas ( 14 ) , or puerto rico ( 6 ) .

as of june 1 , 2017 , of the 12 district courts with active asian american judges , 4 ( 33% ) had more than one active asian american judge ( with the greatest number serving on u.s. district courts for the northern district of california and northern district of illinois , each with 3 judges ) .

altogether , 12 ( 75% ) of the 16 active asian american judges were serving , as of june 1 , 2017 , on u.s. district courts in california ( 6 judges ) , illinois ( 3 ) , or new york ( 3 ) .

figure 11 shows the number of active african american , hispanic , and asian american u.s. district court judges serving on the bench during each calendar year from 1977 to 2017 .

overall , during this period , the number of african american district court judges increased from 16 to 85 ; the number of hispanic district court judges increased from 5 to 64 ; and the number of asian american district court judges increased from 3 to 20 .

the current number of active african american district court judges , 85 , is lower than the all - time high number of african american judges ( 94 ) that were serving in 2014 ( also shown in figure 11 ) , during the sixth year of the obama presidency .

the current number of active hispanic circuit court judges , 64 , is lower than the all - time high number of hispanic judges ( 67 ) that were serving in 2016 , during the eighth year of the obama presidency .

the current number of active asian american district court judges , 20 , is lower than the all - time high number of asian american judges ( 22 ) that were serving in 2014 and 2015 , during the sixth and seventh years of the obama presidency .

this section provides a percentage breakdown of the 570 active u.s. district court judges by gender and race .

as shown by figure 12 , white men represent 49.3% of federal district court judges ; white women represent 21.9% ; african american men represent 8.1% ; african american women represent 6.1% ; hispanic men represent 6.5% ; hispanic women represent 3.7% ; asian american men represent 1.6% ; and asian american women represent 1.2% .

additionally , there is one american indian female u.s. district court judge and eight multiracial district court judges ( four men and four women ) .

as discussed above , "nontraditional" judges are those belonging to certain demographic groups from which individuals , historically , were not often , if ever , selected for federal judgeships .

consequently , this group includes white women , non - white women , and non - white men .

so , for example , of the 247 white women to ever serve as u.s. district court judges , 242 ( or 98% ) were appointed to the bench between 1977 and 2016 ( i.e. , 5 were appointed prior to 1977 ) .

of the 93 non - white women to ever serve as a district court judge , 92 ( or 99% ) were appointed to the bench at some point between 1977 and 2016 .

and of the 240 non - white men to ever serve as a district court judge , 213 ( or 89% ) were appointed to the bench between 1977 and 2016 .

in contrast , of the 2,334 white men to ever serve as u.s. district court judges , 928 ( or 40% ) were appointed to the bench between 1977 and 2016 .

as with circuit court appointees during the obama presidency , nontraditional judges for the first time in judicial history comprised over 50% of active federal district court judges .

as of june 1 , 2017 , this remains the case among active u.s. district court judges — specifically , 289 , or 51% , of 570 active u.s. district court judges are white women , non - white women , or non - white men .

the change in the gender and racial composition of those serving as u.s. district court judges is due , in part , to the effort by president obama and many senators to select and support nontraditional nominees for vacant judgeships .

so , for example , as shown by figure 13 , president obama's nontraditional district court appointees represent a larger percentage of all active nontraditional district court judges on the bench ( 56.1% ) than do his appointees among all active district court judges ( 46.0% ) .

the change in the gender and racial composition of those serving as district court judges is further explained by figure 14 — which shows , across presidencies , the percentage breakdown across each of the four groups for all district court judges appointed by each president ( i.e. , the percentages reflect all of a president's appointees and not just those individuals who are currently serving as active judges ) .

so , for example , of all the district court judges appointed by president carter , 67% were white men ; 11% were white women ; 19% were non - white men ; and 3% were non - white women .

notably , as shown by the figure ( and as with his circuit court appointees ) , president obama was the first president for whom nontraditional nominees ( i.e. , white women , non - white women , and non - white men ) comprised a majority of all those he appointed as u.s. district court judges .

specifically , 62% of president obama's district court nominees who were confirmed by the senate were nontraditional nominees .

while a plurality of president obama's district court appointees were white men ( 38.1% ) , a greater percentage of his district court appointees were white women , non - white women , and non - white men ( 25.4% , 15.7% , and 20.9% , respectively ) than any of his predecessors .

another notable change during the obama presidency was the increase in the number of non - white women who were appointed as district court judges .

while this group represented the smallest percentage ( 15.7% ) of the four groups ( i.e. , white men , white women , non - white men , and non - white women ) appointed by president obama , he nonetheless appointed 42 ( or 45% ) of the 93 non - white women to ever serve as u.s. district court judges .

among asian american women specifically , president obama appointed 7 ( 78% ) of 9 to ever serve as federal district court judges .

he also appointed each of the four multiracial women to ever serve as district court judges .

the average age , as of june 1 , 2017 , of active u.s. district court judges is 60.8 years ( the median age is 61.3 ) .

of the 570 active district court judges: 8 ( 1.4% ) are 40-44 years old 44 ( 7.7% ) are 45-49 years old 96 ( 16.8% ) are 50-54 years old 100 ( 17.5% ) are 55-59 years old 168 ( 29.5% ) are 60-64 years old 101 ( 17.7% ) are 65-69 years old 53 ( 9.3% ) are 70 years of age or older of the 570 active judges , a plurality ( 29.5% ) are 60-64 years old .

combining the two age groups with the greatest number of active judges ( the 60-64 and 65-69 age groups ) reveals that 269 ( or 47.2% ) of all active federal district court judges are between the ages of 60 and 69 .

the average age at the time appointment to the bench of active u.s. district court judges was 50.0 ( the median age was 49.8 ) .

of the 570 active district court judges: 2 ( 0.3% ) were appointed under the age of 35 20 ( 3.5% ) were appointed between the ages of 35 and 39 108 ( 18.9% ) were appointed between the ages of 40 and 44 163 ( 28.6% ) were appointed between the ages of 45 and 49 147 ( 25.8% ) were appointed between the ages of 50 and 54 93 ( 16.3% ) were appointed between the ages of 55 and 59 36 ( 6.3% ) were appointed between the ages of 60 and 64 1 ( 0.2% ) was appointed between the ages of 65 and 69 altogether , 310 ( or 54.4% ) of all active federal district court judges were appointed between the ages of 45 and 54 .

of the 20 active district court judges who were appointed at the youngest ages ( each under the age of 40 at the time of appointment ) of all 570 active judges , 13 ( or 65% ) were appointed by republican presidents — including the two youngest at the time of appointment being appointed by president reagan .

in contrast , of the 20 active circuit court judges who were appointed at the oldest ages ( each over the age of 61 at the time of appointment ) , 13 ( or 65% ) were appointed by democratic presidents .

the average and median differences , though , in the age at the time of appointment between democratic and republican appointees is relatively small among the entire group of 570 active district court judges .

for democratic appointees , the average age at the time of appointment was 50.7 years ( with a median age of 50.3 years ) .

for republican appointees , the average age at the time of appointment was 49.0 years ( with a median age of 49.2 years ) .

the length of service for each active judge is calculated as the number of years from when the judge received his or her commission to june 1 , 2017 ( which , for the purposes of this report , is the cut - off date used for this calculation ) .

so , for example , the length of service for judge manuel l. real ( the longest - serving district court judge ) is calculated as 50.6 years ( the period of time from november 3 , 1966 , when judge real received his commission after his confirmation by the senate , to june 1 , 2017 ) .

the average length of service of active u.s. district court judges is 10.8 years ( while the median , represented by the reference line in figure 15 , is 9.1 years ) .

as expected , and as shown by the figure , there is a positive relationship between a judge's current age and the length of time he or she has served as a judge .

figure 15 also shows the clustering of each president's cohort of appointed circuit court nominees by length of service and current age .

overall , of 570 active district court judges as of june 1 , 2017 , president obama appointed a plurality ( 46.0% ) of district court judges , with a median length of service of 4.4 years and a median age of 55.9 years , followed by presidents g.w .

bush ( 35.3% of active judges , with a median length of service of 13.0 years and median age of 62.9 years ) ; clinton ( 13.2% of active judges , with a median length of service of 19.6 years and a median age of 65.4 years ) ; g.h.w .

bush ( 2.6% of active judges , with a median length of service of 25.3 years and a median age of 67.0 years ) ; and reagan ( 2.5% of active judges , with a median length of service of 31.6 years and a median age of 75.8 years ) .

the remaining judges were appointed by presidents carter , ford , and johnson ( each with one judge ) .

this section provides data related to the occupation or professional background of active u.s. district court judges at the time of their appointment to the bench .

as shown by figure 16 , a plurality of u.s. district court judges , immediately prior to appointment , were working as attorneys in private practice ( 35.4% of all active judges ) .

the second most common type of professional experience immediately prior to being appointed was serving as a state or local judge ( 30.5% of all active judges ) , followed by serving as a u.s. magistrate judge ( 14.6% ) .

figure 16 also provides summary statistics taking into account whether active district court judges , immediately prior to being appointed to the bench , were serving as judges ( either at the federal or state level ) or in the executive or legislative branch of government ( federal or state level ) .

overall , 46.1% of active district court judges were serving as a federal or state judge , while 16.5% were serving as an official or staff in the executive or legislative branch at the federal or state level .

altogether , 62.6% of active u.s. district court judges were serving in either federal or state government immediately prior to being appointed to the bench .
