congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriationsmeasures , the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill .

congress also acts every year ona national defense authorization bill , which authorizes programs funded in all of the regularappropriations measures .

the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely thesame level of detail as the defense - related appropriations , and congressional debate about majordefense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization .

because thedefense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related , this report trackscongressional action on both measures .

the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense ( dod ) - - including pay and benefits of military personnel , operation and maintenanceof weapons and facilities , weapons procurement , and research and development - - and for otherpurposes .

most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department ofdefense , though the bill also provides ( 1 ) relatively small , unclassified amounts for the centralintelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management , ( 2 ) classified amountsfor national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well asby dod , and ( 3 ) very small amounts for some other agencies .

five other appropriations bills alsoprovide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies including: the military construction appropriations bill , which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing , all administered bydod ; the energy and water development appropriations bill , which funds atomicenergy defense activities administered by the department of energy ; the va - hud - independent agencies appropriations bill , which finances civil defense activities administered by the federal emergency management agency , activities of theselective service system , and support for national science foundation antarctic research ; the commerce - justice - state appropriations bill , which funds national security - related activities of the fbi , the department of justice , and some other agencies ; and the transportation appropriations bill , which funds some defense - related activities of the coast guard .

the administration's fy2001 budget includes $305.4 billion for the national defense budget function , of which $284.3 billion is requested in the defense appropriations bill .
