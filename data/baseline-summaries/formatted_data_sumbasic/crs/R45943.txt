agriculture - based renewable energy can take several forms , including biofuels such as corn - based ethanol or soy - based biodiesel , wind - driven turbines located on farmland or in rural areas , anaerobic digesters that convert animal waste into methane and electric power , or biomass harvested for burning as a processing fuel or to generate heat as part of an industrial activity .

since the late 1970s , u.s. policymakers at both the federal and state levels have adopted a variety of incentives , regulations , and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculture - based renewable energy ( mostly biofuels ) .

over the years , the two most widely used biofuelsâethanol produced primarily from corn starch and biodiesel produced primarily from soybean oilâhave received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives , loans and grants , and regulatory programs .

many of these support programs originate in legislation outside of the farm bill .

for instance , the energy tax act of 1978 ( p.l .

95-618 ) provided an exemption for ethanol from the excise tax on motor fuels .

by executive order the bioenergy program was established in 1999 and in fy2001 began making payments from the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda's ) commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) to eligible producers of ethanol and biodiesel based on year - to - year production increases in these fuels .

the biomass research and development act of 2000 ( p.l .

106-224 ) directed usda and the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) to cooperate and coordinate research and development activities for biobased industrial products , including biofuels .

the 2002 farm bill ( p.l .

107-171 ) authorized several new biofuel programs and added an energy title , title ix .

the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) subsequently extended and expanded the programs promoting renewable energy , emphasizing particularly those utilizing biomass feedstock .

the 2014 farm bill ( p.l .

113-79 ) extended the programs through fy2018 .

the 2018 farm bill , the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-334 ) , continues federal support for the programs through fy2023 .

motivations cited for these legislative initiatives include energy security concerns , reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion , and raising domestic demand for u.s. - produced farm products .

congress has enacted temporary tax incentives for biofuels , specifically tax credits for biodiesel and second generation ( formerly cellulosic ) biofuel and a tax credit for small producers .

some of these temporary tax incentives have been extended numerous times .

most recently , the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba ; p.l .

115-123 ) retroactively extended the tax incentive for biodiesel and renewable diesel of $1.00 / gallon through the end of 2017 .

in addition to these types of tax incentives , the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) mandates a minimum level of renewable fuel usage .

historically , there has been a revenue cost associated with tax incentives for ethanol and biofuels .

the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit ( veetc ) provided a tax credit of $0.45 / gallon before it expired at the end of 2011 .

from fy1980 through fy2013 , excise tax credits and incentives for ethanol reduced federal tax revenue by a cumulative estimated total of $46.9 billion .

in fy2011 , the fiscal year immediately preceding the veetc's expiration , its cost was an estimated $6.5 billion .

excise tax incentives for biodiesel producers have reduced federal excise tax revenue by an estimated $17.3 billion between fy2008 and fy2018 .

in fy2018 , excise tax receipts were reduced by $3.4 billion due to biodiesel producer credits ( the reduction in fy2018 excise tax receipts is associated with tax credit claims made for biodiesel production in calendar year 2017 ) .

title ix of the 2018 farm bill continues long - standing congressional support for the production of renewable energy from agriculturally sourced materials .

this report focuses on those policies contained in the 2018 farm bill that support agriculture - based renewable energy .

the introductory sections of this report briefly describe how usda bioenergy policies evolved and how they fit into the larger context of u.s. biofuels policy .

then , each of the bioenergy provisions of the 2018 farm bill are defined in terms of their function , goals , administration , funding , and implementation status .

in an appendix at the end of this report , table a - 1 presents data on 2018 farm bill budgetary authority for energy provisions , while table a - 2 , table a - 3 , and table a - 4 present the original budget authority for title ix programs under the previous 2014 farm bill , the 2008 farm bill , and the 2002 farm bill , respectively .

in general , two types of funding are authorized by congress in a farm billâmandatory and discretionary .

some farm bill programs receiving mandatory funds are automatically funded at levels "authorized" in the farm bill unless congress limits funding to a lower amount through the appropriations or legislative process .

for many of these programs , mandatory funding is provided through the borrowing authority of usda's commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) .

the farm bill may also specify some discretionary funding as "authorized to be appropriated"âsuch discretionary funding is actually determined each year through the annual appropriations process and may or may not reflect the funding level suggested in the authorizing legislation .

like the three preceding farm bills , the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) contained a distinct energy title ( title ix ) that extends many of the previous bioenergy programs .

what follows is a summary of the bioenergy - related authorities found in the 2018 farm bill , including ( where applicable ) a brief description of each program , 2018 farm bill funding levels , and the status of program implementation , including any noteworthy legislative changes .

this section provides a description for all sections listed under 7 u.s.c .

ch .

107 renewable energy research and development , which includes those sections that are under other titles of the 2018 farm bill .

the 2018 farm bill made three substantive modifications to bioenergy - related definitions as follows ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8101 ) : 1 .

"biobased product"â similar to prior law except it expands the term to include renewable chemicals ; 2 .

"biorefinery"â defined as a facility that converts renewable biomass or an intermediate ingredient or feedstock of renewable biomass into biofuels , renewable chemicals , or biobased products and may produce electricity ; and 3 .

"renewable energy system "â defined as a system that produces useable energy from a renewable source , including the distribution components necessary to move energy produced by the system to the initial point of sale , and other components and ancillary infrastructure such as a storage system , but not any mechanism for dispensing energy at retail ( eg , a blender pump ) .

the first two modifications were designed to expand access to federal support for renewable chemicals and intermediate ingredients or feedstocks of renewable biomass , respectively .

the last modification was designed to expand access to federal support for ancillary infrastructure ( eg , storage system ) associated with a renewable energy system .

administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rural development agency ( rd ) , usda .

program overview : the biobased markets program was originally established under the 2002 farm bill as a federal procurement preference program that required federal agencies to purchase biobased products under certain conditions ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8102 ) .

the 2008 farm bill renamed the federal biobased procurements preference program as the biobased markets program .

usda refers to the program as the biopreferredâ® program .

the biopreferredâ® program promotes biobased productsâthose derived from marine and forestry materialsâthrough two initiatives: ( 1 ) a mandatory purchasing requirement for federal agencies and their contractors and ( 2 ) a voluntary labeling initiative for biobased products .

products that meet the minimum biobased content criteria may display the usda certified biobased product label .

under the biobased markets program , federal agencies and their contractors are generally required to purchase biobased products from 109 categories of goodsâamong which are cleaners , carpets , lubricants , office supplies , and paintsâwhen an agency procures $10,000 or more worth of an item within these categories during the course of a fiscal year , or where the quantity of such items or of functionally equivalent items purchased during the preceding fiscal year was $10,000 or more .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) extended the biobased markets program through fy2023 , while adding some new implementation requirements .

it requires the secretary to update the eligibility criteria for determining which renewable chemicals will qualify for a "usda certified biobased product" label .

the farm bill requires the secretary and the secretary of commerce to develop north american industry classification system ( naics ) codes for both renewable chemical manufacturers and biobased product manufacturers , and for the secretary to establish a national registry of testing centers for biobased products .

the bill also requires usda to establish an expedited approval process for products to be determined eligible for the procurement program and to receive a biobased product label .

the farm bill prohibits a procuring agency from establishing procurement guidelines for biobased products that are more restrictive than what the secretary has established .

funding: the 2018 farm bill authorized mandatory ccc funding of $3 million for each of fy2019-fy2023 for biobased products testing and labeling .

discretionary funding of $3 million was authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

however , through fy2019 no discretionary funding has been appropriated for the biobased markets program .

administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rural development agency ( rd ) , usda in consultation with doe .

program overview : originally called the biorefinery assistance program ( bap ) as authorized in the 2008 farm bill , this program assists in the development of new and emerging technologies for advanced biofuels , renewable chemicals , and biobased products .

competitive grants and loan guarantees are available for construction and / or retrofitting of demonstration - scale biorefineries to demonstrate the commercial viability of one or more processes for converting renewable biomass to advanced biofuels .

biorefinery grants can provide for up to 30% of total project costs .

each loan guarantee is limited to $250 million or 80% of project cost ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8103 ) .

mandatory funds are used for the loan guarantee portion of bap , whereas discretionary appropriations are to be used to fund grants .

with no appropriation of discretionary funds for bap during the life of the 2008 farm bill , congress permitted usda to move forward with only the loan guarantee portion of bap .

rural development administers the program under 7 c.f.r .

â§4279 , subpart c , and 7 c.f.r .

â§4287 , part d. for loan guarantees , project lenders ( not prospective borrowers ) must submit the application .

each loan guarantee application undergoes at least three rounds of review , including review by the rural development agency , usda ; the national renewable energy laboratory ( nrel ) , doe ; and the office of the chief economist ( oce ) , usda .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) extended the program through fy2023 .

it expanded the definition of eligible technology to include technologies that produce one or more of the following , or a combination thereof: an advanced biofuel , a renewable chemical , or a biobased product .

funding: the 2018 farm bill authorized mandatory ccc funding of $50 million for fy2019 and $25 million for fy2020 for the cost of loan guarantees .

discretionary funding of $75 million was authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

no discretionary funds have been appropriated through fy2019 .

administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rd , usda .

program overview : the repowering assistance program ( rap ) was originally established under the 2008 farm bill to encourage biorefineries to replace fossil fuels with renewable biomass as the feedstock .

rap made payments to eligible biorefineries ( i.e. , those in existence on the date of enactment of the 2008 farm bill , june 18 , 2008 ) to encourage the use of renewable biomass as a replacement for fossil fuels used to provide heat for processing or power in the operation of these eligible biorefineries .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the repowering assistance program was repealed .

administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rd , usda .

program overview : originally created by a 1999 executive order during the clinton administration , the bioenergy program provided mandatory ccc incentive payments to biofuels producers based on year - to - year increases in the quantity of biofuel produced .

the 2008 farm bill established a new bioenergy program for advanced biofuels to support and expand production of advanced biofuelsâthat is , fuel derived from renewable biomass other than corn kernel starchâunder which usda would enter into contracts with advanced biofuel producers to pay them for production of eligible advanced biofuels .

the policy goal is to create long - term , sustained increases in advanced biofuels production .

payments are of two types: one based on actual production , and a second based on incremental production increases .

not more than 5% of the funds in any year can go to facilities with total refining capacity exceeding 150 million gallons per year ( 7 c.f.r .

part 4288 , subpart b ) .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) extended the program through fy2023 .

it modifies the equitable distribution portion of the program by limiting the amount of payments for advanced biofuel produced from a single eligible commodity to not exceed one - third of the total program funding available in a fiscal year .

funding: the 2018 farm bill authorized mandatory ccc funding of $7 million for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

discretionary funding of $20 million was authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

however , no discretionary funding has been appropriated for the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels program through fy2019 .

administered by: national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) and office of energy policy and new uses ( oepnu ) , oce , usda .

program overview : originally established under the 2002 farm bill , the biodiesel fuel education program was extended by the 2008 , 2014 , and 2018 farm bills ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8106 ) .

the biodiesel fuel education program awards competitive grants to nonprofit organizations that educate governmental and private entities that operate vehicle fleets , and educates the public about the benefits of biodiesel fuel use .

the program is implemented by usda through continuation grants .

the final rule for the program was published on september 30 , 2003 ( 68 fed eral reg ister 56137 ) .

changes in 201 8 farm bill : extended the biodiesel fuel education program from fy2019 through fy2023 without changes to program implementation other than new funding levels .

funding: the 2018 farm bill provides no mandatory funding for the program .

discretionary funding of $2 million is authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

however , through fy2019 no discretionary funding has been provided .

administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rural development , usda .

program overview: the 2008 farm bill combined elements of two existing programs from the 2002 farm billâthe energy audit and renewable energy development program and the renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements programâinto a single program renamed the rural energy for america program ( reap ) ( 7â u.s.c .

â§8107 ) .

reap provides various types of financial assistance under a cost - share arrangement for the following purposes: grants , guaranteed loans , and combined grants and guaranteed loans for the development and construction of renewable energy systems ( res ) and for energy efficiency improvement ( eei ) projects ( eligible entities include rural small businesses and agricultural producers ) ; grants for conducting energy audits and for conducting renewable energy development assistance ( eligible entities include state , tribe , or local governments ; land - grant colleges and universities ; rural electric cooperatives ; and public power entities ) ; and grants for conducting renewable energy systems ( res ) feasibility studies ( eligible entities include rural small businesses and agricultural producers ) .

the cost share feature of reap limits the government's contribution to no more than 75% of eligible project costs for res systems and eei funding for combined grant and loan guarantees , and to no more than 25% for grants .

under energy audit and renewable energy development assistance grants , a grantee must pay a minimum of 25% of the cost of the energy audit .

res systems include those that generate energy from biomass ( but excluding any mechanism for dispensing energy at retailâeg , a blender pump ) , anaerobic digesters , geothermal , hydrogen , solar , wind , and hydropower .

eei projects typically involve installing or upgrading equipment to significantly reduce energy use .

reap operates under regulations published under 7 c.f.r .

part 4280 , subpart b .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill extends the program through fy2023 .

it amends the financial assistance for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems section to include certain limitations for loan guarantees to purchase and install energy - efficient equipment or agricultural production or processing systems .

additionally , it limits funds for loan guarantees for energy - efficient equipment to agricultural producers to not exceed 15% of the annual funding provided to the program .

funding: the 2018 farm bill retains mandatory ccc funding of $50 million for fy2014 and each fiscal year thereafter ( thus , unlike other farm bill renewable energy programs , reap's mandatory funding authority does not expire with the 2018 farm bill ) .

mandatory funds are to remain available until expended .

discretionary funding is authorized to be appropriated at $20 million annually for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

discretionary funding of $335,000 was appropriated for fy2019 .

administered by: rural utilities service , rural development , usda .

program overview : the rural energy savings program ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8107a ) provides loans to qualified consumers to implement durable cost - effective energy - efficiency measures .

the program was established in the 2014 farm bill .

loans are to be made to eligible entities that agree to use the loan funds to make loans to qualified consumers .

eligible entities include public power districts and public utility districts , among other entities .

loans to eligible entities are offered with no interest .

loan repayment by an eligible entity may not exceed 20 years from the loan's closing date , with an exception for special advances for start - up activities .

a qualified consumer is a consumer served by an eligible entity with the ability to repay the loan .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill extends the program through fy2023 .

it modifies the definition of energy - efficiency measures to include cost - effective on - or off - grid renewable energy or energy storage systems .

it amends the program such that the debt incurred by a borrower under this program may not be included when determining the borrower's eligibility for loans under programs authorized by the rural electrification act of 1936 .

it requires the secretary to streamline the accounting requirements on borrowers .

loans from eligible entities to qualified consumers may bear interest , not to exceed 5% , and must be used for certain purposes ( eg , to establish a loan loss reserve ) .

additionally , it requires the secretary to publish an annual report containing the number of program applications received , the number of loans made to eligible entities , and the recipients of the loans .

funding: the 2018 farm bill provides no mandatory funding for the program .

discretionary funding of $75 million is authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

the program received $10 million in discretionary funding for fy2019 .

administered by: national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) , usda , and doe , jointly .

program overview : brdiâcreated originally under the biomass research and development act of 2000 ( brda ; p.l .

106-224 ) âseeks to foster significant commercial production of biofuels , biobased energy innovations , development of biobased feedstocks , and biobased products and processes , including cost - competitive cellulosic ethanol .

to this end , the program provides competitive funding in the form of grants , contracts , and financial assistance for research , development , and demonstration of technologies and processes .

eligibility is limited to institutions of higher learning , national laboratories , federal or state research agencies , private - sector entities , and nonprofit organizations .

brdi provides for coordination of biomass research and development , including life - cycle analysis of biofuels , between usda and doe by creating the biomass research and development board to coordinate government activities in biomass research , and the biomass research and development technical advisory committee to advise on proposal direction and evaluation .

the 2008 farm bill moved brda in statute to title ix of the 2008 farm bill and expanded the brdi technical advisory committee ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8108 ) .

since 2002 usda and doe jointly have announced annual solicitations and awards of funding allocations under brdi .

pursuant to the 2008 farm bill , applicants seeking brdi funding must propose projects that integrate science and engineering research in the following three technical areas that are critical to the broader success of alternative biofuels production: feedstock development , biofuels and biobased products development , and biofuels development analysis .

a minimum of 15% of funding must go to each area .

the minimum cost - share requirement for demonstration projects was increased in the 2018 farm bill to 50% , and for research projects to 20% .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill extends the program through fy2023 .

it amends the definition of biobased product to include carbon dioxide , and it requires the initiative's technical advisory committee to include an individual with expertise in carbon capture , utilization , and storage .

further , it expands the objectives of the initiative to include the development of high - value biobased products that permanently sequester or utilize carbon dioxide .

it also expands the technical areas of the initiative to include the biofuels and biobased products development of technologies that permanently sequester or utilize carbon dioxide .

funding: the 2018 farm bill provides no mandatory funding for the program .

discretionary funding of $20 million is authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

however , no discretionary funding has been appropriated for brdi through fy2019 .

administered by: rural business and cooperative service , rd , usda .

program overview : the 2008 farm bill authorized the rural energy self - sufficiency initiative to assist rural communities with community - wide energy systems that reduce conventional energy use and increase the use of energy from renewable sources .

grants were to be made available to assess energy use in a rural community , evaluate ideas for reducing energy use , and develop and install integrated renewable energy systems .

grants were not to exceed 50% of the total cost of the activity ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8109 ) .

no funding was ever appropriated , and regulations were never announced for this program .

no provision was included in the 2014 farm bill for the rural energy self - sufficiency initiative , with the result that program funding authority expired after fy2013 .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the rural energy self - sufficiency initiative was repealed .

administered by: farm service agency ( fsa ) , usda .

program overview : under the 2008 farm bill , the ffp required that usda establish and administer a sugar - for - ethanol program using sugar intended for food use but deemed to be in surplus .

usda would subsidize the use of sugar for ethanol production through federal purchases of surplus sugar for resale to ethanol producers .

usda would implement the program only in those years where purchases are determined to be necessary to ensure that the sugar program operates at no cost to the federal government ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8110 ) .

the intent of the ffp is to provide the ccc a tool for avoiding sugar forfeitures .

under the sugar program , domestic sugar beet or sugarcane processors may borrow from the ccc , pledging their sugar production as collateral for any such loan , and then satisfy their loans either by repaying the loan on or before loan maturity , or by transferring the title for the collateral to the ccc immediately following loan maturity , also known as ''forfeiture'' of collateral ( as specified in 7 c.f.r.â â§1435 ) .

the ccc is required to operate the sugar program , to the maximum extent practicable , at no cost to the federal government , by avoiding forfeitures to ccc .

if domestic sugar market conditions are such that market rates are less than forfeiture level ( i.e. , forfeitures appear likely ) , current law requires ccc to use ffp to purchase sugar and sell such sugar to bioenergy producers to avoid forfeitures .

the ffp became effective upon publication of the final rule by usda in the federal register on july 29 , 2013 .

by late july 2013 , u.s. sugar prices were below effective federal support levels , compelling usda to activate ffp on august 15 , 2013 , and use an estimated $148 million of ccc funds to avoid possible sugar forfeitures .

no outlays have been required since 2013 .

changes in 201 8 farm bill : extended the ffp through fy2023 with no changes to program implementation .

funding: the 2018 farm bill extends the mandatory funding authority of such sums as necessary through fy2023 .

the cbo baseline does not project any outlays for the program .

discretionary funding is not authorized for the program .

administered by: farm service agency ( fsa ) , usda .

program overview : bcap provides financial assistance to owners and operators of agricultural land and nonindustrial private forest land who wish to establish , produce , and deliver biomass feedstocks to eligible processing plants .

bcap provides two categories of assistance: 1. establishment and annual payments , including a one - time payment of up to 50% of the cost of establishment for perennial crops , and annual payments ( i.e. , rental rates based on a set of criteria ) of up to five years for nonwoody and 15 years for woody perennial biomass crops ; and 2. matching payments , at a rate of $1 for each $1 per ton provided , up to $20 per ton , for a period of two years , which may be available to help eligible material owners with collection , harvest , storage , and transportation ( chst ) of eligible material for use in a qualified biomass conversion facility .

establishment and annual payments are available to certain producers who enter into contracts with usda to produce eligible biomass crops on contract acres within designated bcap project areas .

eligible land for bcap project area contracts includes agricultural land and nonindustrial private forestland , but does not include federal or state - owned land , or land that is native sod .

lands enrolled in existing land retirement programs for conservation purposesâthe conservation reserve program ( crp ) or the agricultural conservation easement program ( acep ) âalso become eligible during the fiscal year that their land retirement contract expires .

generally , crops that receive payments under title i ( the commodity title ) of the farm bill ( eg , corn , wheat , rice , and soybeans ) and noxious weeds or invasive species are not eligible for annual payments .

matching payments are available to eligible material owners who deliver eligible material to qualified biomass conversion facilities .

eligible material must be harvested directly from the land and separate from a higher - value product ( eg , title i crops ) .

invasive and noxious species are considered eligible material , and land ownership ( private , state , federal , etc. ) .

is not a limiting factor to receive matching payments ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8111 ) .

the 2014 farm bill changed enrolled land eligibility by including land under expiring crp or acep easement contracts .

it also included residue from crops receiving title i payments as eligible material , but extended exclusion to any whole grain from a title i crop , as well as bagasse and algae .

one - time establishment payments were limited to no more than 50% of cost of establishment from 75% previously , not to exceed $500 per acre ( $750 per acre for socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers ) .

chst matching payments may not exceed $20 per dry ton ( down from $45 per dry ton ) and are available for a two - year period .

chst funding shall be available for technical assistance .

not less than 10% or more than 50% of funding may be used for chst .

not later than four years after enactment of the 2014 farm bill , usda is to submit to the house and senate agriculture committees a report on best practices from participants receiving assistance under bcap .

changes in 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill extends the program through fy2023 .

the 2018 farm bill expands the definition for eligible material to include algae .

funding: the 2018 farm bill provides no mandatory funding for the program .

discretionary funding of $25 million is authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

no discretionary funding was provided for fy2019 .

administered by: forest service , usda .

program overview : the 2008 farm bill authorized the forest biomass for energy program to function as a research and development program to encourage use of forest biomass for energy .

the forest service , other federal agencies , state and local governments , indian tribes , land - grant colleges and universities , and private entities were to be eligible to compete for program funds .

priority was to be given to projects that use low - value forest byproduct biomass for the production of energy ; develop processes to integrate bioenergy from forest biomass into existing manufacturing streams ; develop new transportation fuels ; and improve the growth and yield of trees for renewable energy ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8112 ) .

in the end , the forest service never announced any regulations for this program .

changes in 201 4 farm bill : the forest biomass for energy program was repealed .

administered by: forest service , usda .

program overview : the 2008 farm bill authorized the community wood energy program to provide matching grantsâup to $50,000 and subject to a match of at least 50%âto state and local governments to acquire community wood energy systems for public buildings .

under the 2008 and 2014 farm bills , participants were to implement a community wood energy plan to meet energy needs with reduced carbon intensity through conservation , reduced costs , utilizing low - value wood sources , and increased awareness of energy consumption ( 7 u.s.c .

â§8113 ) .

the 2014 farm bill defined a biomass consumer cooperative and authorized grants of up to $50,000 to be made to establish or expand biomass consumer cooperatives that would provide consumers with services or discounts relating to the purchase of biomass heating systems or products ( including their delivery and storage ) ; and required that any biomass consumer cooperative that received a grant match at least the equivalent of 50% of the funds toward the establishment or expansion of a biomass consumer cooperative .

changes in the 2018 farm bill: the 2018 farm bill extends the program through fy2023 .

the 2018 farm bill changes the name to the community wood energy and wood innovation program , and modifies the scope of the program and participant requirements .

the program provides financial assistance for the installation of community wood energy systems or building an innovative wood product facility .

in short , the 2018 farm bill defines a community wood energy system as a system that produces thermal energy or combined thermal energy and electricity , services public facilities owned or operated by state or local governments , and uses woody biomass .

the capacity of the community wood energy system shall not exceed 5 megawatts of thermal energy or combined thermal and electric energy .

in short , an innovative wood product facility is defined as a manufacturing or processing plant or mill that produces building components that use large panelized wood ( including mass timber ) , wood products from nanotechnology , or other innovative wood products that use low - value , low - quality wood .

the 2018 farm bill removes the requirements for participants to implement a community wood energy plan and the requirements for biomass consumer cooperatives .

cost - share grants may cover up to 35% of the capital cost of the system or facility , and , for special circumstances , up to 50% .

the secretary is required to take into account certain selection criteria for awarding grants ( eg , energy efficiency , cost effectiveness , displacement of fossil fuel generation ) .

the secretary is to give priority to grant applicants that use the most stringent control technology for a wood - fired boiler ; would be carried out in a location where markets are needed for low - value , low - quality wood ; would be carried out in a location with limited access to natural gas pipelines ; would include the use or retrofitting of existing sawmill facilities that meet certain conditions ; and would be carried out in a location where the project will aide with forest restoration .

a maximum of 25% of the funds for the program for a fiscal year may go toward grants for innovative wood facilities , unless the secretary has received an insufficient number of community wood energy system proposals .

funding: the 2018 farm bill provides no mandatory funding for the program .

discretionary funding of $25 million is authorized to be appropriated for each of fy2019-fy2023 .

no funds have been appropriated through fy2019 .

administered by: nifa , usda .

each regional sun grant center manages the programs and activities within its region , although a process based on peer and merit review is used to administer grants .

program overview: created under the 2008 farm bill , the sun grant initiative ( sgi ) is a national network of land - grant universities and federally funded laboratories coordinated through regional sun grant centers .

the centers receive funding to enhance national energy security using biobased energy technologies , to promote diversification and environmental sustainability of agricultural production through biobased energy and product technologies , to promote economic diversification in rural areas through biobased energy and product technologies , and to enhance the efficiency of bioenergy and biomass research and development programs .
