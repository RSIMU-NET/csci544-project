the republic of cyprus gained its independence from great britain in 1960 .

at the time , the population living on the island was approximately 77% greek ethnic origin and roughly 18% turkish ethnic origin .

 ( this figure has changed over the years , as an influx of mainland turks have settled in the north. ) .

maronite christians , armenians , and others constituted the remainder .

at independence , the republic's constitution defined elaborate power - sharing arrangements between the two main cypriot groups .

it required a greek cypriot president and a turkish cypriot vice president , each elected by his own community .

simultaneously , a treaty of guarantee signed by britain , greece , and turkey ensured the new republic's territorial integrity , and a treaty of alliance between the republic , greece , and turkey provided for greek and turkish soldiers to help defend the island .

however , at that time , the two major communities aspired to different futures for cyprus: most greek cypriots favored union of the entire island with greece ( enosis ) , whereas turkish cypriots preferred to partition the island ( taksim ) and possibly unite the turkish cypriot zone with turkey .

cyprus's success as a new , stable republic lasted from 1960 to 1963 .

in 1963 , after president ( and greek orthodox archbishop ) makarios iii proposed constitutional modifications that favored the majority greek cypriot community , relations between the two communities deteriorated , with turkish cypriots increasingly consolidating into enclaves in larger towns , mostly in the north of the island , for safety .

in 1964 , turkish cypriots withdrew from most national institutions and began to administer their own affairs .

intercommunal violence began to increase between 1963 and 1964 and continued to escalate in the ensuing years .

outside mediation and pressure , including by the united states , appeared to prevent turkey from intervening militarily on behalf of the turkish cypriots .

on march 4 , 1964 , the united nations security council authorized the establishment of the united nations peacekeeping force in cyprus ( unficyp ) to control the violence and act as a buffer between the two communities .

unficyp became operational on march 27 , 1964 , and still carries out its mission today .

in 1974 , a military junta in power in athens supported a coup against president makarios , replacing him with a more hard - line supporter of enosis .

in july 1974 , turkey , citing the 1960 treaty of guarantee as a legal basis for its move to defend the turkish cypriots , deployed military forces to the island in two separate actions .

by august 25 , 1974 , turkey had taken control of more than one - third of the island .

this military intervention had many ramifications .

foremost was the physical separation of the island ; widespread dislocation of both the greek and the turkish cypriot populations and related governance , refugee , and property problems ; and what the greek cypriots refer to as the continued occupation of the island .

after the conflict subsided and a fragile peace took root , turkish cypriots pursued a solution to the conflict that would keep the two communities separate in two states under the government of either a confederation or a stronger central federal government .

in february 1975 , the turkish cypriots declared their government the turkish federated state of cyprus ( tfsc ) .

in 1983 , turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash declared the turkish republic of northern cyprus ( trnc ) â€” a move considered by some to be a unilateral declaration of independence .

at the time , denktash argued that creation of an independent state was a necessary precondition for a federation with the greek cypriots .

however , he ruled out a merger with turkey and pledged cooperation with u.n. - brokered settlement efforts .

thirty - five years later , only turkey has recognized the trnc .

between 1974 and 2002 , there were numerous , unsuccessful rounds of u.n. - sponsored direct and indirect negotiations to achieve a settlement .

negotiations focused on reconciling the two sides' interests and reestablishing a central government .

they foundered on definitions of goals and ways to implement a federal solution .

turkish cypriots emphasized bizonality and the political equality of the two communities , preferring two nearly autonomous societies with limited contact .

greek cypriots emphasized the freedoms of movement , property , and settlement throughout the island .

the two parties also differed on the means of achieving a federation: greek cypriots wanted their internationally recognized national government to devolve power to the turkish cypriots , who would then rejoin a cypriot republic .

for the turkish cypriots , two entities would join , for the first time , in a new federation .

these differences in views also affected the resolution of issues such as property claims , citizenship of mainland turks who had settled on the island , and other legal issues .

these differences in views continue to plague the negotiations today .

throughout much of the recent history of the cyprus negotiations , both sides have periodically reported that various levels of convergences had been reached , mostly on the issues of eu affairs , governance , economics , citizenship , and how to resolve and compensate for disputed property .

as intensely as the cyprus negotiations have been followed in the press and by outside observers , it has always been difficult to determine with any specificity exactly what either side means by the term convergences when referring to agreements on the issues under negotiation .

the negotiations are conducted under the principle that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" ; thus , the term convergences has been used to describe likely agreement without admitting that agreements have actually been reached until all issues have been resolved .

in his april 1 , 2010 , press conference , former turkish cypriot leader talat stated that 31 "joint documents" had been prepared addressing a range of issues .

it appeared that both sides agreed in principle that the new federal government would have powers over external relations , eu policies , citizenship , budget matters , and economic coordination .

within these , for instance , was apparently an understanding that one side would hold the portfolio of the foreign minister and the other side would hold the eu portfolio .

still another point had the equal constituent states covering most of the remainder of the governance issues .

these convergences seemed to have been written into the later 2014 joint statement between anastasiades and akinci .

it also appeared that the two sides had agreed on a senate , equally represented , and a house proportionally represented based on population .

there was also reportedly a convergence on a new judicial court that would have equal turkish and greek cypriot representation and an agreement that cyprus would be represented in the european parliament by four greek and two turkish cypriot members of parliament .

a federal supreme court also was identified in the joint statement .

apparently , on april 15 , 2018 , in an interview in the greek cypriot politis , greek cypriot negotiator mavroyiannis confirmed that many of these convergences had been reached .

when anastasiades and akinci began their negotiations , it was not clear specifically what the starting point of the negotiations had been beyond the joint statement issued in 2014 .

eroglu apparently drew some pretty strong red lines around some issues , and akinci initially had not appeared , at least publically , to have adopted or refuted any particular positions advocated by eroglu , although many expected that to happen on some issues .

although reports out of cyprus by the end of 2016 suggested that more than 90% of the governance , power sharing , economy , and european union issues had fallen under the term convergences , other reports indicated that many technical issues remained unresolved .

in his september 2017 report on his mission of good offices in cyprus , u.n. secretary - general guterres appeared to reaffirm that these convergences had been reached .

one issue both sides continued to differ over was how a new , united cyprus would be created .

the greek cypriots assumed that the new unified state would evolve from the existing republic of cyprus .

the turkish cypriots wanted the new state to be based on two equal "founding states. .

eroglu had reiterated that he was not prepared to give up the trnc .

the turkish cypriots also wanted the new entity referred to as something other than the "republic of cyprus. .

the joint statement agreed to by anastasiades and eroglu in 2014 simply referred to a "united" cyprus , not a united "republic of cyprus. .

the anastasiades / akinci talks initially seemed to suggest that the new entity could be referred to as something such as the "federal or united republic of cyprus," but it was unclear how the two sides would get there .

in mid - december 2015 , anastasiades stated that "no one was aiming to abolish the republic of cyprus," rather "what we are pursuing is the evolution of the republic of cyprus into a bizonal , bicommunal federation. .

in public statements , including in washington in summer 2016 , then - turkish cypriot "foreign minister" ertugruloglu and others suggested that no agreement could be signed between the leadership of a "republic of cyprus" and the leader of the turkish cypriot "community. .

for ertugruloglu , it appeared that sovereign equality was not the same as political equality , suggesting that the turkish cypriots could not accept an agreement unless it was signed by two equal sovereign leaders , implying that recognition of the turkish republic of northern cyprus was a requirement for a final agreement .

in response , then - greek cypriot government spokesman nicos christodoulides said under no circumstances can "the regime in the occupied areas be upgraded since it is the product of an illegal action. .

in late 2016 , as both sides talked about convening a five - party conference to settle the issue of security and to sign a new agreement , controversy erupted over whether the greek cypriots would be represented as the republic .

anastasiades stated that the republic of cyprus , as a signatory to the treaty of guarantee , had to be represented at the conference .

during the geneva talks in january 2017 , the term "united federal cyprus" appeared in numerous references to the federal entity that would be created by an agreement .

in addition , the turkish cypriots apparently also raised the idea that political equality had to include equality for turkish cypriots in the new federal entity and that they could not accept a "minority" status or representation in any new federal entity .

more recently , the turkish cypriots championed the concept of "effective participation," meaning that on any decision taken at the new federal level , there would have to be at least one positive turkish cypriot vote in favor of the decision for that decision to take effect .

anastasiades suggested this would effectively give the turkish cypriots a veto over every decision that its representatives did not agree with .

when the crans montana conference began , it appeared that anastasiades and akinci may have worked out an understanding on both the issues of political equality and effective participation , but such a convergence was not made public .

in april 2018 , anastasiades appeared to have suggested that codecision could not be accepted .

since then , akinci has continuously demanded agreement on political equality for the turkish cypriots , suggesting this issue remains unresolved .

one highly sensitive issue under the governance chapter involves that of a rotating president and vice president for an elected term .

the greek cypriots reportedly had proposed the direct election of a president and vice president on the same ticket with weighted cross - community voting for a six - year term .

the president would be a greek cypriot for four years , and the vice president would be a turkish cypriot ; they would then rotate offices , with the turkish cypriot becoming president for two years .

turkish cypriots initially proposed that the executive have two alternating presidents elected by the senate .

turkish cypriots were opposed to a single list of greek cypriot and turkish cypriot candidates to be elected by all of the people of cyprus principally because greek cypriots , by virtue of their majority , could in effect elect the turkish cypriot candidate of their preference .

at some point , former turkish cypriot leader talat seemed to have made a significant concession in agreeing to accept the greek position for the election of a president and vice president but only with a weighted cross - community system to address the turkish cypriot concerns over the power of the greek cypriot majority to elect the turkish cypriot candidate , even though he continued to have doubts about direct popular voting .

although the idea of a rotating presidency was not new , opposition to the proposal was , and continues to be , vocal on the greek cypriot side , as many greek cypriots apparently could not accept the idea of being governed by a representative what many believe is still the turkish cypriot minority .

it had been reported that in july 2014 , anastasiades retreated on the notion of a rotating presidency , proposing the old idea that future presidents be greek cypriots and future vice presidents be turkish cypriots elected directly by all voters .

the turkish cypriots rejected the proposal .

akinci , in early august 2016 and subsequently on numerous times , suggested that a rotating presidency elected with weighted voting was a must in order to have political equality .

although a rotating presidency would apply only to the federal entity and would have limited authority over the daily lives of most citizens in either community , several greek cypriot political parties continue to oppose the concept .

greek cypriot archbishop chrysostomos stated his opposition to a rotating presidency , saying that no population of only 18% should be permitted to elect the president .

during the geneva conference , it was reported that a five - year rotating presidency would be created with the greek cypriots holding the office for approximately a little over three years and a turkish cypriot for just under two years .

however , other iterations of the convergence also had arisen .

it was reported that at crans montana , anastasiades had held out a concession on the rotating president in return for a turkish concession on security guarantees .

in april 2018 , akinci reiterated that the issue of a rotating presidency had not been resolved and was an absolute requirement on a 2:1 basis .

akinci stated that anastasiades had not reconciled this matter with the greek cypriots .

the presidency , however , was only one of several sticking points .

for instance , the question of which community would hold the portfolio of foreign minister and how external policy would be made also was controversial , as both sides hold different views on , for instance , turkey .

it also was unclear how a new turkish cypriot state could maintain traditional ties to ankara or the greek cypriot state could maintain ties to athens in light of long - held hostility toward both greece and turkey .

the thorny and emotional issue of property had been the focus of a significant debate between by anastasiades and akinci .

as a result of the ethnic strife of the 1960s and the deployment of turkish military forces on the island in 1974 , it was estimated that over 150,000 greek cypriots living in the north were forced south and close to 50,000 turkish cypriots living in the south fled to the north , with both communities leaving behind large amounts of vacated property , especially in the north .

greek cypriots had long insisted that the original and legal owners who lost properties in the north must have the right to decide how to deal with their property , whether through recovery , exchange , or compensation .

turkish cypriots believe that the current inhabitant of a property must have priority and that the issue should be resolved through compensation , exchange of alternate property , or restitution .

to try to help resolve some of the property issues , the turkish cypriots established the immovable property commission ( ipc ) to hear cases related to greek cypriot property claims in the north .

the greek cypriots initially rejected the ipc .

only a few private greek property owners have filed claims for compensation with the ipc , and funding for the ipc has become controversial in the north .

although the gap in the respective cypriot positions on property had been wide , it appeared that positive movement had been achieved by 2017 .

in july 2015 , anastasiades and akinci seemed to agree that former property owners would be offered various choices regarding their claims that would allow all involved to be fairly compensated .

for the turkish cypriots , however , only a limited number of greek cypriots would be permitted to return to or take actual ownership of their properties .

however , it appeared that any settlement might involve between â‚¬25 billion and â‚¬30 billion , a price tag the new "federal" entity might not be able to afford .

at crans montana , u.n. secretary - general guterres's six - point framework proposed that in areas that would be returned to greek cypriot administration , the rightful owner would have preferential treatment .

in areas that would remain under turkish cypriot administration , current users would have preferential treatment .

the question of overall territory that would come under the jurisdiction of the two equal states remains in dispute .

the turkish cypriot side of the "green line" currently includes approximately 37% of the island and includes several areas that had been inhabited almost entirely by greek cypriots before the 1974 division , such as varosha , morphou , and karpas .

greek cypriots have long wanted all of that territory returned , which would leave the turkish cypriot side controlling about 28% of the territory .

at the time , christofias resurrected an older proposal that would have the turkish side return the uninhabited city of varosha to greek cyprus in exchange for opening the seaport of famagusta for use by the turkish cypriots to conduct international trade .

the port would be operated by the eu and a joint greek / turkish cypriot administration , thus allowing direct trade between northern cyprus and the eu .

the european parliament declined to consider an eu commission initiative to permit direct trade on technical grounds , but its 2011 report on turkey's eu accession progress ( introduced in parliament in 2012 ) called for that very trade - off offered by christofias .

after the 2013 greek cypriot elections , president anastasiades resurrected the proposal in the form of a "confidence - building" measure to test the sincerity of the turkish cypriots and turkey to move forward in the negotiations .

in early august 2014 , it was reported that anastasiades had upped the ante by suggesting that no agreement could be reached unless the town of morphou was also returned to the republic .

the turkish cypriots quickly rejected the idea , saying the town would not be returned .

after turkish cypriot leader akinci took office , anastasiades again included the varosha / famagusta option as a confidence - building measure .

as in the past , akinci rejected the return of morphou as part of a final settlement .

understanding the sensitivity of this issue for both leaders , akinci had suggested that the discussions of territorial adjustments be held off the island and away from potential leaks that could set off a firestorm of protests from either side .

at the november 2016 meetings at mont pelerin , switzerland , the two sides agreed to discuss three issues regarding territory: percentage of land to be administered by each constituent state , the number of greek cypriots who would be allowed to return to the new territories given back to the greek cypriots , and the shoreline .

following mont pelerin , both sides , in agreeing to meet in geneva in january 2017 , agreed to present maps indicating their proposals for a territorial adjustment .

as noted , the turkish cypriots administer approximately 37% of the island .

at geneva , the greek cypriots proposed long - standing views that the boundaries be redrawn such that the turkish cypriots would control approximately 28.2% of the island and that some 90,000 displaced greek cypriots could return to those areas gained back by the greek cypriots .

some of the territory â€” such as the cities of verosha , parts of famagusta , and morphou â€” would come under direct control of the greek cypriots whereas other areas that once had large greek cypriot populations would either come under control of the greek cypriots or become "enclaves" under the administration of the new federal government .

the greek cypriots also wanted additional shoreline along the east coast of the island , including part of karpas .

the turkish cypriots insisted on controlling at least 29.2% of the island , with as straight of a border between the two constituent states as possible ; no enclaves ; and only 65,000-72,000 returning greek cypriots .

the turkish cypriots also expressed a willingness to meet the greek cypriot demand for more shoreline , but only if the new shoreline territory was made into state parks so that no new greek cypriot communities could settle in those areas .

on all three points , the leaders failed to reach an agreement at mont pelerin and again in geneva in january 2017 .

for the first time at geneva , both sides had presented maps outlining the territorial concessions they were prepared to make .

however , when the turkish cypriot representatives rejected the return of morphou , which was included in the greek cypriot map , and insisted that additional territory , including the area of kokkina , be added to morphou and remain under turkish cypriot jurisdiction in exchange for verosha and parts of famagusta , the discussions broke down .

both sides apparently withdrew their maps .

at crans montana , it was reported that akinci appeared willing to return part but not all of the town of morphu to the greek cypriots but that akinci wanted to retain additional territory that the greek cypriots had requested be returned .

in july 2010 , president christofias , seeking to unlock the stalemate on territory , tabled a citizenship proposal that would have linked property , territory , and the number of citizens permitted to reside in the north into one agreement .

the offer included an agreement to allow 50,000 mainland turks who had settled in the north to remain in the north .

eroglu had indicated that any final solution could not result in significant social upheaval in north cyprus , meaning that significant numbers of citizens of the north , whether from the mainland or not , could not be forced to leave , and only a small number of greek cypriots would be permitted to return to property in the north .

eroglu rejected the offer from christofias , stating that "no one on cyprus is any longer a refugee" and that sending mainland turkish settlers back to turkey was not something he could agree to .

eroglu had also reiterated in his talks with anastasiades that the number of mainland turks who had settled in the north and who would be allowed to remain on the island would have to be higher than previously discussed .

after the joint statement was agreed to in february 2014 , turkish cypriot representatives were reported to have stated that no citizens of the north would be required to leave the country .

in a talk given at the woodrow wilson center in washington , dc , on february 28 , 2014 , the then - cyprus ambassador to the united states speculated that a resolution of the cyprus problem could conceivably allow for mainland turks , who came to the island as long ago as 40 years and had established clear roots in the north , to remain on the island .

akinci , perhaps not wishing to antagonize what had become a majority of the population in the north , initially stayed away from this issue .

however , apparently through the negotiations he and anastasiades may have agreed to at least set population sizes in both of the "constituent" states that would emerge as part of an agreement .

the population for the turkish cypriots was apparently set at 220,000 , although akinci seemed to want another 50,000 , while the greek cypriot population would be approximately 802,000 .

this ratio , while including a sizable number of mainland turks who have since become citizens in the north , would be close to the ratio of the island's population in 1960 .

nevertheless , several of the greek cypriot political parties appear to remain opposed to any agreement that would allow a large number of "settlers" to remain on the island .

in the summer of 2016 , there were reports that ankara had wanted the turkish cypriot government to speed up the process of "citizenship" for more of the mainland turks living in the north .

in august , some news accounts in the media claimed that the ozgurgun government was trying to rush citizenship for around 26,000 additional mainland turks before a final agreement was reached .

greek cypriot political parties jumped on the news and claimed ozgurgun was trying to sabotage the negotiations .

in january 2017 , it was reported that turkish deputy prime minister turkes stated that there were some 300,000 turkish cypriots in the north so the population sizes of the two constituent states would have to be adjusted .

in may 2017 , anastasiades reportedly told a meeting of the greek cypriot national council that akinci had retreated from previous convergences , including accepting a 4:1 ratio of populations .

in his september 2017 report to the security council , secretary - general guterres stated that the "sensitive issue of citizenship , with its links to other key aspects , including the exercise of civil and political rights in the future united cyprus , was almost completely concluded , with only certain details left to be agreed. .

next to the property and territory issues , the issues of security guarantees and turkish troop deployments continue to be the most difficult bridges to cross .

these issues became real stumbling blocks as the two sides met in geneva in january 2017 and at crans montana in july 2017 , and they resulted in the collapse of both meetings .

the greek cypriots long have argued that all turkish military forces would have to leave the island , beginning immediately after an agreement was adopted .

they argue that the u.n. or the eu can offer security guarantees to all citizens in the two member states .

therefore , once the entire island became part of the eu , the greek cypriots see no reason for guarantees from third countries , such as turkey , greece , or the united kingdom .

by contrast , turkish cypriots and turkey long had maintained that the 1960 treaties of guarantee and alliance must be retained in some form in any settlement , because , without guarantees , the turkish cypriots would feel insecure based on their history with ethnic violence on the island in the 1960s .

they continuously point out that the u.n. had forces on the island even before the 1974 violence that were unable to prevent the military coup against the makarios government or to protect the turkish cypriot population .

they argue that the greek cypriots maintain a 12,000-man , fully armed national guard , while the turkish cypriot security forces are smaller and less well equipped and have to rely on the presence of the turkish military for security .

eroglu had stated on several past occasions that "the security guarantees with motherland turkey could not be changed. .

after the february 2014 joint statement was agreed to , it was reported that eroglu had again stated that turkish troops would not leave the island .

it remained unclear for a while whether akinci held the traditional turkish hard line .

he clearly did not want to antagonize ankara over this issue by going too far into the negotiating process without including turkey , but he also appeared to have not gone out of his way to focus on the issue .

some suggested that akinci , while not wanting to abandon the treaty of guarantee altogether , may have been willing to adjust the provisions regarding when or under what pretext turkey could intervene in northern cyprus in the future and to include the gradual withdrawal of most turkish military forces , leaving only a small garrison on the island .

in one august 2016 news article , it was suggested that anastasiades had put forward the option that a multinational police force , made up of u.n. or eu personnel with some turkish police , could be created to support the new federal entity .

the turkish cypriots and turkey rejected the idea .

in the lead - up to the mont pelerin and geneva conferences , most of the public demands for continued turkish security guarantees and military presence in the north came from former "foreign minister" ozgurgun and others in the turkish cypriot government who had stated that no agreement could be accepted without the guarantees .

ozgurgun reportedly stated that in conversations with akinci , he was assured that turkey must continue to play a role in the security of the north .

nevertheless , as the negotiators at geneva opened the security guarantees "chapter," the rhetoric increased .

greek cypriots , and greece , continued to insist that no guarantees were necessary and , on their part , no agreement could be accepted that would allow turkey to intervene on the island or to retain a military presence there .

in april 2016 , the greek foreign minister reportedly suggested that no final agreement on cyprus could be achieved until all turkish military forces agreed to leave the island .

with the two sides dug in , compromise seemed unrealistic .

once formal talks on security were begun in late fall 2016 , both cypriot sides appeared to soften their positions .

in november 2016 , athens and ankara agreed to begin bilateral discussions over the future of the guarantees in advance of a meeting between the respective prime ministers and any five - party conference on the issue .

according to some sources , although turkey appeared willing to discuss a revised agreement on security , ankara initially did not want to discuss the abolition of the guarantees or the complete withdrawal of the turkish troops from cyprus .

ankara apparently raised the idea of the establishment of a military base in the north and suggested that the timetable for the reduction of the turkish military on the island could be 10-15 years .

the greek cypriots would not accept such provisions but reportedly may have proposed that a small contingent of turkish troops could remain , but only for a short period of time .

at geneva , turkey , clearly keeping in mind the fate of its own constitutional reform referendum in april , took a hard line on the issues of continued turkish security guarantees and troops on the island .

the greek cypriots and greece took a similar hard line in opposition to turkey's continued presence .

apparently , at geneva , anastasiades reoffered his proposal for an international police force , this time , however , noting that greek , turkish , or uk forces would not be part of that multinational force .

turkey and the turkish cypriots rejected the idea again .

russia and others also suggested that the u.n. security council could serve as the initial guarantors of security , but that too was brushed aside .

at geneva , the eu was fully represented by the commission president and the high representative for foreign and security policy , with each offering assurances that any solution could be adequately implemented and enforced by the eu .

nevertheless , the eu was not able to convince either ankara or the turkish cypriots that it could guarantee the security and fair treatment of the turkish cypriot community , even though the north would become fully integrated into the united cyprus under eu law .

the lack of any appreciable progress on the security issue , in part , resulted in the january 12 , 2017 , session in geneva being cut short without a resolution .

the february 2017 dispute over the introduction of the enosis legislation in the greek cypriot assembly ( see above ) led akinci to complain that the enosis issue underscored turkish cypriot concerns for their safety and security after a settlement and reinforced the argument for why some level of turkish troops should remain in the north as well as the need for some type of guarantees for turkey to assist the turkish cypriots , if conditions changed on the island .

during the suspension of the talks between february and april 2017 , u.n. special adviser eide was reported to have been working out the details of some kind of bridging compromise between the two positions on security as a way to move the talks forward until after a solution was agreed and implementation begun .

when the two sides announced that a new conference would be held in late june 2017 at crans montana , it was also revealed that eide would prepare a security "roadmap" from which all five parties could negotiate .

the eide proposal would not be issued as a formal u.n. proposal but as a working paper that would outline the various positions each side had taken on the issue of security guarantees and the possible compromises that could be accepted .

although eide consulted with the guarantor parties and the two cypriot leaders , anastasiades apparently objected to parts of the eide document and the paper was not presented .

at crans montana , the same security issues quickly forced the negotiations into deadlock .

although turkey appeared ready to discuss the removal of most of its troops after an agreement was reached , ankara rejected any "zero troops , zero guarantees" option and insisted on maintaining a small contingent of forces on the island for at least 15 years , when the issue would be revisited .

turkey refused to agree to any changes to its right to intervene in the north , although the turkish cypriots appeared to indicate some flexibility by ankara on this as the presence of a contingent of turkish military forces on the island could be used to respond to any problems incurred by the turkish cypriots during the implementation of an agreement .

the greek cypriots and greece held to their positions that the treaty of guarantee be abolished , although greece suggested a new "treaty of friendship" between greece , turkey , and cyprus , which apparently would allow for consultations on complaints that implementation of the agreement was not being fulfilled from either cypriot side .

greece and the greek cypriots again insisted that all turkish troops be withdrawn from the island , although anastasiades may have appeared ready to accept a small contingent of turkish troops to remain on the island but only if that provision included a date for the final withdrawal of the remaining turkish troops .

the crans montana talks clearly proved that the differences between the two sides on these two security issues had become too high a barrier to be the starting point , or focus , for any new round of negotiations .

for many , these issues should be reserved until all the outstanding governance issues have been resolved and an international conference on security can be established again .

by july 2018 , it appeared that both sides had set the need for concessions regarding the security - related issues as a precondition for resuming the talks .

the greek cypriots once again insisted that turkey change its position on retaining troops and security guarantees , and the turkish cypriots and ankara have argued that anastasiades drop his "zero troops , zero guarantees" position .

in mid - december 2018 , when u.n. special adviser jane holl lute met with turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu , he reportedly said that those who dream of zero guarantees and zero troops should let it go , as such a thing will never happen .

when mustafa akinci was elected as leader of the turkish cypriots in 2015 , many believed the window of opportunity for a permanent settlement of the cyprus problem , for all intents closed by ergolu , had been reopened .

as "mayor" of the turkish cypriot portion of nicosia , akinci had been praised for working cooperatively with his greek cypriot counterparts on a number of infrastructure projects , leading some to take a positive view of the possibilities of a settlement between anastasiades and akinci .

while the political environment on both sides of the island immediately after the election of akinci had taken on a positive air , with predictions that the negotiations could conclude quickly , the scene reminded cyprus observers of the 2008 election of christofias and the almost giddy atmosphere that arose over a possible quick solution to the division of the island with turkish cypriot leader talat .

akinci , much as talat had with christofias , declared that he and anastasiades were of the same generation and could relate more easily to each other and better understand the measures that both sides would have to take to achieve a solution .

negotiations between anastasiades and akinci , once begun , got off to a fast start .

for many , the first 20 months of the anastasiades / akinci era went well .

both leaders seemed to enjoy meeting with each other and doing public events together in a show of solidarity .

the positive atmosphere of the negotiations raised hope among some that these two leaders might just reach a settlement .

and , although the issues that have separated the two communities and prevented a solution for more than 44 years have long been clearly defined and repeatedly presented and debated by both sides , the chemistry between anastasiades and akinci , seen by many as an improvement over the anastasiades / eroglu relationship , seemed to allow the leaders to overcome some of the traditional barriers to a settlement more effectively than previous attempts by cypriot leaders .

however , as the talks progressed , with more references to agreed convergences , both anastasiades and akinci , as those before them had experienced , began to hear public controversy and criticism of the negotiations emerge from the skeptics and opponents of an agreement .

despite the inevitable level of domestic opposition in both communities and the inability to reach concrete agreements on several governance issues , as well as the security and guarantees issues , anastasiades and akinci , at least publicly , seemed determined to continue to seek a solution .

the intensity of the negotiations beginning in fall 2016 and continuing through mont pelerin and geneva in 2017 earned both leaders international praise for their commitment and persistence .

to most observers , the fact that anastasiades and akinci appeared to have come closer to reaching a settlement by early 2017 than at any time since 2004 , and that both sides , plus greece and turkey , were willing , after the failure at geneva , to come together again at crans montana for another attempt to resolve their differences , seemed to support the growing optimism .

indeed , although a solution for that final settlement remained elusive , the negotiators maintained a level of optimism that a breakthrough was possible .

the failure of the crans montana conference , despite the framework presented by u.n. secretary - general guterres , appeared to be directly related to the disagreement over security issues .

ankara appeared unwilling to accept the replacement of turkish security guarantees with guarantees from the eu or an interim international security force , despite the fact that some turkish troops that might have remained under a compromise could have provided security to the turkish cypriots during the time the agreement was being implemented .

it also appeared ankara was not willing to forego its geostrategic interests and influence over the island by accepting a longer - term "zero guarantees , zero troops" option .

ankara insisted that some level of troops would remain on the island either permanently or at least for several years , a condition that they knew anastasiades would continue to reject .

ankara's determination to build a permanent naval base in north cyprus , raised again in december 2018 , seemed to affirm this view .

by summer 2018 , however , akinci indicated that he and anastasiades no longer shared the same vision of what constituted a bizonal , bicommunal federation or whether such a form of government was even desirable at this point .

reports suggested that several governance issues long thought to have been part of the oft referred convergences , such as the rotating presidency , turkish cypriot codecision power , political equality , and the population mix in the north , not only appeared to remain unresolved but also may have been pulled back from the status of convergences .

some observers believed that if the two sides could not find common agreement on the governance issues , then arguing over troops and security , as seen at geneva and crans montana , was a futile exercise .

in appointing jane holl lute as his new adviser in july 2018 , it appeared that secretary - general guterres specifically intended to challenge the sincerity of both sides to return to the negotiations .

guterres also appeared to have adopted akinci's demand for a results - oriented negotiation , first by making it clear that both sides would have to agree to a "terms of reference" document that lute would draft and then by not letting the talks become open - ended by allowing the terms of reference document , once presented , to be renegotiated .

the approach initially seemed to work: anastasiades reportedly believed the terms of reference could reinforce his position that turkish military forces would have to withdraw from the island and future security guarantees for the island would have to take another form .

akinci apparently saw some support for his demand for political equality for turkish cypriots .

nevertheless , acceptance of the terms of reference would require the restoration of trust between the two leaders , between the greek cypriots and ankara , and perhaps between ankara and akinci .

as lute started on her mission , it was unclear whether such trust could be restored .

akinci indicated he was no longer sure what type of solution anastasiades was looking for and made it clear again that he could not accept changes to the security issues .

anastasiades apparently could not agree to how the turkish cypriots defined political equality .

further complicating lute's task was the fact that the political mindset surrounding the talks began to change , actually pointing both sides in opposite directions .

in mid - fall 2018 , anastasiades surprised many by suggesting that both sides might consider some form of a "decentralized" federation .

his proposal seemed to suggest that the two constituent states that would emerge under such a working agreement would have more powers than what had been discussed previously , even though he was slow in defining what those additional powers might be .

it also was reported that anastasiades suggested holding a conference in cyprus to discuss the various parameters of either a decentralized federation or perhaps even a confederation .

this proposal resulted in the atmosphere becoming muddled .

some thought that after meeting with turkish foreign minister cavusoglu at the u.n. in new york , anastasiades may have become convinced that ankara would no longer accept a federal solution and that anastasiades was looking for an acceptable middle ground .

some others assumed that anastasiades was trying to buy time in the hope that the gas exploration being conducted by exxon - mobile and others would produce positive results , thus putting more pressure on the turkish cypriots to cut a deal in time to guarantee they would share in the potential revenues generated by the additional gas finds .

akinci expressed skepticism of anastasiades's proposal , seeing it as undermining his support for a federal solution and a way to try to reach a settlement without giving the turkish cypriots the political equality they sought at any federal level .

anastasiades also came under heavy criticism from his political opponents , particularly the leadership of the akel party , for what they claimed was an abandonment of the goal of a federal solution .

more importantly , when some turkish and turkish cypriot government officials who had begun to sour on a federal solution , particularly foreign minister ozersay , insisted the government should have a say in the negotiations , akinci saw a growing challenge to his position .

ersin tatar , the newly elected head of the opposition national unity party ( ubp ) , indicated his party would not support a federal solution and would not be bound by akinci's decisions .

tatar apparently threw his support behind a "two - state" solution .

some also pointed out that the decision by several of the original pro - federal solution political parties not to publicly defend akinci had left him isolated .

some suggested that akinci and ankara were no longer on the same page .

by contrast , observers who saw ankara attempting to sideline akinci and move beyond a federal solution saw the infighting as a ploy to buy more time for turkey to get through local elections in march and perhaps even the may european parliament elections .

in this strategy , the resumption of negotiations would not even be considered until at least june 2019 .

when the apparent rift between akinci , ozersay , and others became increasingly public , threatening turkish cypriot unity , turkish foreign minister cavasoglu traveled to cyprus in late january 2019 , apparently to bring all sides together and to try to end the public squabbling .

cavasoglu reiterated that ankara wanted a permanent solution , no matter what it was , but that the greek cypriots had to determine what outcome they were willing to negotiate to achieve .

at the same time , some observers questioned whether special adviser lute's mission could actually succeed , as it appeared that disagreement on several issues would not likely help achieve agreement on her eventual terms of reference document .

for instance , anastasiades did not accept a definition of political equality for the turkish cypriots favored by akinci .

nor would he reverse his long - held position and accept a target deadline to conclude the talks .

cavasoglu's december 2018 comment that those who dream of an option with zero guarantees and zero troops should let it go , as such a thing will never happen , suggested that the guterres framework , in which turkish troops would begin to leave the island after an agreement is reached , could jeopardize the entire terms of reference from the start .

these questions resulted lute's inability to craft a terms of reference document by the end of 2018 , and she stated she would have to return to the island for another round of consultations in early 2019 .

when she returned in early 2019 , the rift between anastasiades and akinci centered on the issue of turkish cypriot political equality .

akinci demanded his proposal be accepted as a condition for resuming the negotiations .

the idea was again rejected by anastasiades .

subsequently , lute found little basis for continuing her consultations and decided to meet with the guarantor powers .

although the greek and turkish foreign ministers agreed to hold their own consultations on security , lute saw no likely breakthrough between anastasiades and akinci .

nevertheless , lute agreed to return to the island on april 7 for yet another round of consultations with the two leaders .

when lute returned , she apparently found both sides seemingly farther apart .

aside from the long - standing disagreements between the two cypriot sides , particularly on security and troops , a big sticking point was akinci's insistence that the turkish cypriots have political equality in the new federal government rather than holding a minority status .

akinci repeated his demand that if a solution would result in two equal constituent states , under a federal structure , then the turkish cypriots should hold equal power on issues taken up at the federal level that would involve both constituent states .

he proposed that on all issues there must be a positive turkish cypriot vote .

anastasiades again rejected that approach , claiming it would give the turkish cypriots an absolute veto over all policy issues and would subject cyprus to the demands of ankara , potentially resulting in gridlock .

anastasiades , however , apparently did express a willingness to discuss akinci's proposal , but only for some issues .

at the same time , anastasiades resurrected an old proposal that the new government be a cross between a presidential system , in which the president would be a greek cypriot , and a parliamentary system in which a prime minister would rotate between the two communities .

akinci rejected this proposal , arguing that it reinforced his view that the greek cypriots will always see the turkish cypriots as a minority and not a coequal partner .

other turkish cypriot officials claimed this was an attempt by anastasiades to establish a greek cypriot state on the island .

lute's fourth return to cyprus again failed to achieve an agreement between the two cypriot leaders on a "terms of reference" document that would become the basis for restarting the negotiations and suggested that negotiations were unlikely to resume anytime soon .

secretary - general guterres will now have to decide how to proceed .

continuing with the lute mission without a chance of being successful may seem fruitless .

even if anastasiades and akinci could compromise on some form of an agreement on the definition of political equality for the turkish cypriots , questions still remain on what type of final governmental structure would be addressed , specifically , is the long - sought bizonal , bicommunal , federal solution for the island still attainable ? .

the guterres framework suggests that a new security framework was needed , particularly one that does not envision turkey's automatic right to unilaterally intervene on the island .

would ankara eventually accept that concept ? .

could akinci argue successfully to his citizens that the new federal structure , loose or otherwise , with some version of political equality for the turkish cypriotst , the guarantees of eu law , and a more robust u.n. peacekeeping force in place , might be enough to argue for a new security arrangement regarding turkish troops or turkish security guarantees ? .

could either side accept a future nato - led peacekeeping force , in which turkish and greek troops could participate as a reassurance to both sides ? .

history might indicate a continued "no" to these questions .

at the same time , relations between turkey and the greek cypriots have become so tense over the energy exploration issue that neither side appears capable of backing down from its security demands , leaving little room for optimism that any kind of a solution can be achieved .

many also wonder whether either leader could sell any agreement to his community at this point .

some longtime observers of the negotiations in the international community expressed deep concern for the direction the dispute has taken since crans montana .

for instance , in late 2017 , the business monitor internatio nal , part of the fitch group , downgraded its assessment of a new unification deal from slim to extremely remote .

its 2018 forecast likely will not have changed .

former british foreign secretary jack straw in 2017 restated a previous assessment that "from the greek cypriot point of view , conceding political equality with the turkish cypriots means giving power away .

but absent a real incentive for both sides" to actually reach an agreement , "the reality isÂ that no greek cypriot leader will ever be able to get their electorate behind a deal .

the status quo for the south is simply too comfortable. .

at this point , and despite the effort being put forward by u.n. secretary - general guterres to restart the negotiations , a final settlement for cyprus remains elusive .
